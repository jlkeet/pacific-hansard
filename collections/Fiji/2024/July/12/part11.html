PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Friday, 28th June, 2024, I move that the following Consequential Bills be debated, voted upon and be passed: (1) Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 8 of 2024); (2) Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 9 of 2024); (3) Value Add Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 10 of 2024); (4) Customs (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 11 of 2024); (5) Customs Tarriff (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 12 of 2024); (6) Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 13 of 2024); (7) Airport Departure Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No.14 of 2024); (8) Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No.15 of 2024); (9) Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 16 of 2024).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Before we proceed with the motion, I remind honourable Members that pursuant to the resolution of Parliament, the time for debate will be limited, to ensure that the nine Consequential Bills are debated and voted upon today. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, Sir, the nine Consequential Bills give legal effect to the policies announced in the 2024-2025 Budget. Before I go into brief detail of each of the Bills, I just wanted to make some quick general remarks. In terms of taxation, Sir, and customs related Bills, we have broadly kept the tax regime stable with minimal policy changes, apart from departure taxes. However, there are a number of administrative changes to strengthen tax compliance, bring clarity to the law and streamline tax administration processes. As I have highlighted, with tax reforms in the last Budget and the growth in the economy, we are on track to collect around $3 billion in tax revenue this year. This is an indication and demonstration that our tough and decisive actions in the last Budget have worked well and yielded intended results in terms of the revenue. On the same note, we recognise that we must not overtax the economy and we want to have a tax system that is simple, efficient and fair. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me highlight some of the major changes being brought into effect through these Consequential Bills relating to taxation and customs. In the last Budget, Sir, we introduced a 3 percent import duty on raw materials. Following our discussions with manufacturers and exporters, we are removing that 3 percent duty. With the tourism industry back to normal and more than normal in terms of the record visitor arrivals and as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation very well highlighted in his speech with respect to the volume of receipts and the injection from the tourism industry into the economy, the departure tax will increase from $140 to $170 effective from 1st August, 2024, and will return to the pre-pandemic rate of $200 from 1st August, 2025. In addition, effective from 1st August, 2024, the transit hours for departure tax exemption will reduce from 96 hours to 48 hours - equivalent to two days. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the construction industry has noted a shift from conventional building methods towards more modern building techniques and the use of prefabricated buildings to assist in the construction sector, in light of the high building and material costs. The fiscal duty on</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1328</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 prefabricated buildings consisting of prefabricated buildings of wood, modular building, units of steels and other prefabricated buildings will be reduced from 32 percent to 5 percent, while fiscal duty on steel structures or articles of iron will be maintained at 5 percent. We are increasing the excise duty on alcohol and tobacco product by 5 percent, while duty on carbonated or sugar sweetened beverages will be maintained at 40 cents per litre per kilogramme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to June 2020, the threshold for personal imports under Code 212 was $400, so as a COVID measure, the threshold was increased to $2,000, to encourage imports of personal use and assistance from families overseas. The threshold for personal imports under Code 212 will be reduced to $1,000 and 15 percent VAT will be applied. We are closing this loophole, as some businesses had started abusing this and in a big way as well. For our hotel incentives, we are extending the Short Life Investment Package (SLIP) tax holiday to investors who acquire existing hotels and undertake renovations and refurbishments for more than $50 million. This will support major investments like Crown Plaza, Wananavu Resort, and in addition, the standard allowance for renovation and extension of hotels will be reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent, similar to COVID levels. A 200 percent deduction will be allowable for donations over $10,000 towards the 2030 Pacific Games. Similar to the tax incentive provided to Fijian Drua 13-year tax holiday, tax duty concessions on imported sports equipment and 200 percent tax deduction will be extended to the National Rugby League. The tax free zone incentive will be amended to allow existing iTaukei companies to qualify for the Tax Free Region (TFR) incentive in the tax free regions for new investment above $250,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also making changes to the Fiji National Provident Fund Act 2011 to bring about the following changes: (1) We are restoring the tripartite spirit in the Board composition of the Fiji National Provident</p><h4>Fund (FNPF) to include a worker representative and an employer representative.</h4><p>(2) We are making legal provisions to cater for minors to become FNPF members, which means, there would be no age limit for children to become members of the FNPF. (3) To strengthen compliance, the penalty for non-payment of contributions by an employer will be changed from $100 per employee per month to 10 percent of the balance of unpaid contributions for an employee each month. The Bill also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, accommodates FNPF member reaching entitlement age to be able to transfer sum of all the amounts withdrawn to an existing FNPF member. At the moment, it is either you opt for pensions or withdrawal. This provision allows members to give their FNPF balance to their loved ones. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Budget (Amendment) Bill 2024 mandates tertiary education institutions to inform Tertiary Education and Loans Service (TSLS) of at-risk students who are not meeting expected academic requirements. This will ensure that we are able to have an early detection and thus, an early intervention to improve completion rates. With the write-off of the Tertiary Education Loans Schene (TELS) debt and conversion to bond, TSLS will now be responsible for the management of these student bonds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me quickly go through also some of the Clauses in each of the Bills. I am sure that honourable Members have already gone through it, but I just wanted to, for the record, go through that as well very quickly.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1329 On the Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, the Bill seeks to improve tax administration processes aimed at improving compliance with tax rules and regulations, as well as the efficiency with the day-to-day services of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS). Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title, as you can see. Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 30 of the Act to increase the period of seizure and detainment of non-perishable goods from 10 to 30 consecutive days, to assist with the handling of non-perishable goods in detainment. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will significantly assist FRCS in the processes involved for handling detailed goods and provides the owner of the goods more opportunity to collect the good before the disposal process commence. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 33 of the Act, to allow any forfeited refund to be used to offset a taxpayer’s debt and penalty. Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting section 36A which empowers the CEO to collect bulk information for the purposes of the Act, in accordance with procedures prescribed under regulations. Clause 5 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting section 46C, which imposes a penalty equal to 200 percent of the deficient tax. On the Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 1 of the Bill, as usual, provides for the short title. Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 25 of the Act by setting the rate of export income deduction for tax year 2025. This is a continued rate of export income deduction, which is the current rate for the tax year 2024 - 90 percent for agriculture, fisheries and forestry industry; and 60 percent for other industries. Clause 3 of the Bill amends the Act by deleting section 28A in relation to the deduction for a pandemic reserve. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 78 of the Act to revise valuation amounts to Fringe Benefit Tax on motor vehicles. This Clause also includes valuation amounts based on the cost of an electric vehicle. Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 110 of the Act to revert the rules for the payment of advance taxes that existed prior to COVID-19 pandemic measures that we have put in place, especially at that time. The advance tax will be paid in three instalments. So, we are getting rid of some of the COVID-19 measures and putting things back to what it was before COVID-19. Clause 6 of the Bill amends the Act by deleting section 125A in relation to deduction for business losses of up to $20,000. This maintains withholding tax as final tax. On Value Added Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 14 of the Act which governs the application of Value Added Tax (VAT) on imports. Currently, certain items are exempt from VAT under section 14(4A)(a). Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 14(4A)(a) of the Act by including Concession Code 201C (a Member of Parliament) as imported items exempt from VAT. Deleting Concession Code 212 (a private individual), which currently allows for VAT exemption on personal imports. The proposed</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1330</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 amendment requires individuals to pay VAT on personal imports, aligning with the standard VAT regime. This amendment seeks to create a fair market environment, as all commodities, whether domestically purchased or imported, will be subject to the same VAT rate. This also ensures that tax revenues are not lost due to imports. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 32 of the Act, which sets out the taxable period application under the Act. This Clause amends section 32 of the Act by deleting references to Categories C and D, which currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provide for taxable periods of 12 months. Instead, taxable period will align with those in Category A - one month, or Category B - three months. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the transitional provisions to facilitate the transition of new taxable periods. This Clause allows registered persons who are previously in Category C or Category D to file their tax returns by 31st January, 2025, for the taxable period 2024. Clause 4 of the Bill also seeks to allow registered persons previously in Category C or Category D to be re-assigned to either Category A which is 1 month, or category B which is three months. Overall, the Bill seeks to streamline and simplify the application of VAT on imports and taxable periods, while also ensuring a smooth transition for persons registered under the Act. On the Customs (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, section 2(1) of the Act is amended to redefine definitions - there was a lot of confusion with respect to “produce”, “producer” and “manufacturer”, to allow local producers to receive the same concessionary benefits as others, creating fairness and levelling the playing field for the local producers, and providing them with the same opportunities and advantages as others, fostering a more equitable economic environment. Section 2 of the Act is also amended to insert new definitions of “mixing” and “blending”, and “sign” or “signatures” for clarity. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 32 of the Act by deleting subsection 2 to remove the time to pay arrangement for the payment of duty on yacht imports of up to $2 million, to ensure uniformity and prompt revenue collection upon importation. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 66(2) of the Act is amended to increase the penalty for the owner of goods who fails to comply with an undertaking of furnishing the necessary entry within five consecutive days of the departure of goods to the Comptroller. Section 92(9A) of the Act is amended to allow the Comptroller to impose a 5 percent penalty for approved petroleum companies that fail to pay import duty before the due date to deter non- payment from the approved petroleum companies. Section 173A(8) of the Act is amended to align the objection period in the Act to the Tax Administration Act 2009 in relation to a decision made by the Comptroller. Customs Tariff (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024: Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is amended as follows. As I have said earlier, to: (1) (2) (3) remove the 3 percent export duty on sugar. This was never applied. It was always on the books. increase the excise duty on alcohol and tobacco by 5 percent. increase the import fiscal duty on ships, boats and floating structures from free to 5 percent.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1331 (4) reduce the import fiscal duty on prefabricated building from 32 percent to 5 percent. Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Act is amended to exempt hospital beds from fiscal duty and VAT. The wider public can acquire beds at a lower cost and patients receiving care at home will benefit. Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Act is amended to provide the following: (1) A new concession code to exempt duty and VAT on importation of one motor vehicle for a Member of Parliament within their term of Parliament. (2) A new concession code for the manufacturers and producers, processing alcoholic beverages through the mixing and blending process. This will fix interpretation issues at operational level and manufacturers who are involved in mixing and blending processes do not qualify to benefit from concessions for manufacturers who produce the final product through the fermentation and distillation process. (3) Removal of VAT concession on personal items, as I have said earlier, from $2,000 to $1,000. It used to be $400 before COVID-19, I was taken to $2,000 so we are not going back to $400 but we just going back to $1,000. (4) Reduction in fiscal duties associated with different products relating to various manufacturing and production purposes. I am sure honourable Members have read all that. On the Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, section 2 of the Act is amended to provide for a longer duty accounting period for manufacturers of certain excisable products who were issued a licence on or after 1 st January to assist new businesses. Section 28 of the Act is amended to impose a fee of $15 for each submission that is processed by FRCS and a fine of $115 for the late payment of excise duty to discourage late payments. Section 81 of the Act is amended to mandate manufacturers and warehouse keepers to keep electronic copies of books, documents and phones. Schedule 2 to the Act is amended to reflect the increase in the rate of excise duty on alcohol and tobacco by 5 percent. On the Airport Departure Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 3 of the Act is amended to reflect the changes from $140 to $170, and then $170 to $200, and the effective dates. These changes are reflective of the recovering tourism sector in the last 12 to 18 months, as I have said before. We are also reducing the transit hours. On the Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, as I have said, we are amending section 7 of the Act by including a worker representative and an employer representative, as members of the FNPF Board. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 36 of the Act to update provisions on admitting minors, as I have said before, on FNPF members. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 37 of the Act to provide an employer up to 14 days at the beginning of each month, to submit a remittance back to the Board, and all the other amendments that I had highlighted earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, section 2 of the Act is amended, as I have said earlier, to insert the new definition of “at-risk student”, to identify a student who is under a bond agreement.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1332</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 Section 5 of the Act is amended to mandate tertiary education institutions to inform TELS of at-risk students, so that TELS can undertake actions to support their students better. Generally, the amendments are made to mandate former TSLS students to clear their bond, to mandate tertiary education institutions to inform TELS of their at-risk students, penalise students who are legally bound to TSLS and have no intention of serving their bond, and reflect the initial arrangement on former TSLS students on their bond.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bills to Parliament.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have in front of me a list of speakers that has been put forward by honourable Whips, as follows: (1) Hon. S. T. Koroilavesau; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (3) Hon. S. S. Kirpal; (4) Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; (5) Hon. P. D. Kumar; and (6) Honourable Minister for Education. Honourable Koroilavesau, you have the floor, Sir. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the Government and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for the passing of the Budget yesterday afternoon. The discussions that will be held today are basically consequential of the Budget that was already passed yesterday. So, we are basically going to raise some issues that we think should be highlighted in this Parliament, but it will not make any impact on the decisions that had already been made yesterday. My contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be restricted to departure tax only, and a Bill that covers the amendment of income tax for the export of agricultural, fisheries and forestry goods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand perfectly well the increase in departure tax. It is a source of income and revenue for Government to be able to fund its operations in the financial year that has been earmarked (2024-2025). Government has to create avenues and look for areas that it can generate revenue. My view is that airport tax is basically added on to the airline ticket which will deliver an indication of the cost for flying across and spending their holidays within a destination. The increase in departure tax will basically mean that Fiji, as a destination, will be increasing its actual cost that the tourists will need to spend if they choose to come and spend their holidays here in Fiji. My main concern, as I have highlighted during the Budget discussions, is the competition that will be provided by the destinations in South-East Asia. Fiji had done good by rebounding well after COVID-19. In that, it was one of the first destinations to be opened. We took advantage of that opportunity, and we flew off our handle and we are reaping the benefits today. I would have suggested in hindsight the suggestion, that may be the increase could have been done in two slots. To me, the first one is to be done in this financial year because we will finish that</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1333 period before the next budget, and then have an increase of $200 announced during the next Budget, which will then give the impetus to introduce that increase in August next year, especially as we approach the season of October, November, December, January, February and March. It gives a comfort to our international tourists, that it is alright for high-end spenders, which we do not have the comfort of always attracting. Our attraction in Fiji is the sand, sea and smile and the nice weather that we enjoy, and that is basically one of the major pull provided also by our workers that work in our hotels. Sea and smile is the main attraction to Fiji. While we consider it comfortable that the numbers are increasing, I am just concerned that these two increases within the Budget announcement, to me, would have been done in a softer manner – announce $170 now and then announce $200 in the next Budget next year. But, anyway, that is water under the bridge, and we need to meet up with the expectations that this increase in departure tax will bring forth. Sir, the next one is the percentage on export income to be deducted on agriculture, fisheries and forestry. This is a welcome development, and I thank the Government for introducing this because this will help our export. As the honourable Minister for Agriculture had stated in his delivery, we need to also take care of our consumption in these areas, locally. Before considering export, we need to feed our people, that is food security, and that is an important issue that Government needs to consider. Before I take my seat, in my short contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure the honourable Minister for Fisheries that I am not a technician or a technical expert in fisheries. My expert is very limited in handline fishing. That is the only expert I have. I do not have any degree or anything in fisheries. Whatever I learned was from the last five years that I was the Minister for Fisheries. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau, but you are really an expert in fishing when you are on land. (Laughter) I now invite the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, to make his contribution. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics in tabling the Consequential Bills that accompany the approval that was done yesterday. I guess what the honourable Koroilavesau, perhaps, lamented that the Bills are consequential and, therefore, are just part of the approval process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think what we need to understand is that there are some very significant amendments been made today that will continue to assist us as we try and redevelop the architecture of the Fijian economy, Sir, and try and ensure that we diversify the Fijian economy and also ensure that we start achieving the aspirational 5 percent economic growth that we really need to get to, in order to try and address some of the challenges regarding debt management and also creating sustainability for our people. One of the things, Sir, that has dawned on me in our deliberation this week is that we are really in a true democracy. The conduct of consultations, the conduct of the debate in Parliament, Sir, shows that we are in a new environment. We, on both sides of Parliament, Sir, should</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1334</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 congratulate ourselves and pat ourselves on the back in terms of what we are doing in front of the people of Fiji in terms of trying to progress and rebuild our nation. The transparency that we have been experiencing for the first time, twice in a row now, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition Party have been allowed to access all the information, investment information. It is not like a big deal. The Chief Executive Officer of Investment Fiji just called, and I said, “Yes, go ahead, do it.” Sir, this is the new Fiji that we are trying to rebuild. The Opposition asked for access to the budgetary information, even the information that they were using against us in terms of utilisation. But that is the new democracy, Sir, and we will continue that because we can see that it is allowing us to all work together for the betterment of our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to specifically mention some of the great initiatives that are here, and the first one I thought I will mention is the3 percent duty on raw materials. And if anything, Sir, this demonstrates that this side of the Parliament and this Government, your Government, Sir, we listen to the people of Fiji and we listen to everyone. There were concerns expressed last year, we all discussed with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and was removed. What it has done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just to re-energise the private sector and make them happy that when they come forward, they can move forward with a lot more optimism. Departure Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do take note of honourable Koroilavesau’s comments, but just to allay his concerns, the first increase is actually taking effect from 1 st August, 2024 and the second increase is taking effect in 2025. So, in fact, we are, sort of, spreading it over for two financial years and that should be fine in terms of managing expectations. In fact, it is a good thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are flagging it in advance because for the tourism industry that the honourable Gavoka and I know about, they are always happy when we signal things in advance rather than, sort of, hiding and be cloak and dagger and then, all of a sudden, announce a change. Again, a government that listens, Sir. In terms of the Prefabrication Buildings Concession, Sir, this is very significant because it will allow, firstly, to accelerate the construction of hotels in Fiji. We have one significant hotel in Denarau that is seriously looking at prefab, sort of, design and they are actually now saying that they can condense their programme from three years possibly down to two years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from that perspective, this is a very significant initiative, and it will speed up the pace of construction in our country, and whilst speeding up the pace of construction, Sir, that just means that there are more jobs created in our country, as we all agree, is all needed. The hotel incentive –SLIP, Sir, again, that is significant because there was a bit of a grey area in the legislation. You could only enjoy tax concession if you build a new hotel. As we know, Sir, there are now investors in the country wanting to take hold of retired, rundown properties and re- design them, enhance them, rebrand them and, sort of, attract more visitors to our shores. This, Sir, will take away that mystery and will, again, make people a lot more interested, investors particularly, for coming into Fiji, taking control of existing properties, and then enhancing them into branded hotel. The other one that we should celebrate is the iTaukei Incentive, Sir, and I speak certainly in terms of those who are on this side of Parliament that sincerely believe that we really need to unlock the potential in the natural resource economy which is, of course, what the iTaukei of this country</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1335 own. Sir, these concessions will ensure that we start assisting the growth in that sector and have a look at what the Maoris have done in New Zealand. That is a benchmark for the rest of Fiji and this step, Sir, will ensure that we move in that direction. Finally, Sir, I thought I will just touch on one final concession which is the Lyndhurst Limited Tax Free Region Concession and I do that Sir, not because I am a former employee, but I do that just to explain what this opportunity brings. The honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources mentioned it yesterday but, probably, some of the honourable Members did not hear it. This project, Sir, is an eight-year project, upon completion, will actually produce between 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in Fiji. Let me repeat that again, Sir, this investment, upon completion, is just underneath half a billion dollars. So, Lyndhurst, working with FNPF, will create an investment that is estimated to create 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in Fiji, so this is a very significant concession that we have made in the interest of developing this economy. Sir, with those thoughts in mind, I totally support the Consequential Bills. They may be called “consequential” Sir, but I beg to differ with honourable Koroilavesau and say that these are very significant amendments in the legislation for Fiji and for its future. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today I will be speaking on Bill No. 12, but before I do that, I would like to congratulate honourable Bainivalu, as I forgot to mention that in my Budget speech. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support female, so I kindly request the honourable Prime Minister to have a few more lady Ministers sitting in front, as alluded by honourable Premila Kumar. Honourable Qereqeretabua has been here for her second term, she is good to be a full Minister. In my knowledge, I humbly request the honourable Prime Minister to show the country that we have gender balance. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Talking here in Parliament about democracy, democracy has come a long way since the 1970s. A lot of governments have come and whatever legislations and regulations best suited for them, they change. Now, you are at the steering wheel so whatever suits you, you can do it. At the end of the day, we have to serve the people of our nation as Members of Parliament. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- It will be good to see honourable Members going out into the public and supporting the people of this nation. MR. SPEAKER.- We want them to be in the front bench?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.:</span> If they do not want, we can come that side.</p><p>(Laughter) I have already told the honourable Prime Minister, and soon if he can offer me to be the Minister. (Laughter) The honourable Prime Minister has plenty avenues, his numbers are large now.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1336</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 Talking on Bill No. 12, I think the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and I will also ask the honourable Attorney-General that when the Bill was tabled in Parliament from that night, Customs started charging 15 percent and they said that it is in the regulation, but the Bill was only tabled at that stage. The Bill will be effective from 1 st August, so all those charges should be applied from 1 st August. If there is any regulation to be changed, as they have alluded, it should be changed. I request the honourable Attorney-General to change are few of the regulations in the Customs Act where once the Bill is tabled, they started charging 15 percent, and whatever duty they start charging and say if the Bill does not go through then they will refund the money. So, it is a double process. I think the honourable Minister for Finance will understand much better, he is an economist and a professor, and I have a lot of respect him. I went to USP and did my Degree when he was there, so I have a lot of respect for him so I hope he will do the right thing for the nation because.... (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.:</span> Oh, my Professor was Dr. Reddy.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I do like him:</span></p><p>When the Ministry of Finance came for a meeting with the Opposition Members, they talked about that regulation. The other one, I will request the honourable Minister for Finance that it is hard on all local bottling companies - from1 cent, it went to 5 cents, if they can re-consider putting it at 2 cents or 3 cents. Do not be hard on them because maybe the local water price will go up because of 5 cents. The price of the water which we are buying from supermarkets, the honourable Minister cannot provide water. The Tacirua area is suffering, honourable Minister, so I hope you will consider that there is no water at times. Sometimes, they do not bath for two or three days, they have to go to the river. So, I just want to let you know. There is one creek, Mr. Speaker, where they go and do their washing. Talking about water, 1 cent to 5 cents is big and mostly, Fijian people drink Fiji Water, as well as other water in Fiji. I hope you will consider that. With all those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this time. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution in support of the Bills which are consequential to the Appropriation Act that we had passed last night. I just want to emphasise, I suppose, a point that we probably already know. Those who have had their first and second rounds in Parliament since 2014 would understand the importance of why these Consequential Bills ought to be passed because on the balance. They would support the implementation of the Budget that we had overwhelmingly agreed to last night. It is also important that we get these Bills through today because without them, none of the impositions that we intend to carry through with the Budget will be lawful and to that extent, I appreciate the contribution by honourable Koroilavesau, as well as honourable Kirpal, and I am sure that honourable Premila Kumar will also, in the end, support the passage of these Bills so that we can get, not just the Budget but also the Consequential Bills through and bring this week to a high end.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1337 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not intend to spend the 20 minutes that I have been allocated but collectively, to make some comments on the nine Consequential Bills that accompany the Appropriation which we have passed yesterday. One of the important provisions that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Finance had picked up was in our tax system, that is, in the reduction of prefabricated materials from the present 32 percent to 5 percent that we would begin to impose and levy from 1 st August this year. Building and construction materials, honourable Members have always been an impediment to the greater construction industry in Fiji, but also even in the lesser but equally important construction of residences and commercial buildings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is going to bring down the cost and if we are bringing down the cost, we are also going to be increasing the number and the level of employment that we would create in the country. I think from yesterday, we would all agree that when we went through the Budget line by line, we can identify that through this Budget, there is a lot for every citizen of this country. We can identify that in the Ministry programmes, line by line that if we look at it, there is always something there for all Fijians. The important part is, post-1 st August is the implementation and the rush to ensure that that budgetary item is completely spent, and as the Opposition would impose on us, spend it well. I am sure that we have that in our books. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SLIP provision that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics as well as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications had spoken about is an incentive to ensure that existing hotels are upgraded. If it is not upgraded by those who own it now and if there is a sale, there is always a tax concession for those who will come in, pick up the project and continue on with it. We have, I think, a deficit of about 3,000 beds. That, I think, is even a very moderate number. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation might have the accurate number, but notwithstanding, that number is still great. So, this sort of incentive is going to bring that investor confidence into the country where people will see an avenue of investment, pour in the money, take advantage of the concession and also contribute to our national economy, as well as our buoyant tourism industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, one of the provisions that clearly has been highlighted by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is that we now have more latitude given to our businesspeople for clearance of their goods. That is important because as we know, businesses in Fiji are not always flush with funds. Sometimes, as usual, businesses run into some brick walls, availability of funding is not always there all the time. So, the provision of more time then gives them an opportunity to clear their goods and not having all those goods forfeited because time has lapsed. One of the great measures that we can see now, which is also an indication of our progress as a country economically, socially and collectively as a people, is that which was identified by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in his speech on the Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 is that all the measures that were there post-COVID-19, we are now returning it pre-COVID-19. That is a good thing because it is indicating to us, and we are also indicating to the rest of the world that we are now back on track. We are trying, we have gone through one of the most devastating global phenomena, and we have pushed past that that in the few years ago and we are now back on track, and we are now on a post-recovery pathway. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the VAT on personal imports (even my wife is not in agreement with that, because they purchase online), I think the balance of that is, now local traders will have a very fair</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1338</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 playing field with those who trade on international online web system. So, those in Fiji who have gone through the pains and local businesses who have gone through the pain of reporting goods, putting them on the shelves, now have a level playing field with those that do the same or provide the same service online. The Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, is also important because it gives provision for hardship situations. Whilst this was not there before, it is now there in this Bill where TSLS is able to help students in places and in positions of hardship. I just want to come back, Mr. Speaker, and end with the contribution by the honourable Koroilavesau when he identified the imposition now or back to normal imposition of the departure tax. It has been a well thought-out process, Mr. Speaker, during the budgetary process by the Ministry of Finance with all honourable Ministers and the whole of Government approach, again, consistent with our out of the woods theme that we are now coming out of COVID, back into the global scheme of things, but he is right, Mr. Speaker. I just want to add on to what the honourable Koroilavesau has said. Tourists have many destinations to go to. They could go to South-East Asia, they could even fly within the Australian domain, they could go to other South Pacific Islands, but we sell sand, sunshine and smile, better. I think that is something that as a tourist destination, Fijians just fare much better in providing that level of comfort and receptivity to tourists who, over time, keep coming back to our shores. But it is just not that, Mr. Speaker, and I want to end on this note - they come back because they understand that a heart of a Fijian is very different from every other destination in the world. We have them in our house. We have them in our communities. We have them together with us in our backyard. We introduce them to kava sessions. We introduce them to our horsebacks. We introduce them to a lot of things that our nature here in Fiji is able to offer, and that is something that demarcates Fiji as the destination from everywhere else in the world. Even with this imposition, Mr. Speaker, and as quietly rightly pointed out by honourable Koroilavesau, comes part of the ticket quite possibly for those high-end travellers, not a problem, but even for those who might think, “well, that is a small pinch in our budget to travel to Fiji”, they will never forget the experience that they get when they come here and they return – the heart of the Fijians. The heart of a Fijian, Mr. Speaker, is what we all see this Parliament is beginning to show and the people of Fiji is beginning to see from both sides of Parliament.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, with that contribution, I support the Bills consequential to the Appropriation</h4><p>and I thank you for this opportunity.</p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on two Bills and maybe a third one,</h4><p>if I have time - Bill No.13 of 2024 and Bill No.15 of 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all agree with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and, of course, with the Government, that revenue is very important for the Government to deliver its social obligation and it is important that every cent is collected. It is very crucial that we do that. However, one needs to be very mindful of the fact that we are at a difficult situation right now. Government may be collecting the revenue, but the revenue is coming from the people, as well as from the businesses. Now, some of these businesses are not performing well and is causing the slowdown in the economy, we all know that. And, therefore, when businesses are not doing well, it</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1339 is not appropriate to put in certain changes in the legislation which is going to increase the burden, and I would like to draw everyone’s attention to Clause 3 of the Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 that amends section 28 of the Act. What it does is, it imposes a fee of $15 for each submission that is processed by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) and a late penalty fee of $115, and the time that is given for the businesses to clear their duty is just three working days. And it is also subject to the Comptroller, whichever time he or she approves. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have two issues here. The first issue is for the Comptroller to make that decision, which is actually subjective in nature, and we should not allow subjective decision-making to be allowed in any legislation because that opens up abuse, it opens up favouritism, et cetera. To address that, the best solution would have been to give businesses, at least, seven working days or 14 working days because within a month, the money will be paid, and the government can collect that money. But just making the period short, like three working days, obviously, would mean more and more businesses will go up to FRCS saying, “we cannot make this payment. Paperwork will increase at FRCS.” The Comptroller has to write letters to businesses and say, “Alright, I have heard your case, I will give you more time.” So, why take that administrative process when you can amend the legislation and allow reasonable time for businesses to clear their duties or whatever taxes they owe? That will allow businesses to have that confidence in the system as well. When businesses are not doing well, at least, the Government is listening, and they are considerate. So, I am urging the Government to, please, consider that because really, businesses are facing a lot of difficulties at a time like this, with a global slowdown as well so in that case we should give some leeway to businesses. I am not saying that they should not be paying the duty, of course, they will, and they must, and they should. But just giving them ample time to clear their duty within the month, and having this subjective decision to be part of the law is not a very good idea. So, that was my first point. The second point is on the Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 15/2024) and it is to do with the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) members’ nominee. So, it simply says, that the FNPF member can nominate whoever he or she likes, that when he or she is not there anymore, that amount can be passed on. So, if it is existing FNPF member and it says that it can be passed on to the existing FNPF member, or to another member who is not part of FNPF. So, my question here is, say someone who is over 65 years and is not an FNPF member, can that be passed on? That needs to be clarified and it is not clarified here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that clarification is required. Age needs to be specified so that it is clear to the FNPF member that when he or she is going to pass on, whatever money he or she has accumulated in FNPF goes to the member who can join FNPF because I think the whole idea is to retain money within FNPF and grow FNPF money. So, if that is the intent of this particular Clause, then maybe we need to consider that aspect, that if the money is passed on to someone who is over 65 years and a good example would be a young son who decides to pass on that money to his parents, if he passes away or is still working, then obviously it cannot happen. So, I am not clear about this particular Clause. Maybe, some more clarification is required. The third one that I would like to speak on is the Water Resource Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Last year, Government introduced Water Resource Tax and we know that a seven-year tax holiday was given to companies and this year, the seven-year tax holiday remains. Unfortunately, Government is trying to punish the local companies who produce smaller amounts and are, obviously, not extracting large quantity of water from the ground where 19.5 percent will apply to them.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1340</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 However, the Government certainly realises that the decision they made last year is not bringing them revenue as they anticipated. So, what they did this year, they have increased the Water Resource Tax from 1 cent to 5 cents and, definitely, that affects our local producers. I feel this is not fair to our local producers because we are bending backwards to accommodate Fiji Water, and we are ignoring our own producers. Therefore, I am urging Government to reconsider this Water Resource Tax. From 1 cent to 5 cents is definitely a 100 percent increase, and that will affect businesses because every cent counts, at a time like this when our economy is slowing down. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for bringing in this 5 percent duty reduction from 32 percent to 5 percent on prefabricated building. This is definitely needed in our economy; we want to grow our economy and by doing that, we are dealing with two things; one is of course the cost component, and the other one is the labour component. Of course, we will need specialized people to do that but that will shorten the time for the construction and is going to be a gain for everyone. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a short contribution in supporting the motion before Parliament relating to the Consequential Bills, and I would like to specifically focus on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 16/2024). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the Act basically covers the: • • • • • shifting of the bond monitoring and travel clearance from Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) to now Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS); 50 percent penalty for non-serve bond; obtaining student employment records or data; addition of new programmes for funding; and reporting at risk for academically non-performing students who are being sponsored and providing false scholarship information to students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just let me elaborate on some of these provisions. The rationale regarding the justification of shifting the functions from FRCS to TSLS, before it used to be the responsibility of TSLS and in 2017, this was shifted to FRCS, which created a lot of concerns and inquiries from students who are covered under the TSLS bond system when they intend or wish to go overseas. Sometimes they are being directed, after going to TSLS, to go to FRCS to get their related necessary clearance. So, this is bringing the functions back to TSLS to make it a one-stop place and allow efficient services to the students. This is included in sections 5, 6, 16, 17 and 25 of the Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reinstatement of penalty, I think the whole rationale behind this is to ensure that those who have been sponsored by taxpayers’ funds needed to spend time and work in Fiji through Government Ministries, or through institutions that are operating in Fiji. There have been instances where students, halfway into their bond, are being offered to go abroad, so they have to pay off the remaining balance, so this is like a deterrent to keep them here to serve their full bond period. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the taxpayers are not investing graduates to work in overseas countries but in our local workforce. Any graduate seeking to migrate or go for overseas employment will be required to first serve their full bond, and should graduates opt not to fully serve, then they should pay the remaining balance with 50 percent penalty before travel release is granted to go overseas and this will be through discussions and review by TSLS and the Ministry of Finance.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1341 The collection of data, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from graduates who have studied on Government scholarship is also very, very important for future scholarship planning, especially in the areas of need, and investment for bond monitoring purposes and the data will be used in other Government planning system. Sir, the tertiary education institutions sometimes provide incorrect information to students for the purpose of increasing their enrolment numbers and the students are charged fees for programmes which are not funded through scholarships. There have been many cases where students were given offer letters by tertiary education institutions and advised that scholarships will be given when the student did not meet the scholarship eligibility criteria. So, TSLS is running workshops for tertiary education institutions on the scholarship eligibility criteria and every year publishes a scholarship handbook. This will be given out at the beginning of next month. Government only fund scholarships in national priority areas. With this inclusion in the Act, TSLS can take actions on the intuitions providing false information. Government welcomes competition between tertiary education institutions, and we all have experienced mass marketing before the semester starts. This inclusion is included in section 18 of the Act. Regarding at-risk students, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those who start to fail assignments and assessments from the beginning are called academically-risk students. This will ensure that tertiary education institutions have learning support and remedial programmes to provide scaffolding support to students. This will, hopefully, reduce failure and non-completion rate of students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been reported that $160 million has been wasted by 21,685 students, who did not complete their programmes. This results to squandering of State resources and the Coalition Government wants to stop this immediately by having new inclusion in the Act. The current tertiary education institutions provide their results to TSLS at the end of the semester, and they will make sure that information that is provided is accurate information. The adding of new programmes to be funded by TSLS carries out resources and employment checks with institutions and potential employers. This is due diligence before taxpayers’ funds is used, to provide scholarships for new programmes. The Coalition Government is conscious that taxpayers’ money should be used where employment is available for graduates. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will avoid lawsuits from graduates who are not be able to find jobs and TSLS has been sued recently by graduates who could not find employment after four years of study under the TSLS programme. This new inclusion is outlined in Section 25 of the Act. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I render my full support to the motion before Parliament regarding the Consequential Bill. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all the honourable Members for their contributions which are very helpful. It provides clarity and allows me to also clarify some of the questions that have been raised, Sir. On the departure tax, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co- operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications quite rightly pointed out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we deliberately announced in the two phases from $140 to $170 and then to $200 and he is absolutely right that we wanted to provide this certainty well in advance for the tourism industry players to adjust and we have had some discussion with them. They are all very supportive of this phased announcement, even though it will be implemented on 1 st August when we get to $200. The other point that I wanted to make, honourable Koroilavesau is, we have said very clearly before the tourism industry was hit by 10 percent ECAL, 6 percent STT, we are saying that we are</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1342</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>12 th July, 2024 not going to ever bring those as long as we are in government so we have signalled to the tourism industry very clearly that these taxes are not going to come back and that departure tax is something that we feel could go back to what it was before COVID-19. On the point that was raised about how it might affect the tourism industry, in fact, in the last eight months, as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation has already said, visitor arrivals have actually increased by 8 percent in the last five months. Since we have come into Government, we have also increased the Tourism Marketing grant from $20 million to now $35 million, so marketing will also be very aggressive. Fiji Airways always offer very competitive fares, some of them have spare capacity, I think their prices are very competitive. Airline and hotel prices are determined in a similar fashion. Hotels, as soon as they are 60 percent or 70 percent, the last 30 percent, they go very high. So, those rooms is there, Mr Speaker, Sir. The point that honourable Kirpal raised about immediate effect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is always by Customs law that as soon as duty increases, et cetera, is announced, the effect is immediate soon after the announcement of the Budget, because if that does not happen, for example, we announced 5 percent increase in duty on alcohol and cigarette. If it is not implemented straightaway, businesses could stock large amounts of cigarette and alcohol to be sold at a higher price but paying a lower duty. So, in the unlikely event that the Budget fails, that that duty is refundable. So, it is by Customs law that when duty and other things are announced in the Budget, the effect is immediate. And as I have said, in the event that the Budget is not passed, that duty is always refunded. Mr. Speaker, Sir the point on the personal items, the amount was $400. During COVID-19, it was increased to $2,000. So, what we have done, we have not gone back to pre-COVID, we have not gone back to $400, we have just gone back to $1,000, and as the honourable Minister for Lands quite rightly pointed out, I am sorry your wife might not be very happy honourable Minister, but the point is that it brings a level playing field and also close that loophole where it was being misused. Sir, in many countries that have seen the rise of online shopping have put in measures to ensure that there is a level playing field. With respect to the water resource tax, it is not part of any consequential legislation, it is by regulation, and we have had discussions with the water bottlers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have decided that we will stick to 1 cent, in the meantime, instead of 5 cents. The issue about FNPF, honourable Premila Kumar, your earlier point about the Comptroller, that $15 was already in place, it is just a realignment of the law. What is there was already there, so we are not changing anything in terms of bringing the law in line with what was happening because there was a loophole. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Change it! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- We are changing it, we are closing the legal loophole, honourable Premila Kumar, and that is what we have done. For FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the point raised, that is to allow an additional option for those at the retirement age. Right now, they have an option of going into pension or withdrawing the full amount. With this amendment, they will have an option of transferring some of their balances to an existing member whether it is their son or daughter, so that is the interpretation of that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said in my opening remarks, we want to have a tax system that is</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>1343 administratively simple, transparent, efficient and fair. At the same time, we want to ensure that Government is well funded. Tax, Sir, is something which will always have gainers and losers, so it is quite natural that any tax that you put in, any increase or decrease, will always invite winners and losers. As a government, we have listened very carefully and we want to provide that balance, that transparency and that forward looking warning and certainty with respect to what our businesses and our consumers expect. But, at the same time, constantly making sure that we amend our laws to ensure that there is compliance; compliance is a big issue. The point that honourable Premila Kumar kept making that the economy is slowing down, the economy is not contracting, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have said that the economy is still growing and, for the first time, we are going to collect on target $3 billion revenue by the end of this month which is going to be the highest ever collected even pre-COVID, Sir. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) HON. S. TUBUNA.- Listen to the Professor! (Laughter) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- We provide proper estimates and, for the first time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after many years that I have looked at the data, that what we projected in the last Budget is something that we are going to achieve. Sir, that is what you call a very transparent, open system of putting our tax policies, tax laws, and the point I want to make too.... (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- We are telling them that we are going to collect the highest ever capital revenue of $3 billion by the end of this month, and it shows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that what we did in the last Budget and what we are doing in this Budget is actually working for our businesses, working for our people, and working for our economy. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is absolutely no hogwash! That always comes from the other side. I want to thank the honourable Members for their contributions, and I commend the Bills and I ask all honourable Members to, please, support them. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast: Ayes - 39 Noes - 14 Abstained - 1 Motion agreed to.
