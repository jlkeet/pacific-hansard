MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank you so sincerely for the way we handled ourselves during this weeklong debate, even though it became very rowdy towards the end of this sitting and it was always a punch up, I can understand, between the honourable Minister for Multi- Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry, and honourable Bala. But as honourable Bala always stated, we need to allow this to happen, but not to that stage where, I must apologise, since I used the word ‘bloody’ when I tried to intervene and caution you. (Honourable Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, I will not dwell into that. But, again, thank you so much for all the contribution, all the hard work during our participation and even in the passing of the 2024-2025 National Budget. I also wish to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and his Team at the Ministry of Finance, and this is the first time I have heard the accolades being given, even to the Permanent Secretary. That never used to be the case.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, it used to happen.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Oh, honourable Premila Kumar is saying that it used to happen, maybe in the few years that I was out of Parliament. (Laughter) But, again, I am thankful for that - we acknowledging the hard work being undertaken by our senior civil servants and in particular, the Permanent Secretary for Finance. Honourable members, lunch and morning tea is now prepared at the Big Committee Room. Parliament is now adjourned until Monday, 5 th August, 2024, at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 1.17 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42</p></body>
