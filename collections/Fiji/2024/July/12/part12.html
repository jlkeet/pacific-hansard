<body><h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – HOUSING AUTHORITY OF FIJI</h3><h4>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – HOUSING AUTHORITY OF FIJI</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, for the purposes of Section 145(1) of the Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move that Parliament approves: (a) (b) the renewal of the Government guarantee of $150 million (Guarantee limit) for the Housing Authority’s borrowings for another 5-year period from 1 st July, 2024 to 30 th June, 2029 (proposed Guarantee period); and that the Housing Authority pay a guarantee fee of 0.5 percent on the cumulative utilised guarantee credit.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, just by way of background, the Housing Authority was established under the provisions of the Housing Act 1955 and opened for business in 1958, with the principle objective to provide decent and affordable housing to families earning a household income of $50,000 and below, with concentration in the middle to low income families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I try to look at a little bit of history and what I found that the Housing Authority Act and the establishment of the Housing Authority was actually done through the efforts of two men, the former leader of the National Federation Party - Mr. A. D. Patel, who was a Legislative Member from 1944 to 1950; and Father Dermot P. Hurley, who became the Chairman of the Housing Authority. This actual letter that Father Hurley wrote to Mr. A. D. Patel was quoted by Professor Brij Lal in the book called Vision for Change - A. D. Patel and the Politics of Fiji. So, I just wanted to put that history. The Authority’s mission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reinforced by the Fijian Government’s National Development Plan on an inclusive socio-economic development platform, aiming at transforming and improving the wellbeing of all Fijians. In discharging the functions of the Authority under section 19 of the Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it states, and I quote: “…with the consent of and upon such terms and conditions as may be approved by</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1345 the Minister, raise loans for the purpose of exercising its powers and carrying out its duties and obligations under this Act.” Section 20 of the Act further provides that the repayment of such borrowings may, among other things, be guaranteed by Government, so just by way of background. The underlying objective of the $150 million Government Guarantee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to continue facilitation of the Government’s policy to: (1) Provide access to affordable housing through the provision of affordable housing service lots and construction of new housing units. (2) Ensure that more land is available for home construction and help increase the supply of housing. (3) Support the vertical community strata units to accommodate more diverse group of Fijians with different demographics and family size. (4) Construct affordable housing units for those low and middle income earners and who may not be in a position to facilitate the construction of their dreams in terms of getting and owning a home. (5) Reduce the perceived risk associated with the Authority’s borrowings, therefore, reducing the cost of borrowing. Consequentially, this will make the Authority’s instruments more attractive to investors, providing them with an opportunity to support the social obligation needed to break barriers affecting their housing affordability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the development of the domestic security’s market mainly intended to further deepen and expand the domestic security’s market, the Government extends initiative, granting private investors and individuals interest income exemption for investing in financial instruments which includes bonds, treasury bills and promissory notes issued by the State- owned entities and statutory authorities. This will certainly enhance the investor appetite to uptake the housing debt instrument. For the last five-year period, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2018 to June 2024, the Authority had borrowed up to $148 million. For the information of Parliament, the Authority was granted a guarantee cover of $150 million in 2018, to be utilised for a five-year period from 2019-2024, of which $148 million was utilised for land acquisition, development of land into residential lots, mortgage lending for new housing construction and upgrading renovation and financing purchase of properties by the Authority’s customers in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. A total of 2,661 lots were delivered from 2005 to 2024 in the following areas - Waila 3B, Wainibuku, Tacirua, Mokosoi, Field 40 in Lautoka, Namosau in Ba, Matavolivoli and Tovata. The forecast for the next five years anticipates production of 3,071 lots in the following areas - Tacirua, Veikoba, Waila, Navaramai, Veisari, Tavakubu, Waqadra in Nadi, Wairabetia in Lautoka and Tavua. The forecast above excludes the 1,031 lots assigned to the Ministry of Finance and IFC to pursue the PPP arrangement for the design and building concept. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that process is currently underway. The Housing Authority’s outstanding liabilities guaranteed by Government as of 30 th June, 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, stood at $86.1 million, of which bonds were $15 million - 17 percent; and loans were $71.1 million which is about 83 percent. As of 30 th April, 2024, the Government guaranteed debt total as required by the Constitution for Parliament to know, Sir, stood at $1.02 billion, or 7.7 percent of GDP. Accessing the $150 million guarantee by the Authority will increase the total Government guarantee exposure to $1.2 billion or 8.9 percent of GDP.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1346 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the risk analysis with respect to Housing Authority in terms of the financial position and the performance of the Authority in the past years, particularly 2022-2023, the Authority recorded a positive performance in 2022-2023 financial year - operating profit after tax stood at $0.94 million; the total asset was $214 million, an increase by $15 million; while total liabilities accounted for $154 million, an increase of $13 million, compared to the same period last year. So, that shows, Sir, that the financial position of the Authority is quite favourable and we do not see any issues there and I do not want to go into further details. The liquidity position of the Authority also improved in 2023 and that was clearly reflected in the current ratio in both financial years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Normally, the rule of thumb is 2:1 and what we are saying is, it was better than that. In terms of long-term solvency, the Authority intends to borrow funds to finance long term projects. The Authority could manage its long-term obligations whereby for every 72 cents of debt obligation, $1 is available from the total assets to meet this obligation. So, it is a fairly stable financial situation. The Risk Analysis, Mr. Speaker, also shows that the Authority is stable on an improving trend and its profitability and liquidity are, kind of, a break-even point. The Authority, at the moment, is classified as a tier two or a medium risk entity, based on the Ministry’s assessment, as per the Government Guarantee Policy. So, the Ministry of Finance is required to do that risk analysis as per the Government Guarantee policy. Accordingly, a guarantee fee of 0.5 percent was determined, it is also to give the signal to the Authority that “this is the analysis that the Government does”. The Authority, Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans to utilise this guarantee of $150 million to deliver 3,183 lots projected to be delivered during the 2024-2028 period and the locations or areas, I have already pointed out. The total development cost, Sir, is estimated at $229.08 million for the period 2024-2028. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is probably not enough. As a country, we have a very big issue – a national issue, to handle and, that is, to provide affordable housing, especially to those in our informal settlements. The guarantee will also allow the Authority to access the Reserve Bank of Fiji’s Housing Facility, and maintain the current portfolio of $71.13 million, assisting about 525 customers. Furthermore, a total of $9.82 million has been approved, assisting 184 customers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the guarantee credit of $150 million will support the Housing Authority’s policy agenda and, at the same time, will ensure that they continue to provide affordable lots and houses to those who need it. We all know that it has a long history, it plays a pivotal role in ensuring and supporting affordability for housing for our people through Government assistance. As I have said, to recoup part of the risk, that 5 percent guarantee is a signal, but also an attempt to make sure that Government is always careful with all its entities when bringing these kind of motions to Parliament. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With those remarks, I commend the motion to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. There is a list of speakers here from both Whips and the batting is as follows: (1) Honourable Premila Kumar; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs (3) Honourable Jone Usamate; (4) Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; (5) Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1347 (6) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion before Parliament to endorse the renewal of the Government Guarantee of $150 million to the Housing Authority of Fiji, for another five years and for the Authority to pay a guarantee fee of 0.5 percent on the cumulative utilised guarantee credit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just the financial matter, it is a commitment to meet the social development goals set by the Fijian Government, and we all agree that Fijians all want a safe place called, ‘home’. We also understand that Fiji faces an acute shortage of homes, and this is mainly impacting low to middle income families. The Housing Authority was established, as we have heard from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, with the key mandate to increase the housing stock over period of time. But we have seen that Housing Authority very traditionally have been involved in just making the land, dividing the land into pieces and allotting it to the families, and by doing that, again, the family had to look for money to build the house and, again, it is a very expensive affair. So, the new thinking that has come into Housing Authority now is to develop strata apartments, strata flats, and that is the best way to go because there is uniformity and will be able to address the scarcity of land that we have in the urban area. Now, this work started way back with the development of, at least, six areas and it is absolutely ready for the development of these strata apartments, and I have heard from the Government on the commitment to continue with this project under PPP arrangement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government guarantee to the Housing Authority is a necessary step towards addressing our housing shortages and enhancing the social stability that we need in our community. I also want to say that the Government guarantee is not an immediate expenditure. It is just an assurance from the Government to the lenders that if Housing Authority is unable to pay the loan, then the Government will. Such a guarantee from the Government gives credibility and confidence to the lenders to engage with Housing Authority and for the Housing Authority to shop around and secure the necessary funds on favourable terms because if the Government guarantee is not there, I can assure you that Housing Authority will have great difficulty in getting money on favourable terms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I view infrastructure in construction projects as a powerful job creator, providing employment opportunity across a wide range of professions. Even Housing Authority, embarking on to a PPP project will require drafters, architects, engineers, quantity surveyors and also from builders and labourers to suppliers and manufacturers of building materials. So, it will create a lot of economic activity within Fiji. Unfortunately, the Budget that we have just passed had very little in that area. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this guarantee will allow the Housing Authority to expand its housing initiatives without placing undue strain on the Government resources. We all know that the Government resources are always limited because the demands are more from the people and, of course, from every other sector, but the resources are just limited. Can you imagine if the Government had to, again, assign $150 million to Housing Authority to invest in housing sector?</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1348 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 That would simply mean that the Government would be cutting out other important social obligations. So, from that perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see that this initiative is a prudent way of managing finance, and Housing Authority, with that Government guarantee, will definitely not put any strain on Government finances because they can go outside and borrow money because of the Government guarantee. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a caution, I must emphasise the need for a careful oversight and accountability. The Housing Authority must ensure that every dollar is spent wisely, with a clear focus on delivering affordable housing to those who need it most. Mismanagement or inefficiency must not be tolerated, as it would undermine the very objectives we are trying to achieve through this Government guarantee. And I want to draw our attention to the special investigation report that was done during my term as Minister for Housing, which was done by the Office of the Auditor-General. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was quite disappointing because as soon as I was announced as Minister for Housing, I started receiving complaints from the public, probably because they thought that I was still the CEO of Consumer Council of Fiji. They started lodging a lot of complaints, saying that they had put in their request for a piece of land 10 years ago and 15 years ago, and they have not heard anything from Housing Authority. Instead, what they have seen that there are people who can afford to buy a property elsewhere, were given lots in areas, like Tacirua and Wainibuku. So, the financial position of some of those people who got those lots was much better, therefore, the people started questioning as to why they were not able to get that lot. That drove the Government to undertake this special investigation and we found that there were lots of problems with the operation of Housing Authority. They did not have clear policies and guidelines, and any staff was making a decision on how the lots should be allocated. I am sure that the investigation report is a learning and, hopefully, Housing Authority is working in that area to improve the operations and bring about more clarity and transparency in the system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for now, I can say that the CEO of Housing Authority will be able to bring about better efficiency in the system. He has a wealth of knowledge from ANZ, and he was managing ANZ operations. When we talk about big banks, the whole objective is to reduce cost and maximise profit. So, by getting someone from that background, we do expect better performance from Housing Authority. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- When you mentioned ‘strata titles’, honourable Premila Kumar, is that applicable to Native land as well, or is it just State and Freehold land?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the strata apartments would be built on these land.</p><p>Some of these land are Native land. MR. SPEAKER.- All I am asking is, you now can do it on Native land?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for bringing this</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1349 motion up. But before I speak on the motion, I would like to thank Parliament for their contributions to the Budget Debate and for having it passed. I also thank the people of Fiji. We are going to be looking at this motion on the issue of Housing Authority and the provision of housing for the people of Fiji that has been there since 1955, as we have heard this morning. But I would like to go further back, I would like to go to 1874, Sir, the Deed of Cession. I am grateful that we now have the Great Council of Chiefs back because we can then look back at the wisdom of the chiefs and the leaders of the past. We spend a lot of time criticising some doings of the previous governments and we keep blaming them, but we very seldom thank and give tribute to those who had laid the foundation for what we now do as a nation and as the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Fijian chiefs, the leaders, the landowners, the teachers, the doctors, the nurses, healthcare workers, church and religious leaders, parents, prefects at schools, the elder brothers, elder sisters and families, taxpayers, investors, tourists and visitors to Fiji - all who have been involved in what we now enjoy as Fiji and Fijians. I would like to thank the leaders of the past and also pay my tribute to the leaders and the chiefs of the land we now sit on and have our Government Offices established on - the Chief of Suva and Chief of Rewa, and their descendants who are now with us and all those that are rising up or emerging to be future leaders of the land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this motion, tabled by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. I am particularly interested in this motion because I am a beneficiary of Housing Authority. My father and I bought a piece of land, and then we borrowed from Housing Authority many, many years ago. Before that, we were in an informal settlement. You, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was also brought up in an informal settlement and then became Housing Authority flats. So, a lot of us here know what this is all about. A lot of people out there thought we parachuted down to be in those high position as we now enjoy. It did not happen like that. We all had to struggle through housing, education, informal settlements, to be here, and we would like to encourage those who are watching us that there is hope. For every leader, there was a struggle. And the old saying goes, “Every saint has a past.” We are not all clean. Some of us who are now clean, had a past – it is not very clean. “Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future”. I would like to encourage the people to think like that. As we have this morning, it was established by Colonial Ordinance in 1955 and I am glad to have been part of the Coalition Government that I led in the 1990s. The Authority was declared a Commercial Statutory Authority under the Public Enterprises Act of 1996. I was reminded this morning when we were dealing with the Consequential Bills, I showed one of them to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications and said, “That is your father’s Bill in 1991”, the Value Added Tax (VAT), as we now know. I was part of that the Interim Government in 1991 before the Parliament of 1992, and we passed that. I nearly lost the General Election of 1992. A lot of people did not understand what VAT was all about. They went again the SVT Government for having introduced the VAT. But now we know that it is a very fair tax base for any country. The Authority moved away from designing and building homes to concentrate on the production of land lots and provision of financing in 1997, also during the time when I was Prime Minister. I am very glad to have been part of that history. Now, we are looking further ahead and more into the area of not only housing, but all the support infrastructure that is required.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1350 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 In the Budget debate, we talked about the Naboro Landfill. We will have to be considering having more of these available as we grow our urban population. Sewerage treatment plants, all those things that are involved in city development, new town developments, these will all have to come under our housing development and proposals, and it will also raise the costs. We have to try and make it affordable, sustainable and make them also safe, as part of our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slumps (I do not like using this because I was in the slumps, I would like to call them informal settlements), integrated housing frameworks, support economic, social and environmental policy planning and infrastructure linkages across the urban and rural ecosystems, buildings, increase in resiliency. For all these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the traditional landowners - the vanua, that will have to consider giving up or contributing their land for us all as we continue our housing provision for the people who are moving out from the islands where we originated from, to the main centres. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Government guarantee to the Authority, instruments such as bonds offered to investors become more attractive as risks are reduced. Funds raised by the Authority will be used to acquire new land, carry out land development projects for fully serviced lots and provide cash loans to customers for new house construction and to purchase new houses. We are all aware that the demand for housing in our urban centres far outweigh supply, and Housing Authority sites are therefore a step in the right direction. We thank all those who have contributed towards the development of Housing Authority. I remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a shop owner in three miles, Mr. Hira Lal, who rented out his upper floor to my father and my uncle and we rented there. The next door was the other man, one of our most renowned academics, who writes in to us from overseas now, Dr. Wadan Narsey’s father- in-law. We lived in Naikatolu, as we called it then. Mr. Hira Lal was a very good shop owner because we would go and buy juice from him and sell the empty bottles back to him. We bought milk from him and sold the empty bottles back to him. So, it was a very lively community. Then we moved to the Housing Authority lots and built our house. I am a very proud owner of a piece of land now in Suva with a house that my father and I built on Housing Authority loan. We had to build it in 1968, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because in 1969, I was going to be commissioned in the Army, and my salary, as well as my father’s salary as a teacher, would have taken us above the loan limit for Housing Authority. We were no longer called low-income earners jointly; we went over that threshold and we would have been forced to go to Home Finance which my father worked hard for. Although he was only a district schoolteacher, he said, “that will be too expensive for us. Okay, let us do it this year.” So, we got a Housing Authority loan. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced in the Budget, funding of $13.5 million is being provided for the formalisation of informal settlements, to ensure better access to basic amenities. A further $5.5 million is allocated for continuation of the First Home Buyers Grant and a total of 295 applicants will be assisted through that initiative. To support the Housing Authority in its residential lot development in Valelevu, $7.9 million has been allocated for that. Even the Veikoba Bridge that came up during our Budget debate and Koroipita Model Town Grant for Habitat for Humanity, as well as subsidised assistance for the Public Rental Board. All these increases, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are made possible because the Government is prepared to guarantee the loan to Housing Authority to be able to carry out its functions of providing affordable housing to our low and middle income earners and continue to improve the social development of the people of Fiji, particularly those who are moving out from the rural areas and outlying islands to the urban areas. I support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1351 MR. SPEAKER.- As you alluded, we are proud to be part of the Raiwai-Raiwaqa area and we will never forget that. Honourable Rayalu is sitting here and even the former Member of Parliament, Mr. Rasova, is sitting in the gallery. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion before Parliament and at the outset, I would like to say that I support this motion. The importance of this motion has been so eloquently articulated by the honourable Prime Minister, that is, the importance of housing and the impact it has on people in life. I did not support the motion before on the Consequential Bills because there are some things there that I was not fully supportive of, but this one, I most definitely support it entirely, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I just wanted to make that clear. As I have said before in my speech the other day, I will support the things that I believe are in the best interest of this country according to the basis of my own convictions. As has been articulated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the advent of the Housing Authority back in the 1950s has been a major cause for transformation in the lives of many people of this country. It has made a huge transformative change when it is able to address the needs of those for whom it was designed. People have struggled to come across to Suva around the urban areas, they have struggled to find places to live in, and that has been expressed here. People have been brought up in Raiwaqa, we were also brought up in settlements around Fiji, and there has always been this aspiration. When you live in a settlement, you never think that one day you will live in a concrete house, or that one day you will own a car. That is, sort of, like beyond the horizon for you. So, the advent of the Housing Authority and the opportunities that it provided, allowed people to get something that they never really dreamed that they would get. So, I think it has a made a huge transformative change. That is why it is necessary to support it, and I am glad to see that this modus operandi that we have, that we establish entities that are able then to be self-sufficient and we can then provide them with the guarantee for them to get their funding to do their work, is a great way of doing things. As has been expressed by my compatriot, the honourable Premila Kumar, it frees up Government from the shackles of having to provide the financing for these operations. But I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important also for me to think about it. One of the most fundamental components of a good quality of life is for a person to have their own home. There are a lot of other things when you talk about the quality of life that you can talk about things, like wealth and employment, things like physical and mental health, and I think a home on its own, having your own home that is safe, also contributes to your mental health. When someone has that sort of feeling, the effect on productivity in this country can be exploded, it can be a catalyst - having your own home, feeling safe and secure and feeling comfortable. You know all the pressure that may impact on you psychologically have been eliminated, and it gives you that safe space. I think housing is something that contributes to the quality of life but also to growth, productivity. I was listening to the comments by the former Minister for Housing, she was talking about the fact that now with the current management that we have in Housing Authority and listening to the figures by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, it looks like they are hitting their financial targets well. It is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as you are hitting your financial targets to balance because there will always be a balance between these two things - hitting your financial targets and making sure you remain true to the vision of the entity, that is, to assist those who have low income and middle income. One of the speeches in Parliament this week has been talking about Housing Authority in the past that sometimes has made available land for people and eventually that has become rental castles</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1352 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 for the rich. So, there is this important element of the balance between making sure you hit your financial targets and be effective and effectiveness means providing the value to those for whom Housing Authority was designed - those at the lower and middle income. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have had the privilege of serving as the Minister for a number of years and it always hurt me greatly to see that civil servants were living in squatter settlements. I think this is a huge challenge for us. The advent of the Housing Authority, as I have said, has been something that has had a transformative impact on the people of this country. We need to make sure that it maintains that, that it continues to provide services for the people that really need it. It must be self- sufficient economically, but it must remain committed to that course. I think the importance for good governance, fit for purpose management, fit for purpose directors, fit for purpose people at all levels of the organisation, will allow us to ensure to move in that direction. I am not going to speak for too long. As I have said, I support this motion wholeheartedly for the benefit of the low and middle income earners in this country. MR. SPEAKER.- Is the Housing Authority still under the Public Enterprises too? The core interest of Housing Authority under the Housing Authority Act and under the Public Enterprises Act is affordable housing and the bottom line is profit, so that is, kind of, conflicting each other. I hope that has been taken care of. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion before Parliament and I must thank all the previous speakers who have fully supported the motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, housing remains a critical issue in Fiji because it affects countless individual families and increase in land and house prices make it a challenge for ordinary Fijian households in accessing affordable and adequate housing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are pleased to see and note that Housing Authority develops residential lots accessible to the Fijian people, hence assisting in the provision of affordable housing. As alluded to earlier by the previous speaker, the Housing Authority was established under the Housing Act 1955, with the principal mandatory objective of providing decent and affordable housing to low and middle income earners around our country. The Authority’s mission is to continue to assist families with household income of below $50,000, while it also offers concessional loan packages to those families earning below $30,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the housing market segment is exposed to changing economic cycles, affecting individual customers or other risks that might affect customers who are servicing their loan at Housing Authority. While Housing Authority manages risk concentrations, the Government provides support through social debt relief policy scheme, to ensure that those financially distressed customers - those customers who are facing financial hardships and could not afford to maintain or repay their loans, maintain their properties, thereby creating security and resilience within their families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is one scheme that was introduced by the Housing Authority way back in 2011 and this scheme is known as Debt Relief Scheme, which was part of the Social Housing Policy of the Authority, to assist Housing Authority customers who are facing financial difficulties in servicing or repaying their loans. From 2011 to-date, a total of $4.89 million as housing assistance grant had been given to Housing Authority to assist these customers in paying off their loans, as well as maintaining their houses.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1353 There are a lot of success stories about this initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I remember when I was in Housing Authority, there was this retiree, who was just mourning the passing of his wife and the officers from Housing Authority went and served him a letter, telling him that his loan has been forgiven by Housing Authority. And you know what he told the officers from Housing Authority, “this is one of the best messages that he has received in his entire life.” Under this Debt Relief Scheme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it can only be given to those who have retired and could not afford to repay their loans to the Authority, as well as those who are proven to be medically unfit and have lost employment, as well as those who are proven to be mentally and physically disabled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Housing Authority has provided security through Government guarantee of $150 million since 2008 for a period of five-year circle. This funding is utilised to fund the development of land, production of fully serviced lots, construction of houses, and undertake various social and housing projects. Since 2008, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Authority has managed to deliver 2,661 lots in the Central, Northern and Western Divisions. A total of $304.46 million was utilised since the inception of the five-year cycle Government guarantee, while borrowing was kept at $150 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the demand for affordable and quality lots has increased over the years. This is evident and also shown in the number of applications that were received by Housing Authority through expressions of interest received for new subdivisions at Covata in Labasa and at Makosoi Subdivision in Deuba, Pacific harbour. For Covata, having developed 100 lots and Makosoi with only 34 lots, the Authority received a total of 261 expressions of interest for the Covata Subdivision and 185 expressions of interest for the Makosoi Subdivision at Deuba. That speaks volume of the demand that are out there, people who are looking for housing around our country. The approval of this Government guarantee with an amount of $150 million for the next five years from July 2024 to June 2029, will support the Government in providing access to affordable and adequate housing, breaking barriers and affecting affordability. In addition, this will ensure that the Authority have easy access to the Reserve Bank of Fiji housing facility with a concessional interest rate of 0.25 percent and secure concessional loan and reduce the cost of borrowing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also take this time to thank the CEO, as well as the Management and staff of Housing Authority for serving the people of Fiji. As alluded to earlier by honourable Premila Kumar, there were some shortfalls in terms of lot allocation policy, but the Authority has learnt and now has developed a very transparent and a very healthy housing policy. It is also not only to affect only certain individuals but is also going to ensure that the people of Fiji and the clientele that Housing Authority is mandated to serve are well served in the revised housing policy that has been currently developed by Housing Authority. Government needs to continue to support Housing Authority, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because housing is a basic need and through our assistance, through the provision of this Government guarantee, it is going to support the Authority in the delivery of its future projects which it is aiming to do just for the provision of housing to the people who are middle income earners as well as low- income earners around the country. I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity and I fully support the motion before Parliament.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1354 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to also contribute to the motion by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics on the renewal of the Government guarantee of $150 million for the Housing Authority’s borrowings for the next five years and, of course, also for the Housing Authority to pay a guarantee fee of 0.5 percent on the cumulative utilised guarantee credit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by my colleagues on this side, we do offer our support on the motion before the floor because of the importance of the services that Housing Authority provides from long ago and still continuing today. I do wish to join the honourable Prime Minister in acknowledging the past leaders because it is quite interesting and fascinating as well to see how this has progressed over the years, from 1955 when the Act was established and then it came to being in 1958 (if I remember correctly) but, perhaps, the big change, Sir, was in 1996 that you were alluding to when it was decided that Housing Authority be declared a Commercial Statutory Authority (CSA) and is also required to provide returns to Government. This is probably one of the CSA’s that we are still providing guarantee to and, hopefully, that one day they will graduate out of it and join the others that have done quite well in terms of their financial performance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, going back to their role as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, the honourable Prime Minister and all honourable Members who have spoken before me, the initial vision of providing affordable housing. I was the one that raised in my contribution to the Budget debate, Sir, based on some of the previous projects, I raised the question about affordability - how affordable is affordable? Particularly, those who were supposed to be beneficiaries out of this were not able to get access just because of the high cost involved. As a result, probably those on the higher echelons, those that are better off, again, get the privilege to enjoy what is provided but, at the same time, denying the very people that we were supposed to assist through the project. Again, also, I note with interest how they have also changed in terms of strategies, marketing probably, Sir, based on the needs and, of course, the environmental and climatic conditions, and economically as well, because initially the Authority began operations with the development of rental flats. They then progressed into the development of lots, designing and building of homes. Then they shifted, Sir, to designing and building of homes to concentrate on the production of land lots and the provision of financing. This is interesting as we look at where our Housing Authority started and where it is today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Rather than repeating what has been stated by the previous honourable Members who have spoken, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, perhaps, just wish to concentrate because reading back on a few Reports years back, and I thankful to the honourable Minister for providing us with the current financial position or the latest position because I did not have access to that, but I went back a few years and, particularly, the recommendations by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to the Management. Probably, that is something that they still need to make sure that they maintain that focus, as alluded to by honourable Usamate. It is one thing is to have profits but particularly in the corporate world, they talk about the double responsibility of gaining profits, and at the same time, ensuring that their social responsibility still continues. That is why it is important that they remain true to the vision of the entity. Probably two things from those previous reports, and I am thankful to the new CEO and his team. One was, the Authority should review its lending policies and practices to minimise the level of non-performing loans. I know that this is very, very important for Housing Authority and we always continue to emphasise the need for us to have fit for purpose members in the Board, likewise</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1355 in the Management because in the end, although we are providing this financial assistance, hopefully, they can be able to sustain their own operations, even provide some of the returns to Government and, at the same time, sustain in the long term, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the importance of the performance of Housing Authority in as far as loan is concerned because the regular monitoring and review of loan accounts is pivotal for an entity such as the Authority, whose financial standing relies considerably on loan repayments. I hope that this is something that we can expect from the current management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing that I also wish to state here is the role of oversight and scrutiny. We have discussed this during the Budget week. We are giving taxpayers’ funds to the various agencies. That is good, but this Parliament also has a responsibility in terms of oversight and scrutiny. Let us not only leave it to the existing agencies - Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I mean, and other enforcement agencies, like FICAC and others, that should be the last resort. I am urging this august Parliament, through your leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are beginning to strengthen and enhance these mechanisms so that we can ensure in terms of our democracy and good governance principles, it is not only something that is on paper, but it is practice. This Parliament, hopefully, should also be in a better position to scrutinise and have oversight over these public funds because we have talked about implementation. We are giving the money, and it is more output-focused rather than outcome-focused. It is the responsibility of this Parliament in terms of scrutiny and oversight that we also share in this because that will be good for Fiji in terms of our democratic principles, governance, et cetera. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on risk assessments. Honourable Minister, Sir, it is not only on financial risk assessments, I also wish to speak from resilient cities, resilient settlements, wearing the climate change hat and, of course, disaster management under the Sendai Framework. Unfortunately, for some of our housing projects that were done previously, the risk assessments were not done properly. That becomes a burden to Local Government, NDMO and other agencies in terms of responding during disasters. You would know the Naodamu Housing in Labasa, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Now, I see the two honourable Ministers, whenever I mention something about Vanua Levu, they always giggle on the side. I still have Tailevu at heart, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- We are proud of your connections, Sir. (Laughter) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, risk assessments are very, very critical because in the climate space, resilience cities is very, very critical for our macro-economic performance, and most importantly, for the wellbeing and safety of our people. Sometimes, we compromise risks just for the sake of getting the project to go ahead but, in the long term, we also suffer. I would urge Government and all those responsible, we must do proper risk assessments, not only financial risk assessment but most importantly the physical risks as well, whether those risks can be reduced, mitigated, transferred or we live with and manage those risks, that is the big question, Sir, because it is important for us in the long term. Thank you, Sir, that is my contribution and I fully support the motion. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, of course, I rise in total support of the motion tabled by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning,</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1356 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 National Development and Statistics, on the extension of the $150 million guarantee for the Housing Authority. Sir, I know that I am standing between everyone and lunch but, perhaps, if I may be allowed just to pick up on a couple of points, first, I am a bit of a history junky, also, the symbolism of the last few days in accordance with what we are doing with the housing guarantee and, perhaps, just touch a bit on what we are trying to do in terms of economic diversification, relative to housing, Sir. Firstly, Sir, as I stand now, we are 567 days or one year six months and nineteen days into your Government service. Yesterday, in case Parliament did not realise, we did pass our second Budget of your Government, Sir, and that is an immense signal to the whole of Fiji, that we have delivered on the Budget, but more importantly, Sir, we have delivered on stability, security and sustainability for the new Fiji. That has to be made known to everyone, including those listening in today. I would like to credit, you, Sir, for your leadership over the last few days and also, to the honourable Prime Minister, for his leadership, that has brought us here today to this very significant historical occasion. I thought I just share that with the rest of Parliament. Secondly, in the spirit of talking about housing, I am reminded fondly about the Bible verse of Mathew 7: 24-27 on the house and how you build a house - building a house on sand and what that means. Sir, my challenge to everyone here today in the spirit of symbolism, what type of house do we want to build in the new Fiji? I challenge all of us - what type of house do we want to build in the new Fiji? Ten brothers on the other side have come across. Sir, we have some major significant issues in front of us. So, I want to challenge everyone today in the spirit of what we are doing with the Housing guarantee, what type of house do we want to build in Fiji?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- You make sure you build the right house:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Finally, Sir, we have an opportunity. Honourable Usamate, totally miss the point. He said to me, “you make sure you build the right kind of house”. No, honourable Member. What I am urging is all of us together, we build this new house for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just thought I just share that as well. It is just a challenge to all of us. We have been here for one year and 6 months and there is not much long to go before we start fighting elections again, but the question we need to ask ourselves is, what do we do as people? We have all been sent here by the people of Fiji and we really need to work together to solve some of the critical issues that lie in front of us. Sir, finally, of course, in support of this motion, I cannot help but make a jab at the other side of Parliament, I know honourable Premila Kumar talked about PPP, but when we talked about PPPs, I get very scared, Sir. It reminds me of the ASPEN situation, Sir. That is their legacy in terms of PPPs in this country, and they can duck and weave, Sir, but the PPP for ASPEN will hang over their heads as one of their things that they need to own. I would like to assure the other side of Parliament that we have learnt from their first venture, if you like, Sir, into PPPs, and we will do our best to make sure that we never repeat the type of incident that has come across through the disclosures by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 1357 Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Planning and Development in terms of PPPs in this country. We actually need to fix it because from an international community, probably they do not realise this, Sir, at the moment we do not have a good reputation when it comes to PPPs because of the ASPEN situation. So, we need to work together to actually try and fix this perception about PPPs. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Planning and Development has advised that we will be getting closer on the IFC exercise that is currently underway and that is positive, Sir. Finally, because I am wearing my hat as the Minister for Trade, there was talk about economic diversification from the other side. One of the key things to unlocking diversification or the economic activity in Fiji is to begin with the housing construction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have seen the signal has gone with the prefabricated equipment. We have seen in Investment Fiji an increased interest from developers to start their own housing project. I just got an email from one particular investor just now, saying that he wants to talk more, to make sure that he gets going in terms of his own development with the landowners. HON. J. USAMATE.- Too much talk! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Too much talanoa! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- There is a massive opportunity in front of this country in terms of developing the housing sector. We, on this side of Parliament, intend to actually do something about the housing problem. I am told that at the moment, we have a housing shortage of about 7,000 homes. That side of Parliament, Sir, did nothing about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally support the motion before Parliament. Housing Authority will be a fundamental agency when this side of Parliament actually executes on something they could not do, and we look forward to their support as we try and resolve some of the massive problems that we have inherited. I thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They are full of politics and have nothing to share:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning and National Planning and Development to speak in reply. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications and all honourable Members, including the honourable Minister for Housing who have spoken on this motion, and I thank all of them for their support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to prolong this anymore, I just want to thank everyone again. In fact, honourable Premila Kumar did say some really good things today, and the honourable Leader of the Opposition also alluded to that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of the day, the financial model that we have to get in order for Housing Authority to lead the massive task of providing affordable housing to so many people in our country. As I have said before, this is a national issue, it is part of our National Development Plan, there is quite a bit of focus on it and I think both, honourable Kumar and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, did talk about the role of the Housing Authority. I agree with them that the Housing Authority, as a good entity supported by the Government in terms of guarantee, Sir, will have to take</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1358 Government Guarantee – Housing Authority of Fiji 12 th July, 2024 a much more aggressive role, not only in terms of its management, in terms of its ability to open up more land and provide land titling for lots as quickly as possible. I know the honourable Prime Minister once mentioned to me this famous Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, and the philosophy behind what he tried to do. I think the honourable Prime Minister was right, and honourable Usamate alluded to this. When people own a piece of land or a house, it gives them the confidence, it improves capital investment, it creates economic activities, and it helps not only their own personal security in terms of where they live and how they live but also it is a big contribution to the economy. The other point that I want to make and perhaps, the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government could look at that, I think some of our bylaws and regulations are too complicated and sometimes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it adds to significant cost and that is why the whole financial model just goes out of the window. Then Housing Authority, as honourable Kumar pointed out, gets into its financial model looking at the bottom line, so instead of selling those lots to people in the low income category, they have to make money by selling it to those on the high income side. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PPP model that we are looking at, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications is absolutely right, if we do not get the financial model right because not everyone in that model or strata housing strategy will be able to afford to buy even a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom unit. Therefore, part of the Government’s policy there within that financial model is that the Government will provide subsidy and the subsidy will be based on a means test, the lower the household income, the higher the subsidy. Those who are on a higher income, the subsidies will be lower. So that is something that the Government has already committed. The big issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that urban centres are getting crowded. The honourable Minister for Education talked about schools being overcrowded and it is partly because the expectation of people when they move into the urban areas, that they will have better prospects - better education, better homes, and the expectation of what happens in the future determines what happens today. So, people move with the expectation, with the probability that this will be, and that over the last 10 year to 15 years or more, it has caused people to move in a rapid rate. When they move, they find that these things are not available. I appreciate all the points that the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and everyone else made. Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Members for their support, and I commend the motion to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch and when we return we will try and complete all the remaining items that are still part of today’s agenda, that is, the Reports from the various Committees and just a few more before we finish off today’s programme in today’s Order Paper. HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA.- Sorry, Sir, I did not realise you heard me. Honourable Members around my corner were asking if we could just continue and finish the presentation of documents and reports.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>12 th July, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1359 MR.
