<body><h3>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 6.</h3><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 6.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, a question on number 6 - Grant to Professional Bodies. There is grants to the Fiji Indigenous Business Council, Fiji Architects Association and Fiji</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>1318 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 Institute of Chartered Accountants. Is this based on application or is this based on some sort of plan by Government of whom to assist? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is based on submissions by these professional bodies and we have considered this carefully. We feel that the Indigenous Business Council, for example, was defunct for many years and they have regrouped, had a very successful conference where the honourable Prime Ministers and all the Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers were there. We really wanted to support the secretariat, grant to professional bodies such as Fiji Architects Association again was defunct. They do, as a professional body contribute towards a lot of the activities that the Government wants to do in terms of improving legislations, policies and so we felt that we should provide this additional funding to them. Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants in the past have been helping governments to go a lot of things, so we considered that and that is why that allocation is there, based on their submission. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 6(2) – Provision of banking services for non-economical rural areas ($700,000) is allocated for that. I am just wondering which banks are receiving or will receive, how is this money given out to the banks and which banks were given money last year? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- So, really this allocation, honourable Kumar is for subsidy to the Bank of the South Pacific for the provision of rural banking services, and BSP has been in partnership with Post Fiji. Essentially it ensures the rural communities have access to banking services. The Government pays a subsidy of $3.52 on every transaction that is processed by BSP, by Post Offices and postal agencies, including electronic withdrawals and deposits. So, with the new tender, the price may change and other service providers may come on board with effect from 1st October, 2024, depending on what the tender Board decides. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you for your response, honourable Minister. Mr. Chairman, a bit of a concern, considering the banks that we have in our country and the amount of profits they are making with just less than a million people in this country, it is exorbitant and we do expect some level of social responsibility from the banks as well. I just wanted to make this comment. Thank you. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Yes, I think you have a point and we have said to the banks, for example, the banks wanted to move very quickly on phasing out cheques, we have said that they should hold on to it, and they have agreed. As I announced in the Budget Address, for the first time, people like yourselves in the past as Consumer Council Head, have been calling for the appointment of a Banking Ombudsman and that is something we, as a Government, are going to do. So, on average, just to go back on this, 200,000 transactions are processed, including about 99 percent for electronic transactions and 1 percent manual transactions for our rural communities. It is an important service, but you are right, the banks ought to have some social responsibility as well in delivering some of these. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7, Activity 9 - Fiji Cyclone Recovery Programme (DFAT) ($15,000,000), there was a similar allocation last year, but more than this, it was $30 million. I also noted very lately that honourable Minister and the honourable Minister for Education were part of the ceremony on a new social infrastructure programme. My question is, whether this $15 million is a separate allocation from the new social infrastructure programme? If it is a cyclone recovery allocation, is it meant as a sort of stand by for future cyclones, or is it for TC</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1319 Yasa recovery and rehabilitation that is also continuing, particularly in the schools in Vanua Levu? If the honourable Minister can clarify, please? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You are right, honourable Leader of the Opposition, recovery means recovery after cyclone. This is direct funding agreement with the Australian Government which is fully funded. Through this arrangement, the Australian Government has provided AU$37.38 million, which is equivalent to about FJ$57 million for the programme, through which, a sum of $52.54 million has been received in RBF Consolidated Fund Account. So, the programme actually includes the rehabilitation of nine schools namely: (1) Lekutu Secondary School; (2) Lekutu District School; (3) Nukubolu Primary School; (4) Maramarua District School; (5) Dreketi District School; (6) Bua District School; (7) Dama District School; (8) Wailevu West District School; (9) (10) Ratu Luke Memorial School; and two health facilities, namely, Taveuni and Kadavu. So, to date, seven of the nine schools have been completed with the final two schools, both Lekutu Primary and Secondary Schools, is due to be finished probably by the end of this month. The next phase of the programme is delivering infrastructure upgrades at Taveuni Hospital and Kadavu Hospital. That is the description of the projects so far. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question, please. I know that Nukubolu was not initially in the list, but they approached. When we went through the list of schools, if I may just say, Sir, that Muanidevo Primary School had their two school blocks destroyed, but it was not in that list as well. There were discussions between the AMU of the Ministry of Education. If there is funding, if Muanidevo School can be considered? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think people have already got there so Muanidevo Primary School would be included. Mr. Chairman, Nukubolu, I was there at the opening of the facilities, it is a fantastic facility. The people were really grateful that they now have all new classrooms and all other facilities including washrooms, et cetera. This has been a very good project, very well received by schools and communities around those areas. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Public Private Partnership for Health - $90 million. I suppose this is the payment to ASPEN.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- Thank you:</span> So, during the Budget Speech the honourable Minister said that Government is paying $10 million per month. So, there is $30 million less. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You are right, as I have said very clearly and that is why I spent a bit of time in the Budget Speech to put on record what happened with respect to the Public Private Partnership. When the hospital both, Ba and Lautoka Hospitals were handed before the</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>1320 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 conditions, were met by the concessionaire. So, the cost was never a factor in the handing over of the Hospitals. What we have found is that the cost just escalated, the services have escalated and the estimate now is about $10 million per month. On a positive note, we have already started negotiations with the help of IFC, FNPF which was forced into the project under HCF which is the company that manages, in which FNPF has 80 percent share and ASPEN Medical which run the hospital has 20 percent. We are hoping that in the next three months to six months, we will have a new agreement and we are expecting the cost to come down. So, that is the expectation in terms of the allocation. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, we move on. SEG 10? HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, SEG 10 - Northern Division Projects, can you elaborate on that, please. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- There are quite a few items so let me just go to it. You are going very fast, honourable Lal. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Your horse is too fast. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am coming to that. You went right to the end. So, that is $1.9 million and, Mr. Chairman, Sir, can we go on to the rest and I will come back to answer honourable Ketan Lal’s question. In the meantime, you can go on with your second question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, Activity 4 – Graduate Business Start Up Grant -</p><p>$300,000. Can you elaborate on that, please? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is a new allocation and it will be distributed through the FCEF and students who come out from universities in their final year would be able to apply for this $10,000 grant to be able to start. The Northern Development Programme is actually FDB subsidy for projects there. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on the Graduate Business Start Up Grant again, so this will apply to current students who are in the university or it can go back to the previous years as well?. Just like how the TELS was wiped out? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is for new graduates, those coming out of the university. The idea is that they can choose whether they want to go into employment or they could go straight into a business enterprise and become self-employed and do other things. And $300,000 will be distributed through the TELS programme. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG10 - Item 4 and I have two questions related to this. The first question is on Merit Based Skills Qualification. What is the rationale for increasing the budget from $5.4 million to $7 million when only $3.3 million was utilised in the last 11 months? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The expectation is that some of the new students, for example, before, those who paid themselves to do Foundation Studies at universities privately, were not eligible for scholarships. So, we are still not funding Foundation because we do not want people to just go to universities and universities would try and attract them, but if they finish Foundation by paying themselves they would be eligible for TELS scholarships as well.</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1321 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- So, honourable Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Planning and Development, you still have not answered my question. You are just anticipating that the number will go up.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- But my concern is the amount that was allocated was not used:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> That is true, so the assessment that TELS does is that, “Alright, we are allocating this much for this many students in this particular category”, but every year, and it has happened in the past even with loan schemes where you have certain allocations but not all of it is used if the students choose to go into something else. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Yes, I do not agree with you but I will go along with that. Why I do not agree with you, normally, when you do your budgeting if someone is not using the money, you try and reduce as we have heard from other Ministers, but here, utilisation is low but still the money is allocated. Now, my second question is on the Hardship Assistance allocation which is $7.7 million for the next financial year. Again, it was not used at all in the last 11 months, and we can see that $5.9 million is allocated. If you can explain to us, what could have been the reasons that this money was not used? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You can see that there is a decrease in the allocation from last year. It is possible that a lot of students who had already been in the programme continued with the programme, paying themselves without utilising the Hardship allocation. This scheme really is to assist private students doing degree programmes, from second year onwards, with an academic achievement of about 65 percent GPA. Obviously, they will be bonded and students who do not have a combined parental income and business network of more than $100,000 unless allowed by means testing, so the scheme is expected to assist filling in gaps in the labour market. The scheme will have about 2,600 awards and 250 is, kind of, ring-fenced for MBBS because sometimes students meet the mark criteria and because the number allocated for MBBS, because of the capacity in the institution themselves, they are not able to get so. You come from the top then there is a cut-off mark, but some also get an entry; although they do not get a scholarship. And they go pay themselves, and then second year they can apply for that. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister, I understood the bit you have said but my question was simply on the basis that this money was not utilised and yet, substantial amount has been allocated. That is all. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You can argue until the crows come home about why we are allocating this. It is not like in other Ministries where you see the capacity, if they are not utilised, but this is the allocation based on the number of students who would come out of Form 7, Form 6, who would go into foundation and if you do not allocate it, if you do not use it, then it is alright, but the allocation is there if these students come up, so it is a budget. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, SEG-10 on item 10 as well just on the Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project. I am sorry, honourable Minister, I missed this last year in the budget discussion. There was an allocation of $3 million and you have another allocation of $1 million. My simple question is this the continuation of the flood alleviation which involves the construction of retention dams in the tributaries that is in Nadi or are we using this as part of our contribution in the</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>1322 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 work that JICA is also looking at in terms of the Nadi River Realignment. I just wanted clarification on that, Sir. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition, you are right, it is part of that big project - the Nadi River Basin Project. It has not moved too much over the years. The Australian Government and the Japanese Government are now pushing ahead, despite some delays and we are funding that effort through a renewed mix of funding commitments from the Japanese and the Australian Governments, along with $5 million Government funding. Discussions will also be held with the World Bank to gauge their interest in the project funding. So, flood mitigation in the Nadi River Basin is really essential to the tourism sector and this is something that has been there for many years. The proposed structural measures are to provide protection to the Nadi River Basin area against one in a fifty-year flood event kind of thinking. The Ministry of Finance will be working closely with all stakeholders to finalise the components and solutions for Part B of the Nadi River Project. This allocation is really to provide Government the resources and the ability to move ahead with negotiations and get the project going. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 10 No. 4 – Apprenticeship - $1 million. What is that thing for? It is for wages or fees and how do employers access that money? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- There will be a number of components with the Apprenticeship Programme. Essentially as you said earlier in your contribution that to revamp and incentivise the whole Apprenticeship Scheme, we are going to allocate 400 awards to pay 50 percent tuition fees or add $2 an hour as a top-up to the Minimum Wage rate paid by employers under the scheme. The number of awards in this financial year has been increased from 400 to 500 given more interest for employers and students. This is a very targeted attempt towards our unemployed youths, adults, early school leavers, those who fall by the side, for 150 hours to 160 hours of competency- based training after which they can obtain some form of employment. Again, TELS will pay 50 percent of the tuition fees to encourage employers to pay the Apprenticeship students attractive wages, to offset expenses or add $2 an hour to their Apprenticeship wages. Again, in addition to that, there will be a phase out of industrial attachment allowance. This scheme was for providing allowance of $100 per month for maximum of six months for students. We are either doing industrial attachments or clinical attachments. Majority in the attachment are now part of the programme and essentially coded uni such as students who receive the normal allowance except for a few programmes which require books to be filled for eligible graduation. So, a sum of $330,000 has been utilised in the current year as of 11th July. People are beginning to understand the Apprenticeship Scheme again. There is much more knowledge and advocacy now from the employers themselves or the value of this programme and Government is putting or playing its part by including this as part of our scholarship programme. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on Head 50 – Miscellaneous Service. Question put. Head 50 agreed to. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, please take note that Heads 51 and 52 are Standing Appropriations or below the line Appropriation. Head 51 lists all the pensions that are payable and these are a charged on the Government finances.
