<body><h3>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 5.</h3><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 5.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, SEG 5(5) and (6) Public Service Broadcast (TV) and Public Service Broadcast (Radio). Is the Government continuing to engage FBC on this or any other service providers? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-So, the idea for us as a Government is that we want to create a level playing field and part of the reason why it is in Head 50 is that we are going to take a decision on a policy where we can use other broadcasters as well, based on our need and the cost that would be determined as part of proper tender and expressions of interest.</p></body>
