<body><h3>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 3?</h3><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- SEG 3?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> I have a question on SEG 3(3) on Official Overseas Travel Cost. Just a question whether this is the only cost or some amounts are also in different ministries for their ministerial travel? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is a pool allocation which caters for air fare cost and per diem allowances for Ministers and Assistant Ministers travelling abroad for official duties. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is not answered. Is this the only amount or travel is also included in each Ministry head? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- There is travel in ministry head but for overseas travel, it is from Head 50. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Why I am asking because I recall asking this question to the honourable Minister for Education when the travel vote increased by $450,000 and he also said that it was for the overseas visits by the honourable Minister as well as by the officials. So, I just wanted that clarification.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is overseas travel for Ministers:</span></p></body>
