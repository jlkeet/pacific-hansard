<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now resolve into Committee of Supply to resume debate on the Heads in the Budget Estimates. In Committee: Head 22 – Ministry of Health and Medical Services MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, before I ask my question to the honourable Minister for Health, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration. There was a break-in at the Baulevu High School on Tuesday night in the Science Laboratory. Unfortunately, the police did not appear until 11.30 a.m. When I texted the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, just 25 minutes after talking to him, the police was there. Thank you, honourable Minister, for your prompt response. Just letting you know that spirits and about more than two dozen testubes have been lost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- What is the half dozen and two dozen? What is that for?</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1243 HON. V. NATH.- More than two dozen testubes from the science laboratory at Baulevu High School and I happen to be the Manager of the school. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I thought you were referring to some bottles or something. HON. V. NATH.- Testtubes and spirits had gone missing. I want to thank the honourable Minister for Home Affairs for his prompt address. Coming back to the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services on Head 22, given that any government’s priority is infrastructure, education, health and we understand… HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Which SEG? HON. V. NATH.- Head 22. I am talking about the Head; no programme. I have seen that there is a decrease in the overall Head. (Chorus of interjections) MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is the first time that someone is concentrating on the wholesome figure for the Ministry, but I thought we would dive straight into the SEGs and the Activities, et cetera, but you want to begin yours with the overall. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, no just on the Head, there is a huge decrease. If you look at staff establishment, there is a reduction and if you look at the overall budget of the Ministry, it has decreased by 26.382 per cent. Knowing any government, they will want to see the Ministry of Health well looked after. But here, we are seeing a decrease. I request the honourable Minister to explain the decrease. Staff establishment decreased by 10.663 percent travel and communication by 1.130 percent maintenance and operation, purchase of goods and services, special expenditures and capital construction and capital purchase 631.6 percent. That is my only question, honourable Minister. Can you explain these decreases? MR. CHAIRMAN.- I will refer your question honourable Nath to the honourable Minister for Finance because that is where they do the cutting of the cloth. When you want your coat to measure to size but it depends on the cloth available.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- I request the honourable Minister to answer:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> I understand you want the honourable Minister to answer it, but I will refer your question to the honourable Minister for Finance. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member knows what we said during the Budget Debate. Last year we increased the budget for the Ministry of Health from $339 million to $453 million. I do not know where he is getting this $26 million in this year’s budget, there is a slight reduction of only $2 million. It is not a reduction of $26 million as he has pointed it out, I do not know where he is getting that figure. We have looked at the utilisation in the last year, Sir, in fact, what we have allocated for the Ministry of Health is still a huge increase from what was there before and a slight reduction of $2 million because of the utilisation particularly in the capital budget. The Health Ministry still gets the biggest increase from last year. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I refer to Programme 1-1(6) and this is with respect to the Grant to NGOs. I see there is a substantial increase from $900,000 up to $1.6 million, just a little explanation if I could upon that particular increase?</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1244 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Koya for his query with regards to Programme 1-1(6) on the Grant to NGOs. As you would have known, this grant to NGOs in this financial year was allocated to are few NGOs namely Fiji Cancer Society, Empower Pacific, and are few others probably five. For this financial year, we have noted an increase in request for funding through NGOs. What the NGO does is fill in the gaps whereby the Ministry’s work is very much needed. For this year, we are also expecting WOWS Kids Fiji to come on board and also apply to get into this fund. The funding is done through an EOI process. At the moment, we have five NGOs, I can give you the names of the current NGOs in this financial year but for this Budget, we are expecting more NGOs that will want to come on board and have a piece of these funds so that they can assist the Ministry in doing their work. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 1-1(8) – Upgrade and Enhancement of Labasa Hospital (Interior) - $5.1 million. From the $5 million allocated for the upgrade of Labasa Hospital, less than a million dollar was used, that is, 16 percent of the budget. According to the information which is posted on the Parliament website, can the honourable Minister explain why? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, in terms of the utilisation in Labasa Hospital, what the contractors faced was the electrical issues. Because of the electricity capacity within Labasa Hospital, most of the capital projects in terms of the refurbishment of the A&amp;E was put on hold. We currently have new machines in the Labasa Hospital such as CT Scan and laboratory equipment but due to the capacity of the electrical supply within Labasa Hospital, that cannot cater for the load of the new equipment. Together with that, the old wirings, that is why we brought EFL on board to do a whole survey of the hospital and give us a report. We should privatise the electrical work before they can commence with the completion of the work; that was the hold up in Labasa Hospital. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, on Head 22-1-1(5) – Outsourcing of Emergency Clinical Health Services, I noticed there was a reduction of $1 million from the last financial year. Seek clarification from the honourable Minister. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, for the outsourcing part, there is a reduction but because we are also improving our capacity within the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, we have improved our testing capabilities and other specialised areas. That is why there is a reduction, but we have used that as a backup should the need arise then we will fund. Should we exhaust this allocation, there is always an opportunity to source from within to ask for more. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, in fact I have two questions. One is on Programme1-1(5) and the other one is on Programme1-1(6). Shall I just do both questions as one, Sir? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Programme1-1(5) – Doctors Specialisation ($650,000). I just need clarification whether this is to do with further capacity development in order for our doctors to specialise in certain areas or where we lack such skills, we bring in the specialists? My other question is on the Sai Prema Foundation which is on SEG 6. I know that they were also given the same allocation, we appreciate the work that they are doing, particularly for our</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1245 children, not only Fijians, but from the region as well. My question to the honourable Minister is, whether this will be an annual allocation or this is just temporary? I know initially when Sai Prema Foundation Fiji was in the infancy stages, there were discussions about what they provide and what comes from the Government. Like I said, we appreciate the work that they are doing, but I have seen this allocation in both last year’s budget and this year’s, so I just wanted to know whether this will continue in the years to come or there will be some variations? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, for his first question on doctors specialisation, that allocation is for course fee payment of our medical officers pursuing Masters of Medicine Programme and Public Health through in-service training. That is that allocation for. It will be used to pay for the course fee for Semester 2, 2024, and the balance will be used to pay for the continuing students in 2025. Again, as always, an EOI will be called for the utilised space for those who are graduating at the end of the year. Mr. Chairman, as for the second question in terms of Sai Prema Foundation Fiji, this grant started last year. Yes, as alluded to by your good-self that they are doing a good work in terms of correcting congenital heart defects and also very much needed screening for our rheumatic heart disease patients. This allocation, as we speak, is to assist with the operational cost, as they are bringing in experienced doctors from overseas to perform this lifesaving surgery at free of charge here. At the moment, it is not only localised to Fiji, but also including other Pacific countries. In terms of answering your question, will it be a yearly thing, we are taking it early, it started last year and this year, it is divided into four disbursements. Based on their acquittals, then we will give them their balance so that has been the practice from last year and this year. Next year, Mr. Chairman, I do not know if it will still continue. Nevertheless, they are doing a good work in addressing some of the gaps within the Ministry in terms of the specialised area of correcting congenital cardiac defects. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will begin from the back again.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, it has already been asked by honourable Kumar.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, firstly, I just would like to thank the honourable Minister for the big job done at the Savusavu Hospital, all the refurbishment works, maintenance and repairs that have been going for the past few years. I am getting the feedback from the people of Savusavu that they really appreciate the Government’s effort in trying to fix the Savusavu Hospital. From the books that I have here with me from last year, you were given $250,000 for refurbishment work and again for this year, we have another $200,000 for the same purpose (refurbishment) in SEG 8. It is coming back this year on this Budget for another $200,000 for the refurbishment work at Savusavu. I just need a bit of clarification on the kind of work. Is that to complete the same kind of work that you are doing, or are there some other new refurbishment works and repairs et cetera coming up? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank honourable Tuinaceva for his query on the refurbishment of Savusavu Hospital of $200,000. He is correct in saying that that has been an ongoing allocation from previous year’s budget up until now, it is to do with a good amount of capital works within Savusavu Hospital as you are all aware of in terms of the surrounding and the landscape. There was some degree of landslide there so for this allocation, it is an ongoing one and supposedly to be for the Divisional Engineer Western, for sewer line re-alignment which was approved by the Ministry of Finance, contract documents were signed with the Ministry of Public</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1246 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 Works and again we are waiting the new financial year to transfer funds to the Divisional Engineer Northern to confirm the commencement of work. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr, Chairman, let us go to Levuka from Savusavu. The Levuka Hospital was destroyed by fire and I do not see any allocation for the construction of the hospital that was destroyed by fire unless it is in SEG 8 on the Upgrade and Enhancement of Sub-Divisional Hospitals but it is not mentioned, just a clarification on that, Mr. Chairman. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, with regards to Levuka Hospital after a part of the old hospital was damaged by the fire together with the infrastructure that was housing the mortuary. The area where the old hospital which was damaged, that was condemned, that was one-third of the hospital. The other two-thirds, when I visited last year and this year, I was told that the base of the hospital is still intact and they are able to, if we can maintain it then it will be for good use but in terms of the infrastructure which was housing the mortuary and that area of the old hospital which was condemned, as we speak, we have some donors who stand readily available to assist the Government in improving that part of the infrastructure. If you prioritize it, it is way low down because that part of the old hospital, the better half of the two-thirds of it, that is currently being housing our Environment Health Officers while the mortuary part, we will have to deal with it and see how we can build the infrastructure and put in the new mortuary. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Just to clarify that further, it is included in SEG 8. It is not mentioned but it is part of it. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, supplementary. So if it is included, then the mortuary works is also included in that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Included:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, maybe we seek your direction, if we have more than one question, do we go one by one or do we ask all the questions at once on the same Activity? MR. CHAIRMAN. - I think we go one by one to allow the Minister to respond to it. Otherwise, it will be like yesterday.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.:</span> Yes, I noticed that.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Chairman, we noted the 0.4 percent decrease with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services’ budget. I also noted in the new budget book the items that were missing which we seek clarification from the honourable Minister for Finance whether it has moved to other Activities or Programmes. One is the Laundry Service, there was $1.3 million allocated in last year’s fiscal year, it is missing from this year and the Customer Relation Support (DFAT) - $84 million and the Community Health Worker Wages amounting to $3 million. It was in last year’s allocation under this Programme but is missing from this year’s Budget book. I just seek clarification whether it has moved to another Programme. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it has been decentralised to all the different cost-centres activities. So, if you look at all the other Programmes and Activities, you will find that we have moved to these cost-centres which is a better way of allocating so that expenditure is utilised in time and fully. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Thank you for that answer but I am not satisfied. I have gone through all the SEGs centres and it is not there, Mr. Chairman, Sir.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1247 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I will let the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services answer and then I will come back to you. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, start of with your Community Health Worker, you asked that question? I think it is in SEG 7, an amount of $3 million. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG 8 – Upgrade and Enhancement - Sub- Divisional Hospitals, Health Centres and Nursing Stations. I can see that $2.4 million is allocated this year. Last year the money was allocated, only 53 percent, that is around $1.2 million. Again, if the honourable Minister can explain to us why the funds given last year was not fully utilised and why do you need another $2.4 million? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank honourable Premila Kumar for her question. That is SEG 8 on the first one, upgrade… HON. P. D. KUMAR.- It is on Upgrade and Enhancement - Sub-Divisional Hospitals, Health Centres and Nursing Stations HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- We are requesting $500,000 for seed funding. We are doing seed funding for this financial year so in the upcoming financial year, we are able to execute the work. Seed funding preparatory works, we are doing it for newly established nursing stations, upgrading nursing stations to health centres that is part of the seed fund. We have gone around Viti Levu in terms of looking at our health facilities and areas where population have increased or areas which the road has reached up to. We have identified that this facility needs to be upgraded to the health centre level. For that to happen, there needs to be a doctor looking after the health centre, so the quarters, improving the storage space et cetera. We need seed funding for that to do our preparatory works before we can finalise everything and put a monetary value on it. Another issue on is $50,000 on Incinerator Rehabilitation, Building Infrastructure, that is, for Sigatoka and Rakiraki only. The Extension of the Waiting Area at the Kamikamica Health Centre in Lautoka, again one of the issues is the electrical works for our facilities and this one is specifically for Nadi Hospital in the amount of $430,000. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question, Mr. Chairman, Sir. My question will be in two parts. Sir, you were also given some funds last year, substantial amount and only 53 percent was used. Can you explain why you were not able to use the rest of the funds? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- As you are aware, this financial year we were given an allocation for these works. Together with that, we had assistance from our development partners and other multi-lateral agencies like UNICEF. That is why there are some savings within those allocations, but nevertheless in areas where we were unable to spend was external to our control, like the capacity within the Ministry of Works and so forth which limited our ability to spend. Those are two of the main reasons I can think of. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman through you to the honourable Minister, we do appreciate the assistance by our bilateral partners. I note that you are still receiving funds for Anti- COVID activities, in last years’ budget we also had assistance from Indonesia. This is under Programme 1-1(7) and that is not appearing, but we still have the China - Pacific Island Countries Anti-COVID Cooperation Fund. Again, the question honourable Minister is, where is this fund</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1248 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 particularly focusing, whether it is the FCDC laboratory and on the continuation of it as well, because I am also aware that we are in Geneva, the team is in the process of developing the pandemic laws, so what is the purpose of this assistance and where is its focus on? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I believe the question was in two parts; the assistance from Indonesia (China Aid on COVID). The assistance from the Indonesian Government, which was a grant, that has been fully utilised, that is why it is not here. Probably last month we had completed the handing over of very much needed equipment by the Government of Indonesia to Fiji. I think that was the spillover from the previous government. In terms of the funding by the Government of China, the COVID fund, the handover was done last year, and it was reflected in our allocation last year but we did not utilise it and again it is reflected this year that it is still there. We have some plans on how we can utilise the fund both in evaluation of our health system and also for the purpose it was used for – Incident Management Response Team (IMRT). They will come up with their own process on how to utilise fund for programmes which better prepare us for certain and future pandemics so far. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Well, that is just about all, we will move on to Programme 2. We have</p><h4>been dwelling on this one for the last 40 minutes or something.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> It is not clear, there are certain things which are still not clear.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Can we move on, you had two rounds each, you were being given time</p><h4>to raise your questions and queries.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> It is budget, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Yes, I understand it is budget, but we need to ensure that we prepare ourselves well otherwise it will be continuing like this and then it will eat up the whole of the morning. Time is of the essence here, honourable Members. When you come, please prepare well, you put your questions in a row so at least it helps everyone. (Honourable Member interjects) MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want another, that is your third time, honourable Koya. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- We cannot hear clearly what Programme, what Activity, what SEG and what you are asking. It is not very clear. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are still on Programme 1-1 and we have been dwelling on this for</p><h4>the last 40 minutes.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, it is quite a pertinent question that is why I am asking and I was actually only asking one at a time. This is to do with Programme 1-1(5) – Clinical Services and Governance. The allocation has been reduced by some $50,000 and the word “Governance” has been added to it. From what I understand, governance would mean that this is relative to patient’s safety and quality care, et cetera. Because we have added the word “governance”, can you explain why there is a reduction? From what I understand is to do with infection control, et cetera in hospitals. Why would there be a reduction and addition to the actual clinical services line but a reduction in the budget? Just an explanation on that honourable Minister.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1249 HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, there is a reduction of $50,000, you are correct in saying that in terms of Clinical Services and Governance, it is to do with safety and safety is paramount in terms of health. The budget item is for the payment of Outreach Programmes relating to blood services. With that being said, there is even a reduction in $50,000, you will note that in the other Programmes and Activities there is an increase in the Outreach Programmes for the various Divisional Hospitals. Again, it is all to do with the Ministry in trying to decentralise most of its services. Clinical Services and Governance, when we had the signing with DFAT on the Master Plan, we also give Certificates to our staff (our nurses) who just graduated on doing clinical governance work within the Central Division. That will be replicated in the other main hospitals and the other divisions as well. In terms of costing, decentralising certain priorities to the Divisional and Labasa Hospital is the other hospital under the Ministry is where we will find those funds that has been put aside to those areas. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question. Are we sufficiently covered for infection control in hospitals within that particular budget? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Sir, for now yes because we continuously have the assistance of our development partners mainly DFAT on this area. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I could just make a general comment to help the honourable Members on the other side. As I said last year we increased the Ministry of Health’s budget very, very significantly. This year, the reduction is just $2 million and you will see the reductions of $20,000 or $30,000 and $50,000 in some of these areas. It does indicate utilisation of our budget. So, we have looked at the utilisation and reduced on the basis of that so it does not mean that the services will be affected. MR. CHAIRMAN.- There is another question raised by honourable Premila Kumar that the reduction is $26 million. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, in the last financial year it was $453 million, this is $451 million. MR. CHAIRMAN.- You get that? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I do not know where they are getting $26 million from? (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, let me explain, honourable Minister for Finance. If you look at Page 152, you will find in brackets, that indicates that there is a reduction. It says $26 million as the total. I am asking him and he is misleading Parliament. He says only $2 million, whereas the book says it is $26 million.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.:</span> Go to page 150.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.:</span> So you are talking about Programme 1?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.:</span> Yes, that is for Programme 1.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1250 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- First he talked about the total budget, and he said he was reading Programme 1-2. What I said very clearly, and I have repeated myself, the total budget for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services last year was increased significantly. In the last financial year, it was $353 million, and this year it is $351 million, it is a reduction of total budget by $2 million. Then you have Programme and Activities where the movements are increased or decreased, but the overall budget has just decreased by $2 million. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Nath, the honourable Minister wants to reply to your query. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Nath, you were correct in saying a reduction by $26 million. If you look at the Established Staff ($10 million), it is nearly half of that. That has been decentralised to the various Divisional Hospitals cost centres. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 8 on the Construction of New Tamavua Rehabilitation Hospital ($400,000). In the last Financial Year 2023-2024, $1.5 million was given and the utilisation was zero percent. They did not use the money. Can I ask the honourable Minister, you could not use that $1.5 million given last year, this $400,000 is for what? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, the last allocation for this Financial Year for rehabilitation of the hospital was $1.5 million. Our ability to spend, again, it is beyond our control externally. In terms of the development partners, who is looking into this? Discussions are ongoing, but nevertheless, for this upcoming financial year we will start with the preparatory works on our end. Once that is done then KOICA can come on board and start building of the new Rehabilitation Centre. It is a four-year programme before the completion of the Rehabilitation Centre. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question will be on SEG 9 but before that, I just wanted to make a remark on the unspent money on construction of new Tamavua Rehabilitation Hospital. I can understand the honourable Minister’s frustration, he wants to do the work, but the work is stuck in the pipeline all because of Public Works Department and that needs to move. If the money is not spent, it simply means the service is not delivered to the people. Now, my question on SEG 9 is to do with the Purchasing of Specialised Medical Equipment for Urban Hospital as well as for Sub-Divisional Hospital, Health Centres and Nursing Stations. Specialised Medical Equipment is so important for diagnostics. The funds were given last year but, unfortunately, it was not fully utilised. The utilisation rate was extremely low. So, if the honourable Minister can explain why the funds were not used. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, in terms of the utilisation, again, it is nothing new. It has been there from the previous government until now. It has to do with the procurement process - tendering and the process itself. It is an issue whereby there are delays in equipment coming over but, nevertheless, the Ministry through the Fiji Pharmaceutical &amp; Biomedical Services (FPBS) are working on how they can expedite the process in bringing equipment over. Nevertheless, there are equipment already in Fiji at the moment. Some have been installed but others are waiting for, again, improvement in the infrastructure. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I just want to thank the honourable Minister for his very honest answers.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1251 HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, forgive me from my ignorant with the Community Health Worker allocation. My question to the honourable Minister is, does this only include the 1,200 villages or will it also include some heavily populated settlements? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, those Community Health Workers have been registered not only in itaukei villages but in settlements as well. If they are registered, they have gone through the training, they registered within the Ministry, they should be receiving their allowance prior to submitting their report. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, thank you for allowing me the opportunity. I asked for an opportunity to make a general comment because it will help all of us, particularly the Ministers and the Ministries. In our Budget discussion with the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his team, we asked the question about the slow implementation and the problems in the procurement process. The feedback from the Permanent Secretary, Sir, is that one of the key problems that they see in Ministries is junior officers are involved in the preparation of the documents for the procurement process. As a result, it goes to and fro, and the exchanges are taking time. I think, Sir, in terms of moving forward because we want implementation to be done because of the funding, if Permanent Secretaries can be tasked to ensure that senior officials from Ministries are involved in the process because of the tender boards. I had raised an issue where previously, we used to have agency Tender Boards, Divisional Tender Boards but all these has been centralised now for control purposes, particularly for those that are on ‘R’…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- By your government:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> …and it has not changed, honourable Minister. A lot of things are still on ‘R’.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have changed that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- But the way forward is to get the right officers to do the work so that it can help in terms of expediting the process:</span> I just want to make that comment, Sir, because it will help us in terms of the way forward. Thank you, Sir. MR CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, Leader of the Opposition for your comment. We will now move forward. Programme 2-2? HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 2-2(5) - Non-Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control ($350,000). Just a question to the Honourable Minister, we have the same allocation that was given last year coming again this year and basing on the record that we have, there is about 80 percent death every year due to NCD related diseases and sickness. So, is this allocation enough to fight against NCDs and the death rate that we are facing in this country in relation to NCDs? HON. DR. RATU. A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, thank honourable Tuinaceva for your question. These two new core Centres - Wellness in Activity 2 and Family Health in Activity 1, by way of background, they get a lot of funding not only from development partners but multilateral agencies as well, UNICEF, so it is through this funding that they able to do most of</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1252 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 their programmes. That is why their utilisation rate is a bit slow, not less, simply because of the funding and assistance that comes to them. That is why most of these allocations are at the same level. Nevertheless, it is sufficient for now.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. N.T.TUINACEVA.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p>MR CHAIRMAN.-We will move on. Programme 2-3? HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Just a clarification form the honourable Minister, through you Mr. Chairman, the reduction of Oral Health Promotion and Mental Health Awareness by $100,000. Just a clarification, I believe Oral Health Promotion used to be $300,000. Why was the reduction in view of the prevalence of dental decay in our society? HON. DR. RATU. A. R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, through you, I thank honourable Ravunawa for his question. In terms of the reduction, again, for now, the amount is sufficient. For this year, we have just appointed our National Advisor on Oral Health and for this financial year, he will be doing most of the programmes for which the coming financial year, they will be able to carry out their activities. Nevertheless, with that reduction, we still have funding within the Divisions, within the two main Hospitals to carry out their outreach and also implement some of the programmes that are usually funded within this allocation. In terms of the reduction, there are allocations available at the Divisional and the two main Hospitals.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.:</span> Thank you, honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 5 - Climate Change and Health Care ($65,000). Can the honourable Minister explain to us what activities will be carried out with this money? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- The Programme looks after public health complaints or new environmental issues, such as public health nuisance that is perceived by the public to be harmful for human health. Environmental Health Inspectors will investigate, advise and prosecute. This programme budget will look at assessment and monitoring of recreational water, procurement of point of care testing kits and re-agents, as well as assist on climate change and health interventions, training and community work. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Koya, you signalling something. We have gone past that, Sir, maybe you can raise it in other activities still ahead? HON. F. S. KOYA.- No, Sir, it was relative to an increase that I had asked for. I had sent the slip across earlier, and they had it. It was to do with the mental health awareness issue, Sir, in Programme 2-2. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are now into Programme 3 Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> I had sent it earlier, it was with them, Sir, before we actually came up.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> We have to take it from here, Sir. We are now into Programme 3. HON. F. S. KOYA.- I have a question with respect to Programme 3-5(5). Just seek clarification, Sir, from what I understand, from St. Giles, their budget usage has been in excess of</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1253 100 percent. I think it is about140 percent. There is a reduction (correct me, if am wrong Sir) and I think it is an important issue. Mental health is also an important issue with respect to St. Giles. Are they not being resourced correctly in terms of rations, et cetera. In SEG 5, there is a reduction. Again, correct me if I am wrong, I just want an explanation on that. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- On ration?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.:</span> So, $200,000, a reduction in $10,000, and that is for procurement of ration. As with this facility – St. Giles Hospital, on ration, that allocation is ration for inpatients. In terms of the reduction, this is one area also where they get a lot of assistance from the private sector. For now, the funding is sufficient, even with the reduction of $10,000. So, should we need more, we can also source from within, but as it is, it is sufficient. HON. F. S. KOYA.- I had really asked because I know because of the drug issue, we have had a huge amount of intake and St. Giles itself is actually using up a whole lot more than the budget that is actually given. Fair enough, if you have private entities supporting the St. Giles institute, anyway, I think that fairly answers it. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on to Programme 4-1? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, on Programme 4-1(5) - Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue and Diarrhoea (LTDD) Control Programme, I note that we have only $50,000 allocation, particularly in the build-up areas in the Central Division. Maybe, the honourable Minister for Finance Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics can help as well - the linkage between the Ministry of Local Government in terms of the LTDD Campaign. Maybe a chance to increase this allocation, Sir, based on previous issues that we have had in as far as LTDD is concerned. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. In terms of this allocation under LTDD Control Programme, this is for their ongoing programmes. Should there be any outbreak, funding is available within Headquarters on Emergency funding. They can source from within Headquarters. But for this allocation, it is specifically for their programmes on preventative and awareness. Now, they are doing it on a daily basis. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, still on SEG 5 - Boats and Outboard Motors, $50,000 has been allocated in other programme as well. What we were told in one of our meetings that there are areas where the Ministry gave boats, the Boats are there but engine is not there. In some places, engine is there but boat is not there. It is really a problem, especially for people in maritime areas. I can see the allocation of $50,000, is it to buy new boats or also to provide engines which has been missing? HON. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, in response to honourable Bala, this is the allocation for purchase of new vessels, minor maintenance and life jacket - item which is required by MSAF, repair, maintenance and servicing of outboard motors and buying of the new outboard motors as well. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 5-1?</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1254 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 5-1(5) – Service Fees – Biomedical Equipment ($1,600,000). If the honourable Minister can explain in terms of what does it entail, I mean, when you say service fee? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- When we get new equipment, there is a provision there for procurement and servicing, so that is the service fee. We make sure that there is a clause of service fee within the contract so should anything happen to the machine here, the suppliers are contracted to come and do the servicing, and at the same time, build capacity within our local biomedical cadre within the Ministry. That is the allocation. HON. P. D. KUMAR. – The reason why I asked that question, when you buy a new equipment, et cetera, there is always a guarantee period.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I agree:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> So it is only when the guarantee period expires, then only you have to pay for that fee.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Yes:</span></p><p>(Hon. Prof. B. C. Prasad interjects) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Yes, it is, and I am not asking you the question, honourable Minister for Finance. Let the honourable Minister answer, he is answering questions much better than you. Thank you. Honourable Minister, the $1.6 million that is allocated, is that money going out to the foreign companies, or is it to the local institutions? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, some are going to the foreign companies and some to the local institutions. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Are you saying that we have the expertise? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, we have some expertise available in the private sector within Fiji, and even our own biomedical cadre. In terms of the finer details of the very expensive machines, we still need to get overseas experts to come in and do the servicing. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- What about the spare part issues? Normally, we hear that the spare parts are not here when it comes to servicing, et cetera, and the machines are not operatable, and they have to wait for a longer period. Do you have the sources internally?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- It is mostly overseas:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> So, what do you do in that period when the machines are not serviced? I mean, these are practical issues that people are facing, and it is not a laughing matter, thank you. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I agree. So, I will give you a scenario. If a machine is found to be faulty and that is the only machine available in Fiji in the public sector, then we have no other choice but to source servicing and spare parts et cetera. That is why we have allocation for outsourcing so that we are able to use the private sector to send our patients to, in the</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1255 meantime, while we do the repairs on our equipment. Once that is done, we revert our patients back to public servicing. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for your very detailed explanation because this is what people want to hear, and my questions were precisely from that point of view. My other question is on SEG 9 - Bio-Medical Equipment for Urban and Sub-Divisional Hospitals ($10,000,000). If I am not mistaken, $12 million was allocated in the last Budget, and it was not fully utilised. This year $10 million is allocated. If you can explain why that money was not used? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, again, it goes back to the tendering and procurement process. In some procurement, they expect partial payment or full payment. With that being said, then the tendering plus the procurement from our suppliers overseas is where most of the delays are. Nevertheless, especially in this programme, usually the funds are committed so that we do get in the equipment, perishable or medicine. Once we commit the allocation, it is reflected in the budget. Only until we receive the items, then we do the full payment. It may be reflected in the next financial year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Thank you, honourable Minister for your response – much appreciated.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Programme 5-1(9) Dental Equipment for Urban and Sub-Divisional Hospitals ($800,000). I noticed that there was a reduction in this allocation. Sir, a clarification from the honourable Minister, the dental service would need a boost in their allocation. I would particularly talk about the prosthetic service that is now being held at Nakasi Health Centre. It needs to come back to the CWM Hospital. Also, the expansion of the dental prosthetic service to Vunidawa. Now, they have an appointed officer in Nadi when they need to set up the dental laboratory there. Also, we want to expand that service to Savusavu and probably to Taveuni as well. These are specialised dental care where we fabricate dentures for our elderly patients, and they cannot travel too far to get this service. I would urge the honourable Minister to, please, consider our elderly citizens in the decentralisation of service from the main centre and closer to their home. So, I am particularly concerned, and I seek clarification on SEG 9. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, I thank honourable Ravunawa for his concerns and points. Yes, I sincerely agree in terms of the Prosthetic Services that is done in Nakasi. It used to be in CWM Hospital. We do intend to bring it back, but the issue is space within the CWM Dental Services. Should we allocate adequate space, then we should be bringing it back. Yes, it is a priority within the Ministry to decentralise Prosthetic Services to the Sub-Divisional levels. I have been to Savusavu Hospital, the Dental Office there do agree with me that, yes, there needs to be Prosthetic Services done there, Taveuni, Vunidawa and other affected Sub-Divisional Hospitals. But to be honest, the dental cadre together with its area of work since taking this office is found to be badly affected. I can say poorly supported, and it is something that the Government, through the Ministry, is trying its best to improve the workspace and infrastructure. This allocation we have here will buy more dental chairs to fit those that are in poor walking conditions. I can say for Rakiraki Hospital and other areas as well.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1256 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 For this financial year, we have approved in buying new dental chairs for certain facilities, but this is just a continuation on that and for sure, we will improve and decentralise some of the services to the Subdivisional areas. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, this is relative to SEG 5 - Consumables. Patients have actually complained with respect to the consumables they have been asked to purchase themselves and I am not sure, but I think some of the doctors also. I see there is $33 million that has been allocated for consumables and medicine and that has not changed from last year. Why is there a disconnect with respect to what has been told in the space? Do we need more with respect to that particular area about consumables and medicine? Is that sufficient to cater for consumables and medicine? Why I am asking this is in light of the fact that there are patients who been asked to bring their own medicines, et cetera. In some places, there was a shortage of even cotton wool. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, through you, to answer the query raised by honourable Koya, yes, this allocation increased by $3 million from this financial year and it is still the same. The issue of shortage of medicine and consumables, I can say is something that is felt within the region because of our location, purchasing power, et cetera. Nevertheless, we rely on our improved procurement system within FPBS which has just gone online. Together with that, we are trying to improve our processes on how we can streamline the approvals from the Tender Board and the availability of what we need from the suppliers. Most of the time, it is what we need that they do not send and what we do not need, they do send. So, that is something the Ministry through FPBS is working on trying to improve the processes. As we speak, honourable Koya, I can say that for now, this is sufficient. We do plead with our public to bear with us that, yes, at times, there will be shortage of certain things but, nevertheless, as a Ministry, we are always trying to improve and see that we have much the needed medicine and consumables readily available here in Fiji. It also goes back to our storage capacity as well. Just recently, we opened a new storage facility in addition to the current one in Jerusalem Road and, likewise, we will be commissioning another new facility in Labasa and, therefore, the West is left. So, once we have the storage capabilities, we are able to procure more and store accordingly. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 22 - Ministry of Health and Medical Services. Question put. Head 22 agreed to. Honourable Members, we will now suspend proceeding for a break and Parliament will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.51 a.m.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1257 The Parliament resumed at 11.23 a.m. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We shall continue. My apologies to honourable Shalen Kumar. I must not have taken your note that you said that you wanted to raise a question because we are just moving straight ahead. Sorry about that, Sir. Head 23 – Ministry of Housing MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. Programme 1-1?. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have a very simple question on SEG7 - National Housing Policy Implementation Plan. I would like to ask the Minister whether that Policy has been approved by Cabinet? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the National Housing Policy has not yet been approved by Cabinet. It is still currently under review. The consultations was held in May this year and another public consultation needs to be undertaken before it can come for Cabinet approval. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. Yes, honourable Naisa and then honourable Bala. HON. N. TUINACEVA.- On the same SEG7, Mr. Chairman, on the National Housing Policy Implementation Plan, $95,000 was allocated for that last year and we have another $63,000 in this year’s budget. Is this still on consultation process? What is slowing this Plan from its implementation, et cetera, honourable Minister? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the $63,000 that has been allocated will assist the Ministry of Housing for the following policy implementation and awareness: (1) (2) (3) Implementation of the National Housing Policy of $35,000 after approval by Cabinet. Awareness on the next revision of the National Housing Policy of $15,000. Awareness on other housing policies, like the First Home Ownership and Fire Grant which will further assist the Ministry in the promotion of its policies to the general public. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, honourable Bala, then back to honourable Premila Kumar. HON. P. K. PALA.- Mr. Chairman, just a supplementary to SEG7, can the honourable Minister confirm that this National Housing Policy Implementation Plan was approved in April this year? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the paper that was presented to Cabinet was not about the National Housing Policy but it was just to update Cabinet on the procedural steps that our Ministry was going to take in the process of that review. So that was the purpose of the paper that was approved by Cabinet. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. Honourable Minister for Finance. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- There was a policy approved in 2011 so this allocation, as the Minister said, revised housing policy that set the discussion. There has been some work already done so the allocation is for the completion of that housing policy and implementation. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, yes, I agree that the housing policy was being formulated with the help of New Zealand assistance. My concern here, Sir, SEG7 says National</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1258 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 Housing Policy Implementation Plan. How can you implement a plan when the plan is not approved. So maybe the wording needs to change, that it is actually the formulation of a national housing plan. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the revised policy that is currently being discussed is not yet been completed. We are targeting to complete it before the end of this year, hopefully in the first quarter of the next financial year. That is where we are going to do more awareness and implementation of revised nation housing policy. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG 7 again, I am assuming confirmation by the honourable Minister that the National Housing Policy Implementation Plan will include those that are squatting on privately owned, Native and Crown lease? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the of the revisiting and reviewing of this Policy is to review the whole Housing Sector. We have also taken on board all stakeholders, all agencies, so as to ensure when we move ahead, we do not leave any sector behind. It is a very inclusive process and that is something that we have in mind when we are reviewing the National Housing Policy. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, Programme 2-1(10) HART - $400,000. There is a reduction on the allocation given to HART. Is there any reason for that? Last year was $500,000 and we have gone down by $100,000 this year. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- The $400,000 that we allocated this year is to cover for the operational cost which is around $60,000, the reconstruction of two burnt flats at Newtown of $120,000; as well as payment of professional fees for the two burnt flats at Nadera - $9,500, as well as general maintenance. We have been doing general maintenance of the HART complexes for some time, it is an ongoing exercise, and we are allocating $210,000 to assist in the upgrading and renovation of the remaining HART flats.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.:</span> Still on SEG 10, Mr. Chairman, can I just continue.</p><p>Honourable Minister, I can see funding for Habitat for Humanity Grant – Greenfield Pilot Project - $500,000 in this year’s budget, nothing on that in last year’s budget. I think this must be the first time we are assisting Habitat Fiji for their projects, and I want to congratulate the Government for that, Sir. The $500,000 allocated for Habitat Fiji, it says that this is for Greenfield Pilot Projects. I just want to understand what is that Pilot Project and how do you arrive at that $500,000? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Through you, Mr Chairman, the. Ministry has been receiving a request on how we can relocate families that are being served with eviction notices. Currently, we do not have any scheme in place to assist in that regard. So, what we have decided is to set aside some funds to assist the Ministry in relocating some of these families that have been evicted. For example, those people at Veidogo Settlement, they have been served with eviction notices.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1259 The Ministry of Housing has signed an MOA with Habitat for Humanity to assist the Ministry in the identification as well as any green field or green space, or one of the existing sites that was acquired through development lease to assist in the relocation of these families. We do not understand because some of these families, because of the state of their income level and the struggles they have been facing, so we engage Habitat for Humanity to assist in the provision of some simple houses in the process of relocating them to some of these green field or existing land that we have acquired through our development leases. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-1(8) - Formalisation of Informal Settlements ($13,468,756), for last year, it was $10 million. What I want to know from the honourable Minister is, is this the rollover from last year to continue with these projects or are there new projects in this year’s programme? Secondly, the Ministry of Housing acquired close to 50 development leases from mataqali for the development of informal settlements. Unfortunately, some of the development leases have not been renewed. I can give you one example of Varavu in Ba, and I have discussed this with the honourable Minister for Finance. That lease was not renewed and now, the tenants are paying whatever they are supposed to pay to the landowners. What I am trying to say and justify is, at that point in time, taxpayers’ money was paid to the respective mataqali. Do you not think it is the responsibility of the Government to continue with that programme, or just forget about those monies that were paid? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, there are two parts of that question, and I will try and answer the first one which is on the utilisation of the formalisation of informal settlement with the allocation of $13.5 million. Yes, there are four informal settlements that will be the continuation of the existing and formalisation that have been allocated in the current financial year. That is for Sakoca - $2 million; Nasinu - $2 million; Tavele, Nadi - $1.4 million; Toria in Lautoka, as well as Field 4 of $3 million. On the new capital projects, the formalisation of new projects for Valele in Ba - $1 million; and Vunika in Labasa - $1.8 million. It also covers meeting some of the consultation engagement fees, covering consultation up to engineering drawings and phases of around $1.7 million and the improvement of some of the basic amenities of $250,000. On your question on why the development lease for Varavu was not actually renewed, for any development lease, the onus is on landlord, and we have tried our very best to have consultation with the iTLTB on the renewal. Of course, we have requested iTLTB for the renewal of such development lease, and we have just been advised that there have been new demands now by the respective landowning unit, and that is something that we need to respect. But it does not take away the fact that we will have to continue, and also encourage iTLTB for the renewal of the development lease. So, we will continue our consultation with them and, hopefully, without any further new demands, we will be able to renew their leases. That was the only reason why the renewal of the development lease is still on hold. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, apart from Varavu, how many other development leases have not been renewed? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, I think that is the only development list that we have not renewed at the moment, the one at Varavu which is really a challenge now for the Ministry, while the other leases that we have, we managed to renew most of them.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1260 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Viam Pillay, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of the New Zealand Deputy High Commissioner, Mr. Alex Shahryar-Davies. Bula vinaka, Sir. Also, a former politician, Mr. Rinakama and a gentleman from Wainibuka sitting in front of him. HON. V. PILLAY.- Programme 2-1(10) - Housing Assistance for Persons Living With Disability ($300,000). With the high demand of housing from Persons Living With Disability, is this $300,000 enough? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That programme, honourable Member is to assist Fijians living with disability with a maximum grant of $5,000 per applicant to upgrade their homes to accessible standards. So, that programme is for that. We think, based on the number of applicants, this is sufficient for one year. HON. V. LAL.- Sir, I can see under SEG 10 that there is an allocation for Veikoba Bridge Project, $2 million and it comes from the Housing Authority Capital Grant. Sir, my understanding is, this is a building of a bridge and it should come from the infrastructure budget. So, why are we using Housing’s budget for this bridge project? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, that allocation is to assist the Housing Authority, that is, after consultation with the Fiji Roads Authority for the construction of that bridge. On the other side of the bridge is a parcel of land where Housing Authority is planning to develop. It is going to generate nearly 400 to 500 new lots to the people of Fiji. For the Housing Authority it is really a very significant project in terms of bridge construction. This is just to assist the Authority in doing some groundwork, feasibility study before discussions with the Fiji Roads Authority on that particular bridge. They are just assisting FRA in doing some of the preliminary works before the actual construction of the bridge. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Sir, if I can just add, this was a very conscious decision in the Budget because when we had the discussion with FRA, as the Minister quite rightly said, this could open a large number of lots and the problem that we had was this bridge. We said that this allocation within the Ministry of Housing Authority, we will allow them to provide this additional support, work with the FRA so that this bridge is completed as a matter of urgency so that they can start work. The development lease has already been granted, work has been done but this bridge is holding back the unleashing of these additional plots. I think it will be a big addition if we are able to do this quickly. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, who is doing the bridge? Is it the Housing Authority or the Fiji Roads Authority? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The honourable Member should know that Housing Authority is not going to build the bridge on its own. What we are doing is include it in this budget so that they can work with FRA and push this tender process and the construction of the bridge. What we are doing is trying to decentralise allocations to each concerned Ministry and is able to push for it to be done quickly. That is the idea of allocating this and giving it to the Authority. We have this big problem of centralisation, the honourable Leader of the Opposition knows this and we are trying to slowly do that so that things can be done as quickly as possible. (Inaudible interjection) MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order Order! No running commentary, please.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1261 HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, still on Programme 2-1(10) on Housing Assistance to Fire Victims ($200,000). I just wanted to ask, roughly how many victims can be assisted from $200,000 and what was the assistance rate in the last financial year? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the Housing Assistance Grant is allocated to those families whose residential homes are affected through fire, a grant of $5,000 is given and that $5,000 will continue. So, from the $200,000 that have been allocated, we are going to give $5,000 per family whose house got burnt in this new financial year and there is a provision for that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we are trying to move ahead and then all of someone has pulled out. You all raise your hands and we took note of it because as I stressed the importance of sticking to time here. Let us try and work together here, if you raise a question, that is your right to raise a question but when I allocate the time, please ensure that you stick to it or otherwise it is just a waste of time for all of us. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for Housing and Community Development for his answers on SEG8 in relation to the formalisation of Informal Settlements. The issue that I had raised earlier, I would just like to clarify, I think this will also Qauia and Wakanisila. If he can just give us an update on what is the progress of that and whether Wakanisila will really happen? MR. CHAIRMAN.- You still have an interest in Wakanisila or is it outside…? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, for Wakanisila there is an issue, I think there is a church whose boundary is partly inside the development lease and partly within the mataqali land. This is something that we are trying to address with iTaukei Land Trust Board before we can move ahead with the project because I think something is very important and the landowners are also raising their concerns. For the Ministry, I think it is prudent that we address it first, but it would not take away the fact that we also going to have Wakanisila as part of our formalisation process. Also, in Qauia, it is not here but something that we are also looking into. In one of the development plans that were done earlier on, there were concerns on those settlements that live alongside the Qauia River. What the Ministry is trying to do is, if these areas are prone to flooding, then we need to relocate them to higher ground and that is something that we are also discussing now with iTLTB if they have any unused land in Qauia that the Ministry can use to formalise the Qauia Settlement. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 2-1(10) First Home Grant [Income Threshold - $50,000 and below] and First Home Grant [Income Threshold - $50,001 to $100,000]. The First Home Grant - $50,000 and below – I would like to know how many families benefitted and why only 68 percent of the fund was utilised? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- On the utilisation of this, for this current financial year, a total of 128 applicants were paid $2.8 million as well as further applicants have been approved and will be paid out before end of this financial year amounting to $150,000. Accordingly, a total of 134 applicants will benefit from this programme in the current financial year with a total payment of $2.9 million. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- For the other programme, the First Home Grant ($50,001 and above), again I would like to know how many families benefitted and what is the utilisation rate?</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1262 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the utilisation for these housing grants for the current financial year currently sits at 75 percent and a total of 96 applicants have been assisted with a total payment of $1.1 million and six6 applicants have been approved and will be paid by end of July amounting to $75,000. Accordingly, a total of 102 applicants will benefit from this programme in the current financial year with the total payment of $1.195 million. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on and Parliament will now vote on Head 23 – Ministry of Housing. Question put. Head 23 agreed to. Head 24 – Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments? Programme 1-1? HON. H. CHAND. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman, under this Activity, I have got two questions. My first question is on SEG 7 – Development of Child Care Policy and Regulation. I can see that $10,000 was allocated for the development of this policy last year and I have seen $10,000 allocated again this year. Can the honourable Minister provide clarification on this? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am just finding the page. The development of the Child Care Policy has actually been finalized, this was completed by the IFC World Bank. It was brought to Cabinet and approved. What we are trying to encourage now is for employers to actually set up childcare facilities in their workplaces. This is really what the allocation was for. So, we are continuing the work to reach out to employers and organisations to do so because this will help with our women who can come to the workplace and have childcare facilities. We are very excited about the proposed development of BPOs because like overseas, BPOs are known to have childcare facilities in their BPO parks so we hope that this will be the case. So, there is continued work in implementing this Child Cre policy around Fiji and so there is continued work dedicated to this course so that is why the allocation remains so that we can raise awareness of this, not just here in Suva but in all the different Divisions and Districts as well. HON. H. CHAND. - Mr. Chairman, so that is not for the development. It is for the implementation am I right, honourable Minister? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Yes, honourable Member. Like has been answered by previous Ministers, we do not just end at developing a policy, we need to implement them as well and so our teams are dedicated to carrying this out and yes that does assist with implementation as well. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, my second question is on SEG 8. Last year $250,000 was allocated for the construction of Lautoka Aged Care facility, my question is how was the money spent and I can see another $225,000 given this year. How does the Ministry intend to use this money? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, I think I explained this in the last sitting of Parliament where we had commenced work to renovate the Ba Mission Hospital for the relocation of our current residents but that fell through and so we have had to now work and thank the Ba Provincial Holdings for offering the Matanakilagi House which will need renovation so that it is fit for purpose for our residents.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1263 The construction of the new Lautoka Aged Care facility will need the demolition of the current facility but as we are doing scoping on that particular spot, we feel that perhaps it needs to be relocated to a different location for expansion purpose as well. I think this Government, or any government, should consider not just offering for our residents who come to us but also the possibility of looking at a voluntary facility where that voluntary facility can then fund the facility for those residents that are presented to us. So, a retirement living offered also by government. That is also in the plans. But to answer your question, it is still being scoped for the next financial year given the option of actually relocating that facility completely to another location. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have received a motion from honourable Seruiratu. This is the motion coming from your side as well, from the honourable Leader of the Opposition and if you care to introduce your motion, Sir? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I move a motion: To increase the allocation in Head 24-1-1(7) - Economic Empowerment of Persons with Disability from $10,000 to $40,000.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, at first, I do acknowledge the Government and the honourable Minister for the allocation of $10,000 for the purpose of economic empowerment of persons with disability. I did raise this in terms of the resilience level of our people in our communities and it involves economic empowerment, particularly for persons with disability. We, in this Parliament have always talked about handouts, or whatever we want to call it, but this is a programme that I hope everyone will support, because we need to look after our people who, unfortunately, have limited access to employment and many other benefits. That is why I have moved this motion, Mr. Chairman, in the hope that we can consider increasing this allocation for the economic empowerment of our people with disabilities. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, perhaps, if I could respond to that motion, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his motion. Yes, there is always a need to economically empower our people living with disabilities. In terms of this allocation, we have found that people living with disabilities reach out to the Ministry more effectively through their organisations. If you look at SEG 6, we have the Fiji National Council for Disabled Persons, which is allocated over $0.5 million. Then there is the Grant to Organisation for Persons with Disability ($300,000). In terms of organising themselves, that is more effective. This particular grant is really there if there is any individual who comes forward. I will give the example of the Rewa Disabled Women’s Group who are thriving and doing very well in terms of planting and harvesting mushrooms and other cash crops. They are very visible and mobilised. It is a group of close to 200 people, including women and people living with disabilities. The suggestion or the motion is noted, however, we would like to suggest, honourable Leader of the Opposition, that to be more effective in terms of accounting back to the Government in terms of utilisation, to support each other, the organisations are much more effective this way. Question on amendment put.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1264 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 Motion lost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We still have three more speakers listed here. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, in the last sitting, the honourable Minister said that the allocation of $250,000 is directed to the renovation of the new building. Am I right?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- Good:</span> So, that $250,000, plus another round of $350,000, that will be the total cost for the …. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Sorry, what SEG is that?</p></body>
