<body><h3>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- SEG 9?</h3><h4>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- SEG 9?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Yes, SEG 9, please.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr:</span> Chairman, the Department of Mineral Resources’ research vessel, the drawings are presently being vetted by MSAF. It is being constructed in Australia. Payments have already been made. Sir, $97,000 is the retention fee. We are hoping that the vessel is going to be handed over to us between September and October and if it sails well in the retention period, then we will make the final payment of $97,000. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question; honourable Minister, if you can just be more specific on the technical work that will be undertaken by this vessel because I</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1290 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 know previously there has been some discussions too with the Ministry for Defence with the capability in the Naval Division. So, this is where my supplementary question is coming from. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that query. The Mineral Resources Department used to have a research vessel, that has now been boarded, so this is the replacement for that vessel. It is mostly used for mineral exploration, geological mapping within the Fiji Waters. The vessel will also supplement the works of the Divisions in environmental monitoring, groundwater assessment, seismic monitoring, earthquakes and tsunami awareness outreach to rural and maritime islands. It will also be used to assist the Marine Geology Section to undertake coastal assessments.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Your first boat was the Tovuto:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- The first boat was the Tovuto and still working:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Honourable Minister, in SEG 8 – Ground Assistance Programme – Small Islands, there has been a substantive drop of $250,000 whereas for the large islands, a big increase of around $2.5 million. Can you please give us some more information on the reasons for that and what that will cover, especially from the large islands? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, that is to coincide with target of 18 boreholes that have previously been targeted that had already been assessed in the previous year and that we are intending to provide for them in this coming financial year. But this is also in addition to the special provision that we have built in for what we have announced in the budget, which is an addition of $5 million for the development of 1,700 boreholes throughout Fiji in the next few years. So, the target is 200 for the small islands, 500 for Vanua Levu and 1,000 for Viti Levu. So, this one that you see on SEG 8 is really to accommodate. For the ones that had already been assessed and which they have identified that they are capable of developing that Ground Water System in the next financial year. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just one final question on Programme 2-1(8) - Upgrade and Enhancement - National Tsunami Warning Centre ($300,000). I see honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources that this is probably a new allocation on the upgrade and enhancement of the National Tsunami Warning Centre. If the honourable Minister can just elaborate on this project and what impact this will bring because I know that we already have a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Policy and early warning systems is part of our commitment to the Sendai Framework. So, I acknowledge the Government for this initiative, and it would be good if the Parliament can be enlightened on this project? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the $300,000 is to cater for the construction or the extension of the existing building where the Seismology Section is at Delainabua. The place where it is at the moment is quite restricted. The demand and the volume of work that is required of the section, of course. of its importance requires a further extension to the current building but the $300,000 is simply for the building. The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources with South Pacific Commission (SPC) through UNESCO is going to outfit. When the building is finished, they are going to outfit it with equipment that is necessary to compliment the equipment that we presently have at the Seismology Section.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1291 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Just a supplementary question, honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, I know probably there has always been issues too about our buoys that are placed in the various locations. Probably this is something, I know that Fiji has been in the past also requested if they can start looking at additional so that we can cover most of the approaches. I just wanted to raise this with you and maybe if it is already in the plans of the Ministry as well. It is still related to tsunami. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, with these areas of technicalities, of course, as you would understand, we have a very close collaboration with SPC and UNESCO. These are the two partners that we look to, to develop for us and also train for us personnels and also to maintain and expand equipment that we have on the ground. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-2. HON. J. USAMATE.- I see that under SEG 7 there is public consultation review of the mining law. I believe that is in relation to the Mining Act which has been under review for two to three years now. Is this now the final round of review or is it an interim part of the process to coming out with the amended Mining Act. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, we would have a preference that this would be the final phase of it before it is brought to Cabinet. I think we will make an effort to make sure that this is brought to Cabinet and ultimately brought to Parliament within the next financial year. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The review of the lands legislation began in Qarase’s government’s time. Programme 3-2? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir on SEG 8 in relation to the Geodetic Datum, I know this has been underway for a considerable amount of time now and I think a lot of work has been done and I congratulate the Ministry for doing that. Now that we have this upgrade and enhancement of the datum of $161,000, is this also going to lead to the conclusion of this exercise or this is also just part of the process towards the eventual completion later on? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, this allocation is going to cover for the maintenance of the eight existing core stations that we have. They are in need of upgrading and maintenance, so with this allocation of $161,290, we hope that these eight core stations are going to be maintained and kept in conditions that would continue to feed us with strong and reliable cadastral survey and network mapping coordinates that can be used by all Fijians. MR. CHAIRMAN.- These geodetic datum act as survey control as well?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.:</span> Indeed, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, on Programme 3-2(8), I note that you also have a similar allocation to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs on the Survey of Mahogany Plantations? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, this is just to also bring some clarity on the division of funding that you would have seen in honourable Vasu’s Ministry funding yesterday and the one today. So, you will see that the concentration of the $382,000 for this year is to attempt to put a closure on Nukurua and Sawakasa woodlots.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1292 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 We have completed Galoa and Naboutini and we have aging mahogany woodlots in Fiji. So, with the limited number of surveyors and survey teams that we have, the big task that we also have, we have agreed that the surveyors from Ministry of iTaukei and Fisheries Commission are going to be also useful to us in attempting to start with the woodlots that are at Vanua Levu. This is all with the intent to ensuring that we can round up and put this in our knapsack as having these woodlots surveyed so that Fiji Hardwood can then go on and take proper leases on all of these woodlots with all of the survey boundaries demarcated. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I am thankful for the centralisation and to speed up this work but I think the frustrations that usually come from the landowners is which one is official when it comes to the co-ordination after the work has been done? Probably the agencies can just work on these and maybe the Ministry of Lands becomes the official whatever because these are the issues on the ground when trying to settle these disputes. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- We understand Mr. Chairman the ground difficulties that are faced with all of the surveys. We have surveyors up in the Northern Division who are also going to be assisting the iTLFC surveyors when they are up in Vanua Levu. Ultimately, all of these comes back to the Survey General’s Office who will do the verification before everything is finalised. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I would be interest to see the work done in Naboutini as you mentioned honourable Minister because that particular Tikina of Nuku has not been surveyed by the Native Lands Commission as yet. Now, I just heard the survey for the mahogany plantations has been undertaken. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- In Naboutini, Mr. Chairman, there are nine leased lots with 4,921 hectares and six of their plans were submitted for checking and approval and they have been with the Survey-General’s Office. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-3? HON. J. USAMATE.- On SEG 4 – Lease and Rent (Renewals) - iTaukei Lands ($3.845 million), an increase of $300,000. Can the honourable Minister just provide some information on that? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, yes, there is a market increase. We are looking at some 537 active leases of iTaukei leased to the State. We have been going between the Ministry of Lands and iTLTB in trying to make sure that we are crunch down on the right number. So, over the years we have had discussions with iTLTB and also this honourable Member also takes care of the rental increases that do happen every five years. So, when those five years fall, we also have to make sure that the increase that needs to be paid is factored into the budget. HON. J. USAMATE.- Just a follow-up question, Mr. Chairman. On the next one, the Lease and Rent (Renewals) which has also increased by around $60,000, will that explanation be the same for this increase? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- This is for the renewal of leases that are up for renewal. Those ones are for the active leases, this one is for the renewal of any of the ones that we are going to negotiate with iTLTB. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, can I just ask a general question to the honourable Minister through you and may be you can help in this as well, although it is not in any of the SEGs, this is</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1293 about the work of the Valuation Board. I know that we have had a lot of difficulty in the past because of the membership because it is related to ALTA as well, Sir, when it comes to non-active agriculture leases. I just want to raise a general question to the honourable Minister because in the previous sitting of Parliament we have talked about ALTA. I have gone to CEO iTLTB and I think they are bringing that up to Cabinet. This is why I just wanted to ask the question on the Valuation Board and the role that they play. How is it being handled now in the Ministry because it will be important for the primary industry stakeholders? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the Board is now properly constituted as well as the ALTA Valuation Board. Those Board members have been appointed and they are continuing on with the work that is required of them in examining and also passing valuers who have applied to be registered. So, they have been continuing on with the work that they have been asked to do. MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is a bit long explanation, Sir, given the way the Valuation Board has been subjected to other, like this real estate people, coming in by virtue of them doing real estate sales, automatically they become part of this valuation institute without really undergoing the necessary studies. So that was something that we experienced for some time. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- I must also mention, Mr. Chairman, that the Evaluation Act is also presently being consulted and reviewed. We are anticipating that the new Act will be prompt to time and address the concerns that we now have as opposed to the archaic concerns that the present Evaluation Act has. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-4.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> My question is on SEG 8 – Upgrade and Enhancement - Subdivisions.</p><p>I would like to ask the honourable Minister which divisions will be upgraded? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, through you, in the Central/Eastern, we are going to work at the Cautata Agricultural Subdivisions, Muanaweni Agricultural Subdivision on drainage and road maintenance. In the North also $100,000 allocation for demolishing of existing footpaths and v-drains, construction of new footpaths that were constructed on a plan M2O09 and also $100,000 in the Western Division and that is going to be for the construction of a retaining wall on the transmitter road in Nadi. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-5. HON. J. USAMATE.- Through you, Sir, honourable Minister, SEG 10 - Land Bank Investment. I see this is an increase of around $123,000, can you just give us an idea of what is entailed in that budget? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr Chairman, this is to complete the compensation payment for road access to designated land in Mataqali Koronikula which had been pending from 2014. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 33 – Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. Question put. Head 33 agreed to.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1294 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 Head 34 - Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now for any comments and will go straight into the items - Programme 1-1. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG 8 - Standardised Roadside Stalls. Last year $100,000 was allocated and only $13,000 was used. So, honourable Minister if you can explain why the full sum was not used and this year, we are allocating another $80,000? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, basically what we have subsequentially found with regard to the roadside stalls is, we have a bit of an issue with the roadside stalls. Just by way of update, there is a lot of stalls that are actually vacant. For example, out of the 90-plus stalls that were inspected in 2022, about 30-plus are vacant, so we have decided to slow down the spend just to try and understand what we can do to redeploy. So, this year, we will try and move the stalls around and just try and understand why the request comes for stalls we try and assist and then they did not use the stalls. So, that is really the reason why we had to slow down, Mr. Chairman. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 4-1. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 4-1(10) - Co-operative Development Grant. I will be grateful if the honourable Minister could elaborate more on this - what this grant is for and its availability? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the grant is actually a new grant, Sir, and it is really driven by, if you like, a better understanding of how we can continue to assist particularly in terms of economic empowerment. I have discovered that in other countries, they have actually used co-operatives as a major weapon to drive SDG initiatives. This is our first attempt to actually try and boost the funding to co-operatives and, hopefully, over the next few years, we will actually increase the funding because we are now actively encouraging across all the Ministries a creation of co-operative and so the funding is really to try and assist. The initial plan is to try and assist co-operatives that request for assistance, and it leads up to a maximum of $100,000, but it will just depend on the quantum of requests that come in, in terms of assistance, Sir. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is quite a good initiative but the only concern is, if it is at the Ministry’s disposal for funding co-operatives, why is it under ‘R’? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, from our perspective, like even last year, we had $40 million under ‘R’ for the rebates, but we utilise all of it. So, it is really just a matter of applying one’s self properly in terms of the Ministry to ensure the funds come, so a bit of pre-planning is involved. I suppose because it is new as well, may be the Ministry of Finance wants to make sure the money goes to the right place, but that is alright. It certainly will not be in slowdown in the spending of the grant. Requests are coming in already. One of the things that we have all done now across the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, we are all saying and encouraging the creation of co- operatives across all like-minded industry. I think that will be the way forward in terms of trying to develop the sector, particularly agriculture.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1295 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Probably, it acts as a kind of control on this.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Yes, it is a new grant, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Programme 5-1? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, Programme 5-1(10), across the board with respect to the YES, IHRDP, NDP, the National Export Strategy and the TEP, there has pretty much been an increase for all of them, which is commendable, but I see that there is a substantial decrease with respect to the Northern Development Programme (NDP). Is there any specific reason behind the decrease for the NDP, considering we are trying to encourage more and more in terms of diversification and also in terms of the North? You can give us a reason as to why there is a substantial decrease on NDP? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, in terms of the overall utilisation of the grant last year, I think it was a bit of a slowdown in the grant so we have tried to apply the grant in other areas where there has been over utilisation and so that is, I think, the main driver, but overall, we have gone from $2.6 million to $4 million. So, there is enough money in there to cover for other purposes. I think overall, we are pretty good in terms of the money. Like I have mentioned, there is $120 million circulating in the whole SME space between all the Ministries, including the Ministry of Sugar. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, while still on Programme 5-1(10) - National Export Strategy. Honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, I noted the slight increase in National Export Strategy. I did discuss this with you after last year’s Budget and you have increased it by only $200,000. My question is, how flexible are we in terms of assisting others who have been assisted previously? We have visited a few lately in my tours around Fiji and they want to expand so that we can facilitate more, particularly the exporters, but they are saying, “I went to the Ministry and they said, ‘you have been assisted before.’ How flexible is this honourable Minister? Because these are the people that can create the impact as well. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I guess as a Government because there are a lot of requests so once a request is done, we have given them a couple of years before they get back in the queue. So, what I suggest is you refer them to me because sometimes normally, they tend to ready for other forms of assistance through FDB or other things. So, they may not need another grant but they can certainly get concessionary loans or that kind of thing. So, it is double the amount, so it is very healthy.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Thank you, Sir. It is still not enough the amount that he has given.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 6-1? HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, through you, honourable Minister for Trade, Co- operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, I stand to be corrected on SEG7 - Digital Fiji. I believe that is a new allocation of $1,000,000. Please, elaborate more on the work that will be carried out under this allocation.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1296 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the two components to the funding, because we are building out the new ease of doing business platform so there will be annual subscription fees paid for the licensing. So that is one component. The second component is because of the high turnover. We are not paying enough to our IT guys so there is a bit of a risk with the high turnover. So, what we have tried to do is actually get some coverage from offshore, from the vendor, just to make sure that we do have adequate coverage, so that we do not put our information systems at risk. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 34 – Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. Question put. Head 34 agreed to. Head 35 – Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Programme 1-1( 10) – Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance ($4,000,000). Again, this is welcomed but it is time that we look at the return in investment, particularly on production levels. I noted in the last Annual Report Sir, particularly for Vanua Levu, they are still hitting around 600,000 tonnes. Vanua Levu used to produce almost triple that amount during the good days, so honourable Minister, what assurance can you give us in terms of improved productivity?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Chairman, there is a saying that if a lion is sleeping, let him sleep.</p><p>If you wake the lion up, you are in trouble. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Who is the lion? HON. C. J. SINGH.- I am the lion Sir. It is called Singh is lion. Anyway, it is most humorous here now because you are too serious. The Budget will be passed anyway, so let us laugh about it. (Honourable Members interject) Listen, support…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You are wasting our time:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> No, you are wasting my time. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say, before I answer to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, this morning I had two documents in hand which came to me as the Minister. One was a document that money was paid to Abdul Khan’s friend… (Honourable Members interject) No, let me complete, $100,000 just for a change of a logo of FSC. After I am done with the abuse then I will come to the use. Number two, Graham Clarke’s brother was paid $8,000 business class ticket on FSC’s expenses. These are the misuse, now I will come to the use of it.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1297 Honourable Leader of the Opposition, I will tell you, yes, the production of sugar has decreased since 2006. There were some issues of land leases, there were some issues otherwise, but collectively, as the Opposition usually alluded in their speech, we want to increase the production. Vanua Levu, at one good time had 1.2 million tonnes of cane, today it now stands at 600,000 tonnes. We have this programme in hand and together with the Opposition and bipartisan, we would like to see that we all work together to increase the production in the next 10 years and that is why we have this plan. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(10) - Cane Access Roads with an allocation of $4 million. I would just like the honourable Minister to clarify because along these cane access roads, we have some small crossings or low-lying crossings that also need repair and maintenance. Are those also included in that allocation of $4 million? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, through you, last year, we had $2 million and now, it increased to $4 million. That just shows that we are very serious about getting the cane access roads done. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one comment in regards to the Sugar Industry. After looking at both programmes, I do not see there is any allocation for the rebuilding of the Penang Sugar Mill. We all know very well that a number of times, this Minister has repeatedly said in this Parliament that come this time next year, the Mill will be ready. So, since there is no allocation, what does he have to say on this? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the honourable Member, during tea break asked me why there was no allocation. I told him that this programme has an operational budget and we are looking at donor funds. This is not a management project, it is a $150 million project. Your Government has destroyed the Mill. You destroyed the Mill and now we are going to bring it back. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, that means the honourable Minister can come and say anything in Parliament and later on shy away from it? HON. C. J. SINGH.- No shame! You had asked me a question in the Tea Room, and I answered you. Rakiraki Mill will be done, it will be done, and that is it. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, before I get into the question, I have an observation. Until now, discussions have been very cordial, and all of a sudden comes a Minister who absolutely has no idea on how to behave in this Parliament, and starts shouting. It disrupts the entire Parliamentary process. Why can he not start behaving for a change?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> It is the way I speak, Mate! It is called criticism.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- He probably needs a couple of doses:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Chairman, in Programme 1-1(10) – Cage Bins ($1 million). Is this facility available to private contractors who cart cane so that they can have better cage bins, or is it for FSC? I just need an explanation, Mr. Chairman. If the facility is available to private contractors, how can they access this facility?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Chairman, this is only for FSC’s tramline facility. .</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1298 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 MR. CHAIRMAN.- I still have honourable Bala and the honourable Leader of the Opposition with their questions. I have a motion here from honourable Koroilavesau. Please, introduce your motion, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Thank you, I understand, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Chairman, I move: That SEG 10 be reduced by $11 million.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Honourable Member, you may elaborate on your motion. HON S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs have made a lengthy deliberation on FSC. I think during my Budget Speech, I had stated that we need a whole workout on the sugar industry in Fiji, carrying on as we have been carrying on as we have been carrying on since the Colonial days. We will never be able to reach the effort that we want to take sugar to, so that it will be self-sustainable. One of the huge issues that is causing a lot of cost to Fiji is the transportation of cane from cane farms to the mill. Not only the cost in fuel and the expenses in the carrying in trucks, the damage that it does on our roads is huge and substantial. My view is that instead of allocating all these funds to the various headings here, we should start. There was a study that was made that it will cost $30 million to revamp our rail system that will carry sugar cane to our mills. We should start, we should make an initiative to put it into the programme and initiate this. Mr. Chairman, $30 million is nothing if we think about the damages that are happening on our roads, the rubbish that is created by all the cane that is carried on the road, I think it is about time that we re-dedicate the funding that we have to make sure there is a long term solution to the sugar industry. MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is reduce the budget by $11 million. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, we have been talking to this company called Rites Limited in India recently. They are the experts in the railway system and they are coming back to Fiji to assist us in assessing the railway system. Once they give us a report and the costing, then we will come back to the Cabinet and the Government for assistance. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I do not think we support that motion. What it simply means is, I think the rail issue, honourable Koroilavesau is 100 percent correct. The rail system was built over many years, it should never have been allowed to be destroyed. It was destroyed in the last 10 years or 15 years. Now we are in a situation where the cost of cartage and the cost addition to the farmers is a single biggest contributor, which has drained away their income. If you reduce the $11 million, you are essentially saying, reduce subsidy, reduce cane planting programmes and reduce all the cane access roads. (Inaudible interjection) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The FSC is another entity; this is not funding FSC. This is looking at farm level production. While we consider options, funding, studies on drain and I think that is a good suggestion, we cannot allow the farmers to get out of the industry now. This</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1299 programme really is in SEG10 is to keep the farmers. If we had not lost the European Union funding in 2006, there were three components; milling, farm level and alternative livelihood. So we lost about $300 million to $400 million and the decline on the industry was just certain. I think we looked at it very carefully when we were discussing with the Ministry that this funding is required. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the two honourable Ministers for their explanations. I think I just add on, the future cost of keeping the trucks, maintained and the diesel that is being spent on it, the rail can be used during off season and during season to carry containers between our destinations on top of carrying cane during the cane season. It can be a double edge effort in creating and reducing traffic within our roads and damage to the infrastructure. In that case, Mr. Chairman, I would like to withdraw my motion. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. You still want to raise your question? The motion has been withdrawn.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Not on the motion. I have a question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Question from honourable Sachida Nand. HON. S. NAND.- Mr:</span> Chairman, again going back to the cage bins, thank you to the honourable Minister for explaining but cage bins are for collecting canes from mechanical harvesters. So, is the honourable Minister telling us that mechanical harvested canes will be collected in rail carts and carried to the mill, is that what his trying to tell us? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, yes cage bins as you know are very secured, it does not spill out the canes when it goes on the tracks. We are trying to bring in more cage bins now so that the farmers do not get there, canes off track and offloaded on the way. We are totally concentrating on giving more cage bins rather than the open carts. HON. S. NAND.- Will that be for carrying mechanical harvested cane?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- You are correct:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG10 - FSC Working Capital Support ($15 million), if the honourable Minister can elaborate what FSC is going to do with this money. Is it cooperation or some other activities. What is the intent of this fund?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- He does not know:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> I know, I know, I will need to explain.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is the repayment for the EXIM Bank. You know the history of Exim Bank and how we have come to that:</span> Through the Indian Government we were able to negotiate a deal where the interest that was due and future interest is being taken care of by the Indian Government, and so the payment schedule for the next three years, and obviously FSC does not have the funding to do that, so we are allocating that to clear off the Exim Bank loan. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- For how many more years are we going to pay this amount to the Exim Bank? I mean I know this year we are putting in $15 million and what are your plans for the future? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is one-of allocation and we are hoping that FSC itself will take care of whatever is left over.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1300 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, may I just refer to the honourable Minister’s initial statement in responding to my first question. Talking about the sleeping lion, he is admitting that he was sleeping on the job, Mr. Chairman. (Laughter) So, I will ask the honourable Prime Minister through you Mr. Chairman, Sir, to sack the sleeping Minister. (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, I was referring to the sleeping Minister then but I am a sleeping lion. There is a difference between a Minister and a sleeping lion. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 10. I note the significant increase, almost doubled on the cane access road. This is welcomed because they need it, Mr. Chairman, Sir, and increase of $2 million. Does this mean that there are new farmers, new areas that we are getting into because it is quiet a significant increase and, of course, I know that there needs to be maintenance as well in the existing farms. And still the question on railways, that is critical to the farmers? Will part of this allocation go towards improvement in the rails? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation for last year, we gave $2 million, we found out that it is was very less for the cane access roads, the contractors, the prices of machines and hiring of plants were very excessive. So that is how we managed to convince the Ministry of Finance to increase the budget to $4 million but that does not include any existing railway system. That is going to be taken care of as soon as we get a report, we find out what is the cost of repairing and putting new rails. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I will start from SEG 1 on Personal Emoluments. Last year it was $533,000, this year we can see a huge jump and that is $742,713. Can the honourable Minister justify this increase and please behave when answering? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, look I do not control the emoluments. There is a Ministry, and appointments are there. There were a lot of vacancies that has now been filled and this is because your government did not fill them. We have to bring this sugar industry back to its feet and this is why we need workers, we do not need statues.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- I am quite sure this industry is going to collapse under this Minister. Mr:</span></p><p>Chairman, how many more staff they have got in this financial year?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITON MEMBER.- He does not know:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Who does not know? You do not know your job.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, it is dependent on my Permanent Secretary, and he tells me. I do not control the number of staff in the Ministry, but I want to control them to do work, that is all. Whoever comes in, they have to perform. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I can answer the question for the honourable Member. The increase honourable Member is additional salary for the honourable Minister, the re-alignment in salary of the multi-ethnic component about $231,000, additional FNPF, overtime plus also the salary</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1301 of 14 established staff. So, because of the Multi-Ethnic part of the Ministry, fully established that is an additional staff and the increase in salaries is catered for. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, I think what the honourable Minister for Finance has just said, that is also being allocated under the Multi-Ethnic Affairs. Going to SEG 7, last year $187,000 was given for the Sugar Cane Growers Council Election. I would like to ask the honourable Minister what that money was used for and now we see another $200,000 allocated for that? So are we going to have elections or what are these funds for? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, last year we announced that the elections is going to take place therefore we had budgeted $187,000 but there was this submission to the Elections Office, Solicitor-General’s Office for approval and to get a new regulation and laws changed; it took time. We could not utilise the $187,000 then. Now because the elections is going to happen this year, we have made this new provision. So, that $187,000 was never used because we are still going through the process, the process that your government had delayed during your time. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, can you ask him to stop referring to what we did, what we.…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> No, I want to remind you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> If I am going to start, he will be a sorry man.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- You can start:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Honestly, Mr. Chairman, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Because you are going to jail:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Please, he needs to behave.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> If I start, you are going to jail.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> This is not his supermarket, this is Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- I have a right to say:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> SEG 10, Mr. Chairman, so in other words he has confirmed that they are going to conduct the Sugar Cane Growers Elections; that is fine. SEG 10 - Sugar Cane Development and Farmers Assistance has been reduced to $1 million. Can the honourable Minister explain the reason for the reduction? HON. C. J. SINGH.- There has been an assessment done by the FSC and they have said that this money is sufficient, so be it. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on. HON. P. K. BALA.- Programme 1-1(10) New Farmers and Lease Premium Assistance last year, the allocation was $2 million and in this fiscal year, it is $1 million. Can the honourable Minister advise us on how many leases were issued last year amounting to $2 million and how many leases will be issued this year amounting to $1 million?</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>1302 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, we have renewed 300 leases last year and based on the figures given to me, we only have about 150 leases, so that will probably take care of with the $1 million. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted a clarification from the Minister on Cane Harvest and the Utilisation of Corrections Service personnel as highlighted in SEG 7 costing $320,000. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, there is an ongoing programme by the Ministry to re- engage the prisoners to come and harvest and that is the amount that was basically being told by the Corrections Service that they will require so that is the amount that we allocated. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I have one question, Sir, on Programme 2-1(7). There is a new allocation of $500,000 for Special Advisory Committee. I note the District Advisory Councillors in Head 18 with an allocation of $767,960. Can the honourable Minister elaborate more on this Special Advisory Committee? What will be their role and what is the component as well because the Advisory Councillors are already in Head 18? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, I had discussed with the honourable Prime Minister about transferring the Advisory Councillors under my Ministry which he has endorsed and it will come through Cabinet, so once that has happened, then obviously we will take care of paying these Advisory Councillors through our Ministry. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, these are two different issues. The District Advisory Councillors are already in Head 18 and if they are transferred to your Ministry, that will come with the allocation, but you have this $500,000. I am asking about this new allocation of $500,000. (Inaudible interjection) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I can clarify that. I think the Minister was partly right. Because you asked the question about advisory, he answered the advisory question but this advisory committee, this is the discussion that we had when the Ministry requested this allocation. It is a new allocation, it is supposed to be a Special Committee consisting of inter-agency representatives, government ministries, religious leaders who will meet every month to identify issues within the communities, particularly land and other issues, conflicts, tolerance. This Committee is supposed to then advise the Minister. It was part of the recommendation of the review and the recommendation from the Committee that was supported by the New Zealand Government. So, this is an initiative out of those recommendations. It is a new allocation. It could be one-off allocation, depending on what the Committee does in this financial year. So, this is separate from the Advisory Councillors, whose purpose is for rural development and other activities. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, now, it has been clarified that Special Advisory Committee is not the Advisory Councillors allocation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> So, it is not partly right, it is fully wrong.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1303 (Laughter) Mr. Chairman, Sir, going back to SEG 7 – Language, Culture and Arts ($2.2 million), who are the beneficiaries of this allocation? HON. C. J. SINGH.- First of all, through you, Mr. Chairman, I want him to learn about culture and arts as a member of Sangam. This allocation will help and teach you the culture and arts in this country. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I take those comments as offence. As I have said earlier on, he needs to behave. MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are becoming like a bloody market now.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Come on, let us behave like adults here. We do not want to go into this kind of exchanges. Hold on, honourable Minister. I hope you understand that. Parliament will now vote on Head 35 – Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry. Question put. Head 35 agreed to. Head 37- Ministry of Local Government MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is open for any comments. Programme 1-2? HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 7 – Special Administrators. Are we going to continue paying the illegally appointed Special Administrators? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, can I ask the honourable Member to rephrase and repeat his question, please. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, you all will recall that I mentioned in this Parliament few things that some of the Administrators that have been appointed is illegal and here there is an allocation to pay them. What I am saying is, are we going to continue to pay the taxpayers’ money pay to these illegal appointment of the Special Administrators? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Before I respond, Mr. Chairman, I think he needs to look at himself in the mirror first before he asks this question. This allocation is amounted to $7,000 and $4,000 will continue because we have appointed these Special Administrators in all the 13 Municipalities in Fiji. We have gone through the consultative process before they were appointed and the Ministry will continue to pay them. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, at least, I have heard this respond for the first time. On SEG 10 - Completion of Govind Park, Ba ($2,000,000). Some months ago, Mr. Chairman, the honourable Minister was in Ba and he has signed an agreement of around $8 million. It was also mentioned that those two projects will be completed by the end of December. What I am wondering is, the cost is around $8 million, the allocation here is $2 million, so where is the honourable Minister is going to get the balance of the money from?</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>1304 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. M. K. NALUMISA..- Mr. Chairman, through you, the honourable Member is right, there was a contract signed for Phase 2 of the Govind Park project to a tune of $8 million and the timeline, according to the work schedule, as well as the contractor is around February of next year. That is just the timeline. The allocation that we have here is because after a lapse of two years, then we have this project again and the view of the Ministry of Finance is that allocation should be enough. That will be based on some of the projects that have been undertaken because that has not been completed to whatever it was projected for. Even it was going to be done according to the phases, the Ministry of Finance is looking forward also into assisting the Ministry in paying out whatever amount will be needed to complete the project. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 - Special Administrators ($764,000). I note that the allowance of Special Administrators has increased from $392,000 to $764,000, which is 100 percent. Can the honourable Minister explain this increase? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation for Special Administrators is based on the numbers that we have. That is worked up to the end of the next financial year, and even before the determination of the Local Government Election date. As I have said, it is based on the numbers that we have already appointed. Some have already been terminated because of their inability to attend meetings. So, the full amount will not be utilised. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- So, the Special Administrator cost has really gone up and the taxpayers are paying for it. I am saying it has increased by 100 percent, but it has doubled. Instead of cutting cost, we are increasing costs, and this is one area where we could have cut costs. My next question is on SEG 10 - Completion of Lautoka Swimming Pool ($1,500,000). Last year, $4 million was allocated to this particular project. If you can tell us whether that money was used? If it was, great, but if it was not, then I can see, only $1.5 million is allocated for this year. What do you intent to do with $1.5 million? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, before I answer the second part of the question on swimming pool, the reason why there is also my explanation earlier on, on the increase in the budgetary allocation for Special Administrators is, I think everyone needs to understand that we have appointed Special Administrators for all the 13 Municipalities around the country. In the previous Administration, they have clustered some of the Councils but here, we have appointed Special Administrators for all the 13 Municipalities. So, there is a reason why the allocation increased. Also, moving to the Swimming Pool, there were lot of misunderstanding on why the swimming pool was never completed. The Lautoka City Council has that contractual arrangement with the contractors so they were in a position to work on that particular project. For the first six months of this financial year, the Ministry through the Lautoka City Council, was just trying to finalise some of the legal issues regarding the works that were not completed by the two contractors, as well as the Project Managers. So, that has already been taken care of. Now, the amount allocated for this financial year is to assist the Ministry, as well as the Council, in looking at the project together after the appointment of the Project Manager, which he has already been through the tender evaluation process. So, once that is finalised, then it will be up to the Project Manager to review the whole project again. So, based on whatever amount that we</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1305 have, we are confident that there will be some rescoping of the whole project, so they will be able to maintain and complete the project at a very minimal cost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, I thought I was given a chance to ask a question after honourable Bala for Activity 2. Are you still giving me that or you have passed? MR. CHAIRMAN.- I will allow that. HON. V. NATH.- Thank you for giving me the opportunity, Mr. Chairman. Sir, SEG 10 - National Fire Authority Capital Grant of $6.1 million, can the honourable Minister elaborate on this, knowing that in the 2023-2024 Budget, it was allocated $2.5 million but there was zero utilisation, nothing was done. How will the honourable Minister react on that? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, let me clarify first the $6.1 million that was allocated to the National Fire Authority through the capital grant. Now, this $6.1 million allocation is the Government’s 25 percent contribution towards the National Fire Authority’s Annual Budget, as clearly stipulated in the National Fire Services Act. This will be release to the Authority in the normal quarterly instalments for the financial year. Rightfully this $6.1 million should be part of the operational expenditure for National Fire Authority. HON. V. NATH.- Supplementary question, Mr. Chairman; it is written here ‘capital grant’, but the honourable Minister is saying it is operational as well, so I feel that, that needs to be corrected. The second part which I asked was that in the 2023-2024 budget, they were given $2.1 million, there was zero utilization, why? HON. M. K. NALUMISA. – On that $2.25 million that was allocated for this current financial year, the first project is for the construction of the new Navua Fire Station of $1.3 million and the work that has been completed is physical progress, civil works and fencing which has been 100 percent completed. Phase II which is the construction of the project itself is 52 percent completion rate. The next one is on the purchase of replacement of fire trucks and ambulances of around $800,000. The procurement contract has been signed and the relevant procurement process is in progress. The last one is on the maintenance, as well as repair and upgrading of Levuka Fire Station ($400,000) and for that one, it is 89 percent completed. The project should be completed by 21 st July, 2024, which is the current month. MR. CHAIRMAN. – Thank you. We will now move on. Programme 2 – 1? HON. P. D. KUMAR. –Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG7 – Urban Policy Action Plan Implementation. As far as I am aware of for this particular Action Plan, it has expired. So, I do not understand what is the implementation, is it the implementation of the old plan or are you reviewing or developing a new plan?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.:</span> We are developing a new plan, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> – Thank you.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>1306 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 My next question is related to the Town Planning Law Review - $10,000 is allocated to that. The Town Planning Act was already reviewed, along with the Subdivision Act. If you can tell us how this money will be utilized in that context? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, when I took office, I think this was something that I strongly believe needs to be reviewed - the Town Country Planning Act. There was also a paper that was submitted to Cabinet, I think around 2021, and I am told that we need things with SG’s Office, something that we need to review again. I had a meeting with the Town Country Planning Advisory Committee and they still feel that there is a need for us to review and go through the papers again. And if there is a need for us to review, then we need to do more consultations before we can come up with the final review of that Act. HON. P. D. KUMAR. – Thank you, honourable Minister, much appreciated. Can you assure us whether these two legislations will come to Parliament this year because the work was done, as I said, and it was done through a very wide consultation. Even all the past Directors were called to give their views on that particular piece of legislation. In fact, even an expert from Australia gave her opinion on the legislation. So, I think the consultation was very widely done and maybe just about 10 percent or 5 percent of the work is done. Can you please bring that legislation to this Parliament, thank you? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. I caution you to be careful with those kinds of leading questions. If you are so sure that you can bring the two legislations as stated by honourable Premila Kumar, then I urge you to answer. Otherwise, you just take that as kind of a statement coming from her to you. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Chairman, I need to first take it through Cabinet before I can confirm the dates. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 37 – Ministry of Local Government. Question put. Head 37 agreed to. Head 38 – Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. Programme 1-1? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, this is to do with Programme 1-1(10) Tourism Fiji - Marketing Grant. In light of the fact that we may face some lesser activity in the tourism industry, which is being predicted, is this a sufficient marketing grant to cover not just our traditional areas like Australia and New Zealand or are we looking at some other places in and around Asia like in China, India, et cetera. Is that sufficient to cover that also? Are we doing that to ensure that we do not lose out because they are our higher spending tourists? Will that cover it? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, the tourism industry up to the end of June is 8 percent ahead of last year; last year was a record year. In tourism, if make the first six months comfortably, the next six months should be, normal the high seasons, so we are riding comfortably now going forward. Indeed, the way we are going, there is no more low season or high season in tourism. It is only high-end soldier. One of the honourable Members had expressed that the forwards are weakening. This is driven largely by, that the inventory in the country is maxed. They can no longer find rooms, hence the low pickup going forward.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1307 It behoves to build rooms in the country. I think ANZ was also saying this lately that the growth over the next two years will very much be dictated by the lack of inventory on the ground. In terms of developing market stalls out of the traditional markets, Asia in particular, India, Japan, yes indeed there are provisions for marketing in those areas within this allocation. I have the undertaking from the honourable Minister for Finance that if the need arises they can always secure more funding into those non-traditional markets. All in all, we are quite comfortable with the way we are tracking tourism right now, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> There is an increase of $5 million from last year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.:</span> Yes, it is very welcomed. The $30 million last year was used quite effectively, hence the way we are growing now. The advantage with tourism is the sense of partnership, that a $35 million that we contribute as the Government is one-third of the overall marketing for the country; the airlines pitch in and the operators also. For Fiji to be enjoying these kind of numbers is really is the 35 million three times over because of the partnership, that is, the normal structure, how you market in partnership with the operators. As you know, we have a big billboards in Time Square in New York. That is unheard of in the past, we even took eggs on CNN, it was never heard of in the past. It is because of the partnership that is there between the government, airlines and the operators. That is where we always make sure that we drive this partnership by committing sufficient allocation for tourism marketing. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I really was trying to ask whether we actually concentrating on getting the non-traditional markets with more advertisements because there is a high yield that comes out of those non-traditional markets, but I think the honourable Minister has answered what I asked for. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister on SEG 6 – South Pacific Tourism Organisation - Rent ($142,000), what does that mean? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO) made up of the 12 or 14 countries of the Pacific. We host them in Fiji, the office is here in Fiji and we are responsible for the rent. We are renting FNPF for them. In the same way that we host other regional bodies, we also host SPTO in Fiji. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 38 – Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. Question put. Head 38 motion agreed to. Head 40 – Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport MR. CHAIRMAN.- Floor is now open for comments, shall we begin with Programme 1-1? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 10 – Capital Grants: Fiji Roads Authority there is quite a substantative drop here of around $40 million, if I am correct, and I do realise that there is $5 million set aside for rural roads with PWD later on in this Budget. Can the honourable Minister enlighten us on the reasoning behind the big drop in the capital gratnt for FRA?</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>1308 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, may I answer that? The decrease is essentially due the completion of some of the big capital projects including the loan funded Transport Infrastructure Investment Project which is likely to end in July 2025. We took that into account and looked at what FRA would be able to deliver, given that some of the work would also be done by the Public Works Department. HON. J. USAMATE.- Another question, Sir. Request the honourable Minister to give us some details with your permission, Sir, the two projects under direct payments which is the Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Management Project by ADB for $2.35 million and the Transport Infrastructure Investment Sector Project (TIISP) ADB, I think it is a new one, of $12.84 by ADB and the World Bank, a component of $14.1 million. Can you just give us a brief highlight on that? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, that is a direct payment allocation in terms of $2.35 million financed through the loan grant facility at ADB, handled directly by the Ministry of Finance to the contactors for the implementation of clean water programmes, in particular the completion of the Viria project and retention claims for the relevant contractors, Sinohydro Corporation and sub-contractors. HON. J. USAMATE.- For Viria?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, for Viria.</p><p>(Inaudible interjection) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That is ADB $12.8 million and World Bank - $14.7 million. This is a direct payment allocation, financed through the loan grant facility at ADB, handled also by the Ministry of Finance directly to the contractors for the implementation of key roads and bridges. The $12.8 million is to cater for the King’s Road upgrade, and the design and investigation works for the identified 40 affected bridges around the country. This has been earmarked for replacement in the next financial year. HON. J. USAMATE.- The continuation of the work around Viti Levu or is it for other areas?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, that is correct.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- Mr:</span> Chairman, on SEG 10, Capital Grant: Water Authority of Fiji ($135,820,924) Viria Project. We had some discussions on compensation. Honourable Minister, is the Government paying that? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman. There were some discussions on that in terms of the legality of it. Looking at the legality of it, the land in question is freehold, but what was in question was the compensation for the fisheries. That again is subject to the legal assessment, and the first assessment is that the fisheries compensation is applicable to foreshore. There were other claims too regarding water royalty which is not in the current legal frameworks plus other issues which were based, I think, $10 million was bended around, but the legal basis for that is not there. Of course, there were other issues regarding development which we are also including in our budget for the rural roads which is the development of the roads and the connection of water, which we have also discussed with them. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, so the sum which I just mentioned is basically only for the project, we are not talking about the other components which you have just mentioned?</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1309 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What component? HON. V. NATH.- Which I mentioned, the compensation. I am asking the honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He just said that there is no legal basis:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> I am just asking, this amount which is written there $135,820,924, that is basically the whole payment for the project? Is that right? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- No, that is for the total capital grant for the capital works for Water Authority of Fiji, for everything in the capital works programme. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question to the honourable Minister on direct payment. We have talked about Viria Water Project. Can the honourable Minister tell us the anticipated date by when this project will be completed, because people are waiting for this project to be completed and some relief in terms of getting water in their taps? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, the project is already on line. You would have, I suppose noticed from the public the improved water services, the pressure, et cetera from the Suva- Nausori corridor. But the major construction works have been completed; main gravity, line on November 2023 designed building operate issues 23 but at the moment the Water Authority of Fiji is looking at the commissioning certificates and the closure of the design and build phase after the contractors submitted various documents which are required. At the end of July, it is expected that we will 90 percent complete the WAF quarters, landscaping works and the rural works at the Waitolu Reservoir, the road works and the reinstatement of footpaths along the pipe route. The last part is the design and build phase contractor to submit the compliance documents which is expected at the end of this month. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-2. HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Minister on SEG 4 - Repair and maintenance, hydrologically equipment ($130,000). Two issues here that I just wanted to ask in terms of the MET. One of the most important things that we have now is in relation to floods. I am looking at this expenditure on repair and maintenance of hydrological equipment. It has a budget now of $130,000 and is a reduction of $20,000 from last year. My concern in this particular area is about the flood gauges because the biggest disaster that we have in this country in flood gauges, sometimes we have them but they are not sending information or the gauges are out of kilter or something like that. So, with all these equipment in place, will it make sure that all those flood gauges are up and running, not only working but transmitting information down to Nadi. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, that is for funding to procure the hydrological equipment including the spare parts which some will need to be procured from overseas which is $100,000 and $41,000 from local materials. So, this is envisaged to complete the project or the task which is identified there. HON. J. USAMATE.- I just hope that all those flood gauges will be up in running and transmitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes:</span></p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>1310 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman with your permission in terms of the Radar Operational Expenses ($15,000); the three radars that we have around the country. It decreased from $7,000. This year there is a decrease of $7,000. The reason for the decrease in that same SEG 4?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This is to cater for the radar bi-annual servicing and cleaning:</span></p><p>That was the amount used in the previous year, which is why the reduction.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> The reduction is $7,000 from last budget to this.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> But perhaps the reason because you have just changed that other radar, that is now fully complete, you have a new one. My last question on SEG 9, Mr. Chairman, I think this is new, Disaster Recovery Infrastructure ($190,000). I think this looks new to me. Can you just explain what it is all about? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- So, basically it is one of the components of the Disaster Recovery Plan with Meteorological Services, given the critical nature of its services and it is to do with the ITC, the backup services renewal of the main production services and the backup services. So, that is the $190,000 which is allocated there and also the CIS093 system cut-off and handover. So, it is basically the IT backup for the whole six services systems. One of the main concerns from the Meteorological Services over the last 24 months. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3- 1? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Programme 3-1(8) - Rural Roads with an allocation of $5 million which is appreciated. My question, Sir, is, will this work be outsourced, or will this be carried out by the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport? Simply because looking at other activities, we have the Mechanical Unit, Building Unit, Electrical Unit, Joinery and Plumbing, Energy, but there is no unit where you have the Department of National Roads that has the heavy plant component that does this. The honourable Minister before taking up the job, has always been saying about getting rid of FRA and bringing back PWD. How will this allocation be handled, given that we do not have the Department of National Roads with the necessary machines that are supposed to be purchased? As the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport had alluded to earlier in most of his speeches. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- In the last Budget, we had allocated funds for the acquisition of machines and that is currently in progress but for this one, we are looking at various components regarding the Rural Roads. If we are not using those then we will also be utilising or outsourcing. In terms of whether we have allocated that? Just roughly with Divisional Engineer Central Eastern - $1.3 million, Divisional Engineer West - $2.3 million, Divisional Engineer North - around $1.5 million. So, this is distributed according to the need there and this has also been coordinated with FRA. So, whatever they are not covering, we will complement it with this. It is not only for roads but it is also foot-crossings, the drainage works and also initiating gravel stockpiles in key areas, those are the main components of that.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1311 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is a general question to the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport, I have noted from the question that I had asked earlier on. It was a written question and we have got the response from the Ministry of Finance, that quite a number of projects were not completed, and it was all related to Public Works Department carrying out those works, simple things like walkways for CWM Hospital was not done and I am sure most of the Ministers sitting around the room cannot move forward. We just wanted to understand some of the difficulties you are facing in terms of setting up this Public Works Department, or you may have other strategies to move this work forward because when the work is not completed, it is not realised on the ground and the benefits are not accrued. So, just from that perspective. Thank you, honourable Minister. HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, I think what needs to be clearly understood is the situation which we are in or were in, in terms of the resources both, human resources and equipment. In order to rebuild that, I think the equipment part is simple, it is just the human resources, as we understand the lack of skills in specific areas, particularly for operators’ trade skills and that is one of the main challenges we are facing. Not only that, we have to build that up, so in this budget, we have included that in terms of human resources but will continue to build that up in order to cater for the increased demand from the Ministries. One of the delays was that we were working at the human resources level which was geared towards what was there before. But as we increase the demand, we need to increase the work and this year, we have budgeted for an increase in project staff which will also cater for the increased work. For example, for the key institutions - CWMH, some of the Government Quarters and for the Department of Works, we have increased the budget for the Government Quarters, as mentioned in the various Divisions, and prioritised according to those which have really deteriorated. We have started on some, but as we discussed, the resources are limited from the last budget, but with the increase with the PWD in terms of the upgrade and enhancement of Quarters, that will be included there - the increased number of Project staff. Thank you HON. J. USAMATE.- Just in relation to the establishment of PWD, I am glad honourable Minister that when you were initially talking about this, you were talking about replacing FRA with PWD. I am glad that you have now seen the light and…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I did not say that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> … decided to keep FRA. But last year, we did have $5 million for PWD. What exactly was it that we have achieved, because if you see the way you have structured it now, you have put $5 million last year and this year, you are putting aside $5million, plus $6 million to actually do work. From what you are saying so far, it looks like that $5 million that you had last year did not really put in your place to get PWD going. The $11 million this year looks to be $11 million to get things done for the $5 million that you had last year has put you in a stage to get PWD doing things, because this $11 million instigate is about getting things done. So, did that $5 million put you into that space to start moving things forward or is it still delaying or is it still in the preparatory phase to develop PWD? Where are we? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- No, the $5 million last year some have been expended and committed. HON. J. USAMATE.- Not all?</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>1312 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Oh, very poor.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Because we had some issues again, as mentioned, regarding the tenders, et cetera, and of course the capacity within, which we have rectified in terms of the capacity. We have mentioned project management, tenders, accessing tenders those technical side. We have procured and I think some equipment have arrived. For this additional $6 million here, this includes the various the upgrading of Quarters not only that but even the facilities under the Ministry. We are looking at Kadavu, Tuvuca, Rotuma, some of the Quarters, the Boiler Shops, the Divisional Engineers Workshops, so these all needs to be brought up to par because they have not been operational for some time. With this budget, we will run definitely and with the Projects staff which have been included to really get into the business of addressing the deteriorated properties, including staff quarters in Divisions. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I have noticed you have talked about the shortage of skilled workers and I totally agree with you. I am just thinking - one of the greatest sources of skill tradespeople in this country in the past used to be from PWD through the Apprenticeship Scheme. Is that something you are considering, although you get the fruits of it in three, four and five years time? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is included in the budget but not really on a wide scale because they need to come in under Supervisors. So, we need to build them in phases, have the experience and qualified staff there and the apprentices need to come under those, then we move forward. We can include them as part of the Project staff. I do not want to say labour but as part of the learning environment. I just want to say that I never said that we will throw out FRA. I said that we will move forward in a responsible and careful manner so that nothing is duplicated but in a complementary manner. Vinaka. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-3. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, through you, honourable Minister, in relation to SEG 8 – Extension of Grid Power – Rotuma and Lakeba Government Power Stations ($960,000), can you just elaborate a bit on that? The other question is, why is Kadavu not included? The reason I ask is because the capacity of these generators is such is to get the maximum out of it, you need more customers online. So, it is just the phases, you start with Lakeba and Rotuma first, then Kadavu later because they are the three major stations that we have, apart from Nabouwalu. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- So, $960,000, honourable Member, is allocated as you quite rightly pointed out for Rotuma and Lakeba. Lakeba is to extend the grid from Bau Village to Waciwaci Village to Waitabu Village for a distance of about 5 kilometers, connecting about 115 households who are maintaining the existing 313 customers. Rotuma will connect about 80,000 households, while maintaining existing 1,198 customers, so that is the allocation. HON. J. USAMATE.- Are there any plans for Kadavu?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Next year:</span></p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1313 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, Kadavu is not mentioned in this. Programme 4-1. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 10 – Housewiring for Completed Grid Extension Projects ($2 million). Again, $2 million is given this year. Last year, $2 million was given and this money was not used at all. So, if the honourable Minister can tell us what kind of hurdles he faced and why that project was not completed? What guarantee is there that we are all going to support and this $2 million will be able to complete this? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I can, $1.6 million was utilised for the 2023-2024 Budget. So far, that is the latest that I am giving you. Sir, $2 million is, of course, provided for the ongoing wiring contracts, and the project houses have been identified. Just to give you comfort, I think the Ministry is much better prepared now for the execution of the next budget. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, for the decrease, there are two components of that - the decrease in budget consideration for EFL Rural Grid Extension. This project consists of the rural grid extension and house wiring where the grant is transferred to EFL to implement these projects. The Ministry has recently released $4.1 million allocation for the 2023-2024 Financial Year. This can enable the EFL to complete the pending grid extension and house wiring. This will further increase the grant disbursed to EFL. So, the utilisation rate of the $16 million provided from the past year, is around 70 percent to-date which has assisted 1,545 villages and rural settlements. But the crux of the matter is that the implementation or the rollout has been a problem. So, that is why we did not allocate for the funds because the funds are already there, and we need to utilise that this year. Mr. Chairman, some of the challenges include the limited number of companies that are able to do this work because these are outsourced. It is very technical work and they also face serious staffing issues - retention of staff, et cetera. The other one is the sourcing of materials regarding this work from overseas and the increased cost. I think there was an issue with some of the suppliers. Of course, we will need to work with EFL on how to improve the implementation and whether the fund should be sitting there in the Department of Energy, which is something that we will need to discuss, given the ongoing challenges in rolling this out. Also included in that was the Climate Change Resilient Renewable Energy Development Project in Taveuni where $350,000 had been allocated before but this is nearing completion. I think it is ready for commissioning. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, just a question on house wiring. There may be some other projects but there is a project with the Department of Energy that assists communities living in informal settlements in getting their house connected to electricity - wiring et cetera. I know of a community just residing at the back of Caubati Road, that is Cunningham Road. The electricity is there and the line is there, but that community is not able to access electricity. I contacted the Director of Energy, he sent someone over to that community, but nothing has really progressed. So, I feel that the functions, et cetera, of the Department of Energy needs to be relooked at and how we can make them more responsible for some of the projects which the Government tries to deliver to the public. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- As I have mentioned, we will need to, at some point in time, decide whether we complement the private sector with the technical people within the Government</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>1314 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 who can roll it out, or are we going to keep on relying on the private sector, given these challenges. So, that is where the human resource plan comes in, in terms of apprentices and all that kind of HR planning which needs to come into play. It is not an overnight thing, it is something that we need to plan properly for. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 8 - Replacement of Muana Hydro Turbine ($356,522) and the Upgrade of Buca Hydro and Tiliva Solar Micro Grid (173,913). I thank the Government for this, knowing that Buca Hydro is initially a Turkish Government assistance and, of course, the one in Muana has been a lot of problems for quite a long time as well. My question to the honourable Minister is, with this upgrade, I am not sure about Muana whether that will mean extending to a few nearby villages within the Natewa area but, of course, in Buca initially when it was commissioned we were told that the source is sufficient with the right to supply energy to the nearby villages as well apart from Buca alone. So, you have Loa, Tukavesi, I know the honourable Minister for Lands has forgotten Loa. This upgrade means extending to these nearby villages. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Just brief on those two the replacement of Muana Hydro Plant. This was damaged in February 2024 details of the components, bearing casing was burnt given the high speed rotations, broken pool, et cetera. The experts in Renewable Energy Solutions have provided an estimate of the works which is around $409,000. This will progress that. In terms of the grid from that and the extent of the coverage, I do not have those details but I can provide it later. In Buca, the $173,000, Fiji Government and ADBF signed an agreement for funding support from the Japan fund for prosperous and resilience Asia and the Pacific for the rehabilitation of Buca Hydro Plant and Tiliva Solar Micro Grid. So, total funding of $3.4 million where the Japanese organisation will contribute US$3 million and Fiji Government the amount stated there. As I mentioned, it is something that we need to implement. It is funded there. There are agreements in place and we need to move forward on that. So, the coverage again, I can advise later as I get the detail. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 10 - Housewiring for Completed Grid Extension. Are the villages in Ra and Tailevu North also included in this housewiring grid extension villages like Sawanivo Village, Namara Village, Rokovuaka Village and Colata Settlement in Wainibuka. Can the honourable Minister give a clarification on that, please?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I will provide that to him, I do not have the full list with me.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- He has been raising this for quite some time. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I have to search from the long list which is here but I will share it with you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- l hope it is there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.:</span> Also, honourable Bulitavu is telling me to include him.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, in relation to SEG 8, I just go back a bit. Last year we had $50,000 for Kadavu koro but I went there this year and it is still not working. Just for your information, honourable Minister, that is a hydro in Kadavu koro.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1315 For the replacement of Muana Hydro, that hydro was working. The problem was negligence by the people that run it. So, hopefully as part of this, we will make sure that we address that particular issue. In Buca, is this about fixing the hydro or road access to fix it before you can start fixing the turbines. The money that is set aside.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is the rehabilitation of the hydro plant and the micro-grid:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- And the access road:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I will have to confirm that. I do not have that details:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- On the Solar Hybrid Rehabilitation LAKARO:</span> LAKARO stands for Lakeba, Kadavu and Rotuma; all the solars are not working. So, this LAKARO is it for all three or is it just for one of them. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- This funding is to cover all three which is under that one project with the UAE and we have discussed with them regarding the rehabilitation of this and this funding is for that. We have had issues with this, with the contractor who put that up, so it is something we need to really decide but it is really for the rehabilitation of those three. HON. J. USAMATE.- So, with this rehabilitation, they will be running by the end of next year? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I cannot give any assurance on that. That is what we are hoping for. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 6, Activity 1. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, I noted that there is an increase in the LTA Capital Grant by almost $6 million and I am thankful to Government for that. That it is going to boost our road or safety activities. Honourable Minister, can you just clarify on this increase in terms of the projects to be undertaken that is covered in the $10 million capital grant for this year please? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- For the LTA Capital Budget, the main components would be the LTA integrated IT system - $3.5 billion. This is an ongoing project which also involves the re- engineering of the business processes from the start right up to the completion, the seamless type of operations. To streamline all that. The other one was the Labasa LTA Office, $1.5 million so that we can have a fully-fledged office there with weigh-bridge, et cetera. I think a few years ago one of the Ministers planted a coconut tree there to commission the new office, so the coconut tree is now bearing a lot of fruits. The $2.7 million Supply and Implementation of Hyper Converge Infrastructure with Backup Solution, do not ask me about this, I am not really an IT person. It is to create a robust, scaleable, secure infrastructure that will ensure business continuity and data integrity and security. I think those are the main ones, the other one, a $1 million is for installation of red lights speed camera and back office soft hardware. Also, it can increase revenue and instantly transfer TINs to an automated system and Portable Speed Camera - $1 million. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just to provide some colour to the explanation by the honourable Minister. Basically, what LTA is doing will actually transform the whole operations of LTA because they are going through a comprehensive, firstly review of the existing processes and then they will overlay it with an actual ITC system that automates a lot of the</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>1316 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 processes. So, potentially, I suspect what will happen is, all the queuing that happens in LTA will be a thing of the past, that is the whole objective. They can pay online, renew licenses online all those things will come to bear. We all know it takes us a day to go and renew our registration, so hopefully that will be gone. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 7. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG 5, I am still on Transport Activity 1, I have been given permission.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I did not hear him give permission:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Okay, we are reaching that stage now. Honourable Nath, you say this, this. You what, you are flipping out now? HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, I did indicate with Madam, I had one question for Programme 6-1(6) which is a valid question, that is, the Shipping Services Subsidy from Vatulele and Beqa. I do remember a few years ago with the Department of Transport… HON. C. J. SINGH.- Which Programme?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Programme 6-1.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- He has given me permission:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> No, no, no.

NATH.:</span> No really, Sir.</p><p>Sir, I am on Programme 6-1(6) – Shipping Services Subsidy. Thank you for giving me permission, Mr. Chairman. Just one question to the honourable Minister, I do remember a few years ago, the Department of Transport did a household survey and a passenger movement survey for Vatulele and Beqa to Suva. Is this programme included honourable Minister? HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The Shipping Services Subsidy ($3.4 million). I wanted to explain the whole thing, but what was the question again.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> Vatulele, Beqa, Suva.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> It covers 174 trips annually across 10 specific routes. The breakdown of the allocation includes varying amounts for each ranging from 5,812 for Beqa, Vatulele and Yanuca. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 40 – Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport.. Question put. Head 40 agreed to.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1317 Head 50 – Miscellaneous Services. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments. SEG1? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I have seen that the salary contingency has increased from $1.5 million to $5 million. Can the Minister explain the change? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Essentially, as the name suggests, this Contingency Funding is set aside to meet any unbudgeted salary commitment that may arise during the year. Sometimes it is a result of a Job Evaluation Exercise and sometimes shortfalls in the budget that needs to be corrected for ministries and departments. We had a similar allocation in 2023 – 2024 Budget, so there was no utilisation. Given that we had 5,000 civil servants already receiving a salary increase and the remaining will be paid from this Financial Year (1 st August) so if there is any mismatch somewhere, we can just fund it. That is why we increased by $3.5 million.</p></body>
