<body><h3>HON. P.K. BALA.- SEG 8.</h3><h4>HON. P.K. BALA.- SEG 8.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> Yes, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.:</span> So, that will be the total cost for the renovation of the building, around $600,000. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- One allocation to the renovation of the Matanakilagi House so that our residents can be moved to that location. The other allocation is to the renovation of the current which is no longer because when they move it will be vacant, but as I mentioned, there is the option of actually relocating that particular Golden Age Home altogether because of the current space that is located at. It is also located near a very busy intersection and for future growth, we should consider perhaps moving it to another location within Lautoka that has more acreage, there is more opportunity to have a senior citizens park, for more recreational activities, so that is what we are currently considering but we need to move our current residents first which is why Matanakilagi House is being renovated. So, that is a different allocation. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, it is a humble request for the Ministry or the Government to reconsider the location that you want to take those senior citizens to. I will give you the reason. It is just next to the highway.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- That building is facing two main roads. You can imagine the noise and the environment that is going to happen there:</span> So, it is our plea if you can look into that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> Thank you, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman:</span> I am just seeking clarification on Programme 1-1(8) - Upgrade of Child Wellbeing Centre ($230,000). I do understand that late last month and early this month, you did mention that you are wanting to set up the first ever Child Wellbeing Centre which I am thankful for because it caters for all the children that are roaming around our cities and towns. You are saying here that it is upgraded. So, you already have an existing building? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, I had indicated in my Budget Response Speech that we have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Methodist Church of Fiji.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1265 They have donated their Vunirewa Bible School for us to use. So, yes, there is a current location and it does need renovation to be fit for purpose. So, that is what is being allocated in the current budget before us. As I have also mentioned, it is still subject to Cabinet approval, as well as the consultation with line Ministries. It will have a clinical component which will need consultation with the Ministry of Health. It may also require consultation with the Ministry of Defence as the focal point, as well as possible, the review of police powers. As you know we continue to state this to the media and those that ask that we do not have the power to just grab children off the streets or adults, unless there is a commission of a crime and when we do take them to return them to their homes, they come back to the streets. It is just for their safety to remove them off the street but not to confine them in such a centre. That will also require the review of police laws for that purpose because as you know, if you are to commit anyone currently to St. Giles hospital, you need the consent of the family, a very close relative in order to that. So, there are different line Ministries that will be involved in this, so the consultation needs to take place. It is still subject to Cabinet approval, there is a programme component of it that also requires funding, but it is not contained in this budget because we are seeking donor funding for that. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG8 – Renovation of Temporary Lautoka Aged Care Home ($344,900), and I understand that is the Matanakilagi House. If that is the one, then I recall the Oral Question that I asked, you have said that this house will be renovated in eight months and the residents will move in. So, it means it is not done yet and the money was not utilised. HON. L. D. TABUYA.-It has been done. We are still in the process of scoping before we can actually do the renovations, as you would understand as a former Minister, there are processes to follow. That is being undertaken. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you, honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, yes, definitely we know. This fund was given to the Ministry of Women for the whole of last year. This work was not done and now, this budget has come back in this year’s Budget Estimate. We just hope that this work is completed. That is all I would like to say because this money is not spent and I recall, when you responded to that question, you said it in this Parliament, it is in the Daily Hansard, in eight weeks it will be renovated but it is not renovated. That is the point that I want to make. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member, that is noted. The fact that it has not been used last year, I had explained in my response to that question, was that we had the funds ready to renovate the Ba Mission Hospital, even up to nine months into the project but that did not happen, that fell through. So, we had to look for another location and that took time so that explains why we were not able to utilise it in the last Budget year completely. But that is noted, thank you, honourable Member. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- On SEG9 - Purchase – Boat and Outboard Engine ($18,000), I do not understand that allocation. Is there a correction that is required there? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question. It actually is the cost of purchasing an 80 HP Long Shaft Outboard Engine for Kadavu to be fitted to the Kadavu eagle</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1266 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 boat which is what we use in Kadavu so that our officers can move around in Kadavu. So, that is the allocation of $18,000. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Boat and Outboard Engine, honourable Minister, is that correct, and not ‘Board’? If that can be taken care of, the correction?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> Yes, Mr. Chairman, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Programme 2-1? HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, SEG5 - Expenses for Juveniles ($35,000), it is a very important area that involves a lot of care, nurturing and rehabilitation work for our juveniles. Can you clarify on this expenses and is this enough for its purpose? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for the question. There has actually been an increase in this allocation. It was $25,000 in the previous Budget, so I thank the honourable Minister for Finance for this increase because it does cater for the boys’ welfare expenses, including school stationery, uniform, et cetera. As you know, the Juveniles, when they come through the Centre, they are not staying there for a long period of time. They are usually in remand from around the Divisions in the country. It is probably one or two who are convicted, and they are staying at the home. The expenses vary but there has been an increase, and like I mentioned, what it caters for, there is also travelling cost for the boys when they are allowed on a day out or for summer camps. It is part of their rehabilitation programme with the NGO that works with them which is called Inspire Pacific. There has been an increase in this allocation, and we are very thankful for that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on. Programme 2-2? HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 2-2(10) – Welfare Graduation Programme. I want to know the effectiveness of the programme? What percentage of people who went through the programme last year are no longer receiving assistance? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for the question. This welfare graduation programme, in the previous Government, a lot of allocation was not used, so we only saw the engagement of welfare recipients through the Jobs for Nature programme which is the World Bank programme. But as far as the Ministry is concerned, this allocation was not used but we had to go through this past year to actually have the positions for the setup of an actual Welfare Graduation Unit within the Department of Social Protection which never existed before. We are setting up this Welfare Graduation Unit and we now currently engage two staff to be in that unit. As part of our review of the Social Protection Information System, we have to find those welfare recipients who have been on the programme for over 10 years and have continued to be on the welfare programme when they really should be graduated out of the programme, so this is being part of our work. The need for a targeted approach so that we can identify these recipients who will then be trained, because the Ministry, will not be able to do this but to align them with institutions like Pacific Polytech and other vocational institutions, as well as placing them in places of employment through some, sort of, formal attachment or apprenticeship programme.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1267 That is what we are working on, we just had the positions jilted as you know that weird word ‘jilted’ and you are very familiar as a former HR, but we have to do that and that took some time. So, they are now in the Welfare Graduation Unit and ready to roll for the next budget year. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-1? HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 3-1(8) - Completion of Fiji Barefoot College. I think last year, $1 million was allocated. What is the progress on the completion of Fiji Barefoot College? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for the question. I want to start off by stating that the name that has been used which is the Barefoot College, that is currently under review in terms of the relationship between the Ministry and Barefoot College International. When I came into the Ministry, there was a breakaway from Barefoot India to Barefoot International and we met with them and they wanted to take up this project but what they had needed was our commitment from our end before they would seek funding to do this programme. That was in our opinion not secure enough. There was a legal battle between the two organisations about the use of name and logo so that, of course, created more delays for us. But in the meantime, we did look out for alternative providers like International Solar Alliance is willing to come on board but this is subject to Cabinet approval, of course. The construction of the Nadogo Complex is near completion, you will see a reduction in the budget because these are just the final contractual payments for the completion of the project. The project is ready to go, we have the funds allocated to cater for the final payment to the contractor, Sambhu Lal Construction. The consultancy fees to the lead consultant Shri Singh and Associates and the installation of solar panels by the sub-contractor Clay Energy Limited. So that is what is left to pay, as you know in construction, there are always variations and final payments. So that is what it will cater for. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 6 – Grant to Women Institutions. What we have found out that the distribution of these funds is done equally, irrespective of the size of the institution. Do you think it is a fair way of doing this or you going to change the formula or the format that you have? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Sir, we actually have a reduction this year of $100,000. We allocate it to five women’s groups who have been doing their proper accounting back to the Ministry and have been proving their existence. We have the Makoi Vocational Centre, the Ba Women’s Forum, the Life Bread Foundation and the Homes of Hope, so that is a $100,000 each. We have reduced the other $100,000 which was supposed to go a Women’s Safe Shelter in Lautoka because we are still struggling to secure a vendor to run the shelter. We put out the tender, we put out the advertisements but there is being no office to run the Centre for us. The tender has been withdrawn and the $400,000 should be sufficient to support the four institutions that are listed in this Financial Year. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, the honourable Minister has not answered my question. What I asked was that we had found out that this allocation was distributed equally to all the women institutions irrespective of the size or the membership of those institutions. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Honourable Member, again this is what has been undertaken from the previous government and what these women’s groups have proven, it is not necessarily the size that matters, it is the activities that they undertake and the frequency of activities and the training that they conduct, they continue to make submissions and acquittals that meet what the Ministry requires. So, there have been no accountability or governance issues from these organisations. In fact, Ba</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1268 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 Women’s Forum which you should be very proud of honourable Member, has done such great work and today they have not requested further funding. So, they are pretty well funded too from other sources. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on Head 24 – Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. Question put. Head 24 agreed to. Head 25 – Ministry of Youth and Sports MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments, any comments? HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Chairman, needing clarification from the honourable Minister on Programme 1-1(5) – Fiji National Youth Band. How many band members would be paid from the Fiji National Youth Band allocation; and will they be employed as a part-time or full-time employee? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, from the outset of Ministry of Youth and Sports’ core roles are to empower the youths of Fiji and promote sports as a means of fostering community coercion, healthy lifestyles and national pride. In addition to its core responsibilities focusing and facilitating youth and sports development though the establishment of a conducive policy environment and having strategic support structures. This year we have been allocated $23.4 million, a 20 percent increase from last year’s budget. We go to the question being asked by the honourable Member and I him you for that. The Fiji National Youth Band, currently we have absorbed most of the Band members into establishments and General Wage Earners (GWE), about 10 of them and we are left with three. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.– SEG 10 – Upgrade of Youth Training Centre. Which Youth Training Centre would be upgraded and funded from this allocation? Does this allocation include the repairs of the burnt down Naleba Training Centre? HON. J. SAUKURU.- The allocation in SEG 10 is for Yavitu Youth Training Centres. As you know from last year, people were allocated certain amount of money as well, but due to things that are beyond our control on the delivery, we could not do that upgrade. We are raising it again for this year for Yavitu Training Centre. It does not include Naleba Training Centre. Naleba we are still negotiating with a donor agency if they can fund Naleba, we are still talking to them right now. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(5) - Volunteer Expenses Claim. Can the honourable Minister clarify that? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, the Volunteer Expenses is to cater for additional staff engaged through NEC on volunteer basis in assisting the Ministry during emergency basis and also provide work experience for our young Fijians. We do have volunteers too in the Ministry. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-3. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Minister which company is providing services for the Social Media Management at a rate of $45,000? SEG 5, my apologies.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1269 HON. J. SAUKURU.- It is on Activity 3, I am sorry. Mr. Chairman, this allocation is used for the upgrade of the communication and media gadgets marketing and publication for the Ministry. We have our IT Unit and that is allocated for them. MR. CHAIRMAN.- A question raised is what company? You are saying, honourable Minister that is an internal one?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, this is done in-house.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Programme 2-1. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 2-1(6), Sports Scholarships. I note that this budget has been reduced from $300,000 to $190,000. If the honourable Minister can clarify the reason for this reduction, or whether this money has been given to TELS for sports scholarships? If you can kindly explain that? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the reduction is largely due to low utilisation, plus a lot of these sport men and women are also eligible for other scholarships under TELS, if they want to study in any other field. That is why the utilisation was low and that is why we reduced it a little bit. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, a question to the honourable Minister for Finance. Do you not think this should go under TELS rather than the Ministry of Youth and Sports? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, there are specific sporting programmes where they want to get training, for example, if someone wants to get into archery, it is a short training programme somewhere in Korea, so they will get a scholarship but by and large, the utilisation was small so we have reduced it, because a lot of those young men and women are studying at different universities, so they do not engage in specific scholarships which will take them away from here. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, thank you for your explanation. It is hard to believe that Fiji being a sporting nation, there is not a lot of uptake for this sports scholarships. Now I understand, maybe through your social media management and awareness raising, the numbers can go up. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, currently the scholarships awards, there are: • Swimming - eight recipients • Athletics - one recipient (Yeshnil Karan) • AFL – six recipients plus one coach • Gymnastics - one recipient • Archery - two recipients • Yachting - one recipient on part time MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, do you still want to go into those details?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> No, Mr. Chairman, the question has been answered.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Programme 2-1(5), Purchase -Sports Equipment ($20,000). My question to the honourable Minister is whether it is sufficient, and the purchase of sports equipment is for which organisation?</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1270 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, we have allocated $20,000 for sports equipment. I think at the moment we feel that we are content with the budget allocated for that. This is to assist youth clubs and sporting organisations that need assistance on sports equipment like rugby balls, tackle bags, soccer balls, volleyballs so they are assisted from this fund. HON. A. N. TUICOLO. - Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-1(8), needing clarification from the honourable Minister. How many hard courts will be constructed from the allocation, will it also include the maritime islands? HON. J. SAUKURU. - Mr. Chairman, the construction of hard courts, there has been an allocation for this Financial Year - one for Holy Cross, Natabua Housing, Tatayaya in Rakiraki and Tuatua, Labasa. That’s for the completion for the Tuatua hardcourt in, Labasa. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head No. 25. Question put. Head 29 agreed to. Head 30 – Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, my question to the honourable Minister for Agriculture is Programme 1-1(6) – Agriculture Marketing Authority – Operating Grant has been reduced by $500,000. Since AMA plays a crucial part in market accessibility for all our farmers, will this grant not reduce their capacity to perform and also in the SEG 10 – Agriculture Marketing Authority – Capital Grant of $1 million has been allocated. Will the Minister be kind enough to advise what would this grant be used for? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the reduction was justified and AMA can operate within the amount that has been given. For the AMA Capital Grant from SEG10, that is used by AMA for procurement of agricultural produce. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I would have loved more details. In SEG 6 also, the honourable Minister in one of his Ministerial Statements emphasized that the Ministry is embarking on a programme for alleviating poverty through agriculture. However, I fail to see any allocation of funds for this activity. Would the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways be kind enough to advise how they are going to proceed with this programme if there is no financial allocation for this activity?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> I think there is an allocation of 200,000.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Where is this located? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Planning and Development, would you like to help here? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Yes, just on honourable Nand’s earlier question on Agriculture Marketing Operating Grant, the reduction of $500,000, they also have term deposits in other institutions that we assessed. We are also saying that they need to be reviewed, so that is why there is a reduction in the grant.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1271 On your question on poverty alleviation, there is no allocation as such because the allocation that we provided, as you know, the big increase in total of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways Budget last year continued this year and there are a number of programmes within the different programmes and activities, such as subsidies for non-sugar crops sectors, subsidies for increase in the prices of commodities, particularly rice which we feel is part of the overall strategy for poverty reduction. So, there is no specific allocation as such. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you. The honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways has just advised that $200,000 has been allocated. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- My apologies, we have asked for $200,000 but we were told that we can work from within our programmes that are already there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> That was the request, the honourable Minister is correct.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, if I may just add on to what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics said because I think the other side needs to understand this, the way that we are approaching diversification, for example, we are opening up all the rural areas so the amount of investment on rural roads at the moment is unheard of in the country right now. What is actually happening is that it is opening up access. You can see on the ground that people are planting a lot more and we will continue with that investment this year. For the delta in Tailevu and Rewa, we are doing drainage that will dry up that area and allow bigger opportunities for actually planning. That is the way we are approaching poverty alleviation. It is not a specific allocation because that is a handout. What we are doing is providing opportunities for people to work and produce for themselves. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I have a motion here from honourable Koroilavesau. Would you like to introduce your motion Sir? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have come into discussions with the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council during our meeting with the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs. I think our Chairman, honourable Tubuna and honourable Tuinabuna, who is the Assistant Minister for Agriculture understands this and I think honourable Kiran will also vouch for it, that this small organisation does a lot of coordination…. MR. CHAIRMAN.- You are just introducing, I need a seconder, before you elaborate on your motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> My apologies, Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am running right ahead.</p><p>I wanted an increase in the allocation given to Fiji Crop and Lifestock Council. MR. CHAIRMAN.- That motion has been seconded. Thank you, you have not finished. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have already made the introduction. This small organisation does a lot of coordination between the farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture and does a lot of work on the ground. I understand that they have been given an allocation of $500,000 but I take that they have requested for an increase, so I am just putting a motion to increase their funding by $500,000 to take it up to $1 million.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1272 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the work of the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council is really to compliment some of the work that was carried out by our Extension Division in particular. I think the $500,000 given to them is enough. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I can just add, Mr. Chairman, for honourable Koroilavesau’s satisfaction, we had specifically allocated in the last budget a provision for purchase of vehicle and that has been done, so we have reduced the amount this year. The honourable Minister for Agriculture agrees that we need to review the functions of the Crop and Livestock Council, to align it with the work that the Minister quite rightly pointed out to the Research and Extension and training components of the Ministry of Agriculture. It is a reasonable allocation based on what they requested and we feel this is adequate. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I am satisfied with the explanation that has been given. I would like to withdraw that motion. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The motion is withdrawn. We will move on. Programme 1-2? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-2(10) - Commercial Farmers Equity Package; Commercial Agriculture Development Programme. I have looked at Head 50 as well, no change from last year. All the allocations remain. I know the purpose of this programme. I just want to ask the Minister, how is this being taken up? Is it really well utilised and are we feeling the impact? Sir, I will also make a plea here on behalf of the Minister, the honourable Minister for Finance has been talking about decentralisation. I have looked at Head 50, I think just a difference of $2 million has been decentralised. This is what the Ministry, having served as an Agricultural Minister, hopefully that most of the items under Head 50 on (R), if it can be decentralised, but we work out the process because it is important in agriculture is seasonalities. Sometimes when we finish all the processes, the season is gone. If we want the impact because most of it are just short term and medium term impacts. If you give that opportunity to the Minister, he can do much. I hope it can be considered for next year’s budget, not only the increase but the decentralisation - give him the powers, set up the process. Honourable Minister, is it going fast enough and what is the impact? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Through you, Mr. Chairman, the Commercial Agriculture Programme is really part of the Ministry’s efforts in trying to develop value added products. The bigger picture is exporting fresh products to overseas markets which poses a lot of problems for us. There are quarantine issues due to pest and disease status of countries where we are exporting to. These hinders the export of fresh products to those markets. In fact, if you can recall I had called out Australia here in Parliament after our ginger could not get through to Australia. There was an oversupply of ginger last year. This programme on SEG 10 – Commercial Agriculture Development Programme is really to see that local companies take up the value-added processing activity. There are already local companies that are doing that and there are new companies that have joined, but we hope to see that more companies take up the challenge of value adding local agriculture produce. I always say that first of all, we must get our people get used to local value added products such as Cassava Chips, Dalo Chips, Kumala Chips, Cassava Flour, Breadfruit Flour. First of all, local</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1273 people must get used to it, buy it, consume it, before even thinking of exporting it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I think the point raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition is a very good one. In fact, I can tell you that this year, we have reduced the “R” from almost about $1.7 billion to about $1.2 billion. There is always a risk of virement, there is always a risk of funds being diverted but we are looking at Ministries, particularly Ministries such as Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Education where we want to reduce the ‘Rs’ and also a possible Head 50 as well in terms of grants so that you said quite rightly that they can use that effectively. The Commercial Farmers Equity Package is really providing equity for commercial loans assistance on a case by case basis and upscaling smallholder farmers if they want to go and do that. It is a good programme and one that could be very effective. Thank you. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Joseph Nand, your question before we come back to honourable Sachida Nand. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 – Public Consultation - Review of Agriculture Laws - $10,000. A question to the honourable Minister, what type of review are you trying to do in public consultation? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the laws that govern agriculture in this country are quite old, in fact, they go back to colonial days. So, we need to review some of those laws to be on par with how far we have moved in agriculture so that we can be on par with the rest of the world. Thank you. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-2(7) - Research Council ($100,000), the funding has increased from $20,000 to $100,000, a 500 percent increase. Which Council is this and what are the funds for? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, there is a Research Council within the Ministry that conducts meetings every quarter. It consists of the Director Research and Senior Officers of the Ministry. This fund is for that purpose. HON. S. NAND.- For the meetings?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> Yes, but not only for the meetings, there are other activities.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, one of the key things is that agriculture involves a lot of science. Out of the Council, they make publications which is called the Agriculture Journal. That makes us competitive and relevant in the scientific world because most of the research is done, we have released new varieties, and that is where the publication of Agriculture Journal comes in, and it is distributed all over the world. So, that is another function of this Council. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-4(7) - Agriculture Show ($200,000), is the Ministry going to have shows in all Divisions, or is it going to be one central show?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, there will be one central show.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1274 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 MR.

Then we will take our usual break during this Budget session, the afternoon tea and dinner at 6.00 p.m. We are hoping to complete everything by this evening, so come tomorrow, we will be straight into the Consequential Bills. I hope you do not mind that. The Parliament adjourned at 12.59 p.m.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1275 The Parliament resumed at 2.25 p.m. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Now into Programme 2-1. HON. S. NAND.- Programme 2-1(8) Upgrade and Enhancement - Offices and Quarters ($1.5 million). In a particular divisions and offices, this is being done or is it just earmarked for all the officers.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- All:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is how we always got our answers or reply from the previous government:</span> It was simply “yes” or “no”. Yes, honourable Sachida, you are comfortable?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Activity 2. We have two motions from honourable Sachida Nand.</h4><p>Programme 2-2(8) - Women in Agriculture Programme. His recommending an increase of about $100,000. The second one Programme 2-2(10) - Fertiliser and Weedicide Subsidy. He is recommending an increase to $500,000 from the current allocation in the proposed Budget. Honourable Sachida, you may introduce the first one - Programme 2-2(8), Women in Agriculture Programme. We will go one by one. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, under Head 30, I propose that we increase by $100,000 in Programme 2-2(8) in respect for Women in Agriculture.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Please, elaborate on your motion, Sir. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, women are now taking a prominent role in agriculture and are more and more involved in subsistence and commercial farming, not only in crops but they are venturing into livestock including dairy farms. The involvement cannot go unnoticed and now they a playing a very prominent role and this needs to be encouraged so that more and more women can take up agriculture or farming professionally. As such, Mr. Chairman, I move that Women in Agriculture Programme be increased by another $100,000 to assist more women to participate in the agriculture activity and also assist in poverty alleviation. This is not a point scoring motion but a motion that is needed so that women can actively be involved. They have been traditionally involved in farming but not taking prominent roles. Now they are and I would request the Government to increase this allocation so that more women can be empowered to take up agriculture professionally. MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is to increase it from $300,000 by another $100,000, to take it up to $400,000, honourable Sachida Nand?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Yes:</span></p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1276 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr Chairman, while the comment is appreciated, one thing we must keep in mind is that we have women farmers in almost all the programmes. We have women goat farmers, women dairy farmers, women beef farmers, women sheep farmers who can access funding from those commodity funding and to have $300,000 just for women, that should be appreciated. So, any other funding that they will need, they can access because there is no discrimination for all the other assistance. Are we okay with that, honourable Sachida Nand? HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, the answer is good but I would have loved to get women directly involved and this is the way of encouraging and empowering them to take control and it would have good initiative.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> Point is taken, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> I think that is a good suggestion, increasing, but the utilisation last year was only $260,100 so we kept it at $300,000 so there is still room to help additional women there, but we can look at it next year. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you MR. CHAIRMAN.- So honourable Sachida, do you still want to continue?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> I’m okay with that motion, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> You still want to continue with it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- I would like to have a vote on this:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Okay, then will put that to the vote. Question on amendment put. Motion lost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The second motion from honourable Sachida Nand. I will invite him to introduce his motion. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, I move that Head 30 be increased by $500,000 in Programme 2-2(10) with respect to Fertiliser and Weedicide Subsidy (Dalo, Ginger, Cassava, Vegetables).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Mr:</span> Chairman, vegetable farmers are an integral part of our agriculture sector and like any other commodity these farmers need assistance. I see that in the Extension Programme, apart from Fertiliser and Weedicide subsidy, there is no other subsidy, and I did mention this in my response to the Budget Address. It is important to assist these farmers because weedicide and fertiliser are not only the two expenses. There are seeds, insecticides which have a toll on the farmers, therefore I request that Fertiliser and Weed Subsidy be increased by another $500,000. The activity should include Seed and Pesticide Subsidy so that they are encouraged to produce quality vegetables and have this commodity available to our consumers locally and this will also assist in reducing the import bill.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1277 MR. CHAIRMAN.- The proposal here is to increase from $1 million by another $500,000. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, we can make do with the $1 million that is already there because there are other programmes. For example, dalo, ginger and there is another root crop programme which can take care of what the honourable Member has mentioned. For some of these crops, we would rather just leave the trade of planting materials to the market force without interference because we have interfered before and it has resulted in the under cutting of the prices that which farmers were trading with those who needed planting materials. So, we do not want to go there again, but I do agree that there needs to be some subsidy for seeds, but again in most of the programmes, we also supply seeds. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I could just add to what the honourable Minister said. This allocation also includes vegetable farmers as well this time plus in addition to the $1 million allocation here, the subsidy for rice farmers has been to, as we discussed yesterday to the Fiji Rice Limited themselves. So, they will be responsible for providing the subsidy to the rice farmers. Vegetable farmers will be included in the allocation here. That is why the subsidy allocation here remains the same as last year in addition to what has been given to rice. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, I see rice farming, coconut farming, cocoa, ginger, vanilla, yaqona, dalo all having separate allocation for the Extension Programme and Assistance. Vegetable farming or horticulture is very important. Everyday you need to go to the market and farmers need assistance. Farmers are struggling with pests and high cost of seeds. There should be some funds available so that these farmers have access to these funds and can get seeds or pesticides at a subsidised rate and in the small blue book, we have compared ourselves with India as a growing economy. India hugely subsidises its agricultural sector, that is why they are able to produce so much of vegetables or agriculture produce. I think it is high time we should concentrate on agriculture and also not leave horticulture behind. Horticulture is something, fruits and vegetables are something that needs to be looked at and vegetable farming is something that needs to assisted vegetable farming and green crop farming. MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is your right of reply, honourable Sachida?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you:</span> You still want us to go for the vote?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Honourable Members, now we will put his motion to the vote. Question on amendment put. Motion lost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-3. We have another motion here from honourable Sachida Nand. May you introduce your motion, Sir?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> No, Mr. Chairman, that is not for that Activity, it is for Programme 3-2.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1278 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Okay, Programme 3-1? HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, it is Programme 3-1(7), this is on behalf of our furry friends, cats and dogs. We have $130,000 allocated this year, thank you. It is the same amount last year, but the stray cats and dogs are still increasing. Maybe for next year if we can increase this also. If we can also think about tax concessions for those that want to donate, for example the SPCA, so if CJS is going to donate $100,000 to SPCA, if they can get concession the same as we do to sporting organisations. They do a big job in looking after our stray animals, there is one animal shelter in Ba - the Greater Good Foundation. They have 200 dogs right now in there. I saw last week that they were asking for donations for 700 kilogrammes of rice for their food for the next few months. So maybe a plea rather than anything else to change for next year, maybe we can look at increasing this and think about the concession for those that want to donate. One big contributing factor to animal cruelty is the high cost of medicine for animals. I am not too sure whether we can have some subsidy also on animal medicine so that when our animal get injured or sick we are able to afford to buy the medicine and keep them rather than just throw them out onto the streets. MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is a very interesting contribution.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> Point is taken, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> In some provinces they eat this thing such as Lomaiviti, Bua. They are very good, it is a delicacy; eating cats, dogs and everything. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- For the honourable Members information, there is an additional $530,000 allocated under Programme 3-2 for Stray Animals. Some funding from there could also be used if it is necessary. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-1(5) – Purchase – Veterinary Drugs ($6,000). There is another allocation of $1 million in Programme 3-2. Why are these spread over two different Activities when the intention is to get Veterinary Drugs? Why are we doing central procurement so that we do not have procurement issues? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, I can explain that. Programme 3-1(5) is to cater for the purchase of drugs for the Veterinary Laboratory and Programme 3-2(5) is for the clinics in Stations. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, one is for the livestock and the other one is for Vet specifically. The livestock drugs are different. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, I am sure the honourable Minister for Finance would understand that livestock drugs and other drugs if you are using in the Veterinary Laboratory, livestock drugs have a heavy procurement and they require more.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Chairman, that is why I am saying it is separate.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, the Vet laboratory and the Clinic are different.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Understood, Mr. Chairman.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1279 HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Chairman, we have the two different institutions that use these drugs. One is the Veterinary Laboratory and the other is the general extension work carried out by Livestock Officers, and those are two separate uses of drugs. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-2(10) - Upgrade of Nasinu and Vuda Abattoir - FMIB ($400,000). For a long time, there was a talk about moving this Nasinu Abattoir but now, we are upgrading it. Does that mean that it is going to stay there for good, because there were complaints about the Abattoir? I am talking as a person from Nakasi, so I declare my interest. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, we cannot leave the Abattoir in its current state to fall into ruins. We still need to upgrade and maintain, even though the plans are already there to move the current Abattoir from Naulu to Navuso. However, that does not mean that we do not maintain it because we have to keep certain standards in the Abattoir. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-2(9) - Stray Animals Control Campaign ($530,000). Again, it has been highlighted to address this issue with a lot of compassion, so if the honourable Minister can clarify what is all being done or will be done in this control campaign, and if this amount is sufficient for the bigger problems that we have with stray animals? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, the campaign to control stray animals is quite a lengthy and cumbersome process. We first have to with the community and then there are animal groups that are heavily involved when it comes to the control of stray animals. Then we have to take the community through, so it is like an awareness programme. Then we start putting up notices before we finally carry out the actual, whether it is bating, caging or even shooting. Mr. Chairman, normally what happens is while we are still in this process, the damage is done. For example, when dogs attack goats in a goat farm or sheep farm, they do not tell you that they are going to come. They will just come in groups, stay around the farm, find a really nice cool place to lie down and then when everything there is right, then they attack. Very intelligent animal. The worst thing is, they do not eat the whole carcass. They just bite the neck, take the blood out and off they go. Mr. Chairman, when we talk to farmers who have gone through the dog attack and had like dozens of animals killed, it becomes a very emotional issue. As a government, we have farmers on one side and we have animal activists on the other side. At one time, I made a statement that may be, we need to shoot the dogs. I was crucified on the press, but you know, that came out of frustration. I talked with the farmers because to me, livestock is more important than the dogs, especially when it is wild dogs. It is a very sensitive and complex exercise. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- A question on stray dogs in the urban areas. Last year, what kind of work was undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture to trap the dogs in the urban area?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, it is a continuous exercise.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Is that also part of this funding that you have received:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Yes:</span> Just to tell you a story, some mornings when I take a walk in front here, stray dogs sleeping on the steps of Parliament. I think one weekend I came, there were about seven dogs. HON. T. N. TUINABUNA.- Mr. Chairman, if I can add on to the honourable Minister’s response to the question, our work in the Ministry is also coordinated with Municipalities. We work</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1280 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 with Municipal Authorities and we address stray animal campaign in towns and cities differently, compared to when we deal with stray animals on farms. To go back to the cost of stray animals, we have a lot of operational costs in stray animal because we have to maintain pounds where we will hold animals and we will have to look after animals, depending on the number of days that is required before they are released. So, there is a component of operational cost in that capital cost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Before we proceed further, I have a motion here from honourable Sachida Nand that is to do with Programme 3-2(10). Honourable Sachida Nand to introduce his motion. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move That Head 30 be increased by $1 million in Programme 3-2(10) in respect to Dairy Development Programme. HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I second the motion HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the Dairy Sector needs continued support from the Government to assist in rejuvenating the industry. Farmers have been affected by Brucellosis and Tuberculosis and the person has lost a considerable amount of stock on the farm. Government, last year, injected a record of $5 million into the industry and I am very grateful for that. This year, the allocation has been reduced by $1 million. This reduction will hinder some of the activities that was being planned to be carried out in the dairy industry. I request the Government to re-instate this $1 million so that activities can continue without disruption. The farmers were very grateful for the Government’s continued assistance. Last year, they eagerly awaited the reinstatement of $1 million back into the Dairy Development Programme so that they can continue with all the activities. I must stress, again, I acknowledge the Government’s record assistance with the industry and would be grateful if they continue doing that. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I acknowledge the sentiments echoed by the honourable Member, I think the decision to reduce the grant on this Dairy Programme the honourable Member is very much familiar with and the utilisation rate has been slow. So, I think that decision was taken due to the slow utilisation rate of the funds that they were given. But I guess come the next Budget, we should be able to get back to what it was. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Sachida Nand your right of reply here. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I look forward to the increment so that they can continue with all the activities. This sector is on a downward spiral at the moment and the Government’s continued assistance is needed to revitalise it and also to reduce our import bill because 50 percent of what we consume is important and we have potential to reduce this import and thank you for your assurance that this will be looked into the next budget. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do you still want to continue</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> No, Mr. Chairman, Sir.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1281 MR. CHAIRMAN.- The motion has been withdrawn and we shall continue. Programme 3- 3? HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 3-3(8), there has been an allocation of $1.04 million for the Beef Breeding Programme. Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways elaborate that this is purely for beef breeding or in the same context, you will also be handling dairy into it because in the breeding programme they can be simultaneously run for both beef and dairy. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Yes, we have at least four breeds that we are currently developing. One of the breed - brown Swiss is both, for beef and dairy breed. I think you must have had a chance to see the animal, the frame makes it out to be a beef animal, but the udder really makes it out to be good for dairy. So, yes, we do have that allowance.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Thank you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- We shall move on:</span> Programme 5-1? HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 5-1(7) - Climate Smart Agriculture ($250,000), I would be grateful if the honourable Minister could elaborate on what commodities are being looked at, together with what actions will be carried out under this programme? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Chairman, this is an ongoing programme that involves the development of indigenous rootcrops and even livestock. This indigenous livestock and rootcrops have shown resilience over time. There are teams that go out to the islands and they have identified species of yams, coconuts and even pigs for that matter. So that is what is involve in this climate smart agriculture programme.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Thank you, honourable Minister, for your explanation.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Is that part of the climate change development?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> Yes, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.:</span> In fact, if you go to Koronivia, Mr. Chairman, you will find in the piggery, there is a whole section dedicated to indigenous pig breed. In fact, they do much better in terms of their mothering skills than the introduced breeds. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. Honourable Tunabuna. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this is information for those who do not really know indigenous breeds, it is not only for crops, it is also for livestock. They have stood the test of weather and times, and they have very good mothering abilities, especially for livestock, and they can stand the change in weather conditions. Indigenous breeds have been part of the breeding programme in Koronivia for the last decade and have been supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization. So, it is an ongoing programme for the Ministry. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. How long does it take before a breed is being introduced to becomes indigenous, or is it like the trees, the pine and mahogany and other indigenous trees? HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Depending on the different breed, their time will become localised.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1282 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 MR.

CHAIRMAN.:</span> Parliament will now vote on Head 30 - Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways. Question put. Head 30 agreed to. Head 31 – Ministry of Fisheries MR. CHAIRMAN.- Whilst the floor is now open for any comments, we will dive straight into Programme 1-1. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask the honourable Minister on the Aid-In-Kind – Promotion for Regional Soid Waste Initiative, if she can explain on that initiative. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, what you have in front of you is a misprint. The project is supposed to read, “The Project on Pacific Islands Capacity Enhancement for Achieving SDG14” and this project is solely to enhance capacity of the officials of the Ministry of Fisheries to coordinate regional trainings to other Pacific Island countries to promote marine conservation and sustainable fisheries development to achieve SDG 14targets. MR. CHAIRMAN- That is still Aid-In-Kind?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Just a question whether the amount mentioned here is the same amount for the name change? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, honourable Member, the amount is the same but the project name is different. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-1(7) – Inshore Compliance and Enforcement ($300,000). This amount that has been budgeted over the years, but this year has been a slight decrease. I think the honourable Minister will realise after going on tours that this is something you are constantly asked about, about making sure that there is compliance and enforcement of the fishing laws around those areas. I am just wondering whether the honourable Minister given the constant problems that we have had over the years and the similar budget, whether this budget is addressing these needs for ensuring compliance and enforcement in inshore areas. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, yes, SEG 7 will address the need for inshore compliance and enforcement. It is implemented by the Inshore Compliance and Enforcement Division to ensure the enforcement of the relevant laws and legislations within the inshore sector. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Will that involve fisheries wardens and all that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C.

KOROILAVESAU.- Sir, are we on Programme 2-2?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.:</span> Programme 1-1.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Sorry, my question is on Programme 2-2.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Programe 2-2. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister on Programme 2-2(1) – Sea Going Allowance – Regional Observers Programme ($200,000). Why I am asking the honourable Minister is that this Observer Programme is basically we are providing Observers for regional countries to be carried on board foreign ships that are serving the other island countries in the Pacific. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Sorry, Mr. Chairman, I did not get the honourable Member’s question. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Under the Regional Observers Programme, Fiji provides Observers on international fishing vessels that operate with other Pacific Islands. So basically, we are seconding them to provide that service because they do not have observers in those regions. My understanding was that they were paying for those observers being seconded. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the sea going allowance for the Regional Observer Programmes, not only do they go on foreign vessels that has been mentioned by the honourable Member, they are also placed on long line Fiji licenced fishing vessels. So, they also assist the national observers in the vessels that are licenced to Fiji, based in Fiji and are flagged to Fiji. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Let us move on. Programme 2-3. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 2-3(8), Fish Cage Culture Research Project ($700,000). I would like to get a clarification on that Programme, because this is the first time that I am seeing it? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase is to cater for the procurement and installation of solar at the Makogai Research Station. This is to allow for the production of 12,500 giant clam juveniles for 24/7 stable power supply and to provide a backup system to the hatchery. That is the reason for the increase is to cater for that. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, can I just make a clarification. Does that cost $700,000? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman. The increase is mainly to procure the equipment for solar panels for the Makogai Research Station.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> It is written here “fish cage”.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I understand that the project is Fish Cage Culture Research Project which is based in Makogai, the increase from $300,000 from the last financial year to $700,000 for the next financial year, is mainly to cater for the procurement of solar panels for the Research Station.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>1284 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I was going to ask that question too on the fish cage culture, but I am confused by the explanation given by the honourable Minister. I have seen fish cage culture in other places like India, but I will probably have to go to Makogai again to see what fish cage culture is like the one that they are doing there. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, last year the budget for this was $300,000, now it has gone up to $700,000. In these two years we have not yet cultured and produced any fish in cages. Are we still in the development phase where we still not have reached the stage of culturing or growing fish within cages, that we are still developing the infrastructure? Will that be a correct statement to say? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, over the years we have developed clams that we have put out to the other reef systems. It is an ongoing project with Makogai, we continue to spawn, rear and put out these clams, crustaceans, turtles and all the marine species that are cultured at Makogai. It is an ongoing project, and we have over the years fed our reef systems with what has been spawned at Makogai.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> And all $300,000 was used last year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, maybe they should change the name instead of “fish caging” because fish caging is basically breeding fish in cages and then float them in the ocean where they breed them to adult and then they sell it. So, maybe they should change the name to avoid the confusion. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, in the past, the project was known as the Makogai Development Project. I think under the previous administration, the name was changed to Fish Cage Culture Research Project. MR. CHAIRMAN.- There are three former Ministers for Fisheries on this side. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Sir, I am speaking from experience while I was at the Ministry. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sorry, Mr. Chairman, it seems that we are focussing only now on marine but there is also cage culture particularly on freshwater and this is a big opportunity for Fiji. The dam in Navua was wanst, there was a study on it. This was the rice dam in Navua for freshwater fish cage culture. And with that technology, Sir, you just use floaters, and you breed fish inside the nets. You just change the sizes of the nets every now and then according to the growth pattern of the fish. That is a huge opportunity for Fiji. So, probably if the Ministry for Fisheries can consider fish cage culture in freshwater as well. It is available with most of our development partners, Sir. MR. CHAIRMAN.- He is just making a statement there. No need to reply, honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Noted, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Just take note:</span> Activity 4? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- I seek clarification. On Activity 2-4(4), Operations of Ice Plants ($440,000).</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1285 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Clarification is sort there, honourable Minister. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Programme 2-4, the increase in allocation is to enable the Ministry to operate the 24 ice plant machines nationwide and this will also include the purchase of equipment, needed spare parts of the hatchery equipment, et cetera. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I have a motion here from the honourable Koroilavesau. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I wanted the same allocation for operation of ice plants to be increased. This is a major challenge for the Ministry of Fisheries where ice plants are all distributed through the maritime islands and the isolated communities and they would normally breakdown. The breakdown of these ice plants causes the whole chain events of the fishing activities within those communities. In certain areas and in certain times, ice plants in maritime islands like Vanuabalavu, Lakeba and Rabi when they breakdown, it will take 3 to 6 months without been solved. It stops the whole fishing mechanism within those islands. All I am asking is to increase the allocations so that there is a better support system. I can say we had to buy two generators from the government of Japan. They gave us money to fund that. Instead of fixing generators, we just take the generators, place it, take the old one and then replace it again after its repaired. That is all I am asking for, if we increase that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We just get the seconding for the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.:</span> I second the motion, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- And he had already elaborated on his motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Sorry for that, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, you want to make any comments on the motion; increased to $540,000 the maintenance of ice plants. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think the increase of $140,000 is sufficient for the next financial year. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- It is okay if she says that but I can guarantee her that she will have problems. MR. CHAIRMAN.- So, withdraw this motion now.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Activity 5. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I would just like to seek the Koro Fisheries Stations which has been ongoing for about four years now. I just wanted to ask where it is now and what stage they have reached? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Koro Fisheries Station honourable, Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the allocation for the construction of Koro Fisheries Station, $545,000, this is the first of the three years that the Ministry of Fisheries is</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>1286 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 going to construct the Fisheries Station and the necessary works for Koro Fisheries Station. I know it has appeared in the past budgets of the Ministry but because there were issues regarding landowning units in Koro, that was the cause of the delay for the construction of the Koro Fisheries Station but all have been finalised and the project will take three years to be fully constructed and in operation. This year is the first of the three years. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think I had a motion, I would like to withdraw that. That seeks clarification on the State’s development. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Activity 6. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 2-6(8) - Food Security Programme - Freshwater Aquaculture Small-Holder Farmers ($1 million). How effective is this programme and is $1 million sufficient enough to cover all the small-holder farmers in aquaculture? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, because of the need to put less pressure on marine resources, the increase in funding is to cater for the increase in the demand for aquaculture farming around Fiji and also to ensure sustainable food security. So, this $1 million is sufficient for the next financial year to cater for small-holder farmers. HON. S. NAND.- Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, is the distribution centres for aquaculture in all the divisions and easily accessible to all the farmers?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Yes, honourable Member, it is accessible to all.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, on the same SEG and on the same issue, the Food Security Programme for Freshwater Aquaculture, this is quite a large increase of around $400,000 to go up to a million dollars. But one of the things that we have seen for aquaculture, is that a lot of these areas where we built these farms, especially the smallholders, is the issue of getting good feed for them. Is this just about digging up the ponds or also giving them some assistance so that they can produce fish that are well fed, so that they can be as productive as possible? Is it just about digging ponds or is it also looking at other things down the line to make the prawns as productive as possible? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Thank you, honourable Member, so it is not only about the digging up of the ponds, it is about the whole package. Apart from the ponds, the feed and other assistance that is provided by the Ministry and we have had an increase in demand from farmers who are intending to venture into aquaculture. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-6(8) - Construction of Multi Species Hatchery - Ra ($781,038), can the honourable Minister clarify the amount of money that is allocated for this because this was part of a donor supported project? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the allocation of $781,038 for the Multi Species Hatchery in Ra is to cover wages and FNPF for project officers, fuel and oil, procurement, shrimp feed, visits and site inspection and construction of two new staff quarters. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I withdraw the motion that I had put in, now that she has said that it also includes the salary of staff and people that are working in that Hatchery. I thought it was just a direct assistance to progress the work that was carried out by the Government of Taiwan. Thank you.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1287 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 31 – Ministry of Fisheries. Question put. Head 31 was agreed to. Head 32 – Ministry of Forestry MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments. Programme 2-1? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman on Programme 2-1(6) under Fiji Pine Trust - Extension ($1,745,102), an increase of around $0.5 million. Can the honourable Minister explain the reason for the increase just for our information? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase is to cater for the following activities: (1) Administration; (2) Silviculture; (3) Utilisation Consultation; (4) Awareness Training and Business; (5) Review of processes and procedures; (6) Maritime Harvesting Operation Support; and (7) Capital Expenditure. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to Programme 2-1(5) – Annual Contribution- International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation. My question is whether any work is being undertaken by the Ministry of Forestry to develop this bamboo and rattan industry in Fiji? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.– Thank you, Mr. Chairman and honourable Member, you will notice there has been no change in the annual contribution from the previous financial year and the allocation was moved from SEG 6 to SEG 5 in line with the new budget classification structure. So, the provision of the annual subscription fee to the International Union of Forest Research Organization is to enhance the collaboration between countries on forest-related research and disseminates information to all partners that gradually contribute to decision-making and policies. This also allows to new research areas and findings. HON. P. D. KUMAR.–Mr. Chairman, my question was whether we have developed a Bamboo and Rattan industry in Fiji? Any work has been undertaken by the Ministry of Forestry to develop a sector on bamboo and rattan? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU. – Thank you, honourable Member and Mr. Chairman, the work on developing the bamboo sector is still in the process. The Ministry of Forestry is still looking at ways to develop the bamboo from the various species of bamboo that are available in Fiji. MR. CHAIRMAN. – Thank you. I understand there are only three varieties in Fiji. Apart from Indonesia, they have several dozens of varieties. Anyway, they are still looking into it.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1288 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 11 th July, 2024 HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU. – Mr. Chairman, the item on SEG 6 has already been asked by honourable Usamate. The Minister has explained what is included in the amount of money that I wanted to discuss, so I will withdraw my motion on increasing this allocation. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-2? HON. J. USAMATE. –Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7 - Emission Reduction Programme - Benefit Sharing Plan for the World Bank has a budget there of $6.3 million which is an increase from $4.1 million (if I am correct) from last year. For our information, can you inform us on the purpose of the increase and what are the benefits that are coming out of this beneficiary plan? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.–Mr. Chairman, the increase is to cater for the following activities; project administration, Alternative Livelihood Initiative Development, Capacity Building Training and Awareness, registered REDD plus conservation lease, Annual staff emoluments, the ten-district level integrated LUP, implementation of communication and participation plan, the securing of forest government stock and securing socket layer license. So, this is government’s contribution to support Fiji’s participation in the carbon financing mechanism under the World Bank, FCPF, Carbon Fund, REDD Plus readiness initiative to reduce emission from deforestations and forest decantation through the enhancement or establishment of forest government stock as syncs. MR. CHAIRMAN. – Has the Ministry arrived at a formula in the sharing, especially to the resource owners?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU:</span> – Mr. Chairman, Sir, its coming soon.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> On the next SEG – 8 Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD Plus) of $1.2 million, that is also a $400,000 increase. Can you just illuminate us on what that is for and the reason for the increase?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Chairman, she has already explained that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, the first one was on SEG 7, this is now on SEG 8.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, the allocation is a cash grant from the World Bank that supports carbon trade. The processes, systems and institutional arrangements are clearly articulated in the Emission Reduction Programme.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- I think you have given the answer to my first question:</span></p><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have a motion on Programme 2-7(9). The two motions are from</h4><p>honourable Koroilavesau. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, maybe I just start off asking for the clarification from the honourable Minister.</p><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are these the two motions that you have withdrawn again?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Or it has just arrived on the table? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes, Mr. Chairman. It is on SEG 9 and SEG 10?</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>11 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1289 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, maybe I should just ask the honourable Minister for clarification and if that is clarified then I may withdraw the motion. I just needed clarification on those two figures on Programme 2-7(9) - Maritime Pine Development ($700,000) and SEG 10 - Commercial Maritime Pine Subsidy ($2,141,810). I would like to ask the honourable Minister to clarify and explain the difference between SEG 9 and SEG 10? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase in Maritime Pine Development is to cater for the following expenses: salary, wages, transfer and allowance, vehicle repairs and maintenance, saw milling timber treatment and marketing. That allocation is for those purpose. The Commercial Maritime Pine Subsidy is to cater for re-barge and boat fare from subsidy of logs and timber from Kadavu and Lakeba, the construction of new jetty, the roading subsidy, outsourcing of portable saw milling and treatment, vehicle purchasing and staff recruitment. I hope that is clear, honourable Member. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, that clarifies that these are two distinctive items, so I would like to withdraw the motion that I had put up. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 32. Question put. Head 32 agreed to. Head 33 – Ministry of lands and Mineral Resources MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. Programme 2-1? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, on Programme 2-1, I will go straight to SEG 9 - Purchase of Research Vessel. If the honourable Minister can elaborate further on this project, please. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Chairman, the purchase of technical equipment, there is an increase of $167,180. This is just a holdover from the last financial year. So, we have not completed with the purchases.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- My question is specifically on the research vessel:</span></p></body>
