PRASAD.:</span> And honourable Usamate said, never in the history we have had this high inflation rate.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Yes, 4.4.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If you look at the inflation rate during their time and he was part of that government:</span></p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1178 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- No, I was not!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, you joined after that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> In 2009, it was 6.8 percent; in 2011, it was 7.7 percent; and in 2008, it was 6.6 percent. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two Budgets, to help our people and to address the cost of living challenges, we maintained zero percent VAT on 21 items and also added prescribed medicines to make it 22 items. Now, we have sugar, flour, rice, dhal, tea, potatoes, onions, garlic, canned fish, cooking oil, salt, liquid milk, powered milk, baby milk, sanitary pads, soap, soap powder, toilet paper, toothpaste, cooking gas, kerosene and prescribed medicine all on zero VAT and these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are basically the first things that people buy in their baskets. In fact, this list was what we had proposed before the 2018 Elections, and they just copied the same list and included that. We are very happy that they did that. This is just ahead of the 2022 Elections.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Microwave:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> So, they talk about microwave, but that was the real microwave. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! (Laughter) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- In the last Budget, we also increased the Social Welfare Allowances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by 25 percent for those above the age of 70 years and 15 percent for those below 70 years. We increased the Government Pension and Aftercare Allowances by 15 percent. We had increased the allowances for all our Turaga ni Koro (Village Headmen), Mata ni Tikina (iTaukei District Representatives), Turaga ni Yavusa (Tribe Leaders), Provincial Administrators and District Advisory Councillors. We introduced the $200 per child Back-to-School Support for all families below an income of $50,000, assisting over 200,000 students. Honourable Hem Chand and others were actually lying when they said, “this was a FijiFirst initiative.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Of course:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Of course, it was!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Microwave:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What FijiFirst had, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was inflation mitigation measures from August 2022 up to January 2023, and it was $1 a day for six months, so $180. Sir, that was an election gimmick, before the Elections. A $1 a day for six months to give $180 and it was paid through the school. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> They are lying and saying, “Back-to-School Support”.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1179 When the honourable Prime Minister announced that, he was not thinking about the next Election last year. As soon as we came into Government, we realised that our students, our rural children, needed this support and that is why we did that. It was not an election gimmick, and it was a new measure, a flagship measure by the People’s Coalition Government to help our students. HON. J. USAMATE.- Flagship?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, it is a flagship initiative by this Government.</p><p>We wrote-off $650 million in TELS debt for 53,000 students, freeing them from the shackles of debt when they started working so that they can use that repayment money to support them. This was a deliberate policy by the Coalition Government and that idea, thankfully, was mooted by our Coalition partner, the SODELPA Party, before the Elections and we are happy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we did that. In this Budget, we are providing over $85 million in pay increases for 38,000 civil servants, who were deprived of salary increase since 2017. We have taken a bold step to increase the minimum wage rate to $5 an hour, an increase of 25 percent, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Bala and others claimed that the minimum wage increase is too slow. They should go and look at themselves in the mirror. (Laughter) When they were in government, it took them almost eight long years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to just introduce the minimum wage rate in 2014. Eight years to just introduce! That too at only $2 an hour. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Then they increased it to $2.32, and later to $2.68 an hour in September 2017, only before the Elections. We did not do it before the Elections. Only before the Elections did they announce a four-phase increase from $2.68 to $4 an hour. They are talking about why we phased it. In the 2018, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the Elections, we were campaigning for $5 an hour and some of them were there. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Who? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They went around threatening garment factory workers, saying that Government cannot afford, when the economy at that time was better. That was the time to raise minimum wages, but they did not. So, we are increasing the minimum wage rate to $5 based on a comprehensive consultation review by panel of experts, who had undertaken a thorough analysis and consultation with employers, unions and other stakeholders, and we are doing it in two phases as we need also to be mindful of some of the employers who need time to adjust. The other point, Mr. Speaker, and you can see it is happening in the last 18 months already, that unions are negotiating for better conditions and internationally, Sir, including organisations, like IMF. All evidences show that in countries where you suppress unions, where you suppress their leaders and where you restrict employees, the workers of that country would suffer in terms of their pay, et cetera, and this is exactly what happened in this country for the last 16 years.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1180 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If, Mr. Speaker, workers were allowed over the years, we would not have seen this problem that we are seeing today, and that is what this Government is trying to correct. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry and others, talked about the highest cane price for our sugarcane farmers, adding income to our rural communities. We are paying our rice farmers $1,000 per tonne of rice paddy. All our cash crop non-sugar farmers are receiving much higher prices for their crops, as well as subsidies, for the first time, unlike when they were only getting it for sugar. However, for the first time in the last Budget, we had provided subsidies for weedicide and fertilizer to non-sugar crop sectors, we are extending that list in this Budget and we are continuing with our social support measures, like free education, transport assistance, subsidised electricity for households earning less than $30,000, free medical service through private General Practitioners, et cetera. So, all those services are being provided. Let me also tell this fact, Mr. Speaker, which will help our honourable Members on the other side to better explain these things to our people. All the support that we are talking about is going to cost the Government about $750 million alone this year. This is going directly to supporting our people. Whether you talk about zero VAT on the 22 items, the Government would be putting in about $250 million that we could collect in taxes into the pockets of our people, Back-to-School Support - $40 million; Social Pension - $78 million; Family Assistance - $44 million; Disability Allowance - $17 million; Child Protection Allowance - $17 million; Electricity Subsidy - $10 million; Water Subsidy; Transport Subsidy; Scholarships - $150 million, Free Health Scheme, Kidney Dialysis, First Home Buyers; if you put all these together, apart from all the other benefits that people are getting, it is $750 million. So, all the additional revenue that we have collected from the tax reform, whether it is increasing Corporate Tax, none of them talked about that, that we are not only just burdening the people, but we are being fair and equitable in terms of our tax policies. The $100 million additional revenue that we are collecting is all going to look after our people because we realized that before COVID and post-COVID, our people are still transitioning into more income, better jobs and, therefore, it is the responsibility of the Government. We are doing it responsibly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Virendra Lal said that this Budget has nothing for the ordinary people for which they can be proud of.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is right:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> The people are listening, Mr. Speaker. He does not want the children to get $200. Let me say this to him, very few supporters who voted for him would not be feeling very proud of him today when they know that this is what he is opposing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me talk about the economy because a lot of comments were made that the economy is slowing down, there is no confidence and investment is not taking place. Sir, the economy is not declining, let that be made clear. The economy is growing, and it is still growing, honourable Premila Kumar. You are an economist, or have you become a bit of an economist now? We have revised the growth forecast from 3.4 percent to 3.8 percent, but it is still growing and there are other commentators who are saying that we may end up with a higher growth than what</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1181 we are. We are not doing it like the cooking that they used to do when they were in Government. We are being very honest because we want people to trust the Government in terms of what we say, so we are not exaggerating and saying that we are going to get 3.5 percent or 3.6 percent. When we know that we are facing headwinds from the slowdown in Australia and New Zealand, the challenges with our declining labour force and challenges in other areas, we have revised growth forecast downwards, but the economy is still growing, it is not contracting as misunderstood by some of them. With the fiscal stimulus and economic optimism provided in this Budget, there is a likelihood that this growth, as I have said, would be revised upwards. We do not worry about what ANZ and others are saying, we are saying from our assessment that we have revised it downwards, but that there are these other variables that have realised that the growth could be much higher. We are, obviously, taking into account the positive impact of the Budget on some of the areas which will spur private sector investment and as both my Deputy Prime Minister colleagues have said, whether it is tourism or other sectors – agriculture or commercial agriculture - there are a lot of investments almost to the tune of $2 billion in private sector investments. As I have said, we are making sure that the ease of doing business is improved. We are fixing our Immigration and all the other bottlenecks that might be there for investment to pick up in a much bigger way. We are seeing some major investments moving forward - new private sector interests in commercial agriculture, as I have said, outsourcing, ICT, and other new industries that will help grow the economy. Our efforts, as a whole of Government level, is aimed at raising our growth rate from the current trend of 3 percent to 4 percent or 5 percent. Another big issue that has been made by some is the expenditure utilisation. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very honest here. We provide quarterly updates, and we are not hiding any of these from the Government or from the public. So, the big hoo-hah about the expenditure utilisation of the Coalition Government and the execution of capital projects, let me put that in context. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we might have been slow in the last few months, but we have caught up with quite a bit of it. We are now projecting that our overall expenditure utilisation to be about 94 percent by the time we close this year. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- What about the virement? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This includes a 97 percent utilisation of the operating budget, which is understandable, and 85 percent implementation of the capital projects. I agree that we can further improve on the execution of the capital projects, and we do not make any bones about that when we discuss these things within our own Government. The honourable Prime Minister knows it, everyone knows that execution is very, very important. But let me share the expenditure utilisation during their time in government, to put matters into context, because it is important. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Why didn’t you show us the change? MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> That is what I want to show, the difference that we are making.</p><p>For the 2016-2017 Budget, capital budget utilisation, honourable Premila Kumar, was only 70.5 percent, while the total expenditure utilisation was 84 percent. For the 2017-2018 Budget, capital budget utilisation was only 77.7 percent, while total expenditure utilised was 85.9 percent. For the 2018-2019 Budget, Sir, budget capital utilisation was only 61.2 percent, while total</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1182 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 expenditure was 74.7 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me bring this very important point, it was not the ineffectiveness or the inefficiency of people executing the project at that time, it was because the government was running into cashflow problems. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I know that, I know that. This is the briefing I got from my Ministry. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Before the 2018 Elections, they were running into cashflow problems and that is why before the 2018 Elections, they announced so many things and the execution capital was 62 percent and 74 percent overall. That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, they had a negative growth. The economy contracted because they lied before the Budget. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Anyway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to put this into context. We are not trying to justify our execution rate, as I have said.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You have just done that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Figures are stuck:</span></p><p>But it is important for our Opposition colleagues to understand what was happening during their time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Tell us about virement:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Operating capital mix:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> You’re just avoiding!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Honourable Premila Kumar is just getting too irritating, Mr.</p><p>Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I will be:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because she cannot take what has been said:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Because you’re lying! MR. SPEAKER.- You just carry on, honourable Minister. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the operational mix, some also claimed that our operating to capital mix is 73:27 is low because governments are major providers of social services, like education, health, security, judicial services which are labour intensive, such as Police and the Military. You generally require around 70 percent expenditures towards operational spending. Similarly, capital expenditure mix is around 30 percent – 70:30, as we can only budget what we can execute which is based on the absorption capacity of the government and that is true for any government. But we agree that we can do more to beef up on our spending on capital projects.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1183 On revenue projection, this is another area where some of the Opposition Members were doubting whether our revenue projections are correct. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify that the revenue projection for 2024-2025 is not too optimistic or is not simplistic. I would like to assure everyone that the revenue numbers that are being set are realistic as possible as we can. No good thinking government would want to overstate revenue for any reason because if we do that, we will get caught and struggle with cashflow problems, so we do not want to do that. That is why our projection is based on very clear analysis and figures and the policies that we have. As I have said, Government did run into cashflow problems in 2018 and 2019, so there is no real incentive for us to be too optimistic with our revenue numbers. Given our successful revenue reforms in the last Budget, we are projecting a total revenue of $3.9 billion, of which $3.3 billion is tax collection, $0.6 billion will be collected from non-tax revenues. So, we are not making any major changes to the tax, as I have said in my Budget Speech, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, I can assure the honourable Members of the Opposition that this revenue forecast is very realistic. We have worked out very clearly the non-tax revenues, particularly those that come from Government entities, like the Reserve Bank of Fiji and other agencies. These are already, kind of, determined for this Budget, so there is no dispute and worry about the level of revenue that we are likely to collect. Mr. Speaker, Sir, lack of consultations on the Budget came out as a theme and honourable Ketan Lal made a big deal about it. This is a government which has had probably one of the most thorough, open, and transparent consultation process on everything that we have done so far in just 18 months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, contrary to the lies that honourable Ketan Lal was trying to tell, we have done consultations during the National Development Plan, starting from the Economic Summit, Fiscal Review Committee Decisions, multiple meetings with private sector institutions, industry groups, civil society organisations, academia, students, faith-based organisations, Disciplined Forces, and targeted focus group. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-We invited you, and your former General-Secretary (I will come to him in a minute), refused to come. In February 2024, we concluded the nationwide consultation on the National Development Plan, and this was where more than 22,000 people came from all four Divisions. Many of them came not only to talk about the plan, but we were also told what they wanted in the Budget. So, there was a thorough Budget consultation done as part of the National Development Plan because as I have said, the National Development Plan will be launched in August, and the process has been undertaken thoroughly within the Government. For any Budget, never before has this kind of consultation done. I think they should stop lying about no consultation being done. I am confident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a lot of what has come out from these consultations have been reflected in the Budget. For example, the 1,700 boreholes that we are going to put out in the next one year or two years, came from the people.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Again, in the pipeline.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> It is not in the pipeline, it is part of the Budget!</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1184 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 Those are examples, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that came out from the consultation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an issue about the taxing of property income on non-profit organisations. I wish to clarify the issue around the taxing of business income for non-profit organisations. Firstly, all donations and fundraising activities for charitable organisations are exempt from tax. Apart from this, business making cash donations to any registered charitable organisation can claim if it has a deductible expense. Following the amendment to the Income Tax Act in 2016, non-profit organisations that were engaged in profit-oriented activities were subject to tax only for their business income component. This policy ensures fairness with the tax system, as individuals or business conducting similar businesses activities were also subjected to taxes. Otherwise, we would create a difficult playing field for everyone. There are a number of non-profit organisations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we picked up, who were starting their commercial arms, some with good intentions and some as a means of tax evasion. This amendment was to close those loopholes where commercial organisations were setting up non-profit organisations and using that as a way to avoid taxes. Another important factor influencing this change was the formation of, as I have said, not only by commercial entities, but other businesses as well. So, this loophole is going to be closed and that there would be a much better transparency in the way that is applied. As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ministers have talked about it. We have had some good contributions from honourable Opposition Members on drug and crime, but as the honourable Minister for Home Affairs pointed out quite rightly and emotionally, that if we had dealt with this some years back, we would not be in the situation where we are in now. But I am glad that we now have an environment in this country, the political environment not only in this Parliament but outside of this Parliament where we can all work together. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Propaganda!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> It is not propaganda, look around yourselves.</p><p>We have taken decisive action, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to setting up the Narcotics Bureau and making sure that we put in additional money into the activities of the Police and the honourable Minister talked about the major reset of our Police Force and closer collaboration and intelligence sharing with our key security partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of other quick points that I want to respond to, and I will try and finish as soon as I can after that. On the point raised by When the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation was talking about the tourism receipts, honourable Sachida Nand confused himself, and he was talking about the figure of $2.9 billion. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister was talking about the tourism receipts, and the honourable Member said, “Oh, because it is only $2.9 billion or something, the contribution of tourism to GDP is much lower.” That is not true. That is bad economics. I think you should keep away from trying to understand that because receipts is just one part of the tourism industry. There are a lot of spin-offs - hotels, transport, and so the total contribution of the tourism industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is close to 40 percent of GDP. Again, I would urge the honourable Member to refrain from talking because when you come here as a Member of Parliament, you have to make sure that what you say is correct.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1185 Honourable Sachida Nand talked about revaluation and, Mr. Speaker, when you talk about revaluation and devaluation, it is a very, very sensitive issue because you do not want to ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 18 - Misquoting.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Hold on, honourable Member. HON. S. NAND.- I apologise, Standing Order 81(1) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you seem to be changing every now and again. Please, resume your seat. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you may continue.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>What I was saying is that he talked about revaluation. This is a very sensitive matter. When you talk about revaluation or devaluation because it can trigger even a discussion of revaluation, or a suggestion of a revaluation or devaluation can ignite a lot of activities which can be very, very damaging to the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, already, our dollar has appreciated against some of our trading partners and it would be silly to suggest any kind of revaluation of a dollar and also about devaluation. I mean, when we had the devaluation in 2009, there was a major increase in prices in 2000, and it sets a trend of activities for years for us to deal with. So, I would urge him, without understanding the impact of the idea of revaluation and devaluation, he should refrain from talking about it. The reference by honourable Bala about the EXIM Bank loan, I thought it was unbecoming of the honourable Member. In fact, it was an insult to our honourable Prime Minister and to the Indian Prime Minister because that decision of a 100-bed super speciality was announced by the honourable Prime Minister of India, together with the honourable Prime Minister of Fiji, and as a grant to build a 100-bed super speciality hospital in this country. And for him to come out and say, “Oh, this might have been traded with the EXIM Bank loan”, I think honourable Bala should correct that, even outside of Parliament, that his information was wrong, Mr. Speaker, because it is very important for us to do that. The point that honourable Usamate made, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, he made some very good contribution in the last 18 months, but he then traded it off by a little bit of hogwash, by talking about FNPF and the Vatukoula Gold Mine settlement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had promised in 2015 and someone said that they wanted millions of dollars. I do not think so, they were negotiating with the unions in a good faith. This is a government that has solved that problem because we provided that platform for our unions to talk to the Government to understand the imperatives of resolving that, Mr. Speaker, and that is the leadership that the honourable Prime Minister has provided on that issue because he visited them before the Election. This is a promise that we made to them before we came into Government, and we have been able to settle that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we trusted the union leaders. If you look at the history of unionism in this country, they have been responsible leaders. We have not had that kind of disruptions they were thinking about when they brought those draconian laws. We have taken all that away, we have</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1186 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 provided a platform and I do not think this will be used as a pretext or as a platform to settle other disputes. I think honourable Usamate is worried about dealing with the unions. If he ends up in Government the next time around, I do not know, but you will be very happy if you ever get into Government with the environment that we have created, honourable Usamate. The FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to respond to what honourable Usamate said. All I want to say is that some of the things that the Military Government did, without consultation, without any empathy, without explaining to the people why it was going to do that, caused a lot of pain to a lot of people in the last 16 years in this country. This is a government that is not promising to write every wrong that was done but where it has the means, where it can show leadership, we are correcting that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is not just one issue. I think this is the message that our investors and our people in this country are getting, that this is a government which is not vindictive, which is not creating fear, which is determined to resolve issues that have been pending for years and we are demonstrating that. The Vatukoula Gold Mine and FNPF is a very clear indication of what we want to do. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contribution from, should I say, the leader of the loyalist group on the other side, honourable Koya, we can accept criticism when the intention is secure or sincere and when there are clean hands - the criticism coming from people who might have some clean hands, but not from someone who happens to be a Member of Parliament. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am not getting personal. He talked about us not having any creativity, not having any innovation in the formulation of the Budget. That is laughable, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That was what he said. People have said that, honourable Bulitavu said that, but we, as a government, do not want to get into that. But when the people of this country listen to comments like that, they are jogging their memory, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the last 16 years and saying, “What was there that we had to live with, that we have now got ourselves out of it”.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is why this side is the largest Party:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Premila Kumar can continue to bask in that glory of being the largest party, but is for the people to judge. There was a comment made about the quality of education by honourable Naupoto, I agree with him that the quality of education is very important but what he was insinuating was that the new scholarship scheme, based on merit was going to deprive students with lower marks. As the honourable Minister for Education explained, this is in the interest of all our students and those who may feel that, that information is correct, it is not correct, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When we talk about quality of education, we are talking about improving the quality of learning and teaching environment. For the last 16 years, in the Suva-Nausori area, and the honourable Minister for Education knows this very well because as soon as he came into Government in his portfolio, he realised that and he picked that up - our quality of teaching. Honourable Premila Kumar knows this, they know this, that the staff to student ratio in our primary and secondary schools in this area is overflowing. In some cases, there are 50 students to 60 students in primary school classrooms. So, as a government, we are working with the Australian Government. We have signed</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1187 an agreement already, there is an audit being done in terms of the number of classrooms and schools that we need in the Suva-Nausori area, and that is a very, very clear target for us in the next one or two years to build more classrooms so that we reduce and improve the….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Pipeline:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> It is not pipeline, honourable Usamate, it is happening already.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I want to assure all the students who are coming out of Form 6 or Form 7 that the current scholarship scheme has a place for each one of them. If they cannot get to the university, if they cannot get to medicine, engineering or a degree, there are things that they can do, qualifications that they can get, and that they will get a scholarship. Let me now come to my friend and those who talked about Pacific Polytech. Mr. Speaker, the way they are talking about it, as if Biman Prasad has something to do with Polytech.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Of course:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Chand was in the Ministry of Education and he knows the process. All higher education institutions are registered and approved by an independent body, the Fiji Higher Education Commission. They registered Pacific Polytech in 2021 and they are doing a good job by replacing the defunct technical colleges that they set up and wasted $30 million that went down the drain. Honourable Usamate talked about the funding for FNU, so let me just explain how funding is determined for all Higher Education Institutions, including the smaller ones, Sangam Nursing School, et cetera. The submissions by these institutions do not come to the Ministry of Finance, it goes to the Ministry of Education, through the Minister for Education to the Higher Education Commission. The Higher Education Commission does its analysis, they make a recommendation, they have a formula and then it comes to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance can only (in a limited space), we cannot even increase it, we can only reduce it. We reduce the funding allocation, the recovery, the amount that they did not pay to USP. So, we paid $10 million last year and $20 million in the last budget. This budget they wanted a recovery a bit more, we have reduced it to $5 million only. Polytech wanted $9 million, that was reduced to $5 million and the Higher Education Commission and all the Ministers who know about Pacific Polytech, who have gone there, and I thank the honourable Tubuna and honourable Tabuya for explaining this to them that somehow there is some conspiracy somewhere. They are training, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They invited you, go and find out from them during the Open Day. If you have that thing, go there, but do not ask me that silly question, I am explaining to you. They invited you, they sent you a letter to go there. Mr. Speaker, the Higher Education Funding Model, honourable Usamate talked about reduction in funding for FNU. There has been a reduction in funding in the past, increase in funding</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1188 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 – it does not mean that next year FNU is not going to get more or Polytech is not going to have its budget increased or reduced, just like for Sangam Nursing School, they did not ask for more last year but we as a Government gave them more because we wanted them to train more nurses and because the number was there. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is the kind of conspiracy that they come up with:</span></p><p>There was a lot of talk about investment environment - confidence. Let me just mention before I conclude Mr. Speaker, for the first time, I think after so many years that the confidence of the investors, even if some of them have it in the pipeline, but the confidence that is coming through from the investors, from the people who want to invest is unprecedented (to use their word). Let me just say this, there is a leading global commercial real estate and investment company (JLL). This is what they said, “when compared with most other markets, Fiji investment fundamentals have remained and are growing strong and highly attractive in the current environment.” (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- One last point before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, they made this big deal about, 18 months – what have you done? Sir, 18 months is a long time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- You have done nothing:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C.

GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is a fact, Mr. Speaker. The honourable Prime Minister was being very polite, I am not going to be that polite that in 18 months...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by first of all thanking all the honourable Members and honourable Ministers on the Government side for their very strong involved, participation in the formulation of the Budget. I know we have had some very good interrogative discussions during the conversation about where and how we need to do things. I would like to say thank you to all of them including the honourable Assistant Ministers for their support and their contributions in the formulation of the Budget. I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership, trust and confidence that he has in me and his Cabinet colleagues in putting out this Budget through a process that is open, transparent and accountable.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1189 I want to thank my Permanent Secretary and all the senior staff, I asked them for their names, they did not want to give a list of all the names that I wanted to take but I have a great team. They actually feel the freedom, they feel comfortable, they are happy with the way in which we conduct ourselves within the Ministry as opposed to what some of them were going through in the past. I want to thank each one of them but my special thanks also to Assistant Minister for Finance who is also the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee for his contribution. I want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his openness, for his willingness to participate in forums with the Government. We had a great session at the Fiji Institute of Accountants Conference and the and the contributions that he made on behalf of the Opposition was quite exemplary. We appreciate that. We want to thank all the Independent Members including the loyalists for their contributions. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the concurrence of the Cabinet and on behalf of the Prime Minister, I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to support this Budget and let us move ahead for the good of this country. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to Standing Order 99 (3), the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill of 2024 which is known as the Bill No. 7 of 2024 has been read a second time. Without any questions being put, the Bill and the Estimates now stand referred to the Committee of Supply. Before I ask the Secretary-General for the next item on the agenda, just let me as a word of caution. Honourable Members, please read carefully the directive given by the Supervisor of Elections when the deregistration has occurred for the FijiFirst Party. She is very clear into what we should refrain ourselves from echoing again. I understand it is bit difficult to shed that identity of you being a former FijiFirst parliamentarian, but again, by operation of law, you are all now deemed to be independent, subject to the expiry of the appeal period on 15 th of this month. Immediately after that, then we should be able to understand better where we stand. But again, in between time, we would like to caution the 26 honourable Members, please refrain yourselves from further identifying yourselves with something that has been deregistered by operation of law. Again, everything is still open for redress, should you seek redress, you have every right to do that, even the appeal period that we are now respecting. So, when that time comes on 15 th, then you would be able to know better where we stand now. Honourable Members, Parliament will now resolve into Committee of Supply to consider each Head in the Budget Estimates. It is envisaged that this process will be completed on Thursday evening after which the Committee of Supply will then vote on the Schedules and clauses of the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024. For the information of honourable Members, we will attempt to complete the debate and votes on Heads 1 to 21 before we adjourn this evening. I hope you will bear with us on that. For the information of all honourable Members, please take note that for the Committee stage, I will sit at the table with the Secretary-General and Members will refer to me as “Mr. Chairman”. The mace will be placed on the lower bracket, and that signifies that the Parliament is in Committee. Honourable Members, please take further note that the Secretary-General will announce each Head separately, Members may then speak on the Head, and you may speak more than once on each Head. Please take note that in some of the Heads there will be several Programmes and Activities listed. Let me remind you honourable Members, that we will deal with these progressively, this is very important, and we will not regress or go back every now and again, trying to take us back when</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1190 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 we have already moved on. Activities that have been earlier discussed, that is the one I was referring to, we will not revisit them again should you be late or you have been elsewhere when the progress in the Committee of Supply stage has continued. Honourable Members, you may also move amendments to the Estimates under the respective Heads. If a Member moves an amendment, I will call for a seconder and then debate will ensue and at the end of the debate, the mover will have a right to reply, and this will be followed by the vote on the amendment. All the votes on the amendment will be taken, please be reminded, through acclamation. The final vote on the Head, that will be taken electronically. So, when you are proposing amendments, doing explanations on amendments, when that is being put to vote, it will be done by acclamation. At the end when we finish going through the various SEGs, etcetera, we will then go back to the Head and that will be put to the vote and the vote will be done electronically. For further information of honourable Members, amendments are limited to those permitted under Standing Order 100(2) and these are an increase or decrease, removal of the item or subhead from the Head being debated. In the past, you may know some of you sitting in the Chambers now fully understand that it was the late Speaker Luveni that use to demand that you give an explanation where will you bring the fund from, where will the fund to address the increase come from. I will not be asking you to do that because I treat each and every one of you as being adult Members of Parliament and ensure that common sense prevails here. When there are no further amendments and debates, we will proceed to the vote on the Head and then we will continue to the next Head. Sometimes it moves very fast. Honourable Koroilavesau is renowned for moving these kinds of situations at a very fast pace. Please, take note that the amendment slips and copies of Standing Order 100 have been placed on your tables to assist you during the Committee of Supply stage. Altogether there are about 34 Heads but in terms of the numbers and how it is being numbered, there are Heads 1 to 50 which we need to get through today and tomorrow and therefore I humbly seek your full co-operation during this crucial process. We are just going to prepare for the Committee of Supply stage and I intend to adjourn Parliament at 1.00 p.m. and when we resume, we will go straight into the Committee of Supply. I hope you can all understand that and bear with me. In Committee Head 1 – Office of the President MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for any comments. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-1(8) - Construction – Executive Office and the Administration Block. I have noticed that last year there was a budget of $1.5 million and this is down to $1 million. If we can just have an update on this and just an update if this is the end of it or will it continue to go on. MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is a question regarding clarification to SEG 8.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Executive Office and Administration Block:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is the Construction of the Executive Office. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Chairman, the reduction is based on the implementation capacity of the agency and the current expenditure performance. So funding is allocated based on the</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1191 performance and this is in discussion with the President’s Office. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, last year there was $1.5 million. There is now $1 million, is this the end of it or is this something that will be continued?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We think this will be continued. It was not used this year:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> It was not used?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Parliament will now vote on Head 1 - Office of the President. Question put. Head 1 agreed to. Head 2 - Office of the Prime Minister MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments or clarifications, et cetera.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> I have a few, Mr. Chairman, Sir, on Head 2.</p><p>Firstly, honourable Prime Minister, I just wish to bring to your attention, Sir, that the implementation rate in the last financial year for the 11 months was around 63.65 percent, according to the report that we had received. I hope that this is something that can be addressed for this year. On Programme 1-1, I see this consistent too with a few other activities, particularly on SEG 4 - Power Supply ($460,000) and it is quite consistent right throughout the other activities in SEG 4. I just wanted to seek clarification on this allocation, Sir. I do apologise, because I have seen this in other Programmes and Activities – Programme 1- 2(4), Programme 3-1(4) and Programme 4-1(4). I just want to seek some clarification on that allocation, Sir. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition. First of all, honourable Members, we are now in Programme 1-2. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, it is because that allocation is also in the other ones, but the huge amount is on Programme 1-1(4) which I have just raised. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The honourable Leader of the Opposition is seeking clarification on that $460,000. Is there a reply? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- In Programme 1 - Maintenance and Operation?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Programme 1-1(4) Power Supply ($460,000).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> I am not sure what you are looking at on Page 17? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, honourable Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office?</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1192 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. S. TUBUNA.- Power supply covers electricity bills for the office, particularly for the whole of the New Wing of Government Buildings and, of course, our office at Carnarvon Street. This allocation has decreased by $50,000 and is not sufficient to cover for all the power throughout the year. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, still on Programme 1-1(4), I just want a clarification on Security Expenses with an allocation of $45,000. Is this for the honourable Prime Minister’s close protection detail or this is security to do with the residence or with the office? HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I think the security covers the whole of the Government Buildings. MR. CHAIRMAN.- That includes the Parliament precincts, that is covered by the Prime Minister’s security?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, that also includes the training in security detail.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Lastly, Sir, on Programme 1-1(7) – Secretariat to Truth and Reconciliation Commission ($200,000). Has the secretariat already been appointed, Sir, or with the allocation, this is going to be the funding for that purpose? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is for the establishment of the secretariat, the initial funding.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> On that same SEG, is that entirely just for the setup? There is nothing there for programmes or activities for the Commission to be undertaken this year or that will take place in the next one? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are we going back or going forward?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Still on Activity 1.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> I, kind of, listen to the honourable Leader of the Opposition and he mentioned Activity 2 now. Can we be consistent here? Thank you. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, Programme 1-2(6) – Rabi Island Council with an allocation of $200,000. I know that something that was pending for Rabi was the Council election. Is this just the support to the normal administration or does it cover the Rabi Council Election as well? HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the funding is to be used for the operational and development grants to the Rabi Island Council and also for development and operational cost. The allocation has been increased by $95,000 which will assist the leaders to meet the administrative and operational cost of the Council, such as the Judiciary services on the island, local Police, Lands Office, health workers. The major expenditure will be the renovation of the Council Office and the Banaban House in Suva. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on that same SEG 6 in terms of the Rotuma Island Council, I noticed that last year, they had a budget of $500,000 and this year it is down to $300,000.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1193 Can an explanation be given on what is the reason for the drastic drop of $200,000 for the Rotuma Island Council? HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the funding is used for operational and development grants to the Rotuman Island Council and it is released as per MOA which has been signed. The budget has decreased by $200,000 based on the needs of the Council as most of their requests have been facilitated in the current financial year. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Can I also explain why there was an increase in allocation last year? It is because in the previous year, the Rotuma Island Council had great difficulty in getting the funds released, a lot of the activities were not incomplete. So, when we came into the last Budget, we provided this additional funding for them to complete some of those, and then this is back to normal funding now. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. I have a question here. Honourable Ketan Lal, you want to increase the fund again? HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, unfortunately, the question was already answered so I withdraw my motion. MR. CHAIRMAN.- You do not want an increase or you have withdrawn? The Minister has already provided sufficient explanation, thank you. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The discussions going on here does not match what you are proposing in your slip. You wanted an increase in the budget. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to grant to Melanesian Vasu-i- Taukei. I recalled in the last session, the discussion was whether they have a council, just like all other communities, and we were told that the council will be formed. I just wanted to know whether the council has been formed or not – for accountability purposes?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.:</span> They have an administrator at the moment, not the council.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> My other question is on SEG 10 - Small Grants Project ($2,0000,000).</p><p>My question is to the honourable Prime Minister, if he can give us a breakdown on how this fund was used for us to gauge whether the allocated amount is sufficient or not? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- That fund is allocated, Mr. Chairman, to those that come directly to the Prime Minister’s Office, not through various Ministries, et cetera. Some schools come straight to the Prime Minister’s Office, some villagers for their water supply, community contribution - those ones come directly and they are funded or assisted by that small grant. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I can just add, Mr. Chairman, this allocation has always been in the Prime Minister’s Office since I know and all prime ministers have this and the discretion is on the honourable Prime Minister. Sometimes when we go visit communities, they make commitments and this these are part of that allocation. Looking at what was disbursed last year, I think this is sufficient for this budget. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Just a supplementary question to the Prime Minister, was $2 million completely used or there is some money saved? Just to understand whether that amount was used up or still left to be used?</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1194 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.:</span> More than $2 million was used.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Then my next question is, where did you get the extra money if $2 million was allocated? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- There are some grants that are not allocated directly to the Ministries and they come and they are held in the small grants projects.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- I note with appreciation the increase in the budget for the Melanesian Vasu-i:</span> Taukei, I think it has increased by $30,000 and together with the special week that they will have it in November this year, it is a good recognition of their contribution. I am just wanting to know that increase of $30,000, what exactly is it supposed to be for? HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, the funding is used to cater for operational development grants for the Melanesian and Vasu-i-Taukei communities - the 68 communities in Fiji. The allocation has increased by $30,000 based on the demands that are there. There has been increase demands from the communities and they might require more funds for next year. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- There is also more awareness on the existence and the needs of the Melanesian and Vasu-i-Taukei since we revived the Girmit Day. I believe we owe it to them to have that raised profile. Vinaka. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Apart from that they are scrattered all over Fiji and they have contributed a lot to the welfare of our country in times of need, war and everything right until now. Thank you. HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-1. Just seeking clarification through you, Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3. I was just trying to look for the allocation of the PSB Grant. I believe that last year, $10.4 million was allocated in which only $6.2 million was used by FBC. But just seeking clarification, may be there is a name change, Mr. Chairman. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, honourable Bia. Have you found it? You stated that you are still looking for it in this Activity. HON. A. BIA.- It is not included in this one, that is why I am seeking clarification, Mr. Chairman, whether the name has been changed in terms of the allocation or is it in the Communication’s Head? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Sir, it is under Head 50 - because we are going to have a new policy on public service grant, therefore, it is put under Head 50, so if you look at Head 50 it is there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. BIA.:</span> Thank you, Sir, that is why I was seeking clarification. Vinaka.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Please, just confine yourselves to what is there right in front of you. We have moved to the end of the Committee of Supply right up to Head 50, honourable Bia. Honourable Members, Programme 4-1? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, some clarification on the new IT infrastructure and I think it is fairly new. What is actually covered in this allocation in SEG 9 – Purchase – IT Infrastructure ($234,635)?</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1195 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, that will cater for the upgrade of the special server maintained at the National Archives of Fiji. Quotes were obtained from suppliers for which the cost upgrade has increased to $234,635, inclusive of 15 percent withholding tax. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are still on Head 2. Parliament will now vote on Head 2 – Office of the Prime Minister. Question put. Head 2 agreed to. Head 3 – Office of the Attorney-General MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments on Programme 1-1. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is related to Programme 1-1(7) – Fiji Law Reform Commission. I can see a huge increase in budget as compared to the last financial year by $200,000. My question is, how do you intend to use the additional sum of $200,000 in the next financial year? HON. G. E. LEUNG.- Mr. Chairman, as you know, the Fiji Law Reform Commission was moribund for a couple of years, and this Government has decided to re-establish the Fiji Law Reform Commission. The majority of that money will be expended towards operations and the hiring of new staff. The Government has a very busy legislative agenda, and the recruitment of Senior Legal Officers will enable the Commission to carry out its work. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Just a supplementary question, Mr. Chairman. In the last financial year, around $400,000 was given for the Fiji Law Reform Commission. How was that money utilised, now that you are given additional $200,000, and what kind of number are you looking at that will be mending the Fiji Law Reform Commission? HON. G. E. LEUNG.- Mr. Chairman, the majority of that money was expended on operations, as well as the hiring of staff. The majority of the staff are professional lawyers, and they are expensive to hire. Of course, law reform is a complex exercise. As I said, the Commission was dis- established some years ago, and the start up operations are very expensive. But I can assure this honourable Parliament, that the money had been well spent and will continue to be accounted for. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I think my question was not fully answered. What is the number of staff you are going to put in the Fiji Law Reform Commission and what is your budget like? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the budget is for salaries and allowances for 12 positions, which are the Chairman, Director, one Senior Legal Officer, four Legal Officers, one Senior Secretary, Executive Officer, Clerical Officer, typist and two drivers/messengers. Let me say that, this was de-established and ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> We have heard it three times, thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> No, but you have to understand that we are re-establishing this. This is what you do not understand. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- No, we did understand. Thank you, honourable Attorney-General for</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1196 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 explaining that, clearly understood. Considering that it was de-established and now you are establishing it, and currently 12 positions are being created, do you think 12 positions are enough for the amount of work that you have to do, or you feel that you need additional funding? HON. G. E. LEUNG.- Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the honourable Member concerned for her interest in the work of the Commission. It has a challenging role because at the risk of repetition, it was dis-established, but the needs of the Commission will continue to grow as the demands on legislative reform increase. The honourable Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Pharmaceutical Bill and I have extended an invitation to the honourable Leader of the Opposition to work across Parliament on laws that require reform. So, not just on the Government side, there is an ambitious law reform agenda and we welcome your participation in this exercise.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I personally want to thank him for his response:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I just have one more question on that issue. I am just thinking that if all the salaries are covered by this $1 million from $400,000 last year and $600,000? Will they stay as project positions or will they gradually graduate to SEG1 to Personal Emoluments, these positions that you have in the Commission? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is an independent Commission as you will understand. All independent Commissions are not part of the establishment, as I said, it is separate. These 12 additional staff are from zero. As we move on, as the honourable Attorney-General said, the Commission will be allocated a budget every year and they decide how many people, and it is their request for these positions that we are funding. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, just a quick clarification on Head 3-1-1(5), there is a provision there for Drafting of Laws at $30,000. Is that for outsourcing, or what is that specifically for? I understand you would have a Unit doing the drafting within the Chambers. HON. G. E. LEUNG. Mr. Chairman, from time to, there are urgent Bills that require extra assistance and occasionally consultants and technical advisors are engaged for this purpose. In addition, the allocation also includes printing of laws and draft laws. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 3 - Office of the Attorney-General. Question put. Head 3 agreed to. Honourable Members, I am happy that we have begun on this journey and it is now 1 o’clock and I intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch now. We will resume at 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 1.01 p.m.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1197 The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. Head 4 - Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question to the honourable Minister is on Programme 1-2(7) - National Asset Management Framework ($40,000). Is this Framework complete? Is it for implementation? How is this money used? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Are you asking for Special Expenditure?</p></body>
