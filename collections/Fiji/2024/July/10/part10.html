Budget is quite a long process and I am so grateful that up until today, you all look fresh in coming this morning and ready for another long march, as the military always term their march. I also welcome those joining us in the gallery and those watching the live proceedings on television and the internet. Once more, I thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. Committee of Supply – Votes For the information of honourable Members, the Business Committee has approved that the votes taken during the Committee of Supply stage, with respect to Programmes, Activities and SEGs will be through acclamation, but the final vote on the respective Heads, that is when we will finish all the details of a particular Head, we will go back to the Head and I will put it to the vote, and that vote will be taken electronically. Back-to-Office Report – Study Visit to Australian Parliaments Honourable Members, please, take note that the Back-to-Office Report on the study visit to the Australian Federal Parliament and the New South Wales Parliament will be made available in the Library for your perusal and reference.
