<body><h3>CATD?</h3><h4>CATD?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Chairman, that is to support the Ministry’s effort to undertake an institutional review of the CATD because the legislation is very archaic, so there needs to be a review and that funding is provided for that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-2? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 10 - Village Transformation Initiative ($2,000,000) - R. If the honourable Minister can elaborate on the criteria as to how he selects the village and what kind of transformative initiatives are being looked at? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, this programme is targeting villages that are really not up to par with regard to their development. For villages out there in the interior, it is especially for sanitation and village improvement, as well as for those that are close to the hotels. As I have already mentioned in my speech, it is a new programme for us. We started it last year and this is the second year. We have been informing all our Roko and Provincial Councils about the projects that is available for that, which is mostly on sanitation and beautification. How do they apply? They have the forms there in the Provincial Council Office with the Roko. They have to arrange it with them, and it comes through the normal process. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7, there is $100,000 allocated for Feasibility Study for Inter-island Trading Vessels. I am interested in this because we have a Department of Transport that is housed in the Ministry of Public Works. I was wondering, why is it that the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs is doing the feasibility study rather than the Department of Transport? HON. I. VASU.- For this one, Mr. Chairman, there are lots of concerns from the community, especially for maritime movement in regards to shipping. So, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs is taking interest in trying to make a proper study of what is really needed out there, especially for Lau and Kadavu. I understand that the private companies are doing the work now, but there are still complaints from the community. So, we have decided to make a feasibility study so that we can really see what is best for the communities out there, on understanding the type of vessel that will suit them, especially for Lau where there are a lot of concerns.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1203 We have received concerns from people coming back to Suva because of the service out there in the community which has not been properly provided and which is why the Ministry of iTaukei is looking at ways to assist maritime communities who have been complaining in regard to shipping. HON. J. USAMATE. – I hope you will liaise with the Department of Transport because they do a lot of those studies and they have done them in the past. It is just a suggestion. Thank you. MR. CHAIRMAN. – Is that a question or a point of clarification?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. VASU:</span> – Noted, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN:</span> – Honourable Kumar? HON. P. D. KUMAR.– Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 – Education Awareness. There is $300,000 allocated for this programme and I also see some awareness programmes on Programme 2-1. If the honourable Minister can explain to us why you have an education awareness programme under this particular Programme 1, as well as another programme, particularly for Leadership in Programme 2 on the next page? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD. – If I can respond to that, those are two different activities. What the study shows and the presentation from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Ministry of Education is particularly for educational awareness. If you notice, it is about collaborating with the Ministry of Education on TELS, on TVET and higher educational institutions to provide tailor-made educational courses for schools. I do not want to use the word, ‘dropouts’, but for people who have fallen from the track after Form 4, 5 and 6 and a big chunk of them are iTaukei students. Essentially, the discussion was that we should try and get them in the net so that we are able to train them. Contrary to what we have heard, a lot of those people are ending up with Pacific Polytech and other institutions. We need a much bigger awareness to get them. It is not a big amount of money, but I think the benefit would be quite a big windfall. MR. CHAIRMAN. –Programme 2-3? HON. J. USAMATE. – Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 2-3(10) – Survey of Mahogany Plantation in the Northern Division. I am very interested because this is a function that is normally carried out by the Ministry of Lands. When we have the periphery boundary surveys already done, there is the survey of the mataqali allotments inside. So, I am interested, because this would then be a duplication of what normally happens under the Ministry of Lands and what the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs is proposing. HON. I. VASU. - Mr. Chairman, this is to assist the Ministry of Lands on the survey of boundaries, especially the disputed ones for the mahogany. For mahogany, survey should be completed by 2029. Now, the survey is still within Viti Levu so we (Ministry of iTaukei Affairs) have decided to help the Ministry of Lands with the survey in Vanua Levu. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Partly just for honourable Usamate, it is a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Lands and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs because there are a lot of disputes with the land and surveying and getting the boundaries and everything workout, so it is better that the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the Ministry of Lands work together. That is why the budget is with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>1204 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, through you, just a clarification on $950,000 here at the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and there is another $738,000 for Mahogany Survey in the Ministry of Lands.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> As I have said, they are working together.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. VASU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, the Ministry for Lands will take care of Viti Levu and we will take care of Vanua Levu in the survey. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think honourable Kirpal knows very well that surveying is really an expensive exercise. Programme 4-1? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Preservation of Historical Monuments whereby $150,000 was allocated in last year’s budget and in this year’s budget, I do not see that any amount is allocated for it. My question is, are the monuments all fixed?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is completed now:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Alright, thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, this is to do with Programme 4-1(10) – Rehabilitation of Levuka World Heritage Structure ($1,500,000), which specific structure is this? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, this is to refurbish the Levuka Community Centre, the last one was just on the structure and the second one is for St. Johns Catholic Church in Cawaci. They will cover that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 5 – Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts. Question put. Head 5 agreed to. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, I kind of heard some sighs when I awarded the acclamation vote to those who said “no”. Remember in the past, it is the same thing. We yelled from the top of our voices in the Opposition, but it always fell on those that were more in numbers. Even if your voice is bigger, I am kidding, I will play it by ear. Head 6 – Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) – National Security Defence Review. This has been going on, I believe, for some time. I am just wondering, is this now the completion of the exercise, honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> The short answer is ‘yes’.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, my question is on Programme 2-1(5) – Completion of IBMS Project. If the honourable Minister can tell us a little bit about this IBMS Project.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1205</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- The IBMS is the maintenance programme:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> No, she only wants some explanation. Is it still ongoing?. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If I can just help; the IBMS annual fee maintenance, that is $155,000 out of that, and the IBMS e-Passport contractual payment and oracle support for the IBMS hardware upgrade, makes up a total of $400,000. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, through you, the only amount left is now $21,000? In other words, are all the upgrades completed?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> I have noticed, Mr. Chairman, that there has been a substantiative increase in the amount of money set aside for passports - an increase of $2.5 million up to $4 million in this Budget. Can the honourable Minister explain, why the huge increase? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Which SEG are you referring to? HON. J. USAMATE.- Programme 2-1(5) – Passports ($4 million). Last year, it was $1.5 million. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- For e-passports, blank books per year, five years contract in Germany that produces the books, 40 percent at once or $707,329 and 60 percent after delivery which is a million dollars, a total of FJ$2 million. Then you have the shipment, which is $2 million, service support is around €69,850. That is for yearly contract with the company for their services. Service support next year by the same company will cost us approximately $200,000, the passport printer and enrolment kits for the new financial year is $1.3 million and Disaster Recovery Support is $3.5 million.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> The passport number is about 100,000.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Is it that we are completely changing our passport system or what is the big jump for? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, there has been a remarkable increase that we will want because of the current passport numbers that we have - 40,000. So, we are going to increase the numbers next year. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- From 40,000 to 100,000?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister on Programme 2-1(9) - Disaster Recovery Support ($2 million). If you can just explain what disaster recovery is this? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, that is to do with passports in case something happens and the system that prints passports collapses, or there is a malware through cybercrime. That is the amount we use for the recovery of the data that we have.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1206 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 - Digitisation and Modernisation of Fiji Immigration Systems and Processes ($383,198). I believe DFAT is involved, are they assisting you with money or also with people?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Both:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> So, what changes are you trying to bring about in this?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Chairman, this might be a question for Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, given the threats that we face in terms of what we encounter at the border, this becomes more complicated all the time. There are ways now where we can use technology that enhances the way we safeguard the country, particularly from people that we do not need to come through here. So, we know what people are about and if people are sick. If you go to other airports, you are looking at where you have these cameras that detect if people are sick from sea, but these are for the added security measures that we will have at the airport. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 9 - e-Passport Enrolment Kit – Immigration Offices and Overseas Missions. I know over the years, e-passport is being introduced in various Missions, and I can see $300,000 is allocated for that activity. Is it for any specific Mission that you are targeting, and if, yes, which ones are those? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, that includes e-passport kits for Suva, Lautoka and Nadi. This is, in particular, to take the kit out to those who cannot come, particularly for disabled or sick people. We have right now in Missions, like Canberra, Wellington and Washington DC, the enrolment kits that our local people in those countries go to, to try and enrol to get their passports printed there locally. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The proposed Missions for these passport kits right now are Fiji High Commission in Beijing and Fiji High Commission in New Delhi. We already have e- passport kits at Fiji High Commission in Wellington, Consulate in Sydney, Canberra, Washington, Geneva, Abu Dhabi, London and Tokyo. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 6 - Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration. Question put. Head 6 agreed to. Head 7 – Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Chairman, through you, Programme 1-3(10) - Workers Compensation ($6 million). Can the honourable Minister clarify the $6 million allocated, will it deal with all the pending cases that you have in the Ministry?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Chairman, yes, for the current and pending.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Sir, just a question on the same issue; I assume that this will also take up the cases from the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF). Traditionally, Government has been responsible for paying compensation for Government workers. Will this just cover Government workers or both - workers from the Government and the private sector?</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1207</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They only cover the State employees:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Since you are taking over the cases from ACCF, how will the ones for the private sector be covered? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Even with the existence of ACCF, the Ministry of Employment is still doing a lot of the work, assessments, et cetera. The whole thing is in transition now. The State employees already handled by the Ministry will now be directly handled in terms of their compensation. So, this increase in budget is to provide for that. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The ACCF will still process that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, on SEG 7 - Foreign Employment Mobility Services. Can we have a clarification on the reason for the increase of $50,000?. Is that for the Liaison Officers? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Yes, that is to assist with the Country Liaison Officers (CLOs) and other expenses. HON. P. K. BALA.- Programme 1-4(7) - Pacific Labour Scheme ($400,000). Can the honourable Minister clarify this allocation? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Which one?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> On page 55, Programme 1-4(7) - Pacific Labour Scheme.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Sir, it is essentially to meet the expenses of the Pacific Labour Scheme. The demand for Fijian workers under the Programme has been growing. As the honourable Minister explained, there are two Country Liaison Officers to closely provide the support on the ground. The Ministry intends to establish a toll-free line in Australia to help the workers who were sent by the Ministry. This allocation is for the appointment of a Country Liaison Officer and other operational costs in Australia, considering there are over 5,000 workers. Basically, the Liaison Officer as the honourable Minister had explained in Parliament, will be responsible for pastoral care and welfare support for workers on the ground, and also promoting Fiji to the approved employers in Australia when necessary. HON. P. K. BALA.- Just a clarification, we had earlier on heard that those Liaison Officers’ allocation are in the Foreign Employment Mobility Services which is allocated $280,000. I am asking about the Pacific Labour Scheme ($400,000), what is that allocation for? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, if I may, the $50,000 increase was the allocation that includes operational logistics, cost for mobilising workers including cost of hiring, training venues, medical costs for pre-departure, et cetera, and transportation sometimes needed from here to Nadi, and includes cost of planned visits to New Zealand and Australia on bilateral meetings. Then the Pacific Labour Scheme which is $400,000, is for the appointment of additional Country Liaison Officers, one in New Zealand and three in Australia, because there are 5,000 plus Fijian workers now and the Country Liaison Officers will be responsible for pastoral care and everything. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-6?</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1208 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- Programme 1-6(7) - Asia Productivity Organization Training Allowance, I noticed that there has been a significant increase in the budget from $40,000 to $100,000 - a jump of more than 100 percent. Can you just give some clarification? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increase in allocation is to host the World Social Marketing Conference, which I have alluded to in my presentation, from 22 nd October, 2024 to 25 th October, 2024 at the Sofitel. We have 21 countries attending the Asia Productivity Organization (APO) Conference here and there will be 72 participants. There will be a traditional welcome, purchase of tokens and gifts, there will be travel and accommodation expenses for our people, as well as catering for the cost of APO trainings due to the increase in face-to-face APO trainings. So, that is the increased allocation there. I also said in my presentation, Sir, that we are now the Chair of APO. HON. J. USAMATE.- One more question, Mr. Chairman, under the same SEG 7, you have a National Productivity Master Plan. A few years ago, we signed the Productivity Roundtable Charter that was signed by Tripartite, and I do not think we have had another National Productivity Master Plan other than studies. So, I am very interested to know how this $50,000 will be used. How will it be operated? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this is the cost of the review of the Productivity Charter Plan and the implementation of the Master Plan, stakeholders engagement, national awareness on productivity movement, house productivity talks, symposiums and workshops and appointment of Productivity Champions in the public and private sector, as well as printing materials. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 7 – Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations. Question put. Head 7 agreed to. Head 8 – Ministry of Foreign Affairs MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on SEG 8 - Upgrade and Enhancement - Building (Overseas Missions) - $1,000,000, if details of those Missions can be given. Which Missions are we talking about? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is to accommodate refurbishment works. The Fiji Mission priority is Fiji-owned properties - London, Canberra and Wellington. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 2-1(7) – Special Administrator (480,000), can the honourable Assistant Minister briefly explain how are the Special Administrators appointed and who are these four? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Before I allow the questions to be responded to, we have been having this topic in Parliament for quite some time. You still want clarification on this, even though you know it?</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1209 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is essentially the deployment of a Senior Military Officer to the Permanent Representative’s Office to the United Nations (UN) in New York to handle any issues arising out of peacekeeping deployments with the UN and caters for the salary of the Officer and operational expenses. HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA.- If I may just carry on from there, Mr. Chairman, to answer honourable Ketan Lal’s question, yes, there is no change from the last allocation of $480,000 and as the honourable Minister for Finance has already alluded to, it is to cater for all the operational costs of the Military and Police Advisor for the Fiji Mission and the current post holder is Colonel Siliva Raradoka Vananalagi.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> And it is no longer Administrator, it is Military Advisor.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, just a curiosity because I have very little knowledge in this area, so the Special Administrator is now going to be the Military Advisor. My question is, why is it in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ budgeting and not RFMF budgeting? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is simply because it is going to be based at the UN and peacekeeping is coordinated by the UN. It is a UN operation so, obviously, it makes sense to have that within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I hear that the peacekeeping budget has now been moved into RFMF:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> On the same argument, why is this still here and not there?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I have just said, Mr. Chairman, that it is a UN…..</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I can answer that:</span> The Military Advisor is located in the Office of our Permanent Representative to the United Nations (PRUN) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That person is a Senior Military Officer who gets her salary here, but because of her position within PRUN, there are other things, including her accommodation, and the whole range of her work requires her to be subjected to the leadership of our Permanent Representative to the UN. That is why it is under this allocation and not with the peacekeeping. Peacekeeping is for the Fijian peacekeeping missions overseas, not including the one in New York. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Do you understand the meaning of PRUN?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you:</span> Parliament will now vote on Head 8 – Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Question put. Head 8 agreed to. Head 9 – Independent Bodies MR. CHAIRMAN.- On Programme 1-1, we have a question.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1210 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> I apologise, Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my question.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Parliament will now vote on Head 9 – Independent Bodies. Question put. Head 9 agreed to. Head 10 – Ministry of Environment and Climate Change MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-2?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Sir, I have a motion.</p><p>Head 10-1-3(4) – Implementation and Enforcement of the Environment Management Act ($30,000), I move a motion: To increase the allocation by another $20,000.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, this allocation is on the enforcement of the</p><h4>Environment Management Act and I have two other motions later as well.</h4><p>Sir, we have very good laws, but we are quite weak in the enforcement. Having served in the Division and, of course, as Permanent Secretary, a lot of times we are not able to effectively enforce the laws that we have simply just because of lack of resources. That is why I am recommending that the allocation under SEG 4 on the implementation and enforcement of the Environment Management Act be increased by another $20,000. We need to look after our environment for sustainability in the long term and that is why I am moving this motion, Sir. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, I think the current allocation is sufficient to cover the existing work that the Ministry is undertaking. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will put that to the vote. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Particularly, to enhance the Eastern Division and maritime islands, so this is kind of a new allocation, but there are other allocations in other Ministries. MR. CHAIRMAN.- If you have nothing further to add, we will put it to the vote. Question on amendment put. Motion lost. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme1-3(8) – Naboro Landfill – Phase 2 (Cell 4), the same allocation was provided for in last year’s budget but was not utilised at all. So, can we have some explanation from the Ministry as to why that allocation last year was not utilised and what are the chances of this allocation being utilised this year? Has any preparatory work undertaken already so that we can be assured that this allocation will be fully utilised for that purpose?</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1211 HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, yes, I think there has been substantial work already undertaken and we have provided some provisions for that work, particularly in ensuring that stage 2 of the work is completed. There are some provisions that will be fully utilised in the next financial year, and we have provided another contract for the current company for the next four years so that they can undertake the landfill at Naboro. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, just to add to that, the agreement is already signed and $2.8 million will be paid in this financial year. The total cost is $7.8 million, so $2.7 million is allocated for next year’s budget. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Head 10-1-3(7), Consultancy - Development of Fiji’s Container Deposit Regulations ($45,000). The same amount and same activity was mentioned last year and this consultancy work seems to be forever. So, I would like to know or if you can tell us whether it is still in the pipeline or is it going to end this year? HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, the Ministry has been allocated $45,000 to undertake the consultancy work for the development of the Container Deposit Regulations. The Cabinet paper is currently being formulated by the Ministry, to seek Cabinet’s endorsement to continue the work, and then the engagement of the consultant. So, hopefully, this will be the end of this this year. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-5? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, I need some clarifications on Programme 1-5(4) - Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) - $30,000. Thereafter, in SEG 5, again, there is another provision and I am assuming that that particular provision is for annual contribution of $400 to CITES. Can the honourable Minister, please, specify what is the allocation of $30,000 for? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is essentially to support the administration of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Act 2002, and provide support to the Management Committee and the Scientific Council established under that Act, as well as meeting expenses, et cetera. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question; what about the enforcement, is that included in it? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, the Committee and the Council will also have that mandate - to look at how this provision in the Act is enforced. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 5 - Stockholm Convention on the Management of Persistent Organic Pollutants and I see an allocation of $1,500 only. I would like to ask the honourable Minister, how will this $1,500 be used? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is an annual contribution to the Persistent Organic Pollutants Convention.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Subscription:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> We have a motion from the honourable Leader of the Opposition on Head 10-1-6.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1212 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- On SEG 4 - Environment Compliance North and West ($8,000), I move a motion: That the allocation be increased by $12,000, to bring the allocation to $20,000 for the activities in the North and the West.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- I second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Again, similar to my previous motion, we need to arm our people in the various Divisions so that they can do their work effectively. I am very familiar with the work in the Northern Division because I served there as Commissioner Northern, dealing with extractive industries, particularly logging in Vanua Levu, a lot of fisheries activities as well, industrial waste, I know that we used to have a lot of issues with Fiji Sugar Corporation on their disposal. You would recall, Mr. Chairman, Sir, that in one of the recent sittings of Parliament, I was asking the honourable Minister for Local Government about solid and liquid wastes. There are a lot of environmental issues and, again, we just need to give resources to the people on the ground so that they can do their work more effectively. That is why I have moved this slight increase, but it will mean a lot in the execution of duties at divisional level. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- The honourable Leader of the Opposition understands that all the other Departments and Ministries contribute to this one, that is the budgeted amount from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. There is nothing stopping the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Ministry of Local Government in contributing towards the total cost of that function. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Again, if I may be of help to the honourable Leader, as I have said earlier, this is a new allocation and specifically target the Eastern Division and Maritime Islands. This is the first allocation and if there is a need to increase it next year, we will do that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Premila Kumar, do you want to speak on the motion? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Yes, Sir. I just want to simply say that when it comes to environment management, we tend to believe that all other Ministries are really looking after the environment. If you look around us, simple issues, like litter. The Litter Decree is there but littering continues, although we say that there are a number of Ministries involved in looking after that. I strongly believe honourable Prime Minister, Sir, that you need to allocate resources to the Ministry of Environment, a dedicated agency, so that they can deal with environmental issues. Normally, when it comes to Ministry of Local Government, they are too busy with their own mandate and other agencies as well tend to forget environment. We sit here and assume that other agencies will be also assisting, but it is an issue that we need to look at in depth. MR. CHAIRMAN.- That is the response from the Government. We have heard from the honourable Prime Minister that it is a multi-pronged approach from the various Ministries concerned. But, again, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we will put your motion to vote. Head 10-6(4) be increased by $12,000 to make it $20,000. So far, they have $8,000. Question on amendment put. Motion lost.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1213 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG 7 - Implementation of Climate Change Act ($500,000). In the last financial year, $5 million was allocated for the implementation of the Climate Change Act. I would like to know how this money was used, and to see whether $500,000 is sufficient to take this programme further. MR. CHAIRMAN.- She is just seeking clarification. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the reduction is essentially due to the completion of the project and the total for this budget support is approximately about $30 million. This year, the allocation was not used, so that is why there is reduction and there is no allocation. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I apologise, Mr. Chairman, I am really confused here. If that can be explained again in terms of the figures because what I am saying is that last year, $5 million was allocated. How was that used for the implementation of the Climate Change Act? Now, it has been reduced to…. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is why I said it was not used and we are getting budget support from the European Union (EU). Whatever is allocated is distributed across different activities, so that is why we have not allocated anything. HON. J. USAMATE.- I seek clarification, does that mean that this Climate Change Act will not be implemented?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> No, it will be implemented.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> But you are not spending the money on it? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This year, it was not used, and we are getting budget support from the EU, which will be spread across different activities. We do not need to allocate that this year. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Last year, there was $5 million allocated by the EU. Of course, DFAT allocated $1.5 million as well to the Climate Change Unit. Given what is in SEG 7, Mr. Chairman, I would like to know if there are other avenues in which Government is going to source funds from because we all know that this is the biggest existential threat that we face as a country. In my reply to your Speech, honourable Minister for Finance, I did state that Parliaments are responsible to ensure that we align to the global, the regional and even local issues and the honourable Speaker will be answerable at the IPU Meetings about what Fiji Parliament is doing. So, are there any other funding elsewhere to give assurance to our people that we are taking this issue seriously? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- A very good question, honourable Leader of the Opposition, you are right and I agree with you. If you look at the whole budget of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change and all the other funding support that we are getting in terms of budget support, I think there will be more than enough to support any of those activities, advocacy, representation of Fiji in these international climate change forums, et cetera. As I have said, yes, we want to make sure that environment and climate change is mainstreamed. It is a cutting theme across all the different Ministries and a lot of the climate financing strategies now have to be linked in terms of collaboration of key ministries - Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Climate Change. We are putting those strategies together, so the funding allocation is appropriate.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1214 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Apart from the European Union, are there any other? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Sir, there are various projects, as well as budget support that we can direct to specific activities and most of the infrastructure support that we are getting is culled in terms of climate resilient infrastructure or climate resilient activities, so as I have said, it is mainstreamed now and that is how we would like to support it. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, can I ask one final question because we have started with the relocation of Nabavatu Village. Please, bear with me if I have not gone through the others, so how are we going to continue with the relocation of Nabavatu Village that we have already started? Is that already allocated to a Ministry? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- As I have said, honourable Leader of the Opposition, most of the projects, loans, grants and budget support that we are negotiating that we receive, climate change, climate resilient infrastructure, climate change activities is embedded into those mainstreamed programmes. It is working very well because a lot of the funding agencies also want to see those activities embedded into the funding model that they provide for projects, so most projects would have that. The Nabavatu project is funded from the Climate Change Relocation Trust Fund. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 10 – Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. Question put. Head 10 agreed to. Head 13 – Independent Commissions MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-1(6) – Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission ($5,526,760). I do see an increase in their budget. Is this increase for a specific activity, and if so, what is it for? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The increase is essentially due to the following - the increase by $275,000 to accommodate one Legal Officer, one Customer Service Officer and one Financial Analyst, three Environmental Officers, one Senior Human Resource Training Officer and one Team Leader Advocacy. Maintenance and operations have increased and $645,000 is to cater for all that. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, last year, I did raise an issue regarding the regulators for Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) were based in EFL and not at Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC). So, my question is whether that issue has been addressed or not? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- No, EFL determines independently the tariff rates for EFL as well. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I do understand that but if you look at the recent amendments that were made to the law, the regulator for wire man, electrical, et cetera, was moved to FCCC. In the last Standing Committee meeting, they did mention that they do not have the resources and the regulators are still with EFL and not with FCCC. I had raised it last time and this is a bit of an issue because people want a transparent system and not the regulator to be sitting with the main player.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1215 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think the transition is necessary. You are right. When EFL was 100 percent government owned, all that was seen as a Government agency. So that is the point that needs to be taken into account. As I have said, the tariff rate is already independently decided. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Just to add on, Sir, in terms of FCCC’s current role, they set the tariff on electricity pricing which is probably what honourable Premila Kumar is alluding to. They actually have the power to determine the Independent Power Producer (IPP) pricing. There is a regulatory arm in there that looks after the wiring and that bit of it. I think that bit is still with EFL, and we probably need to understand that a bit more because I am not sure whether FCCC is the right house for it because it is a technical certification. It is almost like Civil Aviation Authority type of setup, so it might be something we have to look at. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, just to add to that, the Department of Energy together with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), is currently conducting a regulatory framework diagnostic. It is looking at the generation, transmission, and all those elements, and the regulatory. The outcome is envisaged to separate those functions and where they would lie, and also the current regulations - the legal side. That should be completed soon, and workshops with the stakeholders in order to move that forward. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Additionally, they are also setting up a new regulatory mechanism for Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) as well. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I am pleased with the information given by the honourable Ministers because this is a very critical issue. Sometimes, we tend to say, “Alright, these are wiring and electrical people coming and doing wiring, or electrical goods coming into the country”, which has a lot of significance in terms of the number of fires we have in the country. These are all shoddy jobs being done by some of these electrical companies, who are not regulated properly and that is creating a bit of a problem in households. Then what happens? The Government has to allocate money. When houses go up in flames, we pay some money to the family. We need to nip that in the bud, so I am very pleased with the honourable Ministers for their responses. I look forward to the work that will be completed and how you are going to make the regulation rather strong so that we do not have this problem in the future. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on. Parliament will now vote on Head 13 – Independent Commissions. Question put. Head 13 agreed to. Head 14 – Fiji Corrections Service MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments. Since there are no comments, Parliament will now vote on Head 14 - Fiji Corrections Service. Question put. Head 14 agreed to.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1216 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 Head 15- Ministry of Justice MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on Programme 1-1(5) - E-Transaction Cost ($30,000). Can the honourable Minister explain the transaction that has taken place in the Ministry using this $30,000, which was given previously, and it is being given now? Is it an ongoing cost, or is it for hardware, or what is it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, it is an ongoing exercise.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Just to add to what the honourable Minister said, it is the fees to banks for any transaction carried out on EFTOS machines for printing birth, death and marriage certificates by the Ministry. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) - Refunds ($20,000). Can I have a clarification on that? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, it deals with funds associated to paying back to the public or parties that actually withdraw the paid legislative fees from getting the service. They pay for it, and then they withdraw without asking for the service, so they get refunded. I think that is the right thing to do. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Minister on SEG 7 - Digitisation Programme ($100,000), is that specifically for the Companies Office or the Ministry as a whole? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, it could be for ROT. There is also an exercise with the Official Receivers Office. Last year, it was $100,000, and this year, again, it is $100,000. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Could you be more clearer than that? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, we are undertaking an exercise throughout the Ministry. The chief one is the ROT, but also with the Official Receivers Office. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Chairman, a supplementary question; the digitisation of the ROT, is it expected to be completed this year? I am sure there is quite a few other people here who are interested more than I? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, we are meeting with the consultant next week, and I am hopeful it will be completed. HON. F. S. KOYA.- This year?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C.

KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, on the same Digitisation Programme for which $100,000 is given this year, last year $50,000 was given, so I am a bit confused if you are saying that</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1217 the consultant will come and do the job. Does that mean that we did not use $50,000 last year? MR. CHAIRMAN.- It is ongoing. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It was used, in fact, it was almost completed. I think this additional $50,000 is really for planning, scoping for the digitisation and the additional funding is provided for the implementation phase. I think the honourable Minister did say that, so this is just carrying it forward for implementation. It is also about preservation of records. You are not only putting new stuff into it, you are actually going back, bringing it, digitising it and preserving it so it is not just that the project is completed. Now, it is implementation and also going back and digitising some of the records. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is, is it the digitisation of records for what because it is the Ministry of Justice? Is it the court orders or what? I do not know. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Well, I can give you a general answer. The record of digitisation of Government in the past for so many years, was extremely poor, honestly. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- So, this is what we are trying to do now, going into different Ministries and really … MR. CHAIRMAN.- There is no hogwash here, honourable Usamate.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> So, it is not hogwash. It is washing the mess.</p><h4>HON. P.D.

PRASAD.:</span> No, it is not general. We said it has been done, it is now being implemented with additional funding. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Chairman, if I may enlighten this Parliament, there were two failed projects undertaken by the previous Government which cost $300,000. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You want to know that? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- So, the projects were preserved, in the end, nothing turned out. Then they did a study, and it was paid in US$2.5 million, but nothing came out of it. So, we are actually doing what you should have done. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D.

Our officers travel around the country, in fact. Last week, they just returned from the Northern Division.

KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I want to declare my interest, I live in a Government Quarters and have been for the last 14 years. I have raised this issue with the highest level of government, even with the honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. The only office that I have not been to is the Office of the Prime Minister. I do not really want to bother him with my accommodation. Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am sleeping in my sitting room now. The bedrooms are vacant. The sitting room that I am sleeping in has got a big hole on one of the boards and the ply that covers the ceiling is totally gone. I have been asking this for one year. Three weeks ago when I called the Ministry of Finance, they told me, ‘we run short of money’ so I am asking an increase. I am paying monthly rental which the Government still demands for my quarters, even though I am sleeping in this condition. I have been sleeping like this for the last one year. I do not want to complain because I have already complained to the honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. He has tried to encourage people to repair it but I cannot complain any more. Why should I bother the honourable Prime Minister who is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to come and repair my house? He has got no business of how I sleep or how I wake up in the morning. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Does that include your Sitting Allowance here?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> But I am sleeping at home, Sir, I am not sleeping here.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- I am addressing your letter of complaint that I have just received as well.

That will come up in the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport budget. Part of that is also allocated there in terms of the upkeep of Government properties. I have heard the honourable Minister and have noted that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you for your response, honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport. I am concerned that this is the plight of a Member of this august Parliament and he has been complaining. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am sure the honourable Member would remember the story about the soldier that turned up, did not shave. His Officer asked him, “Did you shave this morning?” The soldier said, “Yes, Sir.” Did you use the mirror? He said, “Yes, Sir.” Try using a razor because your problem would have been easily resolved if you had asked me and the Minister responsible for quarters. Thank you. MR.

KOROILAVESAU.- I withdraw my motion and I will come and see the honourable Prime Minister. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. You just made a statement that is enough there, not for someone else. Programme 3-1? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 3-1-(10) – Shipbuilding Revival Project with an allocation of $10 million, can this be clarified, please? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, we asked for that to be put into the budget because we are having the development of the shipbuilding and ship repair facilities being now understudy with the help of Australia. We have asked for this $10 million to go towards that and even if we have to venture out and buy an amphibious vessel to help with the regional development and maritime, as well as disaster relief work. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 3-3(7), I seek some clarification on the Consultancy Fees, that is, $400,000. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, that is a very complicated exercise being taken there as part of the whole of Savusavu Blue Town Concept, taking into account the development of the roads, so we need that consultancy fee available for our part of the development of Savusavu and surrounding areas. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, can I go back to SEG 10 on Fiji Rice Limited with an allocation of $1.4 million and Food Processors with an allocation of $1 million. You know how important these entities are. I just seek clarification from Government on what specific areas are we targeting in this year’s allocation because this is important as well in terms of linkage to our rural farmers. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Chairman, the Fiji Rice Limited has been allocated $1.1 million for the purchase of paddy. Government is also subsidizing the price of rice paddy so the price of paddy ranges from $750 per tonne to $850, based on the moisture content. So, it is also for the subsidy and, of course, $287,000 is provided to farmers for fertilizer and weedicide subsidy. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Just to add a little bit on that, for the fertilizer and weedicide subsidy, last year it was allocated for all the non-sugar crops under the Ministry of Agriculture. This year, we have moved the rice part of it to Fiji Rice Limited because Fiji Rice Limited is the one dealing with the farmers and we find that this would be a much better and efficient way to help the farmers. That is why an additional $287,000 from that budget is put under Fiji Rice Limited. MR. CHAIRMAN.- The second question is on Food Processors Fiji Limited (FPFL). HON. S. TUBUNA.- The $1 million being allocated to Food Processors Fiji Limited is for agriculture and marine buying subsidy. The FPFL source their agriculture and marine products for both, seasonal and non-seasonal, from rural and maritime areas. The products are canned, they are frozen and sold locally and exported to the United States of America, New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and the Pacific Island countries. The provision of this subsidy will support the company by procuring high quantity of agriculture produce to meet the demand of its products and markets.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1221 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Sir, my question is also on Food Processors. Last year, $2 million was given to that company and this year it is reduced to $1 million. Can you explain why, if it is to do with subsidy? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The reduction is really aligned to the expenditure trend and the Ministry has done some realignment of funds to the allocation of so-called vulnerable being overspent at the end of the financial year. I think we looked at the expenditure trend and we said that whatever is allocated instead of $2 million, $1 million is sufficient for this budget. Part of the expenditure control. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote of Head 17 – Ministry of Civil Service and Public Enterprises. Question put. Head 17 agreed to. Head 18 – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, before I raise my question, I just wish to acknowledge Government for the increase from $29 million last year to around $37 million this year, but at the same time in the implementation that was given to us by the Ministry of Finance, Sir, the implementation rate is quite low (64.55 percent) and I hope that the Ministry can look into that. My question is on Programme 1-1(7) - Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific (Gov4Res) Project (UNDP). This is a very important project that was started together with UNDP and if the honourable Minister can just clarify on this allocation. Which specific areas are they targeting in terms of the assistance that is provided? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Sorry, if you can repeat that, honourable Leader of the Opposition? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Programme 1-1(7) - Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific (Gov4Res) Project (UNDP) the allocation of $1.5 million. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is a new expenditure allocation, honourable Leader of the Opposition. This is part of the UNDP Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific Project and is to cover risk informed rural development work in Fiji for the period August 2024 to July 2025. If you look at the details of the agreement as stipulated in amendment 4 and amendment 5 of the Letter Agreement of the UNDP and the Ministry signed on 24 th May, the schedule of payment for this agreement is listed as Quarter 3 - $136,000; Quarter 4 - $577,000; Quarter 1 - $10,000 and Quarter 2 - $26,000. It is a new expenditure allocation for this year’s Budget. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, my question is, which specific areas are they targeting? This is not new, we have started this programme way back in 2020 with the UNDP. I am familiar with it, but my question is which specific area? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Essentially it is for rural development works, like, access roads, footpaths, water tanks, including desalination plants and in some cases ecological purification systems. So, there are a range of activities as part of that.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>1222 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, as you well know honourable Leader of the Opposition, the development of minimum designs for demonstration projects on community access roads, as the honourable Minister for Finance has shared, footpaths, footbridges, desalination plants, bore holes, concrete water tanks, rain water harvesting, EPS systems, risk informing and retrofitting for Vio Integrated Rural Electrification Project, the review of the Ministry’s strategic plan and procurement of national rural development database server and software. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I am glad to see on SEG 8, the Upgrade and Enhancement of Quarters ($1.5 million). I know this has always been a challenge for our civil servants who live in rural areas. Is this targeting particular areas, or is it just shared amongst the Divisions, or is there a particular focus on which quarters would be targeted in this budget? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, it is a general upgrade for all our existing quarters on a priority basis on the ones that need the attention at the earliest. So, it is on a priority basis. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is on SEG 10 - Project Preparatory Works ($100,000). I would like to know which projects are in the preparatory phase for which $100,000 has been allocated? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, I will just go through what we have used at the moment, $29,290 has been released, of which, $26,826, which is 91.6 percent, has been used for the construction of a new Government Station at Wainua in Naitasiri. Preparatory works undertaken include, securing of land for the development of the Government Station at the site, completion of water reticulation system by the Water Authority of Fiji, completion of partial site levelling earthworks, road access and completion of the EFL grid extension at the site. For the preparatory works, I am sure this is what you are asking for, the construction and upgrade of Government Stations and Quarters planned in the upcoming years, based on the level of preparedness, so full funding will be considered in the following financial year. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, just a clarification on SEG 8 - Construction of Evacuation Centres ($1 million). That is a very critical project. During disasters, it is very important to have evacuation centres as Category 5. In my last speech, we requested, and preparatory work was already done for Maumi and other evacuation centres. Would the honourable Minister be able to tell us which particular evacuation centre are you targeting next? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- The evacuation centres that we will target this year are Maumi, Matacula and one in Ra - the ones that had been approved during your time. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Those are two different areas - Rokovuaka and Luvunavuaka.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I am sorry, Rokovuaka.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> Is that money sufficient, honourable Minister, because this is a very important project? We have seen a number of times during disasters, it is very difficult to get people together. We always have adverse weather conditions here in Fiji. Is that money sufficient for the three projects you have just mentioned? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Honourable Nath, you will notice that this $1 million is a new allocation. In the 2024-2025 Budget, we have put in request for the completion of 13 new evacuation centres. You will appreciate that not everything will be done in one year, so it is a new allocation. What you are saying is, in the past I mean a lot of the evacuation centres are existing buildings, schools, et cetera, owned by communities so there is really a plan to build new ones.</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1223 HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Just to add that, Mr. Chairman, IOM is giving us $6 million for this financial year. It is not reflected in this Budget, $1 million is from Government and $6 million is from IOM. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, why I am very concerned because you are the only Ministry that completed the 100 percent of your projects. The honourable Minister for Finance has just mentioned a number of projects. Can he confirm to Parliament that all the projects will be completed? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think that is a silly question, Mr. Chairman. I am telling the honourable Member, we have started a programme, it is a new allocation for 13 projects in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions, we think that this is an important start. As I have said, there are lots of evacuation centres, schools, halls that are already there. The Government’s effort to support some of those through the Ministry of Education through other Ministries is also happening. I cannot give you a specific answer to say this will be completed in the next two to three months. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I thank the honourable Minister for clarifying the IOM allocation because that was KOICA funded that was supposed to fund those four projects - Maumi, Rokovuaka, Narikoso and Matacula. So, this allocation probably will cater for the other 13. My question is on the Kadavu allocation on SEG 8 - Government Station $500,000. Can the honourable Minister, just clarify this?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is in relation to the quarters:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Government station:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. R. DITOKA.:</span> This is for the 2023-2024 update, to-date $999,000 has been released of which $435,828 has been utilised to meet the upgrade and renovation of 17 existing government quarters of which seven quarters are 100 percent completed while 10 are still in their last phase. The remaining funds is committed to be used by the end of this financial year, delay in project implementation is due to the long rainy weather the country experienced during the cyclone period. Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1.5 million is allocated to continue with maintenance of quarters in 2024- 2025 and this is to be phased out over the years. MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is for 2024-2025 honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> You went back again to 2023, 2024?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I started the update from there then I came up:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir my question is on SEG 8 and it is to do with the Saliadrau Suspension Bridge for which $300,000 was given last year and again same amount is given this year. So, if the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management can explain to us whether that money was used last year, or the work was not completed and it has been carried forward this year?</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>1224 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. S. R. DITOKA.- To-date, $70,000 has been released to undertake the Construction of Access Roads as the Government component of the project. The construction cost of the bridge was funded by the Japanese Government, totalling $250,000, for which the aid money was received by the Ministry in March 2023. Initially, the Ministry of Public Works was assigned to undertake the Construction of the Suspension Bridge in the financial year 2023-2024 with the support of $250,000 from the Japanese Government Grassroots Aid Programme. Later in the year, costing by Public Works Department increased to close to $700,000 due to escalating price of stainless-steel components. The Ministry for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management decided to take another alternative approach which resulted in the re-advertisement of tender in June 2024 which closes on the third week of July 2024 and with this funding of $300,000 plus the contribution from Japan of $250,000, the Ministry will be able to proceed with the construction works in the new financial year. The Ministry was able to construct the Access Road to the new Suspension Bridge site from the $70,000 allocated in the 2023-2024 financial year. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 3-1(10) on the allocation on Rural High Risk Water Sanitation Project. I see a significant increase and we thank the Government for that because the initial allocation was around $500,000 and then it went up to $750,000, now it has gone up to $1 million. If the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management can just clarify specific geographical regions because of the various needs in those areas and what sort of projects are they targeting as well, Ecological Purification System or Construction of New Water Projects altogether? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, what I can provide is just the project brief is every Fijian has Access to Clean and Safe Water in adequate quantities. In addition, this is also to ensure that every Fijian has that right. Just an update to date $723,555 or 90.4 percent of the total funding has been utilised to undertake the construction of 469 Sanitation Projects. The Ministry for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management will continue with the Construction Installation of Ecological Purification System and Sanitation facilities and the increase is just due to the increase in requests from around Fiji that we have received. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, it is a supplementary question related to the same. My question is, just a while ago, the honourable Minister for iTaukei mentioned that under Village Transformation, they are taking sanitation projects. Now, we hear that the Minister for Rural Development is also doing some sanitation projects. Why is it not placed in one place for sanitation- related matters, if the honourable Minister for Finance can clarify that? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think it is a very good question. What we are moving away from is centralising everything which used to be kind of a modus operandi in some sense. So, the Ministry of Rural Development undertakes rural housing projects as well. The village setup is different to settlements, so I think the Ministry of Rural Development is also well placed to do some of these as well in terms of the other projects, particularly the rural housing projects, and we do not want to just burden one Ministry to do everything in every setting and every circumstances and the requirements are also very different. It just helps to allocate this in different Ministries. Sanitation is like a mainstream issue, so every Ministry in the whole of Government is concerned about proper sanitation. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Just to add to that, Mr. Chairman, because of the nature of the Ministry, we look after all rural communities, not only just the iTaukei communities.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1225 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I also wish to clarify on that allocation because health is a big player in this particularly because of typhoid areas. That is why I asked about the geographic region because health has what they call the “red zones”, and that should always be the priority because we had the outbreak in Ra and other places. On SEG-10, Seafearing Entrepreneur Assistance Subsidy, I know that this is beneficial to the maritime islands particularly. If the honourable Minister can just give an outline of how this was taken up by the four geographic Divisions last year? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- It was rolled out to the areas mostly around the coastlines of Fiji in Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and the maritime islands. The initiative now is known as the Seafarers Entrepreneur Assistance or SEA Subsidy, which furthers our longstanding commitment to the self- studying culture in our maritime communities. Around 90.4 percent of the total funding has been utilised. We see that most of this was utilised in the Northern and Western Divisions, the Eastern Division as well, so the Central Division is slow on the uptake in the last financial year. We will look at updating that and see how we can increase our commitment to the Central Division in this financial year. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-2? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, I was basically looking at the Rural and Outer Island Programme on SEG10 at a sum of $3 million. Firstly, I would like to ask the honourable Minister, there does not seem to be any project that is under this heading. Basically, it is a wider heading on Rural and Outer Island Programme (ROI) but it does not indicate what programme it is. If he clarifies that, then I would be able to raise my motion. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, out of the $2.5 million provided under ROI in the financial year 2023-2024, the Ministry was able to expend $1.72 million or 78 percent of the total funding allocated. More than 103 kilometres of rural farm roads were constructed - 75.5 kilometres of rural farm roads were constructed in the Northen Division, connecting the interior of Macuata and Cakaudrove Provinces. The road construction cut across three different major routes, including Nakedra/Sese Road, Nasasa to Valevoni Road and connecting access to Nabuasoqosoqo. More than 77,000 families were directly assisted under this new rural farm road in the North. In the Western Division a total of 16.9 kilometres of new farm roads were constructed, covering the highlands of Ba, spreading across Nadala, Vatalevu, Nadrau, Natawa, Navunitawa and Nausocoko. In the Central Division, a total of 5.9 kilometres of farm roads were constructed in the Province of Namosi, including the villages of Mau, Nakavika and Vunidavo. The Ministry was also able to upgrade five kilometres of farm roads in Navuloa, Nasaumatua and Vunivunisa in Levuka. Assistance were also geared towards the fisheries and forestry sector with a total of 48 projects which includes seven in the Central Division, 17 in the Eastern Division, 12 in the Northern Division and 12 in the Western Division, and are earmarked to be completed in this financial year. The Ministry has also obtained tender approval in March 2024 for three years which will support land preparation for agriculture, complementing the existing interventions. Sir, the 2024-2025 budget of $3 million is allocated to continue with the implementation of this Programme. It will be phased out over the years. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>1226 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, since the ROI Programme is being mentioned here, I was wondering if I could put a motion to increase the allocation. I am just thinking of the maritime islands such as Matuku and Moala. Those two islands have constructed their roads but basically it is overgrown, and it is not being used for the last four years or so. Also, the South end of Kadavu from Nabukelevu where there is a farm access roads are nearly required to be built. I thought if there is no sufficient fund to cover those maritime islands, I would ask for a raise. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, when we were discussing this with the Ministry and the Permanent Secretary, we were mindful of all other allocations within the Ministry and the capacity to actually execute and do all these. We think that we are actually increasing the budget from $2.5 million to $3 million, and given all the other activities within the Ministry, we think that the increase for this year is a right allocation. Perhaps, more could be considered, and I am sure there are other programmes for the maritime islands that the Ministry is also looking at, so I think it will be like farm roads, et cetera. That is all ongoing and the Ministry of Agriculture has a number of programmes. FRA has a number of programmes, so I think there is enough money allocated so I would say to the honourable Member, we can look at some of things next year. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Sir, is there is allocation and I just feel guilty because every time I go out to these two islands of Moala and Matuku, I forgot the other islands. They request for the upgrade of this road because it has already been built and is overgrown because the roads are not being used. So, if the allocation is there, then I will withdraw my motion to increase the allocation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr:</span> Chairman, $3 million is sufficient for us to cover all these works.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- You withdraw your motion honourable Member:</span> We have a motion on Programme 5-1 by honourable Koroilevasu. Before I offer the floor to the honourable Koroilavesau to elaborate on his motion, I will offer the floor first to you, honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, you have gone past Programme 4-1, so we will just flow with that. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, this is another area of neglect, especially in the maritime isolated communities, not only in Lau, Lomaiviti and Kadavu, but also in the Western and the Northern maritime islands, Cikobia and the islands close to Vanua Levu. During my visit to these islands, I have seen the struggles that they have gone through, especially, the damages that they had gone through the cyclones. They basically just put roofing irons together and are living under those conditions. If there is an allocation for the rural housing, if that does not include that, then I will propose to put a motion to increase the allocation to look after those isolated communities in the islands around Fiji? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Minister, there is an allocation of $3 million here, with the same as the other one we have just addressed. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, the $3 million budgetary allocation, we believe, is sufficient to cover all the requests that will be coming this year. It depends also on the capability and the capacity that we have within the Ministry to handle this work. That is why we have limited it at $3 million, and it is done according to the applications that we receive from the members of the public, because this is done on the one-third and two-third model.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1227 HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Chairman, if it is my thinking that these communities will be assisted through whatever is being allocated here, then I do not need to move a motion again.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I can discuss that with you later and see how many of those are there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister, because the design probably has changed from the previous one, so with the new design what is the one-third? People will be listening now, for those who will be interested to be included in this programme? What is the one-third contribution now? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Chairman, the design you are talking about honourable Leader of the Opposition is the 24 by 16 design that I believe has started in the past and that is what we are continuing with at the moment. It has its own ablution facilities just beside it, and we are continuing to work on seeing the needs of the people, as people start travelling overseas and come back, their needs start to change. So, we are trying to take that into consideration as well to see how we can do some other designs and may be they can afford it. We are also working and exploring with FNPF, if we can get the one-third contribution from them. The Scheme 3 using the wood timber, they have pine or mahogany as their contribution and that is also part of this model that we are using. You are asking how much is the one-third contribution? I think at the moment it is about $12,000 and above, looking at the kind of designs that we are working on. Also working on termite free kind of designs require retarded and CAT 5 certified design as well. Question put. Head 18 agreed to. Head 19 – Republic of Fiji Military Forces MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-3? HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 1-3(5). Just a clarification from the honourable Minister on the Rapid Response Infantry Combat Group. I think this is a new group within the 3FIR. Just seek some clarification on this. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- This is a 3 FIR company within the 3 rd battalion, specifically readiness for HADR Deployment in particular, and special capability in other areas, counter- terrorism and other special requirements that Fiji Police do not have that the Military needs to build capability for, so counter-terrorism is one of those.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> Sir, that $300,000, I think it is for their ..</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is actually for the sustainment of the company:</span> It is part of the battalion but to keep that company going and their training for their rapid response course would require that kind of funds to keep them going, especially the training. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I recall that in one of my private visits to Sinai, the honourable Leader of Opposition was in charge of this Rapid Response Unit.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>1228 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, if I may also add, you are right to suggest that also to procure special equipment for them for the role that they are needed for. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-5? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- If the honourable Minister can give a clarification. It does not really have a number on Programme 1-5 but it just says, Aid-in-Kind - Procurement of Patrol Boats (Japan) - $6 million. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Japan is donating patrol boats. It is not anything close to the old TTBs or the current Guardian-class, these are exactly the same type of boats that the Fiji Police Force have - the small coastal boats, and also the rubber dinghies. That is what Japan is providing for us next year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, I am satisfied.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you:</span> The much smaller ones I suppose, not from the ones that you are used to captaining. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- These are for coastal waters only. These are the small boats that the police have.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> The police have it, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> It is a grant from Japan, Sir, it is free.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> I think they have just come out of that situation, they are now building aircraft carriers, et cetera. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I apologise, I think the use of the words “patrol boat” will give the technical experts a little bit of, they will be querying but they are not patrol boats that we would normally have here. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG 8 it is very interesting for me that we have HADR Storage with the Territorial Force $100,000. Can you please elaborate what that is about because I do not see it in last year’s Budget too? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, HADR is one of the functions in peace time of the RFMF in assisting the State. The TF is one big aspect of that, the units have their own special areas where they store their HADR equipment and with the Territorial Force in Nasinu, they need to have a HADR facility also constructed for their benefit for that are currently manning the TF unit and also for the Territorial Forces that will be deployed if there is a need to do that. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, Sir, it is on Programme 2-2(5). I see that there is $50,000 for Official Passports for 2 FIR for Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) but I looked at the next one which is 1 FIR, those that are serving in Golan and Iraq. there is no facility there for Official Passport even though they need it also. My question is whether that $50,000 for the Official Passports that is under the 2 FIR MFO covers also the other two mission areas where they will need passports also? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question and it is exactly correct. That is the passport that is kept by RFMF or other missions it is</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1229 included in this case under 2 FIR MFO.

KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Sir, I would just like to ask the honourable Minister on SEG 5 under the heading of “Purchase - Personal Equipment”. It is just that there is Stores and Service for $200,000 and there is another heading of Purchase - Personal Equipment at $1 million. I just want a clarification of what is that Personal Equipment is? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- This is the procurement of Personal Equipment for support services staff deployed to Golan and Iraq. This includes cover rolls, long johns, winter gloves, winter socks, summer socks, boot calf black, boot scarf, tactical gloves, elbow pads, knee pads, ballistic glasses, survival kits, first aid kits, camel pack, runaway pack, fleece jackets, desert scarf, towel, towel green and uniform green. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now move on. Parliament will now vote on Head 19 – Republic of Fiji Military Forces. Question put. Head 19 approved to. Head 20 - Fiji Police Force HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is actually related to SEG1 on Personal Emoluments. I understand the Minister was having some discussions prior to Budget to get the police salary increased. Did it eventuate? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I thank the honourable Member for the question, not in this particular budget this year. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- For the RFMF and Fiji Police, the Job Evaluation Exercises had already been done and salary progression was given. The Fiji Corrections Service did not have that, so we provided these additional $12 million and in this budget, their salary progression is provided, just like those 5,000 civil servants that had already had a step up.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Sorry Sir, but we have passed that.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Maybe I went too fast and I did not see you waving your hand. HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> My question is on Programme 1-2(7) - Transnational Crime Unit. I see very little money set aside for Transnational Crime Unit which is just around $4,000, so if the honourable Minister can explain. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, the Transnational Crime Unit is only one set segment of the Transnational Crime Unit that is available in the other border agencies that I know. Sir, FRCS has got one, but these fundings that we have is primarily for the Police and the Unit. It is actually quite a small unit and they work very closely with FRCS and also other border agencies including Customs and Airports Fiji Limited.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>1230 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. V. NATH.- Programme 1-6 (5) - Search and Rescue Services which is only $5,000. Can the honourable Minister elaborate on it because I feel it is less compared to the money given to the Pacific Institute, this should increase because I have seen Police Officers during rescues where they work overtime and get wet. MR. CHAIRMAN.- He seeks clarification on the figure, honourable Minister. It is too low according to him.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is already increased:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> Honourable Minister was talking about Programme 1-6(5).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is actually an increase:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> It is only $5,000.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> I think it is sufficient for this financial year, $5,000 for Search and Rescue Services. Not only the Police that is responsible for it but the Navy takes the lead role in search and rescue operations. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, through you, last time I was fishing in Vatu-i-Ra passage and I have seen people have lost. Unfortunately, I think they were crossing to one of the islands and the engine went off. There were about eight people in one boat, a 21 footer Fibre and lucky we were there fishing around Vatu-i-Ra Island and we managed to hold them. They did call the relevant officers in Western side but unfortunately nothing was done. So, what I thought if funds are available or made available, to increase there would definitely be more assistance to the Police officers. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I think we have increased the allocation this time and it should be okay for now as far as we are concerned. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think what he means this is just for coordination but there is another $250,000 in the Ministry of Home Affair’s budget. So search and rescue does not just mean that it is only for people there but there are various other allocations within the Ministry to support that. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you, but for that particular incident, honourable Nath, any Minister could have been the first respondent to that case. HON. V. NATH.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman very well said. But, unfortunately, the network in that areas is zero. It is a black spot, they could not connect. When they drifted a little bit further, they could not connect to anyone. They drifted off the Vatu-i-Ra passage alongside Yadua closer to Natovi. They could not connect to anyone. We had to go for miles to assist them. If the honourable Minister said it is okay then no problem. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, observation and a question to the honourable Minister. I was looking at the other programmes previously, I know we cannot go back but just an observation. I have seen in the previous programmes and activities you have Dog Handlers Allowance and in the Northern Division there is no Dog Handlers Allowance. We do not have a Dog Unit in Northern Division? There are plenty dogs there I am sure the Police trained dogs. Vanua Levu is a very important section of Fiji. MR. CHAIRMAN.- What dogs are you referring to?</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1231 HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member is right, we do not have one in the North but plans are there to also reintroduce the dogs in Taveuni that is where we had them, not in Labasa but in Taveuni. Not the tracker dogs but the sniffer dogs. HON. K. K. LAL.- So these are the drug sniffing dogs? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, that is part of their job, including sniffing money as well, but they sniff people. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I thought you had another question too? Observation and question, that was what you mentioned. HON. K. K. LAL.- The question was to introduce the Dog Unit in the Northern Division or no?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> The short answer is, yes, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I do not have a SEG to mention, but the discussion is so interesting that I wanted to ask the honourable Minister, last year you introduced a new programme called Beat Patrol. Is that programme still continuing? Over the year, did you find that programme effective? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Beat Patrol is the normal work of the police. We allocated a special amount last year of $700,000 to help the police. The responses I am getting right now is that there is a much greater and a bigger presence of the police out there. That does not mean that the issues have stopped, the issues are still there, but there is a greater presence out there. Much of that is to do with the new recruits, I think the 400 police men and women that we have just churned out. We have reallocated resources as well from staff and allow more police beat on the street. I think it is effective, we have just signed an agreement with the Government of China for the supply of around 100 Caravans. This is for police presence everywhere; for permanent and short term deployment so to speak. Temporary presence of the police in the six locations with communications, et cetera. I think that is going to help the police beat in a big way. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-9(4), Minor Improvements - Building ($1 million). Just a question on this, is this targeting the police quarters or office buildings because one of the things that they have always been crying for, for quite a long time, just like Government quarters is the state of the police quarters as well? I just wanted clarification of this. What are the plans too in terms of looking at their request for the state of their quarters? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, this $1 million is not for the quarters, this is really for work places. I know that when there are minor plumbing works or minor repair works that are required in the quarters, as they do everywhere, they would go and respond to it. But, for this particular one, once we facilitate urgent minor repairs that is required at the Police Stations or Community Posts, office partition and works to be undertaken by police building and maintenance unit. So, the funding for accommodation or police barracks has to come through a different allocation. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-9(5) – Standard Forms and Registers ($470,000). I understand there may be some registers that we require but one part of the Government or the Ministry is moving towards digitalisation, will your Ministry also move towards that direction?</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>1232 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, the short answer is, yes. That is one of the big areas under the police reset. One of the advantages is that through our partnership, particularly with the AFP and the embedding of their officers to help ours, comes along with it a line of resources that would take forever for us to acquire for our police. We are talking about things like camera jackets for police and other special equipment that we are unable to cater for, but we would like to have them quickly. Yes, we are going down that path, honourable Member. HON. K. K. LAL.- Sir, there have been a lot of complaints where certain Police Stations that have police patrol cars, at certain times they broke down and they were given one replacement vehicle. For example, the interior division where Muaniweni is, will your Ministry be looking into the matter of trying to get additional vehicles for other Police Stations like in the interior and not big vehicles from other stations and relocate them to where it is needed? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for those concerns. I think, previously in our discussions, we talked about particularly Police Posts that do not have vehicles. This is something that we are trying to address. Well, I have addressed that with the Commissioner of Police because it would appear that the allocation of vehicle is one of the areas that the Fiji Police Force can improve on. One of the things, particularly, for Police mobility, in this same study, we want to ensure that our vehicles that are allocated to Police are given to the right place and the right number of vehicles and the kind of vehicles. I am not sure how much study has been done in the past but this is definitely one area in terms of the reset that we want to do. Yes, definitely, we will make sure that the allocation of vehicles are effective for services to the people. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, again, this is to do with SEG 4 about the issue raised earlier about the minor improvements and there being a million dollar available for building. My question relates to the Central Police Station (CPS) at Totogo. From what I understand, subject to correction from you, is that there is a particular portion of that building that is a heritage building. The rehabilitation or reconstruction of that, is it included in that million dollars? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- This fund is allocated for the maintenance and improvement sector of the Fiji Police to look at repairs in Police Stations and Police Posts, as I had alluded to earlier. It would include CPS as well but CPS, as you know, is something that Government would have to consider into the future. I think there is always been some debate about the useful use of that area. There are plans at the moment but the location of CPS is actually now best use of that particular piece of real estate. So, in terms of the maintenance you have asked if they require repairs, for CPS, that is why this fund is there. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Supplementary question, Sir. I do understand there is a building in there that has heritage status.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Right:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- It was relative to that:</span> So, Totogo has a building in there that has heritage status. Is there any funding available in this budget to ensure that that heritage status can get repaired? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Not specifically as a matter of heritage but because it is a building that is there in the Police Station, if it erodes, then this sum can also be used by the maintenance section to go and repair it. I know, like the Police Officers Mess, is one of those that is actually on one of the heritage sites. If it needs maintenance, it is small, then it can be taken care of with this sum of money.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1233 Question put. Head 20 agreed to. Head 21 – Ministry Of Education MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for comments. Programmes 1-1. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is on SEG3 – Travel. Can the honourable Minister for Education explain the sudden increase in Travel Budget from $250,000 given last year, to $450,000 this year? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increase includes local and overseas travels for the Minister and the Assistant Minister, as well as the Permanent Secretary and other staff local travel. It also includes those that attend workshops and meetings abroad. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on SEG7 - Workshop/Consultation/Conference, can we use universities and also schools that are already available for that instead of using $90,000?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Honourable Minister, if I can help on that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.:</span> Can you just clarify the question again? HON. K. K. LAL.- So, it is on Programme 1-1-(7) - Workshop/Consultation/Conference costing $90,000. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this allocation is a decrease from last year and it is a workshop that is done, together with the other agencies, like the United Nations and this is the contribution from the Ministry of Education. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, it includes other things like workshops, seminars, training for integrated FEMIS, data analysis interpretation, OMRS, HR procedures and Procurement. So, a lot of internal training also happens with the Ministry of Finance as well. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I have two questions. First on SEG6 and SEG7. I will start with SEG6 - Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Grant increased from $2.6 million to $4.2 million. If the honourable Minister for Education can explain how this additional grant will be utilised? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increase is intended for the Commission to carryout intensive survey to identify and register all non-registered higher education institutions operating in Fiji and the survey includes a nation-wide campaign and other related works. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, a supplementary question on that, I am a bit confused because my question is on TSLS - SEG6 - Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service ($4.2 million). HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, the increased budget is to cater for the salary increase, increase in building rent. They are moving to a new location, HR Development Plan, Website upgrade and Mobile Apps.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>1234 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you. My last question is on SEG7 - Implementation of National Action Plan - Gender Based Violence Against Women and Girls where $50,000 is allocated. My question to you is, how were these grants used last year and how will it be used this year? What outcomes are you trying to achieve from this funding? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, the utilisation rate for last year was around 90 percent, basically, on awareness and education campaign that is provided to teachers and stakeholders of the school. So, this is what we will continue to do in terms of women in leadership and other similar training programmes. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programmes 1-2? HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman on SEG5, I have noticed an increase of $244,000 for library services. How will this money be utilised?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Library Software:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> Library Services on Activity 2(5)? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You mean National Library Week? HON. H. CHAND.- No, Library Services. I have seen an increase of around $244,000. It is Special School Library Scheme ($50,000)? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- This allocation will be used to purchase resources such as books, tables, chairs, shelves, rugs for the school library setup and we will work within this approved budget. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, there is a motion here by honourable Ketan Lal. It is to do with Programme 2-1(6). Would you mind elaborating on your motion? HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Chairman I move: That Head 21-2-1(6) - Free Education - Government Primary Schools: Year 1 - 8 ($260,000) be increased.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- I second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.:</span> The current funding jeopardises our commitment in providing quality education for all children, particularly those from lower income families. Adequate funding is essential for ensuring that primary schools have necessary resources, so these are teaching materials, infrastructure and support services to deliver a high standard of education. Mr. Chairman, by increasing this budget, we can enhance the learning environment, produce various education and promote equal opportunities for all children. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, while the Honourable Minister for Education is looking at that, I am not sure what he means by that motion. I mean, the overall budget has been determined based on proper statistics - how many students are there, how many classrooms are there, so the general statement about improving quality, et cetera, that is whole of Government approach for honourable Minister for Education’s effort. So, I think the allocation is adequate, as the Minister will tell himself.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1235</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- The allocation is adequate Mr. Chairman:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> The allocation is adequate, honourable Ketan Lal. So, are you withdrawing your motion?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> No, Mr. Chairman.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Thank you:</span> So, we will put that to the vote. Question on amendment put. Motion lost. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-3? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is on Programme 2-3(7) - Verification for Students’ with Disability, a new budget item. My question to the honourable Minister is, how do you intend to use this data? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Sir, these are most of the mainstream schools that we have currently that have students with the special needs. Sometimes, they are not being probably identified and this is a programme that is used to identify through the assistance of the respective schools, Heads of School and allow them to be classified not only in the mainstream school but become a special inclusive school as well. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-1. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is, on Programme 3-1(1) – Personal Emoluments. I see that this has been reduced from last year’s budget to $50,358. So, if the honourable Minister can explain this reduction. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, in Programme 3-1(1), there is an overall increase to address the increase in teachers that are eligible for the increase. The separation in terms of the respective call centres, they may have some showing a decrease but overall, there is an increase in SEG 1 allocation. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Perhaps, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance can explain. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The honourable Minister is right but I can just give you the details. This budget was increased to $1.8 million in the current financial year to cater for the recruitment of 84 teaching positions. So, these teachers will now be paid from Programme 3-2 and Programme 3-3 so that is why it shows the reduction on the budget this year. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We have a motion here from honourable Premila Kumar. Would you introduce your motion, Madam? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my motion is to decrease SEG 5 which is rations by $1.4 million.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Chairman.</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>1236 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 MR. CHAIRMAN.- Would you elaborate on your motion, Madam? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, each year, the Government allocates around $2.8 million in ration support to Government schools. However, no such support is extended to non- Government schools that offer boarding services. For instance, boarders at Natabua High School pay $70 per term, ACS pays $50 per term, which includes food. However, boarders at schools like Ballantine Memorial School, just an example, and there are many others, are charged $300 per term plus $100 PTA levy. Now there are children from extremely poor families travelling as far as Rakiraki to enrol in these schools. These are non-Government schools. Typically, we have found children attending Government schools funded by taxpayers’ money, they come from families of ex-students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, civil servants, army officials, and people who are in the executive positions, even politicians. These are the leads of our society and these families can pay for their children’s boarding fee. That is my argument. A means test is the best way to address this disparity. As highlighted by the honourable Minister for Women and Children, as she said welfare must start with the families, there is no better place to begin that by making well-to do parents pay for the food rations or pay a slightly higher boarding fee. Additionally, students studying in non-Government schools who come from poor families, actually they do deserve a level playing field. Why cannot the taxpayer’s money allocated to these schools be redirected to schools like Ballantine Memorial School just to help the poor families who are trying to send their children to get the education? So that is my proposal, Mr. Chairman. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I find the logic a bit hard to understand from honourable Kumar. Every school has all kinds of students. It is not quite true for her to say, Government schools have invariably, there might be. I went to a Government school and 90 percent or at least 70 percent to 80 percent of us at that time came from rural backgrounds, farming backgrounds and poor households, subsidised by the Government. So, I think that is a bit of a generalisation. Even in non-Government schools, you have a mixed group. I was surprised that you want a reduction. I think what you should have suggested, in fact the per capita grant to all the other schools are there, it would be better. I think this is something that we can look at in the future, but to suggest a reduction in this, might be a bit illogical, because I suspect that a lot of students in these Government schools also come from very poor families. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I do not agree with the motion that has been put to reduce the boarding school and food supplies. I think the amount that has been provided is sufficient, maybe not enough in terms of the number of students that are attending the schools. We also trying to encourage the schools through the provision of tractor that was made to assist in the provision of their food supplies. We are also looking after non-Government Schools as a boarding school per-capita too has also been given for Non-Government Boarding Schools. I think that is the responsibility of a government being the manager of Government schools that we need to look after the students that are in schools in a manner that they can be able to provide good results in terms of their education. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I just want to say to the honourable Minister first that here we are not talking about per-capita grant. Every school gets per-capita grant. I am specifically talking about boarding schools and not every school is a boarding school. So, what I have seen that when it comes</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1237 to the Government boarding schools, the ration is provided. It is a itemised where is when it comes to the Non-Government boarding schools, it is not there. What I am trying to say is this that if we really want to create a level playing field, we should do a means test; that is all. Any school whether Government or Non-Government, if the parents can afford, we should increase the boarding fee for them. And any child, no matter which school or boarding school they go to, if the parents are not earning enough they cannot support that assistance, that is where we should assist them. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Given that the explanation has been provided by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and as well as the honourable Minister for Education, we will now put this to the vote. The motion is to decrease the rations by $1.4 million that is for Programmes 3- 2(5). Question on amendment put. Motion lost. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- I just wanted to make a comment, if I can, Sir? I would suggest that the defeated motion, I ask Government to look at all boarding schools and see if they could be assisted in the same way that the Government Schools are assisted in provision of funding for rations. Why I am saying that, Sir, I was educated at Lelean Memorial School and the same this happens. We eat what we call tavioka kadrala, tinned fish with curry cassava. So, basically because we have to pay our school fees to be able to survive. The school fees that we pay, we go and buy cartons of tinned fish and we ration it. We eat dhal and rice. All I am suggesting is Government could consider assisting rations for Non-Government Boarding Schools. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, my question is on Programme 4-1-(5), if the honourable Minister for Education can explain there is no allocation for Development and Rollout of Moral and Civic Education? If he can give us some information in relation to how this money was used last year and whether this activity has been completed? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- What SEG is that, Madam? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- SEG 5 on Civic and Moral Education HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- It is not in the Budget book. I can get back to you to get the update on something that is not in the Budget book for this year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It used to be there but it is taken out:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was a one-off programme and it has been completed:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> So, because that programme was rolled out when I was there, the whole idea was to continue with Civic and Moral Education not only up to Class 3 but it should continue till Class 8 and then Life Skills will come in at secondary level. The fact that I see there is no more funding, so I am sort of a bit concerned whether there is a continuity of that programme for the whole of the primary school or because we have reached Year 3 and that is it. We are not going to go forward, so maybe the honourable Minister for Education will clarify that to me later on. That is fine.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>1238 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 6-1(8) as far as Upgrade and Enhancement is concerned, I cannot see Vatuwaqa Primary School on the list because for this particular school, some rooms were damaged and destroyed and that was way back in December 2022. Can the honourable Minister explain, please? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, the Vatuwaqa Primary School as we know the history was burnt down in 2022 and later last year we had requested for the Fire Report which took time to be submitted to the Ministry of Education and it came after the Budget submission. This used to be a Government school but is now being operated by Trustees as honourable Hem Chand would be aware. The need for the school is well noted and this is something that would be considered in the Social Infrastructure Programme of the Vuvale Partnership that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance we were part of the launching last week. However, we are still awaiting the suggestions and the request from the Trustees of the school which we are trying very hard to find and locate where they are right now. So, that is why it has been missing because they need to initiate the request because it is under their guidance. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, if I can just add, I had spoken on this when I responded to the Budget Address and I know the honourable Prime Minister was not here. I appeal to him again if maybe we just go and find a way to build it quickly otherwise the very good buildings that are standing now will just keep on deteriorating. I appeal to you Sir, that we can go and do this. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, just an addition to that, the current students that used to school in that school are in the other schools nearby whilst the discussions are ongoing regarding the rebuilding of the school. Going forward, we would like to see whether that school is enough for just a primary school or if it can also accommodate primary, secondary and possibly TVET or whatever can be allowable in that limited space that is there.</p><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 8-1? Honourable Usamate has got three motions, all to do</h4><p>with Programme 8.</p><h4>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, I actually put in three motions that are all related, so I</h4><p>can just refer to them altogether, if that will be okay? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Is it of the same too? Programme 8?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Yes, Mr. Chairman - same Programme and same Activity.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> Okay, I will allow that. HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My motion is in relation to first of all reduce the grant to Pacific Polytech by $3 million because I believe that, that money is better utilised elsewhere. The other part of my motion is to take out the $5 million USP Outstanding Grant from the University of the South Pacific and both of these funds ($5 million plus $3 million) to be added on to the Fiji National University. I believe that this is the way that we can try to address the skill shortages that we have. The reason that we are trying to provide money for Pacific Polytech was because they provide TVET short term training programmes. Those short term training programmes have been done by FNU for</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1239 ages for a long time all over Fiji. The programmes at FNU lead to formal qualifications. A lot of the one-day programme, two-day programmes are done by smaller institutions. They do not accumulate into a formal qualification. When you carry out training, there are various levels of competency at which trainings undertaken. If you carry a one-day training, the only thing that you can get out of it is knowledge which is the recall, which is the lowest form of knowledge. If you want to have training programmes that lead to someone becoming employable, you need to do that in a more systematic manner and that is what we have at FNU. You have the NTPC, you have all their various programmes that provide their training programme. So that is the gist of my motion, Sir. To reduce the money from Pacific Polytech ($3 million), remove the outstanding grant for $5 million going to USP, that $8 million to give it to FNU so that they deliver the kind of service that this country needs.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Ketan Lal has withdrawn his motion as well:</span></p><h4>Honourable Minister, you have any comments to make on these three motions.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr:</span> Chairman, on the motion by honourable Usamate, I strongly oppose the motion to reduce the Pacific Polytech basically because that is all the funding for higher institutions are being monitored and managed by Higher Education Commission and in this particular instance, the number of students that have graduated from Pacific Polytech in the last year is over 1,200. I think that is quite a big number for an institution that has recently been started. But even the funding that has been given, it is not a handout to all these institutions. There are proper mechanisms in place by the Higher Education Commission to ensure there is the real purpose in terms of the achievement of this funding. The Higher Education Institute is part of the criteria for handing out this funding is for them to provide a destination survey to ensure that those graduates from Pacific Polytech inclusive, FNU, need to highlight whether graduates that come out from institutions are actually employed in the job market, Mr. Chairman. So, I do not agree with the motion by the honourable Member. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD- Sir, this is one of the most ridiculous motions that I have ever had to speak on this Parliament. I mean, this is coming from an honourable Member who was part of a government that terrorises Higher Education Institutions in this country. They completely restricted academic freedom, they interfered in the governance structure of tertiary institutions, including the University of the South Pacific. They did not pay the grant, they did so many damage to Fiji and the region as a result of that. There are issues at FNU during their time, their interference and today with this motion, they want the Government to interfere in the independent process for determining funding for Higher Education Institutions. We have a Higher Education Commission there which monitors, registers, which looks at the number of student qualifications. There is a qualification framework, so I do not know what is wrong with these people. I just cannot understand what is wrong with them in trying to attack institutions which are providing qualifications</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>1240 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 Mr. Chairman, I do not know where they get this rubbish from. The Higher Education Commission monitors the qualification. They have so many steps of qualification where people have. The honourable Minister for Education is right when he says that the Higher Education Commission determines this and if they have any big issues, they should look go and get the details from the Higher Education Commission on how these institutions are registered, how they are monitored, how they are reviewed and how the funding model works. Mr. Chairman, this is really a silly motion and we do not support it. Thank you. MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want to speak on the motion too, honourable Ketan Lal?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Sir, my motion was the same, maybe if I can contribute something.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> No, no, we handle these three first. These three here have been put into one. Honourable Members, HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for Education for his contribution and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. I think we need to be reminded that I am a Member of Parliament. I sit here, I represent people just because we have an institute and organisation that says this needs to be done. As a Member of the Parliament, I have the right to say what I want to say. I do not need the Deputy Prime Minister or anyone else to tell me I did not answer that. I am also a person that contributed to the development of the Higher Education Commission. It is the organisation that was under me that developed the first National Qualifications Framework. I was fundamental, I know it through and through. That is an area that I understand, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, you need to understand that. I have the right as the Member of Parliament to say what I want to say, and I know that business. I believe that what has been happened, the decision is wrong. I believe that decision is wrong and I do not need you to question my intelligence and my authority to say what I want to say in this Parliament. I do not like the fact that you belittle people who go against what you say. You have to learn to respect others in this Parliament. Mr. Chairman, I believe that my motion will help to alleviate the struggles that we have in this country, to develop competent people and that is why I stand by that motion.</p><h4>MR.
