<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2024-2025 APPROPRIATION BILL 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Alvick Maharaj. Oh, he still has not come back from his leave or sick leave, but we bear with him in the struggles that he is undergoing. I think that is his first child.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Baby girl, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Come again:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Baby girl last night:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Oh, baby girl last night. (Acclamation) He has a fantastic history. He got married a bit late, that is why. I am just joking, honourable Members. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and my fellow Fijians; ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and his dedicated staff for the delivery of the Budget for all Fijians. It is a ‘here and now’ budget with an eye for the immediate future. I acknowledge the increase in the budget for the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts from $38.7 million to $39.4 million. While the Government considers options for the 2013 Constitution, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) which Fiji now supports, is our framework for action. It is complemented by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and we are aligning our objectives to it. We want to thrive in this modern world. If the budget trend for our Ministry continues by the end of our current term, the iTaukei will be better off than they were when we came into office. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Assistant Minister has highlighted the increase in the budget for the culture sector. We are already seeing the reason why it was placed under our Ministry. We will develop Fiji's first National Art Gallery. We will restore the Levuka World Heritage Property. We will recognise the contribution of every ethnic group in Fiji through arts. Today, I will outline some other key programmes in our budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1161 been resourced to implement the GCC Review Report. This includes a standalone legislation. The GCC will continue to lead the iTaukei Administration. With its revamped focus, it will enhance and strengthen the development of the iTaukei economy. We must quantify our contribution to the economy, and we will approach this with lessons learnt from past mistakes. Mr. Speaker, earlier, I had touched on UNDRIP. We have developed a National Action Plan which Provincial Council Meetings have overwhelmingly endorsed. Several legislations could be reviewed to localise UNDRIP. This important work is recognised in our budget. Mr. Speaker, last year, the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) and Cabinet endorsed a framework to improve the livelihoods of iTaukei and Rotumans through economic empowerment. As part of the framework, support will be provided to Provincial Council companies and resource owners. I am pleased to announce that Provincial Council companies and resource owners will be assisted under the $3 million allocation - iTaukei Resource Owners Support and Development Fund. This is an interest subsidy allocation. Mr. Speaker, funding has been provided for Provincial Economic Units. The purpose of these Units is to drive economic activities and enhance market access. Market access is the issue for our community. To assist our iTaukei community, we will, again, convene the iTaukei Resource Owners Forum this year, which has been funded. Mr. Speaker, we must not underestimate the ability of the vanua to resolve the pressing problems upon us - the invasion of hard drugs. If we strengthen vanua governance, it could significantly address the problems that now confront us. To assist in this regard, the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission’s budget has been increased by $1 million. Mr. Speaker, a good education is the shortest way out of poverty and our latest village profiling data confirms this. Education is a pillar of poverty alleviation. This year, we convened the first ever Provincial Education Forum. Provincial Council Chairpersons and Chairpersons of Education Committees met to discuss the status of iTaukei education and map a way forward. An outcome of that forum was to further investigate the cause of primary and high school dropouts and how they can be better supported. We will do that through the 2024-2025 Budget with an allocation of $300,000. Mr. Speaker, the Village Improvement Scheme will continue with another allocation of $2 million. Our focus will be on sanitation and village beautification. We have also seen the need to transform two villages as a modern tourist villages. We will work on this in coordination with the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. Mr. Speaker, we will continue to implement the National Action Plan on reducing violence against women and girls. Breaking through the traditional setting is not easy but we want a fair deal for our women, and we will ensure that the message of reducing violence is conveyed appropriately. The allocation for this has been provided in the budget. Mr. Speaker, our budgetary allocations and initiatives are geared towards driving transformative change within our iTaukei communities through economic empowerment, preserving culture and heritage, promoting education and holistic wellbeing, empowering villages and developing visionary youth leadership. Increased funding for the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission, iTaukei Affairs Board, the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts and the establishment of the Provincial Economic</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1162 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 Development Unit will significantly support sustainable economic development and enhance the welfare and prosperity of iTaukei communities. The iTaukei Resource Owners Forum will facilitate access to natural resources, while the Resource Owners Support and Development Fund will provide a vital injection of interest subsidy. Coupled with measures enabling sustainable development of iTaukei land and resources, these initiatives unlock unprecedented economic opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, preserving our culture and heritage is a cornerstone of our agenda. Our experience with the Melanesian Arts and Culture Festival last year and the Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture this year has heightened the importance of this agenda. Efforts by the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission to safeguard ancestral land and waters, the revitalization of customs and leadership roles through the confirmation of traditional titles, and the promotion of language, traditions and identity via cultural programmes will ensure our rich legacy endures for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, initiatives aimed at promoting education and holistic wellbeing are equally vital. Bridging educational gaps will be addressed through village-level awareness campaigns on integrating formal and informal learning pathways. Furthermore, the exploration of sustainable indigenous tourism opportunities will showcase the unique iTaukei culture to the world while creating economic prospects. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the story of the iTaukei is more than a tale of challenges we have endured, and in our future, we must strive for more than just making do. Our budget reflects our highest aspirations - it continues our step in the right direction which is to develop the iTaukei economy and make the iTaukei primary beneficiaries in their natural resources. We will forge a new economy and a new generation of prosperity to make the iTaukei prosperous and equipped to take on the challenges of the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 2024-2025 Budget. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament and my fellow Fijians; thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to be able to contribute to this debate. I want to start off, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by thanking you also for your leadership and decision that has allowed me to be here today as an Independent Member of Parliament. I assure you, Sir, that I do not take this privilege of continuing to serve in Parliament lightly and will perform it to the very best of my ability and my convictions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, putting together a budget is a massive and a critical undertaking, so I congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for the second budget which he has been responsible for. I also congratulate the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his staff for their hard work, and their very useful presentation and interactions they had with us in Opposition Chambers last week. I also want you to know, honourable Minister and the staff, that I appreciate the additional parts of the Budget Supplement Booklet that we had this year. I also would like to congratulate the new Attorney-General, honourable Graham Leung on his appointment. I have appreciated the tenor of his maiden address, it has been a breath of fresh air, a fragrant aroma.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1163 I also congratulate my Nakasi neighbour, honourable Alitia Bainivalu, for her appointment as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, and wish her well in the enormous responsibility accorded to her. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many things to be thankful for in this Budget, and I would like to highlight a few of these. The people of Fiji are battling high inflation that has been bought about initially by the global forces, but which were then fanned into a frenzy, became a ferocious hurricane by the decision of this Government to raise VAT by 66 percent last year. The impact on our people has been catastrophic, Sir. For that reason, I am glad to see that the raising of the National Minimum Wage to $4.50, and then to $5 an hour, and I also understand that the Sectoral Minimum Wage will also be increased by the same quantum, and civil servants pay will also increase. All of these will help people to ride the waves with the high cost of living that this Government is largely responsible for. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the decision by Government to set aside up to $52 million for the FNPF Pensioners, whose pensions were reduced, has been applauded widely. This is welcomed, respite for the pensioners who receive their payments, and I am glad for them and their families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the payment is being made by Government out of taxpayers’ funds, and not out of FNPF funds. This validates that initial decision taken to amend the FNPF pension levels, to ensure the sustainability of FNPF. Without that reform, FNPF would be in a dire situation right now and would go head over heels by the year 2050, meaning that future pensioners would not benefit from it. The decision by the then Government took guts and gumption. This Government must be willing to do the same when it is required to do so. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- A tough decision! HON. J. USAMATE.- For Vatukoula, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government will provide payments to the Vatukoula Gold Miners who had been strike for 30 years. This payment is substantive and is also being paid from taxpayers’ funds. I am sure it will come in very handy for the gold miners and their families. There is a danger, however, Sir, that others will use this as a precedence for future unresolved industrial disputes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> It is your mess, that is why.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is yours:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am glad to see that all the measures that were innovatively implemented by then FijiFirst Government, continued to be implemented. These include all the social wages, despite with some minor tweaking by this Government. This includes the Free Education, the enhanced Social Welfare payments, free water, electricity for the needy, school bus fares, back to school assistance, et cetera. So, thank you for continuing to do what was started from the people from this side. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for reducing fiscal duty on prefabricated buildings to 5 percent and for reinstating zero duty on materials, and committing to establish the</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1164 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 Financial Services Ombudsman, a great move. I also appreciate the allocation for constructing gas crematoriums in major districts around Fiji. Budgetary Concerns: Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst in Opposition, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics was forever deriding the then Government about the nominal debt values. As soon as he got into office, he increased those debt levels to record levels. The honourable Leader of the Opposition has itemised in detail the Debt to GDP ratios that we have had in Fiji from 2006 to 2019, clearly showing that we kept it to below 50 percent in the immediate period before COVID-19 struck. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reduction in post-COVID-19 Debt to GDP ratio has been far too slow. Why? Because of Government’s poor choices. They could have helped to reduce it further by getting rid of highly bloated operating expenditure. One example, every person on that side, including two on this side, is either a Minister or Assistant Minister (including honourable Ravu), with vehicles, staff, offices, bloated travel expenses, bloated expenditure everywhere, hugely bloated operational expenditure, unheard of in this country. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Hogwash! MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. J. USAMATE.- If they had been able to control that, they could have helped push the expenditure down. The Budget deficit remains alarmingly high, posing significant risks to our economy stability. While the Government has made lofty promises, it has not presented a viable plan to reduce this deficit. Borrowing to finance current expenditures without a clear repayment strategy will only lead to further financial strain on future generations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics said he had to raise VAT in order to pay for the debts. In other words, that he had to raise the cost of living so that Government debts could be paid. Guess what, Sir, no debts have been paid off. The stock of debt continues to increase. Inflation has been at the record level. It hit 7.1 percent in April - a 10-year record. Now, they are talking about 5.7 percent, but there are others who are arguing about the high cost of living which is being felt hardest by the worse off in our society. That is who you are attacking – the worse off in our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs growth, and good effective investment in infrastructure helps to build that growth. Government is providing very little or no expenditure on new infrastructure in this Budget. Government is only and largely providing funding to preserve what is already in place. The new infrastructure is coming through our development partners and I thank them for their assistance in that area. They are funding new infrastructure that will contribute to GDP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, slow implementation of projects by some Ministries and Departments that are part of the Executive – meaning you are supposed to execute and do or deliver things, has led to underspent budgets. This inefficiency not only hampers economic growth, but also undermines public trust in Government. When allocated funds are not utilised effectively, essential services and infrastructure projects are delayed, directly impacting the quality of life of the citizens of this country.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1165 The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics replied to Written Question No. 74/2024 on the status of budget usage at the end of Parliament, which is posted on the Parliament website and reported that $42 million was vired out of capital expenditure. Why? Lack of execution. The Ministry of Local Government’s total execution was at 40 percent at the end of June, according to his report. For the Rice Development Project of $600,000, there was zero utilisation, according to his report. For the $2.5 million budgetted for jetty infrastructure, only 37 percent was used - very, very poor execution. Executives are supposed to execute, that is what you are there for. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics did his job by allocating funds, the question is, did the Ministers and their executive team led by the Permanent Secretaries effectively deliver these commitments? This is the result you get when merit-based appointments are replaced by political appointments, rewarding those who helped them in their campaign. It is the public that bears the brunt of the Government’s failure to implement the Budget and deliver the outcomes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism has been doing well this year. However, there is a significant drop in forward bookings till the end of the year, when compared to last year. This is a concern. Are we outpricing ourselves for our key Australian market – mum, dad and the children? Tourism arrivals from Australia – our main source of tourists, has been flat, and now tourism levels have been sustained by other source markets. It is possible that increasing the departure tax to $200, coupled with a relative high cost of Food and Beverage and accommodation, will reduce our tourism arrivals, especially from the more budget conscious markets. We need to protect and nurture tourism, and not stop the flow of the economic lifeblood it has provided us with in these past three years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of talk about diversification, but we are not seeing a targetted approach to achieving that. Investment Fiji reports that there are 39 projects at construction stage in Fiji worth $1.2 billion. Sir, 34 of those projects, worth $1.22 billion, are in tourism services and real estate. The remaining six projects are in wholesale, retail and manufacturing. There is very little investment in other sectors that we need to diversify to. Why? Because there is no focussed approach to develop diversification into other areas. Private sector improvement and value addition is critical and is generally lacking, Sir. The Government’s decision to write off student debts in the last Budget has cost over $600 million – directly equating the current budget deficit. Converting the Student Loan Scheme to Scholarship is not sustainable for a small economy like ours. Even larger economies, like Australia, continue to maintain a loan scheme for tertiary education. The reality is that many graduates are now sitting at home without jobs and many more will join them. In this Budget, the Government has imposed penalties for forfeiting bonds, if they wish to seek opportunities offshore. How does this help our graduates, or the economy? It creates a burden on the very individuals whom we should be supporting to drive our nation forward. We give them scholarships, they graduate in numbers, but there is no demand for jobs, as the private sector, which we refer to as the engine for economic growth, is not creating enough employment opportunities, resulting in high unemployment. So, in fact, these students get frustrated and look at opportunities abroad. It is ironic that we bond them, but we cannot assure jobs for them, Sir.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1166 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 Sir, in the labour market, we have a very tight labour market with shortage of skilled workers and professionals. At the same time, the Reserve Bank of Fiji has noted that there is decline in job advertisements. Honourable Minister, I am very happy to see that there is a lot of focus on apprenticeship and skill development, I am very glad for that. But what worries me is why this Government has decided to reduce its grant to the Fiji National University (FNU), our very own University. Government has been ready to dish out grants to the University of the South Pacific (USP), even though I understand that USP has more than $150 million cash sitting in its coffers. And on top of that, it decides to increase the grant to Pacific Polytech to $5 million. There is nothing that Pacific Polytech does that is not done by FNU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU has graduated more than 45,000 people from 2010 to 2023. It provides vocational education and skills training. It has been conducting training in rural remote areas since 2012, and in the year 2023 alone, the National Training and Productivity Centre issued more than 14,000 certificates for short courses. They graduated more than 2,500 people with degrees and 1,300 through Technical and Vocational Education and Training programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU is our own institution, a key player in Fiji’s development with a long- proven record. It has received growing records internationally for its own contribution to SDG, yet Government is giving FNU short shrift, and has leaned over backwards for Pacific Polytech right from day one, even before the 2023-2024 budget was put to them. What is going on? The FNU is delivering, so why are you diverting funds from USP into a private institution? Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are no initiatives to stop the exodus of skills and professionals. We are resigned to the fact that these gaps will be fulfilled by Bangladesh, Indonesia and Philippine nationals, but applications to get them here takes time. In the meantime, our private sectors suffers. Our brightest minds are leaving the country in search for better opportunities abroad. This braindrain is detrimental to our development. We need policies that retain talent, that provide adequate remuneration and create that conducive environment for professions to thrive in our own country. For this to happen, we need a vibrant private sector and a conducive investment environment, and that is what this Government needs to do. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, Fiji needs Government to do well. I need Government to do well. Everyone on this side needs Government to do well. We all need it. We want you to do well. You determine the way forward, and in my current capacity as an independent Member of Parliament, I am prepared to support the honourable Prime Minister and support the Government on issues that are being brought up by Government that I believe are in the best interests of this country. But I will fight against and oppose anything that I believe does not address our needs as against the best interests of this country. While this Budget has a lot of very good aspects, there are also many underlying weaknesses, and it is for that reason that I cannot fully support this Budget. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, I also acknowledge those who are sitting in the gallery and those watching through livestream from the comforts of their homes; I rise today in this august Parliament to lend my full support to the 2024-2025 National Budget.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1167 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, and his team for their outstanding work in stabilising Government debt and prudent financial, fiscal and economic management after inheriting a debt of 90 percent of GDP from the previous Government or the previous Administration. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can note here the distinction between someone who is a professor in economics preparing a national budget for a government, and someone who does not possess these attributes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is commendable that Fiji’s debt has now fallen to less than 80 percent, with a targetted projection to reach 78 percent of the GDP at the end of July 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year’s Budget Address is not merely a financial plan but a roadmap that aligns our aspirations with the global mandate of sustainable development and resilience. Through the foresight of the current Coalition Government under the steadfast, sound and consultative leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, together, we can embark on a journey to ensure that our rural and maritime communities thrive, and our disaster management efforts set benchmarks for local and regional excellence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the global level, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a universal call for action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all the people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. As signatory to this ambitious agenda, our commitment resonates across borders, emphasising our role in achieving sustainable development both, locally and as part of the regional and global community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regionally, our priorities are shaped by the unique challenges and</p><h4>opportunities presented by our geographical context.</h4><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the announced 2024-2025 Budget is also a roadmap that aligns our national investment priorities to the collective regional strategic pathways to: (1) Strengthen governance which will, in turn, improve economic viability for all Government initiatives, targeting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and promote peace and security. (2) Promote inclusion and equity by investing in the empowerment of women and the promotion of women’s rights and promoting the anticipation of women in leadership. (3) Enhance data-informed decision-making through education, research and technology to revitalise our MSMEs sector, strengthen tourism, empower Fiji citizens and guide Government policy work to better address poverty and the high cost of living. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through partnership and collaboration, the Coalition Government, in their wisdom, have empowered us with the resources to leverage regional strengths to address common challenges, such as climate change, natural disasters and economic disparities. By working together, we create synergies that amplify the impact of our efforts and contribute to regional stability and prosperity and, consequently, better secure our own national security and stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the foresight of the Coalition Government in producing a budget that also actualises our beloved nation’s commitment to the regional priorities outlined in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. This will, in turn, enhance the faith of our development</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1168 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 partners, in the capacity of our beloved nation, to deliver as the regional hub, to take lead on the achievement of the SDGs in the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the national level, the 2024-2025 Budget reflects the Government’s commitment to a transformative change in rural and maritime development and disaster management. I must acknowledge, Sir, that this Budget is more than a fiscal plan - it is a blueprint for building resilient communities, enhancing infrastructure and promoting economic opportunities in our rural and maritime areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my capacity as the Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and the Coalition Government, for prioritising some areas that I would like to highlight: (1) Allocation of $2 million to the Ministry for our Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF), to continue to help our rural communities’ infrastructure development to improve connectivity and accessibility, and ensure our contribution to SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure. (2) Assisting our communities in sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and small businesses, to stimulate local economies and create sustainable livelihoods through the $1 million budget for the Ministry’s Self-Help Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these priorities are integral to our vision of a prosperous and resilient nation where every citizen can thrive. The honourable Minister for Finance rightly stated that the 2024- 2025 Budget is centred around the vision of “security, stability and sustainability”, focusing on improving the fundamentals of our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased investment to improve our health infrastructure, increased funding to reshape our education sector, decisive investment incentives to encourage investors and improve efficiency, and increased public private partnerships, is noteworthy. The Ministry has been liaising with development partners, such as the Pacific Centre for Peacebuilding, who are actively enlightening our communities and institutions with upskilling in conflict resolution to improve governance. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through the Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific (Gove4Res) initiative and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), through their exemplary support in the Northern Division are, but a few of the partnerships that this Coalition Government has supported to-date with a centred vision on improving livelihoods and empowering our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, no man is an island and the announcement that the Government will continue to fund our District Advisory Councillors proves just that. The Government cannot work independently and needs the support and trust of the people of Fiji for holistic economic development. As alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, “We must hear all views, this is the way for true nation building and inclusive development, to build consensus on sustainable progress and unity.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the setting up of a Pilot Tourism MSME fund of $15,000 will empower our rural communities to innovate their natural resource environment for job creation and income generation to not only enable sustainable management of their natural resources, but that of their rural livelihoods as well. People in the rural areas very much appreciate the effort by the Government, especially the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Finance for their support to the sugar industry which the rural areas are very much dependent on.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1169 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Permanent Secretary and Management of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development for the work undertaken this financial year. A special acknowledgement to the four Divisional Commissioners for their active roles in spearheading development in the Divisions through the Integrated Rural Development Framework. This year, we received $3 million in our budget for our Rural and Outer Island (ROI) programme. Of that allocation, we managed to complete 22 projects. One of the projects, is the road that links the interior of Saqani from Nasasa to Nadogo, Valevoni, Nacula and Lakeba, which was undertaken through this budgetary provision. I only hope that we were in Government for the last 16 years, we would have opened up all the areas that are still to be developed. I hope that this budget will continue to be given to the Ministry and we will continue to build more roads for our people in our rural areas. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to render my full support to the National Budget and motion before Parliament. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen in the public gallery and to all those who are watching this proceedings on live platform; firstly, I would like to congratulate honourable Bainivalu in her appointment as Minister for Fisheries and Forests, and I thank our colleague, honourable Ravu, for his service as Minister. Of course, he will continue to serve the people of Fiji with his know-how and skillset, and unwavering commitment to the Coalition Government. Secondly, I congratulate the Attorney-General, honourable Graham Leung, in his appointment as the Chief Legal Adviser to Government and Cabinet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, every once in a while, a generation of people and, for our purpose, a group of leaders, would be called upon to a time of nation rebuilding, resetting and revisioning. They would be called upon to congregate around a fresh new vision for a better country. They would be required to rally around a new set of ideals that would have an impact on the lives of our nation’s citizens now and, most importantly, in the future. That future already has a mortgage on it in our children’s name. That time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is upon us now. In saying that, I salute the nine Independent Members who have shown support to the honourable Prime Minister. When I say anything about the Opposition in this contribution, it excludes the nine Members who are, for all intents and purpose of this speech, a part of Government. Mr. Speaker, it is time to rebuild the political, economic and social landscapes of our nation for those who will come after us. It is time to rehash, rethink together as leaders, collectively as representatives of voters, who thought it prudent to put us here in the first place. Let us validate their hope and aspirations, and hand them a Fiji that they can enjoy and continue to call home, and God willing, for many generations to come. The statement of the honorable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Finance cannot be clearer for the future. We need a budget that speaks truth to the citizens of our nation now and sets a stage for growth, bringing equity into the economy that we can all participate in into the future. Some critics on the other side (excluding the nine), claim that it lacks glamour, colour and high ending statements. Whilst they are entitled to such opinions, Mr. Speaker, this year’s Budget, in my view, seeks to do a few things. Firstly, it seeks to salvage the nation from a one and a half decade long of poor fiscal management and its impacts, bloated economic numbers, fragile investment environment, targeted persecutions and unsustainable programmes, that has created an extremely unhealthy economic environment, unconducive for future growth. Empowerment programmes for self-sufficiency,</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1170 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 monitoring of the Government expenditure to gauge efficacy of the public dollar, encouragement to entice new industries and innovation to bring employment were all drawn downwards in favor of the much easier but much costlier hand-to-mouth policies of the previous Government. Secondly, it realises that the GDP-to-debt ratio must come down and must continue to come down for the next decade for stability, provide more latitude for Government to spend on growth areas that will energise the economic environment for contextual investment, targeted assistance and making Fiji a country that can attract large investments of the world. Much of the noise from the loyalists have been in no programmes, no incentives, no new infrastructure, et cetera. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications said to me in passing yesterday, “they spent like a wounded bull in the last decade that resulted in very limited fiscal space to move post-election.” That is true. Mr. Speaker, Google is here, large BPOs are coming, large farming companies are now doing their due diligence before they put shovel to ground, new hotel ventures are in the horizon, and as announced by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications on Monday, 8 th July, 2024, $6.25 billion of investment is in the immediate forecast. This is what economic prudence and discipline in governance does in only 18 months. It brings investor confidence back to the country. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, the employment that will be generated by these investments. The Lyndhurst Kalabu Project, for example, will alone bring about 10,000 to 15,000 direct employment when all the project phases are completed. That is a Government that is giving confidence to investment. That is a Government that is giving confidence to young Fijians, a job launching pad to begin a career, get married, raise a family and prosper right here at home. It must not be forgotten, Mr. Speaker, that this Government is 18 months old, and we are doing the best we can within means. The previous government and its founding platform ruled Fiji for 16 years. We are just at the surface level of repairing our economy and reigniting Fiji that was built by our founding fathers pre- and post-independence democracy. Whilst much has been accomplished, Mr. Speaker, much more needs to be done. We are not flushed with funds as a nation so we all must work within our means. Working within means was something that the Bainimarama Government did not have in its dictionary for the last 16 years. They overspent easily between $1 billion to $2 billion during their tenure in office, and that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is irresponsible governance. The Opposition have talked about natural disasters and global pandemic as the shocks in our progress as a nation. Let me remind them of the most devastating disaster and a phenomenon more damaging than COVID-19 that was pushed on the people of Fiji as early as 2006 - a two-men government and their much-proclaimed leaders. That two-men government gave Fiji the highest debt a single government has given us since all the governments put together post-Independence. (Chorus of interjections) HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- They gave Fiji a warped political party registration law that they are now paying for it. In 2014, they cooked the economic books, they realigned the statistician to change the baseline and therefore change the numbers. No wonder, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that by 2018, there was a huge confusion between the GDP and the dinau by the previous Prime Minister. Speaking of dinau, a few hundreds of thousands of dollars is still yet to be paid by the de-registered</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1171 Party. Right? Right! Too much noise from the other side, Mr. Speaker, that Government is not doing enough. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Prove it here, prove it here! (Chorus of interjections) HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- We are doing everything a responsible government will do within its means. Perhaps on the other side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the honourable Members may not have maths as their best subject. In this year’s Budget, $410 million is in direct assistance. In addition to that, we have also included the 22 zero-rated items on VAT and, of course, the prescribed medicine. We have increased salaries for the civil servants, as well as upping the minimum wage. In the sugar industry this year, the last payment was $101.08, the largest ever in the history of the sugar industry in Fiji; the largest ever. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has this year been allocated $36.5 million; that is an increase of $6.4 million from the previous year. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- The budget increase will continue to allow the Ministry to enhance its commitment and fulfil its roles to effectively and efficiently administer and regulate land and the mineral resources sector. For the Ministry of Lands, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also I may have to say this before my time is up, to the people who may not have had a good run with my Ministry and the staff of the Ministry this year, I stand here as the responsible Minister to ask for your forgiveness. We will work towards our collective effort to make sure that our service delivery in the next financial year is better.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I hope so:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this Government’s Budget may not be filled with fancy words of the previous government’s budget, but we know is that it is attending to the everyday-need of Fijians, especially those who live farther away from the main urban centres and the peri–urban centres of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have run out of time, I fully support the Budget presented by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Finance. I thank his team at the Ministry of Finance - the Permanent Secretary, Director Budget and the entire budget team. Me lagilagi saka o Viti! MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea but before doing so, I would like to make two announcements.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1172 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 The first one is that when we resume, I will be calling upon the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to make his Right of Reply, that is, the reply to all that have been raised in the debate that you have participated in, honourable Members. It will be an uninterrupted speech as is the tradition and this has been approved by the Business Standing Committee as well, so he can speak for as long as he likes. The second one is that the Secretariat would like to inform you, honourable Members, that the Medical Team is at Level 2 in Parliament precincts, willing to undertake checkup, et cetera. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Blood pressure! MR. SPEAKER.- Well, it is bound to affect a lot of pressure because of the Budget. You will gain some, you will lose some, that is the way it goes. Those are the two announcements that I would like to make from the Chair and enjoy your tea. We will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.30 a.m.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1173 The Parliament resumed at 11.12 a.m. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament; I rise to provide my Right of Reply to the 2024-2025 Budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two days, I have listened carefully, I did not try to interject as much as I wanted to, but I have listened carefully to all the contributions coming from both sides of Parliament, and I wish to thank the honourable Prime Minister and all my colleagues on the Government side for their contributions. I also want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition and all the Independent Members, who came out in support of the Budget and many others who were more balanced, showed some creativity, and I cannot say the same about few of the loyalists on the other side, but it does so, Mr. Speaker, that when we have the freedom to speak, we unleash creativity thinking and we do things in a more honest way, if there is no compulsion and there is no fear. This is very welcomed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as a government, we are very proud that we have provided that environment in the country, the confidence for our people, for investors and for everyone to speak their mind, to criticise the Government and to move the country forward. There was an interesting observation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, made by honourable Kirpal in his contribution. He said to the fact that in the previous government, Cabinet Ministers would get to see the budget an hour before the Budget Address. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, as a Government and, again, I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership, where our budget formulation, as I have said, takes a very thorough process at the Permanent Secretary level, at individual ministerial level, with the Minister for Finance, the Cabinet Sub-Committee, culminating in the whole budget being approved by Cabinet before the Budget Address in Parliament. That, Sir, is a very transparent open engaging process that we have formulated in both, our first and second Budget, and I have no doubt that, that will be the case as we move into the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, formulating a national budget is not an easy task, especially in the midst of a large public debt which constraints your ability to fix infrastructure and public services that had been neglected for many years. The gaps are even tougher, if you also inherit an economy that is recovering from a major economic setback, not only because of poor management, but because of events, like COVID-19, with the need for fiscal support to protect the fragile economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, governments, as you know very well, can only spend what they collect from taxes and other forms of revenue, as well as what they can borrow. Both taxes and borrowed money do not come cheap. Therefore, it is important that governments make the best use of these taxpayer resources where it gives the highest return, and that involves making tough decisions and policy trade-offs, and at most times, choosing what is economically correct and physically responsible rather than for short-term political survival. At the same time, giving the critical role of government to provide essential services, it is important that the government is well funded. Otherwise, we have seen over several years that the Government actually did not have enough money to fix our hospitals, improve our roads, solve our water woes, clean our drainages, rescue our deteriorating public assets and pay our civil servants well. We may well have this situation for the future, until we fix and until we have growth, that we are able to build more fiscal spaces. That is exactly what we have done in the last two Budgets, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we ensured that Government is well funded to not only fix public infrastructure and services, but to contain our fiscal deficit and put our public debt on a downward trajectory.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1174 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 I know a lot has been said about Government debt and I know the honourable Leader of the Opposition tried to weave and find his own explanation and put a positive picture of what might have happened before, but the reality of the matter as they say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have earlier said, Fiji’s debt to GDP ratio peaked at around 90 percent of GDP in July 2022, rising from 53 percent in 2006. By the end of July 2024, we would have brought down the debt to GDP ratio to 78 percent - a reduction of 12 percentage point in just 18 months, and they have talked about how we have done in 18 months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, in his very excellent contribution, said that in 18 months, we can only do so much, and he said how much we have done in 18 months. This was not an easy feat but a great achievement for us, as a nation, putting a path or foundation for a downward trajectory into our debt to GDP ratio. Even more importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the fiscal reforms in the last Budget, we have fixed our revenue problem and brought fiscal deficits under control from the double-digit levels, honourable Leader of the Opposition, prior to us getting into Government. This means that as the economy grows, our debt to GDP ratio will continue on a downward path. That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to continue on this course, and this is not a problem that can be fixed in a year or two. We need to be committed to a fiscal plan for, at least, the next decade. So, what we are doing, Sir, we are not thinking that we are going to be in the Government for the next one decade or two decades as some used to think, we are setting honestly and clearly the path for the next decade whoever is in Government. The political will and national commitment to get our debt problem under control has been commended, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by international agencies, financial institutions, like the IMF and World Bank, credit rating agencies and all our development partners. So, we have a very good tick, and that provides the confidence to our investors, foreign investors and everyone else that is looking at Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been talked about on VAT. I have heard some of the honourable Opposition Members and most of the loyalists, asking why we are not reducing VAT...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> The real Opposition, not the loyalists.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> …that reducing VAT is not an option.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That will become very clear in the passage of time:</span></p><p>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are worried when honourable Opposition Members, like honourable Premila Kumar, honourable Chand, honourable Ketan Lal and others, are proposing that we reduce VAT from 15 percent to 9 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are forgetting conveniently that they were part of a leadership when the VAT rate was 15 percent with no exemption. It was the push by the Opposition which is now in Government, that we forced them after the 2014 General Election to reduce the VAT. They reduced the VAT, but they did not have zero VAT on basic food items. Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they changed it to three rates - they had 15 percent, 9 percent and zero percent, and none of them in their contribution on VAT talked about what was there before.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1175 Plus, Sir, none of them mentioned that this Government kept the zero rate on VAT and on food items, and we added prescribed medicine with 22 items VAT free. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me tell honourable Premila Kumar that if we reduce VAT from 15 percent to 9 percent, we will lose $600 million in revenue. For every 1 percent reduction in VAT, we lose about $100 million in tax revenue. The question is, how are you going to compensate for this, honourable Kumar?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You did not collect:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Are you going to increase the fiscal deficit to double digit and add additional $600 million in loan? But technically, you cannot borrow this additional $600 million, given the availability of financing. Are you going to reduce expenditure by $600 million, of which, none of you talked about? You will recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that when we were in Opposition, they were asking, “Where is the Opposition’s alternative budget?” For eight years, they hounded me and said, “Where is your alternative budget?”. I kept telling them that it is not easy for an Opposition to bring an alternative budget, given the difficulty that we had to get information. Now, they are free, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What is your alternative budget? Where is it now? (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the public should note that a lot of the information that came from some of the Opposition Members was half information, and half information can be dangerous and misleading. It is easy for some of them to come here and say that we should reduce VAT, without saying how we would fix the revenue gap. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reiterate that when we increased the VAT rate from 9 percent to 15 percent in the last Budget, we had done a thorough analysis, explore different options, consulted with various experts, discussed with our multilateral lenders, and even brought it for public discussion. We did not hide it. We knew it was not an easy call, so we had to make sure that we get it right. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we just did not pluck out the 15 percent from thin air, but it was based on a thorough analysis and what was there already, as put forth by the previous government. Then we looked at our revenue needs and worked out what will ensure that government is adequately funded. We were also able to put our debt to GDP ratio on a downward path. If we had not done that, Sir, we would have been in a major debt distress by now, and most of our lenders would have stopped lending to the Government. I will talk more about VAT when I talk about the cost of living. The other thing that the honourable Leader of the Opposition did, Mr. Speaker, was comparison of per capita debt, and that is a right thing to do. I am not saying that the honourable Leader of the Opposition was not right. But let me shed some light on the nominal debt and debt per capita per person, which a number of people have talked about. The Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, inherited a total debt of around $9.5 billion at the end of 2022. In terms of debt per capita, look at the total debt, divide by the total population, that is the debt per capita, Sir. This was around $10,700. By the end of this Budget in July 2025, our total debt is projected to be $10.9 billion, or $12,300 per person. This means that in terms of debt per capita, the Coalition Government in three years, would have added about $1,600 debt per person.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1176 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 On the contrary, the previous government inherited a total debt of $2.9 billion in 2006, or $3,400 per person. During their term, they increased the debt level to $9.5 billion, or $10,700 per person. This is an additional debt of $6.6 billion, or in per capita terms, an additional per capita debt of $7,300 per person.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Compare apples with apples:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> So, honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Sachida Nand who also talked about it, this is the reality when we talk about debt per capita. By July 2025, we would have added $1,600 in additional debt per person, which they would have added about $7,300 additional debt to every person. So, that is just an explanation on debt per capita. Let me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, get to the cost of living because that is another issue that everyone is concerned about, and we all ought to be concerned about. Let me provide some clarification and explanation so that some of them do not go out and lie to the people about what the Government is doing. This is a sensitive issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is always subject to political point-scoring, but let me put through some basic economic facts. First, prices are generally set through market forces in most cases, based on demand and supply. Sellers or producers decide the price of …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Which you never understood when you were in Opposition:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> …their product based on the cost of production, including labour, raw materials, transportation, storage, taxes and associated costs. And based on the level of demand and competition from other suppliers, they decide to put up whatever mark up and the final price on the product, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But the basic principle remains that no one will ever sell their product at the price below their cost of production. Secondly and more importantly, governments can influence the price of any product only to a certain extent, and it can do so in three ways – (1) (2) (3) we can put price controls; changing the level of taxes it applies on these products by producing the product itself; or selling it at a loss, like Government services, including water. So, even with price controls and changing the level of taxes, there is only so much that can be done, and there are trade-offs for these decisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a government, we have looked at all these options and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications which the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) comes under his Ministry, is constantly looking at how we can use some of these tools and policies to provide relief to our people, and that is being done. I am sure the honourable Deputy Prime Minister will be making at some of those decisions soon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are always trade-offs in terms of whatever policies you choose. So, the point that I am trying to make is that it is not easy to bring down prices, and it is critical to understand what the Government can do which they did, which they do not admit what we have done. So, even for some zero rate on VAT items and quite conveniently, none of them talked about the fact that 22 items still has zero VAT - 21 basic food items and prescribed medicine.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1177</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Microwaving, that is what you always say.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Despite the fact that there is no VAT on these items, the price had increased due to increase in either production cost or other associated costs, like freight, insurance, storage, et cetera, which is completely beyond our control, and they know that. It happened during COVID. The freight cost went up three or four times and some of it stayed for a long time. So, even when you reduce the duty, even when you have zero VAT, the prices, Mr. Speaker, Sir, still went up, and other reasons. I know, honourable Usamate, in the last session of Parliament, may be a better way to describe him is honourable hogwash, talked about cassava. HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order, Sir. The honourable Member should refer to other honourable Members as “honourable Member”, not as “hogwash”. Hogwash is a general term. He needs to withdraw that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> You may carry on, Deputy Prime Minister, and be mindful of that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, what we are trying to say is that for most of the products that we consume in Fiji, as such, it is difficult to control the import prices which are determined in the global markets. Our major trading partners, including Australia, New Zealand, United States of America, have all been experiencing very, very high inflation rates due to global supply chain disruptions associated with the pandemic. Australia’s inflation was 6.6 percent in 2022, highest in 31 years, while New Zealand was 7.2 percent in 34 years, the US was 8 percent highest in 40 years. So, given trade links with these countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is natural that the price of imports from these countries would be higher and have a bigger impact, since around 50 percent of our consumption basket is made up of imported items. So, I am trying to explain this, Sir, because our people need to understand and many of them do. It also, I think, nullifies the lies that some honourable Members on the other side have been telling our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at comparable countries, such as Mauritius, its inflation was 10.8 percent in 2022, 7 percent in 2023 and 5.9 percent in 2024. In our neighbouring Pacific countries, Vanuatu recorded inflation of 6.7 percent in 2022, 12 percent in 2023 and 6.7 percent in 2024, while Tonga noted an inflation of 8.5 percent in 2022, 10.2 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent is expected in 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our inflation rate in Fiji stood at 5.1 percent at the end of last year, 7.1 percent in April this year, but that is just in April. Our current inflation rate in June 2024 stood at 6.7 percent and is projected (this is from the Fiji Bureau of Statistics) to stabilise around 3 percent to 4 percent by the end of the year.</p></body>
