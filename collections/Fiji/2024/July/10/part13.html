<body><h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 7.</h3><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- SEG 7.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Let me just explain, there is a net increase and it is due to the following. I will give the details so that honourable Premila Kumar does not come back again. The decrease in the implementation of the new Budget System…. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Are you following, honourable Premila Kumar? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I am sorry, Sir, my question is on SEG 7 and not SEG 9 - Activity 2(7).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, that is what I am trying to explain.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. CHAIRMAN.:</span> She is seeking more clarification on that one, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I am sorry, once again.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Chairman, my question is on SEG 7 - National Asset Management Framework. Is this Framework completed? Is this money going to be used for implementation? So, basically, how are you going to use it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Implementation:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Just a question again on this Framework:</span> If you can elaborate a little bit more, how do you implement this Framework? I mean, is $40,000 really sufficient to do this work? What does the work entail? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I could go into great details about National Asset Management Framework. Essentially what we found out what was that this was all over the place. So, this Framework is actually going to bring things together. The actual allocation this year compared to last year is a decrease of about $10,000. What we are planning to do in terms of the upgrade of the Framework, the Framework is approved and now, it is about implementation and getting it done. It is also updating the Fixed Register and all the other things that are part of the Asset Management Framework. MR. CHAIRMAN.- We shall move on. Programme 1-3? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 1-3(7) – Implementation of New Budget System ($2,700,000). I noticed that in last year’s budget, you had a budget of $2 million and</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1198 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 now, there is $2.7 million. Does that mean that it is the end of the implementation? Is it a $4.7 million in total or is this part of the money that was budgeted last year which was not being used? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The increase in expenditure is really aligned to the payment schedule. We continue to invest in the modernisation of the Financial Administrative Systems. As I have said, when we provided an update in my Ministerial Statement to improve efficiency, effectiveness and accountability, we are basically moving away from the manual system of formulating the National Budget. So, the Government has actually engaged the services of a Canadian company – Questica Software Inc, for the supply and implementation of the new Budget software system. All these years, even until now in this age of technology and IT system, everything was done manually. Staff would actually feed into the Excel Sheet and look at the numbers. This is going to be a great improvement and innovation. It will make it more transparent and efficient. We have had errors in the Budget in the past, in the Budget Estimates, and it was partly arising out of a manual system. So, this is a very, very timely investment that we have made, as a government, to improve the budget system. HON. J. USAMATE.- Was the $2.7 million the end of that process?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, it will be the end of the process.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> I still have a question, Sir. My question is on Programme 1-4(7) – Gender Responsive Budgeting Programme ($50,000). If the honourable Minister can elaborate on the programme - on this particular subject? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Which programme, is it the same Activity?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> We are on Programme 1-3(7).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Give me a second, I think you are talking about the Gender Responsive Budgeting Programme (GRBP), is that right?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> What we have done, Mr. Chairman, it is like the citizen’s budget. This allocation is to make sure that across all different Ministries, this framework, this understanding is included. There are different Ministries which will have allocations for budget to promote gender sensitivity, gender-based activities. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- If I may ask a supplementary question, it talks about a programme. Is it a separate reporting of gender-based activities? Is it a programme that you put it out to the public to understand what kind of budget is given to the public? I do not understand, can you explain? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The programme is essentially training as well. So, you have to continue training and making sure that there is understanding of gender-based budgeting and understanding of the budget. So, that allocation is also part of the training that will be provided. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-7(7) – Vehicle Management System ($50,000). Can we have some bit of clarification on that? Is this for the whole fleet across Government? I think it is a new expenditure, I did not see it in previous years.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1199 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You are right, it is a new expenditure allocation. Really, the funding is to cater for the procurement of the vehicle management system for the Whole of Government. Currently, there is no online database and no vehicle software to manage both, leased and State-owned vehicles. Hence, this software will be used to manage both, leased and State-owned vehicles, and we are, sort of, moving towards a paperless system, as well as the provision of advice to executive management in a timely manner. It is also partly to cut down on wastages. The system will be used by Government Fleet Management Unit to manage all Government vehicles. So, the timely reports on where the vehicles are, who is using it, et cetera, so that we have a much better handle on the use of Government vehicles both, leased and Government-owned vehicles. Currently, everything is manual. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-8? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question is on Programme 1-8(7) - Policy Advisors ($270,000). If the honourable Minister can tell us who these Policy Advisors are, and how many of them will be recruited or used? Was this provision there in the last Budget, et cetera? I need more details on this particular expenditure. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, when we started with the formulation of the National Development Plan, we got a Consultant Policy Advisor from the World Bank - a Malaysian national. We did not want one consultant to just come and do the plan, so we hired two local consultants - two Economists who are both Academics. One was a senior government official before, very experienced in the planning office and was at the Fiji National University (FNU), and the other one was at the University of the South Pacific (USP). We hired them temporarily as Consultants and Policy Advisors through proper expression of interest and procurement. Both have done a fantastic job in getting the plan ready. The plan is near finalisation, as I have said already. Once it is done, they will spend, at least, another year to help in the operationalisation of the plan - the implementation, monitoring, and as you know, we have a three-year, five-year and 20-year plan. So, in the first three years, we have said publicly that we will be addressing the basics, fundamentally going through, and part of the job would be to also look at how budgets are used, the utilisation and whether these things align with the plans. It was a very helpful step that we took to get the plan ready. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question on that; these Policy Advisors, do you have a plan for how long you will need them? Is it for three years?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have said another year. They were hired for two years:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Chairman, I have a supplementary question on the same SEG - Programme 1-8(7) – Policy Advisors. We also give funding to Fiji National University and other universities. Do you think it will be appropriate, honourable Minister, that we use some of those Academics who are already part of the university agreement with the Government? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- If you had listened to me carefully, I had precisely said that they are both University Academics, one from FNU and one from USP. We do not ask Universities to do things free for Government, we hire consultants and invariably in most of the time, Sir, we hire consultants from within local universities as much as possible and sometimes in very rare cases. I do not know about the previous government but so far, we have not hired any foreign consultant,</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1200 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 unless otherwise it is provided for by development partners to help us and in this particular case, that is what we have done. HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, under Programme 1-8(7), this allocation used to be here on apprenticeship funds, but it is not here now. Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics assure us that if it is not here, then apprenticeship funding is moved to another SEG? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is moved to another Ministry. What we have done, Mr. Chairman, we did not do much in the last Budget, we kept a lot of ‘R’s, we kept a lot of funding within the Ministry of Finance. In this Budget, we tried to move as much funding as possible, directly into the Ministries, instead of Ministry of Finance keeping it under ‘R’. So, as much as possible, we have tried to move it directly to the Ministers so that they can get on with the job straight away. Thank you. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, my question is still on Progamme 1-8(7) - National Economic Summit. I see the amount allocated is $50,000, does that mean that you will be having this Summit in one of the schools or community halls? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, I think this is a silly question. We have not decided on the date, otherwise we will be here for three days, asking Government specific operational things, things that we have not actually decided yet. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think we will move on. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-8(7) - National Development Plan ($50,000). Can the honourable Minister elaborate, is this the same national plan which you have failed to launch which you mentioned earlier? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Again, Mr. Chairman, I mean, the pigeon season is over, otherwise I would have told them, but you are shooting from the wrong angle, Sir. We have said very clearly in the Budget Address and today, in the Right of Reply, that the plan is ready, every Minister has been consulted, it is getting ready to be printed and the honourable Prime Minister will launch the plan very soon. We will invite honourable Nath to be part of that, thank you. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, under Programme 2-1(7) - Employment and Unemployment Survey. In the last year’s Budget, you had $2.44 million but this year, there is another $606,597. Is this just the completion of that or is just the reflection of work that was not done last year. The second question, when can we expect the results of the survey? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, honourable Usamate as a statistician would understand that these surveys occur each financial year, especially the Household Income and Expenditure Survey, as well as the Employment and Unemployment Survey, and that is all being done at the moment. That is why there is an additional allocation. Let me, Mr. Chairman, just say that we have empowered the Fiji Bureau of Statistics now to be an independent organisation, to be able to do these things timely and appropriate budget is provided.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>10 th July, 2024 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 1201 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, I do have a question. It is on Programme 2-1(7) - Household Income and Expenditure Survey ($2,454,935). Is it just a one year programme, or you think it is going to spill over to next year? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, as I have said, from all the Household Income and Expenditure Surveys we have had and you would probably know this well, it does not just finish in one year. It is like over a period of time. It, sort of, overlaps into the next year, and that is how this will done. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I am sure, as part of your planning process, you may have budgeted the total sum that will be used. So how much are you looking at as a total for this project? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Yes, I can give you some details but not everything. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey and the Employment and Unemployment Survey are national surveys. The Employment and Unemployment Survey data is based on 6,000 households from 600 enumeration areas from all the four Divisions. The Employment and Unemployment Survey is conducted in four rounds in a period of 12 months. In the same way, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey takes a while. So, it is not something that you do it in one month or two months. The sampling process takes time, the actual conduct of the survey, takes time, and you know this. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote on Head 4 – Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. Question put. Head 4 agreed to. Head 5- Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1(6) - Turaga-ni-Koro Allowance (2,845,000). I notice that there is an increase of around $60,000 from the amount that was there last year. Can this be clarified, what is the reason for that increase and whether all the Turaga-ni-Koro have been paid? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Chairman, the increase is because of the additional responsibilities that will be given to the Turaga-ni-Koro. With the economic empowerment of the iTaukei, more reporting is going to come from the Turaga-ni-Koro. With the current allowance that they are given, it is really not enough when you look at the cost of living. So, we have increased it by $50, so from $150 to $200. Realistically, on the ground, it is still not enough. In regard to the payment of Turaga-ni-Koro, we try and get reports from them and that is the cause of the delay because the Turaga-ni-Koro is only nominated by the community. We make sure that they perform the duty that is given to them before we pay them because it is public funds. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, on the same SEG, we have the Centre for Appropriate Technology and Development (CATD) in Nadave which is a place where a lot of people have undertaken their training over the years. But I notice that there has been quite a significant drop in their budget of around $300,000. Can we just have some clarification on that?</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>1202 Debate on the 2024-2025 Appropriation Bill 2024 10 th July, 2024 HON. I. VASU.- In that allocation, we have allocated $370,000 for their capital projects at Nadave. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, it is due to the movement of maintenance and special expenditure to SEG 10 also. HON. J. USAMATE.- It moved to a different SEG?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr:</span> Chairman, Programme 1-1(7) – Review of Centre for Appropriate Technology and Development By-Laws ($100,000). Can I be clarified on this issue? MR. CHAIRMAN.- You want the clarification on the bylaws that should be undertaken at</p></body>
