<body><h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- PEMAC.</h3><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- PEMAC.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, PEMAC as we speak, there is no one in the Curriculum Unit under PEMAC, so we were putting out Expression of Interest for four. We need four at headquarters to start reviving PEMAC in the schools. Our particular concern is the music side. Our music and dance today is from pre-recorded music. What we want to teach our people is to actually play the instruments and for that, it is quite challenging, getting the right kind of teachers into music. For crafts, we are alright, I think we can do that in co-operation with the community. Physical education, we are alright in that area, but music is a challenging one. Our expression of interest has gone. We need four to be part of PEMAC in the system. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Just another supplementary question to the honourable Minister. Will these Art and Craft, Music and PEMAC teachers be registered under the Teacher Training Board? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. As I had mentioned in my speech, the registration people will be part of this, and once you join as teachers, you will be registered under the Fiji Teachers Registration Association. You will be registered under them. If I can address that, Mr. Speaker, one of the best schools in the Western Division, Xavier College, that had a very good pass rate and they attributed that to the extra-curricular activities they have in the school - PEMAC. So, it really is a huge part of education both, at primary and secondary school, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Do you remember the days when QVS used to have a play – drama, almost every year? They used to tour around the country. We need to revive that. That is a kind of extra-curricular that we want to encourage. MR. SPEAKER.- Just to add a bit more to what we have been hearing, Honourable Members, we have heard from the making of the Sisi ni Lakeba. Instead of using the traditional vau, it has now gone to mangrove barks- similar to Egypt as well. They do drawings on the jute straws that they get, they do drawings there and they sell very high. They have run out of jute, they have gone on to the stems of banana trees. They take out the pieces there and they all look alike. Just recently back in my home island, when there is graduation from these three universities at the second part of the year, that is when new tracks are seen up in the lake in Taveuni where the people of the island found it as a very lucrative business to get the flower of the ‘ tagimoucia ’ and they send it across to Lautoka or Suva where they hold this graduation - the tagimoucia leaves. So, that again is how good the strength of the people to make more from whatever they could in terms of the very high demands there is. If that is to be taught, I certainly would appreciate that because it will protect our flower on the island as well.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>551 In the past you hardly find farmers down in the urban areas of Somosomo with gumboots and you will see them right at the top of the hill. How they go up there with gumboots, I really do not understand. It is quite a hike up the steep hill, yet they are there. They are picking the flowers, and it is bringing a lot of happiness to their families. They do that but at the same time, the landowners just have to face the brunt because they get direct benefit as well from all those side dealings and all that because of the demand from the three universities. Written Question Information on State Land Subdivisions (Question No. 38/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament on the following – (a) The total number of Sate Land Sub-divisions for residential purpose that were developed from 2014 to 2022 by Division and Districts; (b) The total number of State Land Sub-divisions for residential purpose that is currently under development by Divisions and Districts; (c) The total number of State Land Leases issued for residential purpose from 2014 to 2022 by Division; (d) The total number of State Land Notices of Approval of Lease issued for residential purpose from 2014 to 2022 by Division; and (e) The total number of applications pending for grant of lease for residential purpose on a State Land Sub-Division by Division and District as at 31 March 2024. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to table my my written response to the question posed before Parliament this afternoon. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders in respect to sitting times, at this juncture, I would like to ask the Leader of Government in Parliament a suspension motion.</p></body>
