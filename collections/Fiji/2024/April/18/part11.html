PRASAD.- The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I am happy to provide an update on the Fijian economy. The headlines, if I can call them that, are that after a successful post-COVID recovery, we are confronting new challenges, particularly those posed by the loss of our skilled people abroad. The Government is ready to deal with these challenges at the same time as setting a longer- term pathway for Fiji’s future growth and prosperity. However, as always, we want our people to be informed and aware of the critical factors, and we want a united approach to economic management, including from our friends on the Opposition benches. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will delve briefly only on the history, but it is important because as the saying goes, “those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” We know of the huge burden our people suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 when the economy shrank by more than 22 percent. In 2020, this was the fourth-largest contraction in all of the economies in the world. But the economy was not in great shape even before COVID. In 2019, it was already contracting, and we had negative growth. Our debt to GDP ratio was already rising so that when COVID came along and the Government was forced to borrow to keep the economy afloat, it rose sharply to 90 percent. While we expect this ratio to fall to just under 80 percent by July, the Government remains</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>505 burdened by it. When Government debt is this high, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot invest freely in the things our people need – roads, water, power, health, education, and housing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may say, I believe that the Coalition Government’s main point of difference in its economic management against that of the previous Government, has been to open the books, share information and invite people’s participation in economic management. We urgently convened the Fiscal Review Committee to report to us on tax and other economic measures. We convened the National Economic Summit and now, we are completing a new National Development Plan. I will talk more about this shortly. The Fiscal Review Committee Report identified a number of urgent steps that needed to be taken, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The first of these was that the Government was not simply raising enough money, it was critically under-funded for the basic services that our people need, and we entitled to expect. So, what happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Because we were not collecting enough taxes, Government debt was allowed to grow. We sold assets to raise money, such as 44 percent stake in our national electricity company. But most critically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we failed to invest in infrastructure - Everyone in Suva knows what happened to their water supply last month. • • We have critical bridges in our road network that may have to be closed down at any time • • • • and must be urgently rebuilt. Large parts of our main hospital are in an unfit state. Our post system urgently requires tens of millions of dollars in investment. Our sanitation infrastructure requires billions. Indeed, it was only earlier this week that the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport told Parliament that the capital investment bill for his Ministry alone is about $8.5 billion. Why am I raising these points, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Is it to blame the previous Government? No. It is to ensure that the lessons of the past are learned, and the challenges of the future are understood. The first lesson to take from the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we must be honest and open with the people about the challenges we face. We believe that if we share information with the people, and ask them to help and support the Government, they will understand why we have had to know that this has been a concern to many. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Reduce your travel! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Well, when she sees the figures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, she will stand up from her chair. (Laughter) We believe that if we share information with the people and ask them to help and support the Government, they will understand why we had to take hard measures, particularly, with the return of VAT reform. We know that this has been a concern to many. We have tried to manage this by increasing welfare and other payments for our most vulnerable. We have also increased the tax burden on the businesses. We believe that the people who are willing to inform themselves and understand our</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>506</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 challenges, also understand the hard measures we have to take. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our economic management, our first rule will always be to inform, consult and request participation from those outside of the Government. We may not have yet made good use of our learnings at the first National Economic Summit and brought people together again to advance the resolutions we arrived at there. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry, like many employers, has had to deal with severe personnel challenges this year with an impact on what we can deliver. We intend to convene another National Economic Summit later in the year, in August or September after the Budget. The reason for this, Sir, is that we want the Summit to be focused on long-term challenges, not the Budget. By that time.... (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen! MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-...we will also have completed. So, I want to assure everyone that we will continue to consult, to listen and to interact. And we will also listen carefully to criticism, and I want to hear where we may have gone wrong and the alternative solutions that may be available. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in keeping with this focus on transparency and certainty, I intend to set out publicly in the next few weeks, the key Budget measures that are under consideration before the next National Budget is presented on 28 th June this year. This is so that people can give us their input on these issues ahead of time and to tell us what might be wrong ahead of time. I want to emphasise the importance we place on consistency, predictability and stability of policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are not going to announce sudden changes on Budget night. We want everyone with a stake in economic management to understand that our approach is to be open and transparent, to set economic and fiscal policy and not to constantly change it. In the last 18 months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we managed to come out of the pandemic with a strong economic rebound of 20 percent in 2022 and 8.2 percent in 2023. So, we are back at pre- pandemic levels now. But that does not change the fact that our economy is now where it was in 2019. So, we have lost five years of economic growth. The tourism industry rebounded strongly with a record of 929,740 visitors, 4 percent higher than 2019 levels. Our national airline, our hoteliers and all other tourism associated businesses had a year of record profits. Tourism earnings reached a record level of $2.4 billion, which allowed people to go back to jobs and other businesses. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Honourable Kumar, Mr. Speaker, is the most irritating Member of Parliament I have encountered in the last nine years. She cannot help herself. Personal remittances rose to a record of $1.25 billion last year, thanks to our people living and working overseas. This helped propel spending in the economy, and supported growth and income levels of our people. We have also attracted some major new foreign investment, although much of it remains in the ‘so-called pipeline. Our job as Government is to get out of the pipeline and</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>507 and onto the ground. Foreign reserves, Mr. Speaker, Sir, remain at comfortable levels now and is projected to remain stable in the medium term. As of yesterday, our reserves position stood at about $3.2 billion, sufficient to cover 5.1 months of imports of goods and services. While these reserves are comfortable, the Reserve Bank of Fiji is managing them prudently, as we expect pressure on reserves in the coming months from higher oil prices and a slowdown in inwards tourism receipts. The healthy reserves position has ensured that the liquidity in the financial system supports low interest rates, which is a key ingredient in driving private sector borrowing and investment. As of yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial system liquidity stood at about $1.9 billion. On the fiscal side, as I have said earlier, the Government has decisively tackled the debt problem and introduced a number of revenue reforms, although they are painful, to ensure long term debt sustainability.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You have increased the debt:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Debt increased:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have no idea what you are talking about:</span></p><p>We have managed to bring down our debt to GDP ratio from almost 90 percent in 2022 to below 80 percent at the end of this fiscal year - July 2024. This is, Mr. Speaker, good progress, but we still have a long way to go. This path of fiscal discipline and debt reduction must continue. As I have said, the VAT increase in particular, has had some impact on prices of goods and services to our people. But if we do not take this bitter medicine now, the consequences would be far more severe and painful, Mr. Speaker. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They have forgotten that the government of which they were part of, had a VAT rate of 15 percent without any exemption for a long time. MR. SPEAKER.- No running commentaries at the back, please. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Looking ahead, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the economy is now returning to its usual growth trend of about 3 percent, as we had projected in the mid-term fiscal strategy. We know this is not good enough, and we must do better than this. Sir, 5 percent per annum is the minimum growth rate that is acceptable. Once again, Mr. Speaker, we need to stop and look at what our situation is, and what measures we need to take to address them. First and foremost is the loss of skilled people. With Australia and New Zealand after COVID-19 and the global labour market restructuring and unprecedented demand in those countries, they opened up their immigration doors to a very, very significant and unprecedented levels. We have lost about 70,000 to 80,000 people in the last 18 months, many of them with significant technical training and experience. We cannot blame people for seeking the opportunities given to them by Australia and New Zealand.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>508</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 That is one of the more reason why Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is so important that we begin to tackle our big social challenges as well. Some of them, like NCDs, domestic violence, the growing issue of drug use, are generational and require all of us to get involved. The skills lost, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a major concern for employers and investors. It is also a threat to economic growth. We should not forget that Government too is an employer of skilled personnel. Our own Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, lost a quarter of its professional staff in the last 18 months, either to immigration or to the private sector. This has been our biggest challenge in some ways in implementing policies, and I know the honourable Minister for Immigration is going to talk about this in his Ministerial Address as to how we are reforming the Immigration Department and how we can improve the processing of work permits so that we can begin to get critical skills into the country and to get businesses, investment and construction to move faster. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are continuing work on streamlining the processes in our regulatory agencies. This work is challenging and time consuming. Government is burdened with regulatory processes that are decades old, and a culture which assumes that everyone seeking its help is guilty until proven otherwise. Decision-makers, in some sense, have grown up in a culture where they were afraid to make decisions and one that would displease a particular powerful person that they will be fired. So, they were cautious and risk averse and reluctant to even make decisions and, of course, Mr. Speaker, we are changing that. We have also made sure, Mr. Speaker, that we have in our approach of economic management, open up the discussion and the engagement with our business sector. And we are told everyday by businesses and investors that they feel much freer, much more confident about investing in the country. Mr. Speaker Sir, I want to look at some key economic indicators which help us to analyse and assess our economic direction for the year. At this point, the data is pointing to weaker consumer spending against the earlier projections. The loss of so many people in the last 18 months, about 8 percent of our population, will clearly impact this. Lower consumer spending feeds into lower levels of economic activity and, of course, for Government, lower tax receipts from income tax and VAT as well, Mr. Speaker. The recent period of heavy rain and flooding has also not helped, and it is going to cause some impact on the level of spending and delay some of the investment activity. The investment activity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been very positive in the last 12 months to 18 months. Recent indicators point towards a pickup in activity, as major tourism-related projects gain traction. However, we need to build on this momentum and ensure that things are moving on the ground. We all know that we are critically short of skilled construction labour. We are tackling other factors, such as quickening environmental and planning regulation and where possible, high business cost. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about price inflation. There has been a lot of confusing talk about this recently, and we must all get it right because these are issues that go to consumer</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>509 confidence and the search for solutions to the cost of living. Only when we have the right data, we can look for the solutions. The year-on-year headline inflation rate stood at 4.6 percent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in March 2024, compared to 2.0 percent in March 2023. Why has it increased? The two main causes are the increase in global commodity prices, and the increase in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent in August last year. The VAT increase has been largely absorbed now so we expect inflation to slow to an average of around 3 percent by the end of this year. To cushion the impact of inflation and VAT increase on our people, in the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had increased the welfare payments by 25 percent for those above the age of 70, and 15 percent for the others. We paid almost $90 million in two rounds of back-to-school payment to almost 220,000 children. We had forgiven around $650 million in TELS debt for over 53,000 families. We reduced import duties on certain food items and more importantly we are focused on rebuilding the economy to ensure that there is more high paying job creation. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the figures from the FCCC shows that a large number of products particularly food items saw a decrease in the prices as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial sector remains sound and continues to support domestic economic activity. The private sector credit is showing encouraging signs but remains below pre- pandemic trend as over $1.1 billion is approved loans yet to be draw down. We are seeing some major interest in foreign investment but, as I have said earlier, we all need to work harder towards getting this realized on the ground. The global trends, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are watching the global trends closely, the global economy seems to have slowed down in major trading partners including our source markets. New Zealand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just went into technical recession. The IMF is projecting global growth at 3.2 percent in 2024, much lower than the historical average of 3.8 percent between 2000 and 2019. The disruptions to shipping routes and trade fragmentation policies are expected to impact trade and add upward pressure on freight costs, although these effects are yet to be seen. Production supply deficits…. MR. SPEAKER.- Please round off.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> It is the first bell, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- One minute left:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, thank you.</p><p>The other issues we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to global trends is the production supply deficits shaped by OPEC policies and the expectation and escalation of the war in Gaza and this is likely to push the price of crude oil to higher levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, we are reminding our people that we have a new economic management approach. We are involving our people, our businesses and we feel that the approach that we have taken is building confidence, creating as I have said, it is going to result in a level of confidence that we never saw in this country over the last 10 years. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope you are not confused because of the</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>510</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 confusion that, that statement brought to the floor of Parliament today, but let me thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement this morning. (Laughter) I have already stated in my earlier address in reply to His Excellency’s Opening of Parliament that with all the intentions that the Government has, the main thing is for the economy, for the financial footing of this nation and that is something that we will work towards as well. In the limited time that I was given this morning to prepare, I just looked into two references. 1. Reserve Bank of Fiji Economic Review Volume 42 for the period end of March 2024; and 2. Mid-Year Fiscal Statement that has been issued by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister through the Ministry of Finance. The honourable Minister started his statement this morning on a very positive note stating that the Fijian economy has returned to pre-pandemic GDP level after two years of strong economic recovery. The recovery, and of course, the growth in 2023 was because of the initiative that was put in place by the FijiFirst Government. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, post-pandemic Fiji is the fifth fastest growing economy in the world. May I repeat that, Fiji post-pandemic was the fifth fastest growing economy in the world. That is the solid footing that we handed over to the Coalition Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the challenge that I keep raising to Government, and of course, to the honourable Minister of Finance, the forecast for this year is already on a downward trend and the same for 2025. What is Government going to do? Are we going to see a positive growth in 2024 plus vast the 3.0 percent that has been forecasted because 5 percent to 7 percent in my assessment will be the acceptable footing that we would like to be in. That is the challenge for the honourable Minister of Finance. I will not go into the economic review because the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad has stated most of the issues in there. Of course, we understand there are external factors particularly the geopolitics, war that is happening, that affects us locally but what are we going to do with the influence that we can have on things that we can control? That is the challenge for Government, but the reality, Mr. Speaker, is in the expenditure. If you look at the six months expenditure, there are a few concerns.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> The forecasted expenditure is $4 billion-plus. They have only expanded $1.9 billion, well over 50 percent in their expenditure. So, when we are spending below the expenditure forecasted, we are denying the people the services that they deserve. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I say that again, we are denying the people the services that they deserve. Too much travel, too much consultations. Where are the tangible benefits that the people will experience out of the budget that we passed in this Parliament last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir? If I can just quickly go through a few, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Cost of living, you will hear it from</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>511 the honourable Member tomorrow. Cost of living is still increasing. Investments, although positive but it is going at a very slow rate. It is here in this economic report and we hope that we can create the environment so that there can be more in terms of investment. Debt, I will have to talk the debt. He is focussing now on reducing the debt to GDP ratio. Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now almost $1 billion has been added to our debt. That is when you include the TELS component loan that you have taken away. You had $600 million already last year and take away the TELS component is $1 billion already. He is very cunningly telling the people, hoodwinking the people that debt to GDP ratio has decreased but fiscal debt has increased. Do not hoodwink the people. The bottom line is the services to the people. Education, we talked about the redeeming of bus cards. The carriers in Tailevu are not operating. They wanted to stop because 11 weeks, honourable Prime Minister, the carrier operators in Wainibuka have not been paid. The money is not coming. We heard it from the honourable Minister for Agriculture yesterday, we heard it from the honourable Minister for Rural Development. The money needs to come to the Ministry so that they can perform. It is one thing to have a budget, it is one thing to tell us all the good things about the economy, but people want to enjoy the benefit. We set that on a solid footing, the challenge is on you now to take it to greater heights. Sustainable Aviation Fuel HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to present a Ministerial Statement that sets light on the transformative potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in standing at the forefront of aviation’s green revolution. The potential to strengthen those elements of the agricultural sector involved in the growth of biomass, the green technologies that process the biomass and those who build infrastructure that is needed in selected areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, commercial aviation’s climate change impact is complex, reflecting the variety of missions from operations at the surface up to cruise altitudes as high as 43,000 feet across continents and oceans and over varied time spans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, carbon dioxide is the primary contributor to aircraft emissions, accounting for around 70 percent of the exhaust. The gas mixes in the atmosphere with the same direct warming effect that occurs when it is emitted from other fossil fuel combustion sources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these global concerns in mind, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO convened a series of conferences on Aviation and Alternative Fuels to coordinate the deployment of alternative fuels in aviation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November 2009, ICAO convened the CAAF/1 in Rio de Janeiro. The conference endorsed the use of sustainable alternative fuels for aviation as an important means of reducing aviation emissions and established the ICAO Global Framework for Aviation Alternative Fuels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2009, significant progress has occurred, including more than 180,000 flights using a blend of SAF, six airports regularly distributing SAF, and evolution on the sustainability aspects of these fuels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to provide some context, sustainable aviation fuels are biofuels that have identical attributes to conventional jet fuel but have an 80 percent lower carbon footprint. Sir, SAF feedstock includes grain, oilseeds, sugarcane, agricultural leftovers, used cooking oil, biological</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>512</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 waste and animal fat. Ethanol which is a biofuel produced from plant-derived raw materials like sugarcane and cassava is a crucial component in the production of SAF. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to follow up on the developments on sustainable aviation fuels, ICAO organised a second conference in Mexico City in 2017 which endorsed 2050 ICAO vision for sustainable aviation fuels, calling on States, industry stakeholders and other entities to significantly substitute conventional aviation fuels with sustainable aviation fuels by 2050 or net zero carbon emissions (CO2) by 2050. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to find common ground and identify remaining discrepancies for outcome-oriented discussions at CAAF/3, ICAO in September 2023 held a pre-CAAF/3 outcomes consultation to solicit feedback from states on potential CAAF/3 results. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November 2023, ICAO hosted the third conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels on CAAF/3 in Dubai. The goal was to build an ICAO global framework in line with the no country left behind initiative, taking into account national situations and capabilities. I attended the CAAF/3 at the invitation of the President and the Secretary-General of ICAO. It was indeed an honour and privilege to be nominated and elected as Chairperson of CAAF/3, which was quite welcomed for Fiji. The conference was attended by 1,000 attendees from the four regions including more than 40 government ministers, government delegations from over 100 countries and representatives from more than 30 international and regional organisations, CEOs of major airlines, fuel production companies and aircraft manufacturers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, aligning the perspectives from the four regions of the world, each with different economic capabilities was indeed a challenging endeavour. The aim was to reach a resolution intended to be presented at the COP28 in Dubai a week after CAAF/3. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as chairperson of CAAF/3, I led the adoption of new ICAO Global Framework for SAF, lower carbon aviation fuels and other aviation cleaner energies. A collective vision for the clean energy transition, harmonised regulatory foundations, supporting implementation initiatives, and improved access to financing for related initiatives so that no country is left behind. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I wish to acknowledge the substantial contribution of honourable Koya who was part of Fiji’s delegation to the ICAO CAAF/3. His support and insights was indeed invaluable to our efforts, exemplifying bipartisan cooperation in our shared quest for sustainability in the aviation field. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the adoption of a new ICAO Global Framework for SAF, lower carbon aviation fuels and other aviation cleaner energies, Governments from over 100 States, in collaboration with the industry and civil society have established a target for aviation fuel in 2030 to be 5 percent carbon-intensive than the current fossil fuel. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scale-up of the development and the deployment of SAF, low carbon aviation fuels and other cleaner energies on a global basis, greater clarity, consistency and predictability to all stakeholders will be possible through the ICAO global framework. This presents a significant opportunity for Fiji, particularly concerning ethanol feedstock, given Fiji’s conducive environment for sugarcane and cassava production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that ADB is funding a feasibility study for Fiji Airways and Fiji Sugar Corporation for the production of ethanol from sugarcane and cassava. Sir, ADB being a Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) will be a key institution in developing SAF.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>513 Finance Sources and Institutions that will be key are: • • • • • • • Public Finance; Public Finance (Donors); Philanthropic Funding; Global International Financial Institutions; Other Multilateral Development Banks; Institutional Investors; and Private Investors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when talking with aviation professionals on SAF, I quipped that I never imagined Fiji Airways would be in dialogue with FSC about its future and likewise FSC with Fiji Airways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is currently a shortage of sustainable aviation fuels. It is necessary to greatly increase the amount of biological and non-biological resources which are the raw materials that are crucial to the SAF production chain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the transition will need to be rapid, scaling up supply of SAF from 7.9 billion litres in 2025 to potentially 449 billion litres by 2050. This is against the backdrop of the forecasted demand for jet-fuel at 1.9 trillion litres by 2050. This rapid deployment calls for huge capital, amounting into trillions and after CAAF/3, Mr. Speaker, Sir, indications are there that financial institutions are prepared to unlock the required capital. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey towards sustainability is laden with challenges, yet within these challenges, the opportunities for innovation and progress. Achieving economies of scale to bring down production costs and the high cost of specialised processing required for biofuels remains a primary challenge. Access to the fuel itself poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of SAF. Despite this, the aviation sector expects SAF to become more financially viable as demand for SAF grows and technology advances. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji it will mean the cultivation of cane and cassava that is unprecedented. Factor in the processing and we are looking at an industry that will transform our economy in significant ways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the corridors of this august Parliament where decisions shape destinies, we the policymakers wield a profound influence in steering the course of SAF adoption. It is imperative that we foster policies that nurture SAF deployment, policies that transcend borders and industries, policies that embrace technological neutrality and feedstock scepticism. Let us be the architects of change, crafting a path to progress guided by the principles of sustainability and equity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we navigate the complexities of SAF production and distribution, it is imperative to leverage the insights garnered from the outcomes of CAAF/3. The Conference adopted a global framework for cleaner energy in aviation, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and efforts to combat climate change. It underscores the aviation sector’s commitment to improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, with aspirations for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members of Parliament and fellow citizens, the journey towards sustainability has its challenges, yet it is also one filled with promise and possibility. The SAF is no longer just an idea from clever people in laboratory coats, it is a must for</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>514</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 low carbon travel. The industry players, passengers, farmers and the planet will all benefit from the technology. Let us make the aviation industry cleaner and greener, and let us start now. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just say first of, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the invitation that took across both of us to Dubai for this particular ICAO Conference. I think it is quite important to realise that this is not about politics, this was about Fiji. It was about the betterment of Fiji, and I think it is important that we do realise that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest fuel emission problems actually comes from commercial aviation, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel is something that should form a large component of the way forward with respect to how aviation fuels are dealt with. As pointed out by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, it is extremely important that we do something about it because it is a massive opportunity for Fiji. At the Conference itself, we saw that the whole of Africa was being given assistance by Europe, yet the Pacific was left behind, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji were the only representatives from the Pacific. So, this requires a conversation with Australia and New Zealand when we actually do this, this requires a conversation with our development partners as to how we can do it, because this falls in line with what we all speak about in terms of diversification. It could revolutionise our sugar industry. It is very important that we realise that. As a matter of fact, this particular Sustainable Aviation Fuel’s issue touches on three Ministries; the Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Sugar. It is very important that something is done now. I hope honourable Minister of Finance will also start looking at some provisions that can be made, maybe incentivise things from now about the development of these fuels, because it can mean a whole lot of income for Fiji. Fiji Airways is partially using these fuels, I understand also, they have flights that have gone across on totally Sustainable Aviation Fuels right across from the US into the Middle East. It is something that is moving forward at a very fast rate. We all are very hot- headed about the sugar industry from both sides of Parliament, but this is something that can actually turn the sugar industry around. It is something that needs to be desperately quickly looked at with respect to how we can actually develop this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also found at the Conference that there is a pushback from the larger fuel producing nations. If you look at Saudi Arabia and other fuel producing nations, there is still a pushback from them. They are not saying, “no”, but they are still looking at it in terms of how much can we do, how much should we do, and of course, it is only natural because they produce fuels. However, it is an opportunity that we may be able to capitalise on. As I said earlier on, the Pacific was only represented by Australia and New Zealand, and my conversations with them were that they would be happy to chat with us to see what can be done and get an infrastructure drawn up to see how we can benefit in terms of Fiji, and we are talking about Qantas and everyone else that might be involved. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it would not only be just for us, it is also for export, and if I could just quickly let you know, the price of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is quite high still. So you get a good return if you are actually producing these things, because it is quite high, it is still looked at or frowned upon. I am happy to hear that ADB is actually involved in getting this done and I really hope that the honourable Minister of Finance will start looking at maybe how we can actually incentivise this particular area. I am not sure if he can do it in this budget or the next budget, but at least start thinking about how we can actually do it. It is a very important aspect of our diversification that we actually talk about, and it helps three different Ministries. It is not just about sugarcane</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>515 producing ethanol, it is about cassava and many other different foods that it actually produces. We can do it. It is not something that cannot be done, we can do it. Once again, Sir, that is all I really have to say. I want to thank the honourable Viliame Gavoka for allowing us the opportunity to join him on the ICAO Conference. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, if I am to allow the learned Attorney-General to take the floor then he will go for his 20 minutes, but we need to take a break at 10.30 a.m. So, we will now take a break for tea and before we rise on this occasion, I invite the students and members of the public as well to join the honourable Members for tea in the Big Committee Room and hopefully enjoy the tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.21 a.m.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>516</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.00 a.m. Ministry of Justice HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and fellow Members of this august Parliament, members of the public in Parliament and those joining us virtually through livestream media; good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to emphasise the unwavering commitment of the Coalition Government to improve the lives of our citizens and lead our nation towards effective governance. Our administration is founded on the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency, which serves as the cornerstone of democracy. This commitment is reflected in our efforts to uphold the rule of law and ensure justice for our people. The Ministry of Justice is actively engaged in refining its business strategy and enhancing customer experiences through systematic feedback collection and deployment of quality management tools. We aim to ensure that our services are not only efficient but also customer centric. The Ministry is also developing a Strategic Development Plan for the next five years which will be aligned to the National Development Plan, focusing on leadership excellence, digital transformation, customer empowerment and fostering an enabling environment for engagement. We aim to bolster our capacity to address complex challenges and enhance stakeholders’ collaboration. The Ministry acknowledges the importance of preserving and accessing vital records and is in the initial stages of exploring ways to digitise its processes. The digitisation of our systems and processes will improve the accessibility and efficiency in processing requests to better service our customers. We have obtained a Cabinet approval to carry out digitisation works in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Communications, as well as other relevant stakeholders on the digitisation of our legal Registries, prioritising the Registrar of Titles Office. We are also shortening our processing times which, in the past, have taken up to three months. We have managed to significantly reduce our processing time to one month and reduce our response time to inquiries from one day to half-a-day. In our Birth, Deaths and Marriages Registry, we are looking at offering free birth certificates for registration made within a month of a child’s birth to incentivise early registration. We are also increasing accessibility to Justice of Peace (JP) services in our community. Currently, we have 596 JPs in total with 278 in the Central and Eastern Division, 215 in the Western Division and 68 in the Northern division. We expect to increase these numbers, given the number of applications we have received. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have gone through our awareness and talanoa session and reached out to members of the communities as the need for those former civil servants or those in the community to apply for JP so that they speed up the services. One good example is that in the island of Koro, there is only one JP, in the island of Gau, there is only one and in Levuka there are few. There is a misconception that there is a limited number of JPs in one locality. Through our talanaoa sessions and awareness, we hope to probably double the number of JPs this year, so that we can reach out to our citizens.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>517 Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to briefly highlights some of the significant work of the Government agencies under my responsibility. In October last year, the Fiji Corrections Service concluded its Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) for all positions. This is a significant achievement, as the last evaluation was done in 2006. The implementation of the JEE Report is in line with Government Staff Retention Policy that aims to align staff renumeration to the market rate. We hope to implement this during the financial year. In addition, the Fiji Corrections Service successfully held this year’s Yellow Ribbon Walk for the first time in Northern Division (Labasa) since its inception back in 2008. This is a milestone achievement, recording more than 3,500 participants, reflecting the community support for the rehabilitation initiative. The event raised awareness of the importance of rehabilitation through various activities and provided practical pathways for the reintegrating of our inmates into society with dignity and purpose. This event was held alongside Macuata Yellow Ribbon Symposium which established the Care Network Committee made up of the 12 heads of the Tikina representatives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, the Fiji Corrections Service recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Fiji National University to train and develop the Fiji Corrections Service staff to ensure their competency and enhance their productivity, as well as upskilling inmates with tools and opportunities to become more productive members of society when they are released. This is a significant milestone, as the two parties formalise their partnership. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is currently developing its five-year Strategic Plan which they plan to launch in early July. Unfortunately, this Office has not had any strategic plan for the past decade. This new initiative to formulate a strategic and intentional plan indicates the Office of the DPP will become more efficient each year as it focusses on delivering its constitutionally mandated role. The Office of the DPP is also focussed on cybercrime training due to the increase in cybercrime. The Office of the DPP will host a conference which will be held on 13 th June to 14 th of June, which is co-funded by the Council of Europe and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), to familiarise prosecutors with cybercrime and digital evidence in the region. The Office of the DPP also saw a significant increase in hard drug cases. Early this year, relevant authorities seized 4.1 tonnes of methamphetamine in Nadi that resulted in the arrest of 10 individuals. In March alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 33 people were charged with serious offences, including murder, aggravated robbery and attempted drug exportation. An interim board has been appointed to oversee the Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji (ACCF). The Coalition Government had agreed to review the function of ACCF. A new Board has been appointed to ensure that the ACCF statutory functions continue, while the review of its future takes place. The Board is currently chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Employment and the Acting Chairman is the Acting CEO of LTA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Attorney-General provides critical advisory role to the Government in ensuring policies and processes are legally compliant. To enable this, we have managed to secure funding for 24 positions which have subsequently been filled. Currently, for the next budget, we have made a submission to the Ministry of Finance for the recruitment of four more</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>518</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 lawyers in the Attorney-General’s Chambers. The Law Reform Commission which was previously located within the Office of the Attorney-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has now moved to its new designated Office beside Civic Towers. Based on its budgetary allocation, the Commission has also recruited legal officers and administrative staff to support its functions. The Ministry of Justice is also responsible for overseeing the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), as articulated yesterday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this moment to congratulate the new National Flying Fijians Head Coach of Fiji, Mr. Mick. Let me just, in my role as the Minister responsible for the Fiji Rugby Union (FRU), briefly highlight some of the work that has been done in terms of governance. As we speak, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have completed the work in terms of how financial management should be administered in the FRU. Currently, there is a draft constitution in circulation between some of the lawyers to be issued to all the unions. This was lacking all these years and we hope that in the next two months, the Interim Committee has until July to complete its work and then we will hand over to the new administrators of FRU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking on FRU, may I echo my observations in terms of the issue confronting FRU. Fiji and the Fiji Rugby Committee have worked hard in its efforts to advance the professional establishment of the Drua with its current distinguished standing, and I offer my best wishes for the Fijian Drua and Fijiana Drua on their game on Friday. I strongly emphasise the importance on facilitating the progression of local talents within the professional framework. In line with recent discussions held with World Rugby, it has become evident that there is a critical need to equip our local coaches with enhanced professional capabilities, especially in lead coaching environment. Hence, I kindly endorse the incorporation of our local coaches into the professional structure of Drua. This decision will not only elevate and boost the interest levels amongst our local coaches, but also foster the belief that they possess and the potential to coach high level professional teams in future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now briefly summarise a few key legislative initiatives that the Office of the Attorney-General is working on with relevant Government Ministries and Departments in order to bring this august Parliament proposed amendments and Bills: On the Anti-Doping Bill, Cabinet has approved the Anti-Doping Bill policy which requests the establishment of the anti-doping organisation to promote clean sports and ensure compliance with international anti-doping standards. To put this policy into action, the National Anti-Doping Bill has been drafted to provide a regulatory framework and programmes on Fiji’s compliance with international standards for doping in sports. We anticipate that this Bill will be tabled in Parliament by the third quarter of this year. On the Traditional Knowledge and Cultural Expression Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, traditional knowledge and cultural expressions are the foundation of intellectual property. Developing countries like Fiji must develop policies to protect intellectual property rights and preserve their cultural heritage. They can turn into commercially viable products and services for tangible and intangible wealth.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>519 However, the current system of accessing genetic resources and using traditional knowledge and cultural expressions has been repeatedly abused, exploiting the limited resources of indigenous societies. A legislative framework is needed to protect them. The Ministry of iTaukei and the Office of the Attorney-General will collaborate on consultations regarding the protection of traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions. Consultations on the draft Bill with relevant stakeholders is ongoing. It is part of the 2024 legislative programme and will be given priority for full realisation. On the Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services currently lack a guiding law that oversees their functions. As Fiji has experienced tropical weather due to climate change, a proper legal framework is necessity to protect lives and property. The Fiji Meteorological Services has been working on a draft Bill with our Office, which we anticipate will be tabled in Parliament by the third quarter of this year. On the Personal Insolvency Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this new Bill aims to replace the Bankruptcy Act 1944. The Bill offers an alternative bankruptcy, establishes a clear creditor and debtor rights and aligns with international best practices. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is collaborating all these projects by providing drafters who are familiar with insolvency systems worldwide. Cabinet approval is expected before holding public consultations in June with tabling in Parliament planned before the end of this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would like to give my congratulations to both the Ovalau Team and Ra Team that will be playing for the Vanua Quarterfinal at Nasau Park on Saturday, as well as the Under 20 of Ovalau and Taveuni. May the best team wins. Vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the Leader of Opposition or his designate, I would like to mention a few issues that you raised since you have also reported in Parliament on FRU decisions, policies, et cetera. Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge members of the public sitting in the gallery, especially Mr. Rasova and Mr. Rajesh Singh, the two stalwarts of rugby. They are very crazy rugby enthusiasts. The Kadavu President is sitting behind them. Why I am saying this, honourable Attorney General, it is so nice to hear you relay the current position of the FRU because what we had encountered on our way to Dubai to attend the COP 28 meeting was the Fiji Team. They slept on the corridors of the airport. There was no money. They did not have the warm up and warm down clothing that was required and then I was asked to deliver the jerseys to them before they played and that is what they wore during their warm up, right through the game and they lost. As soon as they lost, I stood up and walked out because I am a bad loser. I always want to win. Honourable Attorney General, it will be grateful if you take note of that because that was what the Coach Ben Gollings, Vili Satala and the rest of the team encountered whilst in Dubai. It is a sad occasion, being highly placed in the Sevens ranking, yet they had to sleep on the veranda of the airport in Sydney because when the last aircraft comes in, soon after that, they close down. Everyone has to go outside, including the Fiji Team that was inside. Yet when we arrived in Dubai, they were glorified again. “Oh no! These people have just woken up from the veranda of the airport outside.” So, again, it places the team in a very awkward situation and whilst the Team is written all over the place as the best, yet this is what they are encountering and that affects their morale. We know as rugby players, once your morale is affected, 100 percent performance is not there.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>520</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 I will offer the floor now to the honourable Leader of Opposition or his designate, to make their response. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Attorney General. From the outset, this side of Parliament in hearing the honourable Attorney General’s response this morning, it is too broad - covering many various Ministries that come under him. It shows that the honourable Attorney General has been sleeping on the job for too long. (Laughter) If that Ministerial Statements would have been divided into two parts, probably in the last sitting and this week’s sitting, it would have come in various simple topics. But he has covered a lot, it shows that he has not been doing his work and also his core responsibility is to Parliament and that is the Bills. The honourable Attorney General’s response this morning is full of hollow promises. He has talked about good governance, transparency and efficiency but what the public has seen so far is the exact opposite. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- …especially in terms of the Attorney-General’s performance, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If you talk about transparency, people are saying in the social media that the honourable Attorney-General is under investigation. People are saying whether the honourable Attorney- General should step aside if he needs to preach about transparency. He needs to start with the Principal Legal Advisor of Government, if we are to talk about good governance. Sir, there is also a view from the public that given the honourable Attorney-General holds a very important office, that there is an element of interference. I am not saying that the honourable Attorney-General is interfering with their own cases but, again, due to transparency, there needs to be checks and balances and this is what the people are saying. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The honourable Attorney-General also needs to think nationally:</span></p><p>He is too focussed on Lomaiviti all its islands. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, remember Lomaiviti has nightclubs. (Laughter) HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- In terms of consultation in the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with other Bills, I hope that the honourable Attorney-General moves around Fiji in the14 Provinces and Rotuma to do his consultation before he brings the Bills into Parliament. There has also been a complaint from the public in terms of the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF). I think there was no Board for the last few months and there is a slow in</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>521 payout. So, I hope the honourable Attorney-General puts a Board in place so that people are effectively and efficiently served from what he has alluded to this morning. I welcome the Job Evaluation Exercise for the Ministry of Justice and also the Fiji Corrections Service which is quite outstanding. They have been bringing up their issues to the Opposition as well and even the Committee when they moved around to the Correctional Centres in the last few months. I hope that it comes in the next financial year, honourable Attorney-General. You have to convince the honourable Minister of Finance, given its very important. Not only that we support the Yellow Ribbon project and the road to acceptance, but the important thing too is to see that we retain our Correction Officers that we are losing to new Zealand and Australia given the staff turnover that we have. Mr Speaker, Sir, in regards to FRU, we had plenty issues when the interim committee came in, you were very vocal at that time honourable Attorney-General. But now, people are complaining about this selection of the new Flying Fijians Coach. The very people who had supported you when you brought in this interim committee are not happy with the selection. I do not know what is really wrong, whether we are not complying to IRB standards, these are some of the things that you look into. For the Fijian Drua initiative, that was started by the FijiFirst Government and thank you for continuing it. But for your core functions, I hope the Bills that you have outlined this morning will come under Standing Orders 83 and 84. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- You have first reading, second reading and third reading, and then go into Committee of the whole. That is something that needs to be seen and you have not done that. Even in the last sitting, you have been bringing in Bills that are under Standing Order 51. Mr. Speaker, will be very much aware that he had presented a Bill back in 2005 and 2006 then in the previous Parliament where it came through Standing Orders 83 and 84 - First Reading, Second Reading, committed into Standing Committee and come back into Clause by Clause before we go into Third Reading. I hope that you bring those Bills under those right procedures, and we look forward for Bills to come in a timely manner and also they do not come in the shortcut manner. I hope that Government has taken what the Opposition have said this morning and to be more transparent, more efficient and practice good governance. State of Immigration Services HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Ministers, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, my colleague honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament and my fellow Fijians; first of all, before I speak on the topic for which my Ministerial Statement is based today, I would like to take a short moment to share with Parliament an event that is happening right now at the RSL Club, where the honourable Prime Minister is joining the members of the RFMF’s current and ex-serving members, particularly those who served with the first Battalion Fiji Infantry Regiment as part of Bat19 on 18 th April, 1996. Today, they are remembering an event which is widely referred to as Operation Grapes of Wrath of the wrath of God. During this incident, the headquarters of the Fiji Battalion in United</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>522</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was bombarded. I was the Site Commander or the Tactical Commander of that camp, and commanding us was Colonel Waqanivavalagi, who I believe is there today. Our Contingent Commander was Colonel Raivoce. I was the Battalion Adjutant and the OC of the battalion headquarters company and Tactical Commander of the camp in Qana. During that incident or shelling by the IDF, it killed approximately 200 men, women and children that were under our care. In it, six Fijian soldiers were seriously injured. This is very much an unknown event, and today these soldiers are here to remember this event. It reminds us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of war in the world today and the price of peace. It is something that we should always strive for. Every morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you recite a prayer for all on our behalf, that is, you pray for peace in Fiji and the world. Today is the day we remember the sacrifice of those who gave their lives to be able to give us all a favourable condition to live in the world today. I wish them well and a blessed day of remembrance to all our ex-servicemen who are there today, particularly, the members of the Bat19 of 1FIR UNIFIL. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to inform Parliament of measures recently taken by our Ministry to address the current challenges faced by us, first on the issues of passport to Fijian citizens, and second, on the delays in processing work permits. We have taken note of the significant public and media criticism for our performance in these two areas. It is appropriate that I inform Parliament of the current situation and the actions that we are taking. On the matter of passport issues, for a good part of 2023 and for all of 2024, Fiji has faced an unprecedented movement of its people to jobs abroad, some of its permanent migration and some of it for temporary work. Australia and New Zealand, in particular have opened their borders in a way we have never previously seen in order to obtain the workforce that they need. Our people have responded in their thousands to the work opportunities created. There is also increased demand for leisure and other travels by Fiji citizens, all of which requires them to obtain or renew passports. We have tried to anticipate increased demand for Department of Immigration services since last year. The Department had outgrown its previous offices and undertook a planned move to new offices in Suva last month. This, of course, disrupted our services to passport applications which has compounded the already challenging situation. Mr. Speaker, for the information of Parliament, the volume of passport applications has increased sharply since 2021 and are now between 4,000 and 6,000 passports per month. The Department is responding to the demand despite the challenges. We face a number of systems problems with printing, computer networks and other exceptional circumstances in the face of this unprecedented demand. Mr. Speaker, there was some publicity recently when it was reported that passport applicants were queueing up for service as early as 4 a.m. daily. We have responded by opening up our offices as early as 6 a.m. to accommodate them and on some days beginning the registration process as early as 7 a.m. We are planning to open also on Saturday mornings. We have suffered challenges with a smaller number of passports which are applied for through our overseas missions, some systems issues are causing delays for about 250 of these applications and we are moving now to address these. It is important to note that despite the difficulties we face, we are delivering passports to most applicants within five to seven working days, urgent passport applications are processed within two to three working days. By any standard around the world, this is quick processing. We have identified the problems we are facing and the resources we need. We have had the support of both, the Ministry of Finance which has given us more money for staff and overseas donors helping us with process improvements. So overall, Mr. Speaker, we should see a general improvement in services in the next few months.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>523 Mr. Speaker Sir, I now turn to work permit applications. The outflow of our people has created an unprecedented demand for expatriate labour at all levels. This ranges from tertiary educated professionals, and managerial employees to trades people, to construction workers and all categories in between. We are receiving work permit applications at the rate of 500 to 800 per month. I will shortly be issuing a policy direction pursuant to 44(4) of the Immigration Act 2003 to take immediate steps to address the current backlog on the issues of work permits. This message, Mr. Speaker, I intended to take effect on 1 st May, 2024 although some are already in place. I recognise the current backlog of two to four months in the processing of work permit applications, sometimes longer, is threatening economic growth and investor confidence. This has been highlighted by both the business community and a number of authoritative official sources as Fiji’s most critical short term economic. Our policy actions takes time to work through the system. If decisions are not taken now, it will be too late to change Fiji’s 2024 economic growth trajectory. The loss of skills in all areas slows economic activity, it also delays the capital expenditure. Construction is critical to economic growth and to generating economic activity from completed projects such as hotels, retail centres and private facilities. At a higher functional level without accountants, engineers, IT and other professionals, essential analytical work is stalled and adds to the lead time to establishing the feasibility and design of major public and private sector projects. However, even at lower level of skills, the construction industry being the best example, employment of expatriates is critical. This is one of the challenges the Government is facing in ensuring efficient capital investment in its own capital expenditure programme under the national budget with the resulting losses to public welfare. Fiji employers are competing with other destinations for expatriate employees. They complain that after incurring the time and cost of recruitment and documenting employment contracts, they lose their nominated employees to other countries because of the wait for their Fiji permits. They cannot see things improving so they prefer to sell their future investment projects or even scale down their current activities until things improve. So, we have taken note of these issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to recognise that the business and investment community must see that action is being taken now. Medium term actions we are taking, the urgent need for skills will continue for some years Mr. Speaker, Sir, so long term measures are needed to ensure things do not get worse than they are. Work is being done with the Growth Reset Sub-Committee of Immigration Investment to simplify permit forms and requirements of future applications. This will mean simpler form filling and shorter processing likely to be implemented by the end of June. The 2024-2025 Budget will fund more processing staff at the Department of Immigration and the Government of Australia is supporting the Department with training and document management system. However, these measures will not necessarily address the current backlog, there are approximately 1,000 applications for work permits in the system requiring processing and this must be moved out now. Our immediate measures to clear the current backlog: Delegated powers, the first step we have taken as a Department is to ensure that the Director of Immigration holds delegated powers from the Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs to deal with work and investor permits. This should speed up processing as it eliminates one additional level of authority in the Immigration system and avoid duplication of effort. Eliminating delays in key processing, we have also taken steps to better manage payment processes in the Department. Previously, it took some time for application sheet payment to be processed which demanded Immigration Department officers from beginning work on the relevant</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>524</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 application. A new process is being followed now where processing of the application begins immediately and does not await the issue of revenue receipt. Of course, all payments must be processed and verified before any work permit is issued but the payment process is now running in parallel with the application process, not one after the other. The expedition for work permit applications promoted by qualified employers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of medium-term measures referred to in the paragraph above, the Director of Immigration will compile and issue a qualified employer list. The qualified employer list will comprise employers who in the reasonable opinion of the Director have a good track record as employers are capable of supporting compliance with work permit conditions and whose employees have not breached permit conditions or laws relating to immigration. There are one or two other criteria, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but these are the main ones. Any employer may apply by letter to the Director to be listed as qualified employer. The qualified employer list will be regularly reviewed and updated by the Director. This will take a little time for some employers, and we ask for their patience while we bet down the new system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want us to briefly talk about how qualified employer applications are to be made and processed. The precise criteria for an application promoted by a qualified employer must be left flexible in the discretion of the Director to ensure that the Director is free to act in the most facilitative way. However, we intend in the case of qualified employer application to have a streamlined process that does not require proof of local advertising or evaluation of local candidates. Provided there is a properly completed application form, an employment contract and satisfactorily police and health clearances, these applications will receive priority processing. Other streamlining measures to be announced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the measures I had mentioned are the first in a series of further streamlining measures we intend to rollout. We are currently reviewing a quicker process for applicants of offshore employers who are required to visit Fiji as part of their overseas employees’ requirements. We also intend to look at a streamlined process for employees of the so-called crop agencies, that is, the agencies who are members of the Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, once these measures are taken, we will be looking at easing the work permit processes for spouses or permit holders and accredited diplomats and then moving on a faster process for volunteer permits. There is a concentrated plan of action to speed up the processing of work permits, and I wish to assure Parliament, affected employers and of course permit holders themselves, that we are working on this as fast as we can. Immigration is always a sensitive area. We must respect our obligations to Fiji citizens, and we must also take into account national security and other boarder control matters in making immigration decisions. However, we recognise a clear economic reward that is available if we can make our processes more efficient. We are seriously focussed on those outcomes. Mr. Speaker, before I sit down, I would like to acknowledge some of the sentiments that were echoed in Parliament earlier this morning coming particularly from the honourable Leader of the Opposition about the benefits of economic growth. It is the only thing really that as we as a nation, if we do not have are unable to look after our people. I, as a person responsible for our national security will do all within my best to ensure that our people are safe particularly under the initiatives that we offer as a Government, but we recognise as well that security is also enabled by making sure that our people have got money in their pockets and have got jobs where they can earn and look after their families. So, it is my job to make sure that my Ministry allows, that Government allows these two very important aspects of our society to work</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>525 together and be mindful that we need to continue to look after our country and its security whilst at the same time create opportunities for our people in creating work and generating particularly money and wealth to look after their families. With those few words, Sir, thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to share with you in Parliament the initiatives that we are taking and I ask for the support of Parliament on this initiative and as rightfully acknowledged, particularly all the time by the other side of Parliament, we need to work together to make things work because the benefits of this can only be for our people. It is not cast in concrete, we will continue to review it to make sure our systems are safe and that our people have the opportunity to look after their own families. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for his statement on the improvements to the immigration service and I wish the Department well in the changes that he has outlined and hopefully it will improve the services with immigration from where it is now and drastically improving for the better. When we look at immigration service, a big part of it is counter service when we are looking after the visa, permits, I think there are 19 permits that they issue and the passport services - ordinary, official and diplomatic services. One thing with the Department of Immigration is, you need hands, you need people because at the end of the day most of the work that they do, they need to see the persons standing in front of them when they are making decisions or when they are issuing either passports or permits. But the other big part of immigration work is also enforcement. In addition to them being a conduit to economic growth, I agree with what the honourable Minister said, they have a big role to filter out the unwanted, those that we would not want to come into our country and cause us trouble. In my last travel when I came out from Immigration, I was talking to the Immigration Officer at Nadi Airport and he was only one. There was only one moving back and forth from arrival, if there was a case in arrival or at departure and he was complaining to me, “I am the only one available.” He has to go between arrivals and departure to deal with the cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 500 to 800 work permits per month shows the number of foreigners who are wanting to come into our country to work because work permits are only for non-citizens, those that want to come in. Therein lies this problem of human trafficking. I raise my concern on this business visa where they come on business visa and just go to work and they are allowed to work, and given the enforcement agency also, how do you track it? Who is coming on a business visa and working? Who is responsible for them? I was surprised when the honourable Minister for Sugar said that he had brought in a few people to come and work for him from Bangladesh in his sugar plantation, but then he said that if they do not find work with him, they can go and work in another farm and I know that is not allowed in Immigration policies. The person that brings them in, you cannot just send them away again and go and work somewhere else because there is a responsibility of those that brought them in. I am not too sure which permit they are coming in, but I think that needs to be checked as well.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to warn, for passports, if you hold it for a while, passports are not being issued but applications are still coming in, and one thing I have found is, once you start again, the supply just goes out very quickly. I hope that you are going to restock as to cater for that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Carbon Trade and Fiji’s Emission Reduction Payment Agreement HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>527 fellow Fijians who are sitting in the gallery; ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir... MR. SPEAKER.- Come again?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Sometimes I do not get what you are saying. It is like a fishhook in the fish mouth. HON. K. V. RAVU.:</span> I would like to present my Ministerial Statement on Carbon Trade and Fiji’s Emission Reduction Payment Agreement (ERPA), which Government signed in January 2021 with the Carbon Fund of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) that is managed by the World Bank. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that I first explain the arrangements with the FCPF, as there has been a lot of unqualified and baseless assessments and claims that, if left unanswered, could tarnish the enormous work that my Ministry has toiled to get Fiji to where it is today with regards to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Programme (REDD+) Programme, and its long standing work arrangement with the FCPF. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCPF is a global partnership of governments, businesses, civil society and indigenous people focussed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable means and predetermined intervening programmes from within the agriculture, forestry and other land-use sectors, widely known as REDD+. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCPF, operating under the guidance of the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has a funding portfolio of US$1.3 billion of which: • US$400 million was devoted to supporting 47 countries, including Fiji, to complete its REDD+ readiness work. Fiji received US$5.8 million for its readiness work, which was completed in 2022. • US$900 million is to fund Emission Reduction Payment Agreement of 15 countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, proudly, Fiji is one of the 15 countries that have taken the bold step to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Collectively, the 15 countries have pledged to reduce emission by 145 million tonnes by 2025, which is equivalent to removing 32 million cars of the road for a year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s contribution to this global pledge is a net emission reduction of 2.5 million tonnes. As a Small Island Developing State, this is something that is worthy of mention, and the gist of Fiji’s REDD+ work to date. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Carbon Trade Agreement with the FCPF-Carbon Fund is basically to pilot the result-based payment arrangement, and the rate of US$5 per tonne under this Agreement was established well before other carbon markets that are offering a much higher price, which is beginning to stir discussions and unsettle our landowners and forest dwellers. At this juncture, I must acknowledge the World Bank and the FCPF for progressing Fiji’s REDD+ work through funding and technical support.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>528</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the arrival of foreign interest to our shores can also be taken as an indication of Fiji’ state of readiness to trade. However, it is important that, first, Fiji must complete and fulfil the terms and conditions of existing Emission Reduction Payment Agreement with the FCPF Carbon Fund, and learn from the valuable lessons to better prepare for future markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Emission Reduction Programme under Fiji’s REDD+ was primarily designed to, firstly, reduce greenhouse gas emission and reduce global warming and, secondly, to provide an innovative and alternative source of sustainable financing to: (a) Protect the environment and promote the importance of trees and forests through the natural (b) landscape; support the development and meet the welfare needs of the landowners, forest owners and forest dwelling communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the assessments of the net emission cover Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and Taveuni. This means that all interests within the three islands can participate in the national programme. The Ministry has received reports of communities being unhappy of the Government’s boldness to commit their land under the Carbon Trade Agreement without their prior consent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the case. The rights of the landowner remain intact and without question. A forest or land will only be considered under this arrangement through a formal lease issued by the relevant leasing authority. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is always the responsibility of Government to safeguard the people when a new and novel approach that can potentially impact their lives, like carbon trade, appears, and the Ministry will do so by: • • • Developing the framework; Acquiring a clearer and greater understanding of the dynamics of the carbon market; and Establish right platforms for engagement, as it is currently pursuing under the Carbon Trade Agreement with the FCPF-Carbon Fund. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits from the carbon payment must be meaningful and have a longer and lasting impact on the lives and welfare needs of the landowner. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry is working with the honourable Ministry of iTaukei Affairs to reach out to the landowning and forest dwelling communities with the intention of: • • • Providing the right information and advice through raising awareness; assist in the planning and required preparatory work and provide the necessary training; and most importantly support the Village Improvement Scheme which is meaningful and has a longer lasting impact on the welfare needs of the present and future generations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has programmes that supports, synergises and complements the Emission Reduction Programme, for example, the: • • • National Tree Planting Programme under the RDF 30 million trees; establishment of eco-park and eco-tourism; and cottage industry venture.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>529 To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to advise the general public, especially the landowning communities, that the Ministry’s goal through its national programmes are focused on: • • bettering the lives of all, particularly, the marginalised communities with very little options and opportunities; and protecting the environment from in-discriminant exploitation of the forest and land resources. May God Bless Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I thank you for that statement. Just in terms of clarity, we raised this when we were in the Opposition. You are talking about something that is based on something per dollar and then the cost of carbon. We are talking about air here, free air coming from the forest when it breathes out. Something new has come up again, it is the first time that I have heard it, that it is going to be leased. Most of these areas are regarded as forestry areas that are not supposed to be leased, they are protected forest. Honourable Bulitavu knows fully well how they say it in our side of the world, "ivei na i sau ni cagi? Sir, that is the issue here because when you were speaking, it is like you were speaking in a different atmosphere and we are in a separate world and it is hard for me to understand. How can I interpret what you are saying to the people who own the resources? You mentioned Taveuni is involved and a few islands in Vanua Levu but, Sir, we are simply at a loss here. Would the Government be able to clarify this a bit more so that we better understand what you are telling us. Now, we understand after so many things have been undertaken that the land are going to be leased. Once you lease it, it is gone, you forgo all that. What do we get in return? The free air? Free air is given by God. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, you come from our side of the world, I do not know whether you understand the meaning of this? You come from Vanua Levu. (Laughter) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just because I come from Vanua Levu, I would like to explain what the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was trying to explain. The question that you have asked, Mr. Speaker, is all about carbon sequestration. It is a process whereby it is not about how much carbon is emitted but it is about how much carbon is absorbed by a particular acre of forest. So, the amount of carbon sink per acre or hectare will be calculated in tonnes and that tonne will be sold to someone or some company, for example, sitting in Australia or somewhere abroad who are emitting carbon. So, that is what carbon trading is all about. The reason why I am well-versed with this is, again, the honourable Minister missed this particular point, that this carbon trading is part of the Climate Bill that is now the Climate Change Act that was endorsed by this Parliament back in 2021 after which that Agreement was signed for five years. So, it is all about how much carbon sink is there for a particular land or forest that is going to be leased out under this Agreement. I also remember there was some confusion when this Bill was introduced and some Members of Parliament thought that we will have to go and fill carbon in a can or something and then trade it.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>530</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 It does not actually work like that, it is all about how much carbon sink is there. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Who are the MPs? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- You were part of that particular group, so you would know those MPs. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, as you might be aware that carbon trading is part of the Climate Change Act, there is a huge stock of forest that is available for carbon trading in Fiji. So, having a lot of stock available, that can be deposited for the carbon trading. We were the first country to domesticate the Paris Agreement in the form of Climate Change Act which allowed the landowning units to get involved in carbon trading, but the condition was they need to upgrade the current stock before it can be compensated or used for carbon trading. So, if you have a particular forest, it is not that you just go to iTLTB and lease it out for carbon trading. There are terms and conditions, such as, you need to encourage reforestation. So, if there is a space available within the forest, you need to actually encourage reforestation. You need to discourage deforestation on the land that you lease out. You cannot have logging going on one side and then allow the land on the other side to be leased out for carbon trading. The other thing, Mr. Speaker, which is very important and is part of the terms and conditions is undisturbed ecosystem. So, it is not that the resource owners will not be able to utilise any resource that is available, but you can only utilise resources that does not have a drastic effect on the ecosystem. Lastly, the conservation of endangered species, Mr. Speaker. If there is any endangered species that is part of that forest, you need to protect that. Any lease agreement that is given to the landowning unit, you have to follow or go through these terms and conditions before you can lease out your piece of land for carbon trading. Mr. Speaker, there needs to be a five-year carbon budget for the purpose of planning the whole of economies emission reduction as part of accumulative effort to achieve net zero gas emission by 2015. As per the Act, Mr. Speaker, carbon budget was supposed to be determined before 31 st March, 2023 for the period 1 st January, 2026 to 31 st December, 2030 which, I believe, at this point in time, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is not aware of because we have not receive any carbon budget in this Parliament for one whole year now. And for this to come into effect and that particular agreement to be renewed, this is one of the terms and conditions that has to be passed. The carbon budget has to be passed by Parliament. Mr. Speaker, we also need to assist the landowners to upgrade the stock of forest that they have so that it meets the criteria to be utilised for carbon trading. Carbon trading is a huge industry whereby landowning units in Fiji can really benefit from, but the Ministry needs to do much more to allow our resource owners to benefit from this programme. Mr. Speaker, lastly, we need to assist landowning units financially because they do not have such capital which is needed to cater for the development of the forest in order to engage in carbon trading. So, we expect the Government to bring a separate budget to allow and help landowning Units to upgrade their forest so that they can lease out their forest for carbon trading, Mr. Speaker.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>531 MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member. It is very interesting, and I hope the Government will do more in trying to explain that because we had you live when you were delivering your Statement. That is why I have raised that point, honourable Minister, and to the Government, the Deputy Prime Ministers and the honourable Attorney-General. We have a sad precedent case where millions of dollars were paid to the landowners in Monasavu after a long time. They fought their case in foregoing the area that was taken under the water catchment. It was never leased, nothing was paid, but the landowners cannot touch it. They cannot harvest their forests and all, so millions of dollars have been paid to some trust account. The landowners are still fighting over that money that was paid. That was the court’s decision. Here, I only hope that the Government wakes up to that. From what has been said by honourable Maharaj, no budget has been prepared and all that. I do not know about the legislation, is there any legislation?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It is yet to commence:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- That is interesting:</span> Au qai kerea ga Minisita, na lawa e sega tiko. Maybe, we need to address that as well. We need to give more time to this topic.</p></body>
