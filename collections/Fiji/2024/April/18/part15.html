<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – ENERGY FIJI LIMITED 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – ENERGY FIJI LIMITED 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the followings: (a) Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 Annual Report which was tabled on 23 rd November, 2023; and (b) Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2022 Annual Report which was tabled on 23rd November, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports in November 2023. In its findings, the Committee noted that Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) faced unprecedented challenges in 2021 due to COVID-19, particularly the second wave of the pandemic which significantly impacted EFL’s electricity demand. The Committee noted and increase in the number of domestic customers, benefiting from subsidies provided by EFL, especially after 2020, and acknowledges EFL for this initiative, given that several customers were affected by the pandemic. While deliberating on the 2022 Annual Report, the Committee noted that EFL managed to make a healthy profit despite the various challenges and unforeseen expenses that it had to endure during the financial year, and commends the team at EFL for maintaining its financial soundness. Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering the Government’s commitment to climate change, the Committee noted that the 2021 Annual Report on the importance of EFL embarking on renewable energy site projects, and strongly recommended for the inclusion of key stakeholders, such as landowners in their land acquisition process. It also recommended that all efforts must be made to ensure that the pending Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is expedited to achieve the current targets for 100 percent renewable energy by 2036. The Committee noted in the 2022 Annual Report that EFL’s existing risk mitigation strategies provided substantial support to the company during the adverse impact of COVID-19. This included strategies to address the disruption in EFL supply chain, and the minimising of the effects of rising fuel costs through its hedging programme. It was noted with concern the damages to EFL’s infrastructure which occurred due to various reasons, such as motor vehicle accidents that damage power poles, overgrown vegetation clashing with powerlines, third party and damage to EFL underground cables and vandalism of EFL assets. The Committee urges members of the public to be mindful of EFL’s infrastructure to ensure that they continue receiving undisrupted electricity. The Committee observed the need for FCCC to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical aspects of EFL’s regulatory functions, such as the registration of licensed electricians and ensuring standard compliance is met. In this regard the Committee recommended FCCC to recruit necessary expertise required to regulate the services of EFL.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>553 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 While deliberating the Committee noted a slow increase in the use of solar rooftop installations and, of course, encourages the use of solar-powered products by domestic and commercial customers as an alternative to reduce their dependence on fossil fuel in the 2021 Annual Report. The Committee was made aware of EFL’s loss of 54 technical employees for greener pastures overseas. Given that EFL is an essential service provider, it is imperative to further develop strategies to entice the technical employees from moving overseas. Multiple renewal energy projects are in the pipeline at present, however, the Committee is concerned that our national targets to meet 100 precent renewable energy electricity by 2036 might not be achievable. While hearing submissions from various applicants who intended to invest in the renewable energy programmes, their applications were rejected. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I do offer the floor, I have a list before me of those who will be participating in the debate: 1. Honourable Jone Usamate; 2. Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 3. Honourable S. T. Koroilavesau; 4. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to congratulate the honourable Members of the Committee for the Report. In short, I am quite pleased to see that despite all the kinds of difficulties that it faced, EFL has come through quite well, despite the damage to its property, the huge loss of technical staff and the kinds of damage that happens to it. I have also noted, in particular, how they have been able to mitigate against the risks that they face, such things as the hedging programme, which I think that a lot of companies in Fiji can learn from, all of us can learn on how we can mitigate the risk that we have. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in going through the reports, I have noticed the strong financial record of the EFL, the Action Management and the Grid Risk Management that they had, and I think in terms of their governance system, a great use of Committees in the Board. I think this was a great example of seeing how this is taking place. Looking at the HR aspects of EFL, despite the fact that they lost quite a lot of staff, they seem to have a very good strong pipeline of making sure that they have people in place to be able to take care of the kind of work that is being done by the people who have left. They have ongoing recruitments, they also still have a strong apprenticeship scheme, I believe it is still operational, and they hire graduate engineers. I read in the Report that they had implemented a succession plan for all positions from Tradesman Team Leader to the CEO. I think that is very admirable. It shows that, we know that things are going to happen, but we do not just sit and cry about it, they identify high potential people and they have a programme to put them through, so if that person goes, there is someone who can take up the kind of role that the person who has left used to take. So I think that is something that they need to be congratulated for. I have also noted during COVID-19, we asked a lot of organisations in Fiji to pitch in and help residents of our country to get through COVID-19. Looking through the Reports, I noticed that EFL’s contribution to the low income earner from April 2020 to March 2021 during COVID-19 was</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 554 around $6.77 million. This was the kind of assistance they gave to the people that they used their services. So a very big vinaka va levu to EFL for what they have done in that area. I noticed also with appreciation the Rural Electrification Programme that has been funded by the Government, where they extend the grid up to rural areas to care for rural dwellers. During our time in government, we removed the requirements to pay the deposit that communities had to pay before, but this has brought electricity to people out in the rural areas. I think if there is one area for concern, and we get these complaints every now and then, is the delays in getting their electricity completed, whether it is putting up the poles or hooking up the electricity from the poles to each of the individual houses, that is the kind of complaint we get every now and then. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to speak to a few recommendations for both of the Reports. For the Report of 2021: Recommendation 1: The Committee noted the need for FCCC to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical aspects of EFL’s regulatory functions such as the registration of licenced electricians and ensuring compliance with standards. The Committee recommends for FCCC to recruit necessary expertise to undertake the full range of regulatory functions. I totally endorse this particular recommendation, Sir. At the moment EFL plays the role of a player and a referee at the same time. It has been like that because in the past we did not have the technical expertise around the country to be able to separate out these roles, but in order to have any good governance in any sector, we need to be able to separate these roles; the role of the player and the role of the referee. I commend this but I know it is not going to be easy to do because there is not a lot of these technical people around. They will have to come up with some innovative ways of separating out the functions and still have access to technical expertise, whether it is from the private sector, whether it is from the institutes of higher learning, somehow that they can do that, but we need to move to that level where we separate out these two roles of player and referee. Recommendation 6: The Committee noted that stakeholders such as the Department of Energy under the Ministry of Public Works, EFL and FCCC need to have strong collaborations and recommends that there be clarity in their functions and their roles. I also totally endorse this particular recommendation. The energy sector or the electricity sector which is part of the energy sector has three major players. EFL is the provider, FCCC is the regulator, the Department of Energy it seems to have a mix kind of roles. One part of it is very operational, where it does the solar home systems, where it does the energy efficiencies, it identifies potential sites for hydro and wind power and the other part of it is more policy formulation. I just come up with things like the National Energy Policy. To my mind, the establishing policy should be something that always should sit in government, policy looking forward should always sit in government. I think that role of policy setting for the sector as a whole needs to sit with the Department of Energy. It is something that I talked to the department at that time that we need to build it up and I think moving forward, we need to strengthen this role where the Department of Energy is given the right kind of people so that they can sit at that policy role looking for a</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>555 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 benchmarking around the world and deciding what the direction should be for the sector so that it is not led by the players. That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse that particular recommendation. I have not seen the final version of the National Energy Policy that has been approved by Cabinet unfortunately, but I am familiar with the 2021 version that has been together while I was there, which calls for a higher level of involvement and coordination by DOE across the whole energy sector. As I said, the Government must keep the policy controlled to itself, can give up regulatory but the policy must be with the government, so it has oversight, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Report for Year 2022, I found one finding in particular which was of interest to me, Finding No. 5. The Committee is aware that multiple renewable energy permits are in the pipeline at present, however the Committee is concerned that our national targets to ensure 100 percent renewable electricity by 2036 might not be achievable. That, I think should be a concern for all of us. I will come back to talk about that particular finding because it appears again in one of the recommendations at the bottom. Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends for EFL to raise awareness on the benefits of installing roof-top solar plants as well as incentivise such initiatives. I would propose that the honourable Minister of Finance might look at ways in which we can incentivise our citizens to put solar panels onto their roofs so that we can reduce the amount of electricity we get out of fossil fuels. Recommendation 7: The Committee is of the view that a detailed enquiry is needed in the energy sector to ensure EFL embark on attaining a 100 percent renewable energy by the Year 2030. You will notice that one part of the Report talks about 2036, the other part talks about 2030. That is because one is quoting from the NDCs, the other was quoting from what National Climate Change Policy. But the thing is this, we as a country are one that fights for climate change. It is very important for us as a country when we go out in the world that there is coherence with everything that we say everywhere, there is also coherence between what we say on the global stage and what we do at home. So, I think this is something that we really need get together with, if we are not going to hit 2030, I do not think it might be possible for us to hit 2030 unless we get those Namosi hydros in very quickly; the three big ones that are still stalled for the time being. But if not, we need to shoot for 2036. How can we hit that target? So, when we hit that target, we stand on a global stage and we talk about reducing emissions, we have done it here, by getting at least our electricity 100 percent renewable. We already have a lot of things that we have put in place, the Low Emissions Development Strategy, the Maritime and Land Transport Strategy that talked about efficio vehicles, reducing fossil fuel consumption, National Adaptation Plan that looked at creating a long term resilient strategy for the energy sector underpinned by Climate Risk Model and the National Climate Change Policy. Those are my recommendations from the Reports. The last things that I will say, Mr, Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the extra minutes. I also think the energy sector is one when we look at them and commit this, we look at them in isolation; we look at EFL, we look at Ministry of Works and other parties but we need a way in the Committees, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to look at the whole energy sector. I think the honourable Leader of</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 556 the Opposition was talking about this yesterday. So, that will also be one thing that we need to consider. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, ni sa bula vinaka and good afternoon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me time-off this morning to be with my friends at the RSL Club remembering the events of 18 th April, 1996 and we were joined later by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs who was also there at the time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for the preparation of this Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 and 2022 Annual Report. As we are aware, Sir, the EFL is a vertically integrated company and honourable Usamate is concerned about players, referees all playing on the same side is because of that. Power generation, transmission, distribution and retail of electricity in the large islands of Fiji, et cetera, they all one. That was not the original intention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know. The SVT/GVP Government had lived through the corporatisation, privatisation era in the world and one of those identified entities was FEA (now EFL). It was supposed to be cut up into those three entities; a generation enterprise, distribution enterprise and a regulatory body. The successive government did not go that way, so we now have EFL and the way it is structured. The EFL is responsible for developing renewable energy projects to support Government’s goal to attain 100 percent renewable energy. The honourable Usamate mentioned two years - 2026 and 2030. Yes, we have those feature in our plans as well as the universal goal of sustainable development. Hydroelectric sources are the major renewable energy generators for EFL. Given sufficient rainfall, hydroelectric generation contributes approximately 50 percent to 60 percent toward electricity generation by EFL. Sir, EFL has been consistent in providing return to the Government even during the COVID pandemic. EFL developed a 10-year power development plan which highlights the project within the Green Energy Sector that aligns to the national objectives or providing electricity to every citizens in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the EFL Board, the management and staff for their continued hard work in progressing EFL. I must apologise in advance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, few of the recommendations made to these two reports are outdated and have been overtaken by events and progress made by the entity in question, so I will only focus on the recommendations which are pending actions: Recommendation 1: As honourable Usamate also noted, the need for FCCC to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical aspects of EFL regulatory functions such as registration of licenced electricians and ensuring compliance with the standards. The Committee recommends for FCCC to recruit the necessary expertise to undertake the full range of regulatory functions. Our response back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that I am pleased to report that the FCCC now issues generation transmission and distribution and retail licences to operators in the energy sector and has absorbed the regulatory functions of EFL while few technical functions have been outsourced to EFL.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>557 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 Recently, FCCC conducted public consultations on EFL proposal on 10 th August, 2023 to raise electricity tariffs. The submission was declined and FCCC deemed that direct increase unsuitable at that point in time. Recommendation 2: The Committee noted with concern that the power purchase agreement for the Agro photovoltaic project in Ovalau is yet to be signed. The response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this agreement was signed on 27 th November, 2023 outside the period of the report. If I may elaborate on various ongoing solar farm projects, a power purchase agreement has been signed with Sunergise Dratabu Pte. Limited for a 5MW solar power plant in Dratabu, Nadi. The power plant is expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of this year. EFL entered into a financial advisory services agreement with International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September, 2020. Three solar power plants in Nadi, Ba and Tavua with an expected collective capacity of 19MW are undergoing due diligence by the IFC and we will be operated either by an independent power producer or via a joint venture with a development model. EFL is working with Chugoku Electric Power Company Limited through the Sevens Pacific Pte. Limited a 44 percent shareholder in EFL to develop a 5MW solar power plant in Lautoka by 2025. IFC due diligence is also underway for a 10MW solar power plant in Seaqaqa, Vanua Levu which will have battery storage and after due diligence, tenders for the Independent Power Producer (IPP) or JV are expected to be called in 2024. Feasibility studies are also underway for a solar power plant project in Labasa which was identified by a prospective IPP. EFL, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is working with Envelops Company Limited, a South Korean IPP on 4MW solar power plant in Ovalau. The development of one megawatt solar power plant with battery storage is also underway in Taveuni. The project is funded by Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and is expected to be completed in 2024. The EFL is working to ensure that 100 percent renewable electricity target is achieved by 2036. The Committee strongly recommends the inclusion of key stakeholders such as the landowners in the land acquisition process. The Committee’s recommendation is noted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my position, the Coalition’s position and as Minister for Public Enterprises, we must abide by our commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and sadly after this sitting this afternoon, I will be joining my golfing colleagues to pay our last respect or reguregu to Ratu Napolioni Delasau of Nabubuco, one of the champion landowners who had been trying to finalise the deal on their land in Monasavu. Unfortunately, the agreement we made before the Elections of 1999 have never been completed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure the other speaker from the Government side will complete the response on the other recommendations before the end of this debate. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to make a short contribution on the Review Report of Energy Fiji Limited 2021 – 2022 Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members that have spoken before me have basically covered the recommendations that has been put in by the Committee. As a Member of the Committee, I would</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 558 like to make my contributions on the findings and what we had look through during our examinations of the original report itself. Most of the recommendations have been stated by honourable Usamate and the honourable Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report provided to Parliament by the Committee as findings and recommendations to reflect the effort, the Committee dug deeper into EFL operations and see if the Committee can recommend some changes. The Economic Affairs Committee through the Chairman had decided to play a more active scrutiny and oversight role in the agencies, especially on the agencies that provide economic activities in Fiji and that affects Fijians. The EFL provided that opportunity and we are looking at the Sugar Industry and its contribution to agriculture as a whole. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are well aware of these efforts to make improvements on our ability to contribute to the improvement of this industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted that the FCCC’s functions as has been alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Usamate has been deprived in its checkoff. I think to enlighten Parliament on that, I think I would go back to the background on the appointment of FCCC as the regulator in September 2019 when the Electricity Act was gazetted. However, EFL had signed an MOA with FCCC to continue to carry out certain regulatory functions until further notice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the dilemma that had been forced on EFL as part of FCCC. While FCCC is the regulator, EFL still does not see because it has the technical expertise to oversee this regulatory function. I urge the honourable Minister for Public Works to have a look at this because the Department of Energy within the Ministry of Public Works has the Director that oversees this function. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we found that EFL is on a different footing in comparison to our national commitment on energy sector. We called EFL to tell us, what is their commitment towards renewable energy? We found out the difference between our national target and the target set by EFL itself. We have highlighted to them that they must align themselves to our national target - a total of 100 percent by 2036, and we hope that they will come online on that. The Committee believes that a comprehensive inquiry is required on energy as a whole, especially the renewable energy sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason I am saying this is that, there have been efforts by international companies to establish solar farms in Fiji but it seems that EFL needs position to protect itself so as a sole provider of electricity in Fiji, it has always denied this opportunity. As the honourable Prime Minister has suggested that with the partnership with the landowners, they will be able to develop this and then provide the energy into the main grid for it to be distributed to consumers. I think in the Western side, they have been a lot of effort by landowners to give their land for solar farms. My view is this, EFL owns the assets - they own the post, they own the lines, they can rent into new investors that come in at an affordable rate that will allow the investor to generate electricity and sell it off to EFL so that the whole population of Fiji derives the benefit of cheaper electricity. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will leave it there, that is basically what Mr. Chairman had delegated and thought that we should side track and have dig deeper in why this monopolised industry should be allowed to carry on to the detriment of the people of Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister and</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>559 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 other honourable Members who have spoken before me. The honourable Prime Minister gave a good account of some of the recommendations - the way in which EFL has placed itself in dealing with the whole energy issues. What I heard from honourable Koroilavesau and honourable Usamate was quite interesting. I think a lot of what they have said we agree. On this side of Parliament, as a Government, we are deeply committed to addressing some of those concerns and moving ahead, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with plans to ensure that we achieve those targets, not only in terms of affordable energy, but also moving away from over reliance on fossil fuel to more renewable sources. The economics of decarbonisation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where earlier on we talked about carbon emissions trading and you raised some very intelligent questions about what it involves, because a lot of people do not seem to understand that. But before I talk about the two other recommendations, let me just remind the honourable Members of this Parliament, particularly, the honourable Members on the other side who were in the Government in 2021, the Government at that time entered into a share sale agreement with Sevens Pacific Pte limited, which is a consortium owned by Chugoku Electric Power Company and Japan Bank for International Corporation to acquire 44 percent of shareholding in the EFL. So, the consortium acquired 44 percent of the shares in the EFL, acquiring 24 percent from Government and 20 percent from FNPF. In fact, we are now wondering, why would even FNPF at that point in time want to sell its 20 percent shares to this company. From foreign investor point of view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it makes sense. We could say that, that is a signal that we provide to foreign investors, but the fact is that, EFL is no longer governed under the Public Enterprises Act. It is no longer a Public Enterprise. It is a private company governed by the Companies Act. When we talk about what honourable Usamate and honourable Koroilavesau talked about, the synergy - the difference between what is our national priority, what the Government wants to do in terms of energy policy, what the company and EFL wants to do. In fact, the Government still has majority Board members, but Chugoku Electric has three Board members as well. For any private shareholder, the motive, the overwhelming objective, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to make profit. So, having said that, I think it is important for honourable Members to understand where we are in terms of what was done in the past with respect to the sale of shares. Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we as a Government, the Department of Energy and a number of priorities that the Government has articulated to the EFL Board, we have a new chairman, we have a very competent Board and we are confident that the Board is bringing together the expertise of the private company that owns 44 percent of the shares, that we would be able to move ahead as part of our national strategy and national objective in not only moving away from over reliance on fossil fuel to more renewable sources of energy, but also make sure that the energy that is available is affordable, not only to our ordinary citizens, but also to our investors and those in the business sector. On Recommendation 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends for EFL to explore avenues through which solar roof installation can increase at a rapid pace. I know, honourable Usamate talked about incentives, so let me give you some figures. In fact, I think people themselves are moving away from the idea of just relying on the electricity supply from the EFL to rooftop solar. In fact, the EFL Grid rose from 174 in 2020 to 225 in 2023, a growth rate of about 29 percent. The issue of existing Government support and funding initiatives, the Government provides financial support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, towards household having a combined income of less than $30,000 by contributing about 16.34 cents per unit VEP for first 100 units consumed in a month by such households.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 560 Also for primary and secondary schools, what we call a ‘step up subsidy’ is in place where first 200 units consumed in a month are subsidy at a rate of 12.85 cents per unit VEP with the school contributing the remaining 21.16 cents per unit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the roles of the Department of Energy, FCCC and EFL and their ability to align their policies and strategies to ensure that it meets both the regulatory as well as the policy imperatives of Government is something that we, as a Government, would ensure that the Board and Government representatives of the Board are able to move this forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I want to take this opportunity to thank the former Chairman of the EFL - Mr. Daksesh Patel, and all the Board members who were there and as stated by all honourable Members before, despite the decrease in the sales during COVID-19 in 2021 and the contribution that EFL made to consumers or households during COVID-19, it shows that EFL was in good hands at that point in time, it is in good hands now and the Government is going to work with the new Board Chairman and the Management of EFL to make sure that our national objectives of Energy Policy would be achieved by targets set by the Government. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think most of honourable Members have extensively covered most of the recommendations. I just want to highlight one area which has been highlighted by honourable Koroilavesau, the need to have a thorough inquiry at the energy sector. Of course, the Committee had written to the Secretariat so that we do not to go ahead with the recommendation. Also has been highlighted by honourable Usamate and honourable Professor Prasad on the non-alignment of EFL to national targets. From our view and, of course, the Committee this has to be intensified and accelerated to ensure that they achieve at the national targets that the Government has established for them not to achieve. I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments, and I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I thank you for those comments and I think if only we bear with the workload that we have here with the Secretariat and once we get the role of the Committees on oversight and scrutiny to be better addressed, especially by the proposal to set up sub-committees under existing Standing Orders, then that should be able address what you have stated, Mr. Chairman. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea. When we return, we just try and complete the remaining motion that is still before us. The Parliament adjourned at 4.40pm</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>561 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 5.16 p.m.</p></body>
