<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –FIJI CORRECTIONS SERVICE 2018-2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – FIJI CORRECTIONS SERVICE 2018-2020 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report for the year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, which was tabled on 23 rd November, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as the Member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Consolidated Report for the Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in November last year and the wish to proceed directly in articulating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in this Report. To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are few pertinent issues identified which the Committee had noted and these were as follows: 1. 2. 3. The Fiji Corrections Service, or commonly known as the FCS, is committed to reducing the high number of contraband entering correctional facilities around Fiji. The FCS continues to work towards its responsible targets by safely detaining and rehabilitating persons sentenced to imprisonment or, in other words, persons placed on remand at each correctional centre pending trial by the courts. The FCS has no control over the number of persons incarcerated by the courts and, therefore, does not have the means to minimise overcrowding issues within the Correction facility. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National Budget 2022-2023 provided funding for a Job Evaluation Exercise to be conducted for FCS staff, with the intention to review their salaries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCS engaged a consultant company, namely Maxumise Pte Limited to conduct the JEE, which was to conclude in early October this year. With that, Sir, the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Finance now have the responsibility to evaluate and determine its outcome. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to note that the final two key findings noted by the Committee was derived from the site visitation that the Committee had conducted in which we were able to identify key issues for redressing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, therefore, noted that during its tour of the correctional facilities, the Fiji Corrections Service has taken humanitarian steps to monitor and provide daycare towards inmates of old age. This has subsequently exposed the lack of facilitation for inmates that are at risk with respect to mental health problems. The last key findings was that, the Committee was informed of the land tenure issues at its Levuka facility, Mr. Speaker. The Committee notes that the FCS has take a step to protect tenure on the mataqali land by signing a 99 year lease agreement with the landowning unit beginning in 2017.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 562 Mr. Speaker, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Fiji Corrections Service and any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the key findings that was noted, the Committee has come up with recommendations that he believes will possibly improve certain operations within the Corrections Service. Sir, I will go straig `ht into the recommendation put forth by the Committee for the consideration of this august Parliament. Recommendation No. 1 The Committee recommends that the upgraded equipment be installed to curb the high number of contrabands smuggled into correctional facilities and this, Mr. Speaker, is a major issue whilst we were visiting the correctional facilities. Recommendation No.2 The Committee is of the view that the human dignity of all inmates be respected and recommends that there be separate Centres allocated for remand and convicted inmates, respectively for Natabua, Vaturekuka and Korovou Correction Centres. This would reduce the issue of overcrowding and reduce the negative influence on persons on remand. Recommendation No.3 The Committee recommends that there be a specialized area to confine offenders identified as having mental health and drug issues. Recommendation No. 4 Furthermore, the Committee recommends that the Corrections Infirmary facilities be improved and better resourced and also serve those facilities without infirmary be furnished with one as soon as possible. Recommendation No. 5 The Committee recommends that all Corrections full preparation as storage facilities, including kitchen and dining hall, be revamped to OHS compliance status. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity, and I urge the honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report and show support for the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have a list of speakers given by the Whips and the batting is as follows: 1. Hon. M. D. Bulitavu; 2. Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; 3. Honourable I. Naivalurua; and 4. Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>563 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- I rise to give my contribution to the motion that is before Parliament and, that is, to note the Committee’s Report. Most of the things that I wanted to talk about has been clearly outlined by the Chairman of the Standing Committee in his opening speech in moving the motion before Parliament. Mr. Speaker, just few other things from my observation after reading the Report, we had moved around the FCS facilities. In our visit, we have identified few areas that are in the findings for those of you who have the Report. We have got assurances this morning from the honourable Attorney-General and also Minister for Justice and Minister responsible for Corrections on the Job Evaluation Exercise that has been conducted and I have stated this morning that it is long overdue and outstanding. That was one of the main issues that was raised to us in our visit in various Corrections Centres around the country, given they have been bringing up these issues over the past few years and they are still waiting. So, we hope that the honourable Attorney-General will bring this to the attention of the honourable Minister of Finance and we looking forward for the upcoming budget. There could probably be a $5 million allocation for this JEE and if it is done, probably it should be given in a lump sum where lessons should be learned from the JEE that was done to the Fiji Police Force years back that had few teething problems and had to come back to the Committee for inquiries. It was given on a pro-rata basis and most that had passed on or left the Service were still being paid. There were issues of some who were paid monies that they were not supposed to receive. On the other issue, I would like to raise with the honourable Minister responsible and honourable Attorney-General is the establishment of the Parole Board. I think that is one area that inmates have always raised in terms of having that Parole Board. I think they are in the process of getting the board members given there are certain specialists that are needed to be part of that board, psychiatrists, et cetera, and other things. Probably he will enlighten us when he takes the floor. These are some of the avenues that inmates are awaiting so that they can come through and also re-join the community outside. On the other issue that we have found out was the caregiving training that needs to be done. If you go to Nasinu Correction Centre, I think there is one whole dorm there which is dedicated for old inmates who are disabled and I think they are being cared by some Corrections Officers and some inmates. I think proper training and proper equipment is needed there especially things like vehicles and ambulances where they can assist also them if an emergency arises in the facilities given, those old sick inmates are being cared for. One thing that they had raised in our visit around was a x-ray scanner. Probably that could be part of the budget too as a capital expenditure for Fiji Corrections Service given the high rise of contrabands coming into our prison facilities, telephones even drugs and other things that are used by inmates illegally. But they have body scanners but given the developments that have happened, how inmates have managed to hide that even in their cavity. These are one of the things that came up in our visits – the need for x-ray scanners to be available in most of our facilities around the country. Another thing that we came across was the remand centres. Most remand centres here in the North, we do not have a specific remand centre in Labasa given that all are in Vaturekuka. If there is probably a project in the future, honourable Minister, if there could be a capital project where a remand centre for the Northern Division can be constructed, so that it will reduce overcrowding in our centres. Usually, Labasa is the only holding prison especially in the courthouse in Labasa before they are distributed to Taveuni and other places in Fiji.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 564 Those are my initial contribution to the Report that is before Parliament and I hope that the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice who is responsible for Corrections will take those recommendations and findings that are in the Report that is readable and also those recommendations will be taken in so that the service of the Fiji Corrections Service can be improved. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to base my comments on the Report particularly the recommendations made by the Committee and I thank the Committee for their report to Parliament today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to speak on the lack of burial space. I live in Davuilevu Housing which is right next to the crematorium and the cemetery. That cemetery is filling up very quickly, I know also that the informal settlement located behind the crematorium and the cemetery is actually the reserve for the cemetery. I noted in the Report that the Committee recommended that may be some of us can take our loved ones who have passed away to our villages, so that we can bury them. I think some of us have not been to our villages for a long time, so I am not sure how that will work. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- I really like to laugh at that comment. (Laughter) HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I would like to raise a sensitive issue that could really help the situation on burial space and that is cremation particularly the iTaukei and Christians. We do not quite advocate for cremation. There are many benefits of cremation, I have been to the crematorium many times, actually if I die maybe I want to be cremated, I am not sure if my wife will agree if she is still alive. This is definitely one area that has been developed in Fiji. I know there is one in Nasinu and there is more in Raralevu. I think our Hindu brethens actually use it very well. This is a good way and clean way to go. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- You already gone. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I think we should consider this as a community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know if many of our people know, I been to some burials in Nasinu. I personally do not want to be buried there and for one of the main reasons is right now, during the burials they do not allow the casket to be covered with the mat. I do not know whether this is a rule.... MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, it is. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Or maybe because it is small. Just looks a little bit bare. It is a discussion about death but I think it is essential that we do that. MR. SPEAKER.- Is if because of the mats or the body will not go down? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I will leave that idea. I know we Catholics are working around this idea of getting cremated, not being buried. I would encourage discussion that much. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reinforce the proposal raised by honourable Bulitavu on the proper remuneration of Corrections Officers and all the other conditions for their work that needs to be looked at. I was in Naboro the other day for reasons that shall not be made known to Parliament,</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>565 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 and I noticed that some of the workers are really working hard. I think there has been something in motion but I think we should recognise that our Corrections Officers need to be paid well. Overcrowding in our prisons and the negative effects of that. Space is always a problem and I know it was raised earlier by the Chairman that the Corrections Service do not control the number that are coming to them. We must consider smart ways of looking after people who are convicted. The honourable Naivalurua and I were talking about restorative justice as a lead on to Yellow Ribbon as some way of looking after humanely and to try and rehabilitate people without leaving them in jail. That is something we need to look at also. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our correctional facilities are not cut for those that need special attention. One, the physically handicapped (disabled). I know an uncle of mine who is in there who is in a wheelchair. Neither is it responding enough to the mentally challenged. The third category of people that perhaps it should also look after are those that are aged. So they all clamped, and this is part of the recommendation of the Committee, in the same space as everyone else. Definitely a challenge, something for us to all look at particularly the Government I believe. I am sure there are two places they are kind of co-located which people do not necessarily want to look at for the stigma, they are located in the same area. One is Suva Prison and the other one is St. Giles Hospital because it deals with the kind of people that we push to the limit of our community. But the important thing is that they are the very people who need our help the most. I would hope that we consider some humane policies around this, and I definitely would support this in Government, in the event that these are brought as laws to be able to help, not only the Corrections Officers, but also those who are there, spending time for the crimes that they have committed. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to start off by thanking the honourable Minister for the good news this morning. I stand together with my two colleagues, the honourable Minister for Home Affairs in thanking him for his commitment and assurance that Corrections Service JEE will be paid out in this fiscal year – thank you, Sir. Much has been presented by the two previous speakers, Sir, on the Report, but for the benefit of Parliament, I just wanted to go back to how it all started, just to enable us to understand why some of the current issues that keep on propping up in some of the reports will continue to do so. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 18 years ago, the Corrections Act 2006 was enacted. That basically changed a big paradigm shift of the organisation from one of containment to one of correction and rehabilitation. That demanded a lot of changes. I am thinking the past, changing the attitude, and above all, re-training the staff, a 360 degrees turnaround, even to the uniforms, to the branding, to how they should posture themselves in public, even to the selection of the uniform that they wear today, that particular uniform was decided by the community inside the New Town Hall. A lot of things took place. The plans were very clear and we were required to align ourselves to the new order of the day; the Corrections Act 2006. All the plannings including infrastructure and capacity building had to be aligned. We had to put into place a long term development plan, together with what we thought will help us to comply with the new order of the day. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in those days, the Corrections Officers were known as Prison Officers. Today, they are Corrections Officers, but I would also want to call them, they are Captains of Lives. Primarily the role of the Corrections Service is really inside the laws where they receive those who have gone offtrack and they are like doctors who treat them through a rehabilitation programme, then after they have served a time, then they are handed back again to the community. There are two parts to this – one is their role inside the wall, and secondly is their role outside the wall. You have heard about the Yellow Ribbon Programme, their positive initiative to deal with those who have served the time and were rejoining society, community or their families to be given a second chance. From my</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 566 experience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the inside of the wall part of the work was manageable, we could control, we could deal with but it was the outside of the wall aspect of it that was most difficult. I, at this point wish to thank the vanua, the community at large, families for their contribution and their effort in supporting the Yellow Ribbon Programme. Very quickly on perhaps one of those five recommendations, all the five recommendations are really the inside the wall aspects, apart from a few of the need for funding on projects. This will be ongoing, some of it are yet to be completed in line with the long-term development plan that we had set and some are just results that we are slow in catching up of the change in times. The offenders are those who are incarcerated in there, they have all the time in the world to beat the whole system. So, it is very important that we have a well-trained organisation, a well-skilled dedicated captain of lives who cares for them, treat them, change them and send them out again. I thank the Committee for the engagement with the Fiji Ex-Prisoners Training and Rehabilitation Associate Service, this is something new for me. These are those who have done time inside and they are really giving back their time to help those find their way back out and I would like to acknowledge them at this juncture for their commitment and work in the rehabilitation programme. Let me end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say that whilst we cannot control numbers that go in, I believe we can create intervention points to reduce the numbers that go in. By this I mean, in my thinking, whilst we have the Yellow Ribbon Programme, it could be extended further that would encourage and perhaps inform the public and society on the roles they could play under the Yellow Ribbon Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have heard about the Duavata Community Policing, we had a brief discussion with the honourable Minister for Home Affairs just before we came back in and whether it is all possible whilst the Corrections Service’s role is to bring them back on track, Fiji Police under the Duavata Community Policing could keep them on track, back a track and keeping them on track. There has been a few wonderful initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our effort to come up with innovative ways in dealing with ways or making sure that they change and they change for the better and they do not go back in. The Arts Gallery was one, innovative one, if I may mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was one that we introduced in Taveuni. Those who stole dalo or yaqona when they come in for the rehabilitation programme, they are sent out to the places where they stole and planted five times more what they stole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 10 yaqona plants, you plant 50 to the owner, 2,000 dalo times five. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it worked there. I am simply trying to say that there are innovative ways, it really does not cost much in how we can perhaps reduce the numbers and also prevent our sons and daughters from going in. I support the motion here, Sir, and I once again thank the public and society for their support of the Yellow Ribbon Programme. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I will just share some experience here being an old boy. So, I have two old boys, one the school that I attended, the other one is the Rehabilitation Centre and they quickly label you with the Yellow Ribbon thing. The only concern that I have is the uniform of the Prison Wardens. When I was sent to jail, they had only about two and when honourable Naivalurua took over, lots of changes happened. I do not know how many uniforms they have now, compared to the military and the military still has more.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>567 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 Why I am saying this, honourable Members, is because the Prison Officers are more exposed, very high risk job for them especially when they go with prisoners to clean some bush, et cetera, they are with prisoners who hold knives and things like that. It is quite risky and dangerous for them and on top of that, I do not how about their present uniform. Do they have overalls as well like the military? On top of that, I am happy that this Report has come up and we have two former Commissioner of Prisons here; honourable Naivalurua and honourable Vasu. The crux of what I am trying to say is, the prisoners, when you go amongst them, when you are also thrown into jail, they do not look at you as one of their colleagues who has broken the law but rather your standing in the community. Strangely I was asked, could you give us some training and lecture about what to do and what not to do, et cetera, things of that nature and then I said, “look, I am already in uniform, it will be so stupid of me to be in this uniform and then trying to lecture to you on something that you alone can understand, because you are wearing the uniform to look after us even though we are more smarter than you”; most of the convicts there are very bright. When you cage them in, they become more smarter in how they exercise their minds. They never put to waste anything, even the leather boots, they make nice cases for gas lighters. How they transform the lace of the shoes into strings and whereby they throw things across their cell. That is how they pass on whatever they get from this end right down to that end. Even how they throw the newspapers through the cage like grills that we have and it flies through. The distance is about from here to there, but when they fold the newspaper, it is so strange because by the time you come to understand where is the newspaper, someone is reading it on the other side. That is a different dormitory altogether. All I am trying to share is the riskiness of the work of the officers in prison. I hope honourable Vasu will understand this better, their uniforms. They have got number one, two now, and so forth but compared to the military, is still very much behind. There are more interesting stories which we can share on the rehabilitation centre. But again, I only hope that whatever is coming out of this Report, now that the Attorney-General is going to be closing up the debate on this motion, I only hope that proper financial help is provided to the Ministry, so that they conduct themselves better. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Deputy Prime Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, first of all, Sir, thank you for sharing the journey first-hand experience which other honourable Members too, through their visitations or probably by knowledge, are fully aware of the issues. It brings me to light regarding this facility. When I started in Government, one of the first work I did was to look after the Government Departments’ business and that Department used to come under my portfolio. When I look at the government assistance rendered to RFMF, the Police and Prisons, the Prisons are always the last. I can see the change during Naivalurua’s appointment and thereafter, and the infrastructural changes are significant. I happened to spend some of my time in the compounds of Natabua, Naboro and Nasinu. My eldest brother was a prison officer, you may have known him, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I just came back from Sydney to celebrate his 70 th birthday, so I am fully aware of the experiences. I was a lawyer, a Magistrate and now I am the Attorney-General. I can assure you one thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be changes, but it is going to take time. The last few years has been different, during honourable Naivalurua and honourable Vasu’s times. When we talk about human dignity, I can say that in the last few years, it was non-existent. It did not only affect the prisoners, it also affected the lives of the Corrections Officers and it is a huge shift from that mode to the current.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 568 I have been constantly reminded, Sir, thank you for the change of Government and we owe it to the people of Fiji. Now, there is more access for lawyers, over the weekend and this week, we can see some of the religious faiths have been permitted to enter. That was a big no-no during the last Administration. I, for one, whenever I come to visit the head office, it is difficult. You cannot go inside because the officers were trained like military officers. But all I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Parliament is that there will be changes. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for the detailed Report, the observations, findings and, of course, the five recommendations. I do note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they said that majority of the issues identified in the review have been adequately addressed. As you are probably aware, most of these issues are infringes in terms of finance budgetary allocation. I have been trying to impress upon the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. I would like to invite him to visit the Corrections Centres and see firsthand what it is like. Only then one can understand because in terms of the needs, infrastructure, et cetera, it will depend on the funding. We acknowledge the pressing nature of the issue and are firmly committed to implementing effective measures to ensure the the safety, security and rehabilitation of all individuals under the Fiji Corrections Service. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a significant concern regarding the smuggling of contraband into the Fiji Correctional facilities but with the nature of the organisation, such is bound to happen, but the Corrections Officers are supposed to be on top of their job. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address this, the Fiji Corrections Service has embarked on a comprehensive strategy aimed at enhancing security measures and reducing illicit activities within its facilities. These include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The purchasing of handheld machines and metal detector walk-through doors for Correctional Centres, ensuring thorough screening procedures. Mr. Speaker, Sir and honourable Members of Parliament, even then they still slip in as the human mind, and this was probably explained earlier on how they do things in prison without detection by the officers. It is also a provision of capacity support for our K9 sniffer dogs at the K9 Unit. There is also implementation of irregular and consistent snap security searches conducted by the K9 and Fiji Corrections Service personnel. There is also procurement of full-body x-ray scanner machine. There is also heightened surveillance and intelligence gathering by the Emergency Unit, facilitating proactive intervention and response. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Corrections Service’s core mission centres on the safe and effective rehabilitation of all prisoners and remandees. We understand the importance of individualised care and support, which is why we continuously implement rehabilitation programmes tailored to meet the diverse needs of inmates. Except for the Labasa Corrections Centre, all correctional facilities have separate facilities for remanded and convicted inmates. Sadly, this will be a capital project if not next year, then probably in the years to come. In the case of Labasa Corrections Centre, there are separate cell blocks for remand and convicted inmates. Sadly, we have no control of the people put in remand.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>569 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 18 th April, 2024 I totally agree with honourable Naivalurua regarding the theft from farms. Let me share, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I was a Magistrate, especially when I go to the island, that is the sentence I actually impose, for them to plant more. But that is below the tariff, as honourable Ratu Niudamu will realise that. The tariff is two to nine months, so if you are a first offender for that, two to nine months then normally you will suspend it. But if you commit another theft, it will be more. And the theft of farm produce, according to the Court is higher, but I have done it. It has not been appealed because maybe it was done on the island but the point is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a creative and innovative way because that suits the particular offender - the point of being charged, appear in Court with fellow villagers watching, sentence on the same day, but when they go out, they want to change and sometimes it does help. We hope that in the future, there will be some dialogue with the Judiciary to implement other ways in terms of imposing custodial sentences for our prisoners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the shortfalls within our correctional facilities. However, we are progressively working on addressing the concerns and limited resources. Unfortunately, as I have said, the previous Administration failed to prioritise the overcrowding concern in our correctional facilities, owing to the influx of offenders, including those with drug related offences. Some of the initiatives to address this include the utilisation of early release programmes for those inmates who are eligible, and the anticipated re-establishment of the Parole Board to facilitate early release applications. The Parole Board has been appointed, it is awaiting administrative setup from the Fiji Corrections, before it is submitted to His Excellency for their appointment. The Standing Committee also recommended setting aside a specialised facility for offenders who are mentally challenged, including those struggling with drug addiction. As I have said, as the years go by, there is always new initiatives for the Fiji Corrections Service and one of which has been recommended is for a separate hospital facility for the Fiji Corrections Centre. That is something for the new Administration to implement. As clarified by the honourable Prime Minister, we will be soon having a new Commissioner of Correctional Service, probably in the space of a month or two. Those are some of the projects that the new Commissioner and the new team at Fiji Corrections Service will take heed of in order to improve the status in the Fiji Corrections Centre. I fully endorse the Report of the Committee. Vinaka. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions towards the motion before Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, before I take my leave, I wish to thank yourself for allowing the Committee to visit all the correctional facilities. We have been fortunate enough to have seen another world. For you, honourable Members, who have not been inside the prison, we have been inside and it is totally different, as honourable Naivalurua, honourable Vasu and Mr. Speaker have shared with us. It is totally different inside there, a totally different lifestyle and we met all sorts of people from all sorts of life - lawyers, teachers, policeman, politicians, with totally different lifestyle. We are being fortunate, and I thank, Mr. Speaker, for allowing us to visit all these correctional facilities. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a big thank you to the Fiji Corrections Service. To the Acting Commissioner, Madam Panapasa and all the hardworking men and women in the Fiji Corrections Service, we thank you for your services, especially with a ratio of 4:1, given that most of them have</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 570 to look after prisoners who are handling knives. We thank you for your commitment and it is a very high risk environment. Thank you to all the hardworking men and women in the Fiji Correctional Service. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a notable mention to our Liaison Officer, Deputy Commissioner Senior Superintendent Apakuki Qurai, who accompanied the Committee all throughout to all the correctional facilities around Fiji. He helped the Committee throughout the visitation. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that bring us to the end of the sitting today. Before I adjourn Parliament, I think I was just informed a while ago that honourable Members are not able to listen or hear the bell being sounded from here, especially when you are in the Big Committee Room. However, we made checks since it happened the last time and it seems that someone has lowered the volume. Perhaps, it is only one of us here or one of the staff who has lowered the volume. Honourable Members have been coming in late to the sitting when the bell has already sounded. On that second bell when it sounded, I was still in my office and I could not hear anything. Yet, the Orderly who has been assisting me heard it. Something strange is happening here. The volume cannot go down on its own. Maybe, we need to up the security again to ensure that bell is sounded at the same time everyone hears it. I thank you all for your contributions today. Honourable Members, Parliament will now adjourn until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. In addition to that, I want to inform you honourable Members that dinner is being prepared in the Big Committee Room and I hope you will enjoy your dinner. The Parliament adjourned at 6.05 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71</p></body>
