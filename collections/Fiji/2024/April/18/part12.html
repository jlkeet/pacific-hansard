<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Housing Rehabilitation Assistance – TC Yasa (Question No. 30/2024) HON. J. N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry update Parliament on the Housing Rehabilitation Assistance provided to landowners through the Fiji Pine Trust after the devastation caused by TC Yasa? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question regarding the Housing Rehabilitation Assistance provided to the landowners through the Fiji Pine Trust. Mr. Speaker, Sir, close collaboration between the Government and non-governmental organisations and the communities is crucially important in the effort of rebuilding homes and lives during trying times after a severe natural disaster, like we faced after TC Yasa. The outcome of what was achieved during the rehabilitation programme was a result of united effort by Government through the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management and NGOs where each party had respective critical roles to play in their rebuilding of lives and livelihoods of the affected communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry and key stakeholders in the Forestry Sector undertook the lead role in housing rehabilitation in the Northern Division, collaborating with the Fiji Pine Group of Companies in assisting pine landowners in Cakaudrove, Bua and Macuata Provinces to rebuild their homes. With the support of the Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL), the forestry stakeholders were able to repurpose timber from trees felled during the recent series of cyclones and have them ready to rehabilitate the homes that were damaged by the cyclone.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>532</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 The collective effort from the forestry stakeholders have now seen about 17 houses rebuilt, ripped and sawn for the village of Cogea from trees given by FHCL through the Ministry of Rural Development, who was the leading agency in that work. The Government had targeted to rebuild 70 houses in Cogea and Nabavatu but the progress in achieving these numbers was stalled due to the proposal of the previous Government to rebuild both homes in concrete material suitable to withstand Category 5 cyclones. The Ministry of Forestry have since had a home built at our Training Centre in Nasinu certified by MOIT last week to withstand Category 5 cyclones. This is the model that we use in the Northern and Maritime communities’ rehabilitation work given that we have the resources readily available to carry out this work at limited cost to affected communities and doing so empower and upskill these communities to become self-reliable and sustainable during this time. Specifically, Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited supply both pines and mahogany, timber, and associated housing materials while the Ministry of Forestry provides portable sawmills and carpenters. In addition to providing its staff to operate the sawmill, the Ministry also trains the communities to assist and on occasion to actually mill timber themselves. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry further supported the initiative by training and certifying 28 carpenters and 20 portable sawmill operators. Through this training, the Ministry also supplied framing materials processed through the portable sawmill for at least 250 houses. This assistance provided much needed relief to the villages in these three provinces of Vanua Levu following TC Yasa. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned before, lesson learnt during the past, the Ministry has received requests and constructed a Category 5 model house which has been inspected by the Ministry of Infrastructure and has now been certified. The Ministry will be conducting training on this model house and requests are already coming in: 1. Kumi - 20 houses; 2. Nameka - 15 houses; and 3. Gau - 1 house. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government through the Ministry of Forestry, and its consultation with other agencies will continue to provide practical and capable solutions for our maritime communities. There are much bigger plans in our next budget to support provisions of jetty for Muani in Kadavu, Lovu in Gau, Narocake Pine Scheme and Wainiyabia in Lakeba. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will ensure ease of transportation of pine logs and timbers from these pine schemes to others close by. These jetties will allow the barge to access more resource owners and support growing in other parts of these maritime islands apart from the areas where the current jetty exists. Housing rehabilitation assistance is currently undertaken directly and indirectly through three different agencies. The Ministry of Forestry across Fiji and Fiji Pine Trust for 49 plant schemes including those on maritime islands and Fiji Pine Limited for Fiji Pine lease landowning units with over 126 villages. The Fiji Pine Group has assisted in re-building 85by purchasing building materials funded through the 70 percent project entitlement and dividend from the Forest Trust levies.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>533 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the housing rehabilitation in the North is in addition to the housing rehabilitation in the Central, Western and the maritime islands where the Ministry of Forestry has so far have re-purposed timber building over 500 homes. We are continuing to look strategically in strengthening the Ministry’s initiative in focusing and driving our economy’s economic and development activities in the North and the maritime islands. This work will continue to be driven and focussed in empowering our maritime and Northern communities to be self- sustainable and commercially minded and economically driven in the respective programmes that the Ministry continues to undertake. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to Members of Parliament who would like to raise supplementary questions, you mentioned something that caught my ears and that is the Wainiyabia Jetty. I remember vividly in this Parliament during budget session, we raised that issue to the Government of the day then and they could not figure out where Wainiyabia was even though it was in their proposal. So, when we raised questions, the former Prime Minister shot out and said, “do not worry, we will do it”. I said, “okay, do not worry” to honourable Semesa Karavaki who raised the question. This Wainiyabia is in Lakeba, it is next to the late Turaga na Tui Nayau’s cattle farm. It is quite some distance to the deep waters and they are still waiting. It is over how many years now. You have mentioned that in your reply to the question raised and I hope you understand that issue concerning that particular proposal to build a wharf in Wainiyabia. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Fisheries in his statement highlighted about the upcoming trainings. My question to the honourable Minister for Fisheries is, what was the selection criteria for the households to be selected for the trainings and when it will commence? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a community training, it depends on the devastation of the place which was affected by hurricanes. If we have it in Natokalau Village, we will teach them on how to operate and assist the Ministry in doing their own logging, et cetera. But for forestry training, we have our training centre in Nasinu, they can apply for training, and we can assist them with training. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I was in Vanua Levu during Tropical Cyclone Yasa because of rehabilitation work and the pressure to get it done for these houses. A lot of those timbers were not treated. I think some years later, people started to complain about the condition of the houses because of untreated timber. They have been using their own pine because that was the advice given by the Ministry. Will that be part of this work again to go back and fix these houses, they are really going down now. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were not aware of that from past years but we are now working on that and trying to get all timbers treated. We cannot get it to Viti Levu, we will take our services down to the rural and maritime areas and do our servicing in those villages. MR. SPEAKER.- I remember quite vividly as well, the former government, for fallen trees, they passed a very quick authority to be given to the Ministry of Forestry to cut and start providing fallen trees to enable the people affected by the cyclones to build their houses up in the Dawasamu area. So now, it is the fallen trees during the hurricane and cyclones. We do not have any fallen trees right now because we are still waiting for what may come. I leave that to you, Sir, the logistics of moving your trough to enable to treat the timbers because by then if there is a cyclone the roads will be blocked, et cetera. How quick a response time can that be undertaken? I do not know want you to reply to that, I just want you to consider that.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>534</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 National Rugby League Premiership Competition (Question No. 31/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports update Parliament on Fiji’s bid to secure a licence to enter the National Rugby League (NRL) Premiership Competition for men and women rugby league teams in the 18th Extension Franchise? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give my response, allow me to acknowledge the presence of the Bid Director, Bev Broughton and Mr. Rajesh Singh of Broughton’s &amp; Associates are partners of official Bid company in the public gallery today. For the interest of Parliament, His Excellency the President of Fiji is the current patron of the Fiji National Rugby League while the honourable Prime Minister is a former patron and now a life member. In reference to the question raised by the honourable Member, the following updates have been received - a letter of support from the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports on behalf of the Government of Fiji was vetted by the Office of the Solicitor-General and sent to the Chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission, Mr. Peter V’Landys on 23 rd February, 2024, expressing our support for the bid. Mr. Speaker, Sir, confirmation from the Australian Rugby League Commission for a licence is yet to be received and the timeline to have this approved may vary and could even take a while. However, in the meantime, as we wait for a confirmation, Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited, our bid company is currently strengthening media coverage of the Fiji bid on the extensive wide world of sports programme that reaches out to over four million sporting fans every month on Channel 9 News in Australia. They have ensured media coverage with key online commentators, one of which has been reported by a media commentator with the following of 168,000 sports fans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited is also developing bid programmes and constructive liaison with the Fiji National Rugby League regarding complementary pathway programmes to ensure no duplication. Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte limited is also working on the development of the media collateral in readiness for ongoing media releases to keep the profile of Fiji and the Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited consistently promoted both in Fiji and internationally. Furthermore, they are working with sponsors including a forthcoming formal Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited, the launch date to be decided, agreed and preparation for the launch of official website and social media. The above are activities that will help support Fiji’s bid for a licence in the National Rugby League Franchise. The bid has a defined outcome, but whatever the timeline to when NRL licence may be, the Fiji NRL bid has great ongoing value with a range of innovative programmes that continue to strengthen Rugby League and community outcomes for Fiji. HON. F. S. KOYA.- First of all, we are competing with the PNG Kumuls from what I understand as the 18th Extension and I also understand that they have received some Australian Government backing with respect to this, they have a war chest of about $600 million with respect to their bid. Are we able to even match them, because we all want to see our Fijian team part of NRL. Will we be able to compete with them because I know PNG has a lot of money to do that and they have some Australian Government backing with respect to that? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer to the question is, yes, we are competing with PNG in our bid for a place in the NRL franchise. On the financial side, at the moment we have</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>535 Rugby League Fiji, the company that has been formed which is currently looking at that bid. Financial outcomes for that we do not have any details of it, so at the moment our priority is to secure the bid. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Have you approached the Australian Government for assistance on this? HON. J. SAUKURU.- As I have mentioned Mr. Speaker, Sir, the company is also looking at sponsorship. There are a lot of interested partners that are willing to come on board to be part of the move for Fiji to be in the NRL franchise. MR. SPEAKER.- What is the situation with the Silktails? Are they part of that company? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, no. Kaiviti Silktails is competing in the Under 20s category, so it is not part of the company here or the bid. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my apologies honourable Minister, you already have the Silktails there and they are already playing in that competition. Why cannot we just move them to another level? While they are already there with the NRL, just play our Silktails? That is my question in trying to understand the process that you are going to take, instead of going through another bid as we are already in that arena. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, as I have mentioned before, Silktails is competing in the Under 20s category and it is at a lower level while the Fiji National Rugby League and the plan for joining the franchise, who are looking at the premium level of rugby league in Australia. MR. SPEAKER.- It will be a conduit to supply the rugby league.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> The Silktails to the rugby league; tthat is the question being raised? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, Silktails can be used as a pathway for our youths to go through the same structure. They are provided the same pathway.</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no supplementary questions, I intend to adjourn Parliament</h4><p>now for lunch and we will resume at 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12:34 p.m.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>536</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.38 p.m. FSC – Pay Increase for Staff (Question No. 32/2024) HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament as to where the funding for the 5 percent pay increase for the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) staff that was recently announced will be sourced from? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to first of all ask the honourable Member whether he is opposing this increment or his for the increment. (Laughter) I will ask all the honourable Members on the other side of the Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes I would like to actually say something more about the sugar industry, I have been given a good opportunity today.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Yes, I will answer. Please bear with me.</p><p>I have got 19.23 minutes left. So, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister who is here to listen to my answers because I will be delivering are few important messages and I am here to do a job. Now, honourable Keta Lal please….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> I will, it is coming. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC (this is the whole contention of this question) was and is in a state of debacle and as and is in a state of a debacle, in a shape of disarray whereby…. HON. K. K. LAL.- What are you doing now? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Look, in three years there were no balance sheets given by the last boards because we … HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. C. J. SINGH.- … and through my effort that I got the last board to present the last three years’ of returns. In any business for that matter, and of course our honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Kamikamica will agree, you will need to have a balance sheet every year so that you can better measure yourself; where your company is going and what it is doing? Now, I had to instruct the last board to present three years of accounts and when we saw the balance sheet, it was upside down and why I am saying this is, I have given an instruction now to the new board that within three months of the closing of accounts, they have to present a balance sheet so that we can see how FSC is performing and where it is going.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Vinaka:</span></p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>537</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Just a small thing to say:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Look!</p><h4>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You have got 17 minutes, don’t worry.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- One more issue that honourable Naupoto had raised earlier that I was illegally doing things in the Immigration:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> I have not transferred the workers, they are under my permit. You know what happened, in my years in cane farming, as well as when cane crushing starts…. HON. K. K. LAL.- And where is the sugar? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Come on honourable Ketan, shut up! (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Do not say shut up:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Sir, I am sorry.</p><p>As soon as the cane crushing starts the farmers see the cane farms burning. They cannot get cane cutters to harvest because there was a seven-day window programme for the farmers to harvest and bring the cane to the mill. I will seek the honourable Pio Tikoduadua’s indulgence to see how we can assist the farmers. They will still be under my contract but if I can assist them, that is my whole idea. I am not here to be illegally getting them transferred.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, that is right.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Under this programme, I must thank honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka and honourable Faiyaz Koya for raising the issue about ethanol and aviation fuel. We want to bring aviation fuel to this country, but we need production. With 1.6 million tonnes of cane, we cannot produce ethanol. We need volume. Later on, I would like to ask the honourable Leader of the Opposition, how did our industry fail from a 3.2 million tonnes of cane to 1.6 million tonnes? (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- No, I am not blaming you directly, honourable Leader of the Opposition, but I would like to know what went wrong and to bring it back is a task. So, that is something that I will talk about with the honourable Leader of the Opposition. The honourable Leader of Opposition has alluded to me earlier that we need to bring the cane price up and I will tell you, $95 is minimum in this season. If everything goes well, it could be $100 per tonne before the election. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>538</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 HON. C. J. SINGH.- You not a farmer! Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will tell you what the losses this country faced because of the loss of production of cane. HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Come on, honourable Member.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the 3.2 million tonnes of cane that we used to harvest, we used to produce 370,000 tonnes of sugar. That relates to $700 million in foreign exchange. That was the figure we have. Now, what are we getting today? Sir, 1.6 million tonnes of cane, 140,000 tonnes of sugar and it gives us $200 million in foreign exchange. We have to reverse it, and this why I want a bipartisan friendship. Do not go to the farmers and give the wrong signals. You just tell them that they have to work together. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I tell you that the honourable Leader of Opposition is very in co-operation with me. I would love to see other honourable Members on the other side to be part of us. My answer to him is a four-piece answer. I have got another nine minutes. Now, as we speak, Mr. Speaker, today we have got seven Engineers from India who are here in the country. I have negotiated to bring them here. They are working with no fees, and we only have to pay airfares and accommodation and they are currently… HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Labour Law! HON. C. J. SINGH.- …they are in FSC Ba Mill, then to Lautoka Mill and then to Labasa Mill to assess the conditions of our aging plants. They will give us a report in the next couple of days to say how the current Mills have to be given a revamp. They will also give us an advice on how the Rakiraki Mill and what sort of mill that we have to put there. It is coming and I am giving a promise in Parliament that like this time next year, the Mill will start with the foundation. I will tell you why the production of sugar has gone down in this country. It is because you on the other side have ruined the sugar Mill in Rakiraki. You can put the market there, but your mill is not there. Now, I will tell you one thing - the good part about me handling the Sugar Industry is this, the former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhary used to criticise the sugar industry, but he has not even said one thing against me ever since I have been the Minister. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Why? I am an efficient Minister. I am a person who is working on the job. I am not sleeping on the job! (Laughter) I was in China recently. I will tell you that under your Government, you</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>539 imported pesticides and weedicides that could not kill the grass. So now, I am bringing in a set of weedicides and pesticides that will kill not only him but you too. (Laughter) Ever since he has asked me this question, he kept on saying, “Please, please do not attack me”. I said, “I will not attack you because you did not ask the question. Thethe question was asked by someone else, but you only have your name there.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question posed by honourable Matasawalevu. The decision to provide this pay rise was made considering the several factors that have affected the Fiji Sugar Corporation employees. The last salary adjustment occurred in January 2019, marking a period of five years without a subsequent financial recognition of the Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA). This termination had led to a noticeable decline in boosting moral, motivation and productivity. It is also crucial to acknowledge that the high inflation rates over the past five years have severely impacted the ability of FSC employees to make ends meet. The impact of these challenges, coupled with persistent demands for wages reviews has put a significant pressure on FSC and its management. Furthermore, in the aftermath of COVID-19, we observed a troubling pattern of skill loss as employees migrated to other countries or moved to organisations offering higher wages. In the recent years, FSC has lost a total of 110 employees to either migration or to organisation offering a higher remuneration package. In response to these pressing issues, the Board of Directors of FSC has approved a 5 percent increment, totalling to $1.1 million annually effective from 3 rd January, 2024. This has benefitted nearly 2,000 FSC employees. It is important to note that the Executive Management is not part of this salary increase, while the majority of FSC employees have already received their increment and are benefitting from this. There are still 238 employees whose union are currently negotiating with FSC before accepting the increment. While the unions negotiate as their rights under the Coalition Government, funds have been allocated from the budgeted $1.1 million for these employees to also benefit from the increment. Now, this is the punch line. “Let me not compare against the salaries of two previous CEOs, Abdul Khan and Graham Clark, who, in today’s dollars, were earning in excess of $1.1 million per year.” We are effectively taking the funds from the Executive Management’s remuneration and invest them in our hardworking employees who run the show and keep these esteemed organisation afloat. This is investing in our own people, without lining up the pockets of the privileged few. Implementing the pay increases was not just a choice, but a necessity, resulting from past negligence. The funding for this pay increase will be sourced from the operational budget of FSC. The decision to provide this pay rise was made after careful consideration of various factors, including the Corporation’s financial standing, operational efficiency and the dedication of its workforce. Honourable Member, I thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say everything from my heart.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>540</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable Minister for his elaborate answer. We just recently visited all the Mills in Fiji - Western and returned from Labasa two weeks ago. The honourable Minister has highlighted the production of ethanol as fuel. Unfortunately, in our visit, it did not indicate the capacity to even produce sugar for local consumption, let alone for export. My belief is that the Ministry of Sugar should come under the Ministry of Agriculture. Does he have any comment on that? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is the prerogative of the honourable Prime Minister where the Ministry should lie. You have said a good thing and if I can get half of the Ministry of Agriculture on my side, I will be happy. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Minister; he talked about the good old days of sugar, FSC particularly when we had more than three million tonnes and now it is down to 1.2 million tonnes. However, there is a correlation between that and the availability of land for leases and, of course, the number of famers that we have lost through that process. Please, can you tell Parliament and every Fijians who are listening today, how many farmers were victims of non-renewable of leases? How does that relate to the production? How much land? The expiry of land started in 1997, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Please, can you tell Parliament how many farmers did not have their land renewed and what is the impact of that on sugar production? Be honest! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question. It was under your 16 years of governance, what did you do? (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. We love listening to you and the way you hold up when you are under pressure. Even by reading your reply, your voice goes up and down, yet no one is questioning you. (Laughter) HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his answer. I have another question to the honourable Minister. The FSC workers are happy now. My question is, what have you got for the farmers? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a new question but, again, I love to answer it because the farmers are listening. It will be better than last year’s price. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question is based on the first 12 minutes of uttering by the honourable Minister about the sugarcane industry. What I would like to know is, what is the current global market price for sugar at this point in time? As simple as that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this honourable Member is deaf or what. I said $2,000 per tonne. Go back and listen to my speech.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>541 National Disaster Management Office (Question No. 33/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on how the Ministry through the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) is working with stakeholders to address the issues of flooding due to drainage issues? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, first of all, I would like to digress for a little moment and try to clarify some of the issues that honourable Premila Kumar had pointed out yesterday, regarding the revived Rural Housing Programme. She was saying that it was not revived, but just an old programme that was part of what they had done. Allow me to clarify, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Rural Housing Programme is a testimony and legacy to the previous Government’s failure of trying to mainstream development programmes, particularly for our rural population. There are two schemes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and compared to that, we have five at the moment. It is important to note that the above two schemes also include Social Welfare Scheme, which was causing them issues in the end. The programme was transferred to the Ministry of Housing in the 2018-2019 Financial Year with approximately $0.76 million outstanding deposit as a one-third contribution for the 113 applicants. In the last five years, when the programme was with the Ministry of Housing, only 86 applicants were processed, which is equivalent to around 17 applicants per year, compared to about 6,000 applicants that we received. In the same period, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Government never received new applications but ended up withdrawing the applicant’s one-third contribution as part of the Rural Housing Reform Programme. A balance of 27 applicants with approximately $296,056 were recorded at the end of the financial year. As a result, when it was transferred to our Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had to go through the very arduous task of returning the one-third contribution that they had already received. That is only the clarification of yesterday’s answer that I gave. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in answer to the question today from the honourable Member, I thank him for his question. It is an update on the Ministry’s work facilitated by the National Disaster Management Office in collaboration with stakeholders to address the issue of flooding caused by drainage problems. In accordance with the provisions outlined in the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998, the Prevention and Mitigation Committee holds the responsibility of formulating policies directed towards disaster mitigation and prevention. Recently, the NDMO convened a meeting to comprehensively address the drainage issue through a holistic Government approach. During this session, the Prevention and Mitigation Committee identified feasible short-term measures, emphasising the necessity of an integrated strategy, involving stakeholders such as the Fiji Roads Authority, Municipal Councils and the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>542</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the focus was on maintaining clear roadsides and urban and field drainage systems to facilitate the uninterrupted flow of rainfall runoff to designated outlets. Following the recent flooding in the Central Division, a Multidisciplinary Team, led by the Commissioner Central, swiftly mobilised to assess the areas of concern and identified potential gaps in our disaster mitigation efforts. This approach underscores our commitment to ensuring the resilience of our communities in the face of natural disasters. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a list of priority roads and choke points that have led to floods in the last two years, was given to the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways for their contractors to attend to and desilt and clear where required. The Ministry of Local Government was also requested to advice all Municipal Councils to be on alert and attend to all critical drainage and choke points during heavy rains to prevent build-up of runoff that contributes to flooding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same vein, there is a concerted effort by Municipal Councils to promote continuous public and community awareness on cleanliness and rubbish collection to avoid blocked drains from households. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of urban flooding is also a matter of civic pride and responsibility, as rubbish and debris from households are often a major contributory factor to drainage systems being clot and the onus lies with individual households to collaborate with authorities in maintaining clear drains and outlets. I would dare say it is a challenge also to the Ministry of Education in maybe adding that as part of the curriculum and also just the general public, to ensure that we take this lesson to our homes when we go back. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDMO, together with the Divisional Commissioners, form sub-national level taskforces as part of our coordinated responses to address recurring instances of flooding. These taskforces are led by the Divisional Commissioners and comprise of representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, Ministry of Local Government, Water Authority of Fiji and Fiji Roads Authority. The taskforces, Mr. Speaker, Sir, met for formulate quick fix measures to address flooding in urban and rural localities particularly, and this is related to drainage and debris management. This approach is in alignment with SDG11 of making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. In particular, one of the targets is to substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements, adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters and develop and implement in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the long-term plan that the NDMO is currently developing is a National Disaster Risk Reduction Plan with the assistance of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The Plan is now piloted for the Western Division, is almost completed, and it includes mapping of vulnerable areas prone to flooding, and this will guide development planning in urban and rural areas to ensure that development does not exacerbate flood risk. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue to implement ongoing interventions to address the issue at hand, I acknowledge the re-establishment of the Drainage Board, as announced by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways earlier this week. This will ensure a proactive and</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>543 systematic approach in the clearing of blocked drains and natural waterways that are causing flooding due to accumulation of debris and desilting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise to our citizens the importance of proper waste management. I do concur and support the previous statement made by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways in this august Parliament on Monday, that it is crucial for each community, household and individual to take responsibility in the appropriate disposal of their rubbish. Failure to do so will not only lead to blocked drains, which is now visible in almost all drains around us, but also will be exacerbating the risk of flooding, as well as creating breeding grounds for mosquitos in stagnant water. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this all-hands-on- deck approach requires the support and cooperation of all stakeholders, including those in the Opposition, particularly in changing the mindset and behavioural change towards proper waste management, given its important contribution for sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is concerning to note that more lives are lost to vector-borne diseases, such as LTDD, leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue and diarrhoea due to the direct impacts of flooding and heavy rainfall. This underscores the urgent need for collective action and collaboration on improving waste management. I cannot overstate the significance of citizens’ adherence to proper waste disposal practices. I urge honourable Members of this august Parliament and fellow citizens, let us unite in our efforts to promote responsible waste management and mitigate the associated risks to public health and safety. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge the honourable Minister perhaps just to pick up and continue with the work on rural development because regardless of whether it is in the Ministry of Housing or whether it is in the Ministry of Rural Development this is about the basic needs for our rural people. A lot has been done particularly by the Ministry when it was with Rural Development in terms of clearing the backlog from yester years. So, he just needs to pick it up and carry forward, Mr. Speaker. You have talked about you DRR Policy. You are answering a question related to flooding due to drainage issues but most of the flooding in Fiji is because of the major rivers and streams. Under the Sendai Framework that you have mentioned, early warning systems is so important. What are your plans about the early warning systems in the major rivers and streams in order to mitigate and raise the level of resilience for our communities? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- The early warning systems that we had, some are already installed in some of the major rivers in Ba and Lautoka. There were some issues that we had met this time around. Some of the gauges were not picking up. So, we have got the Korean team coming over to have a look. The plan is to ensure that all the major inlets coming down from the hills, the ones that are causing flooding, those are the ones that we want the river gauges to be deployed up to. At the moment, it depends on the donor members who come forward to deliver those systems. At the moment, the Koreans are the ones who had delivered those systems and those were the ones that were installed in Ba and Lautoka and in the areas surrounding and we intend to keep moving it around to other areas. In some areas, the issues we were finding that some of the members of the public were causing damage to it. In some place the solar system was tampered with, some were stolen. In some other</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>544</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 areas, some technical equipment were also tampered with. So, those are the kind of issues that we are facing as we are trying to deploy these systems all over the country. HON. S. TUBUNA.- My question to the honourable Minister, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and Local Government Authorities also involved with flooding, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament of how he will ensure that there is no duplication of efforts between NDMO and other related agencies? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the taskforce has been established to address the sudden onset of flooding and tree hazards. The team operates in real time to respond promptly to flooding incidents collaborating with Department of Waterways. The Drainage Board which just been established is an institutionalise cognition forum responsible for overseeing drainage and irrigation infrastructure management. While the Board focuses on mitigation such as drainage, maintenance and dredging, the primary mandate of the taskforce is to coordinate resources which is response from both Government and private sectors to respond effectively to flooding events and minimise the impact. So, you will see that there will be no duplication of effort in that way, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Fiji’s National Standardisation Strategy (Question No. 35/2024) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the importance of Fiji’s National Standardisation Strategy, its requirement and benefits? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Standardisation Strategy will provide a policy roadmap making sure that our National Strategic Priorities and Development objectives are supported by relevant national and international standards. In this case, the development and adoption of standards should be guided by a comprehensive understanding of national priorities across various sectors such as trade, building, construction, tourism and environment to name a few. The all-encompassing strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will also consider emerging sectors that are expected to play significant roles in the future ensuring that standards evolve to support innovation and growth for an economy. Mapping national priorities to standards also helps prioritising Fiji’s resources towards achieving specific development targets. The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) for which Fiji is a member provides significant investment in capacity building for countries that want to develop their national standardisation strategies. The Ministry has recently completed virtual training workshops on the ISO methodology on developing National Standardisation Strategies with ISO and more virtual meetings will be expected as that strategy work commences. Being the only full member of the ISO amongst its Pacific neighbours gives Fiji a unique position to influence regional standardisation initiatives. The strategy is an excellent policy advocacy too, it is also important because the exercise will involve conducting assessments or priority sectors and stakeholder interest which are essential in the standardisation process.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>545 Furthermore, the Ministry will be engaging with stakeholders who are users, contributors and potential users of standards ensuring that the resulting standards are comprehensive, relevant and widely accepted within the respective industries. The Ministry plans to develop the strategy of the next 18 months and we are positive with the technical support by development partners that we will be able to use this collaboration to enhance the quality and effectiveness of our standards as a national strategy. The Ministry will prioritise stakeholder engagement in developing the strategy as it plans to work closely with the members of the Trade Standards Advisory Council, technical committees, sub- committees of the National Standard Board or the Department of National Trade Measurement and Standards (DNTMS), industry, professional associations, core-government agencies, and of course, NGOs. Key stakeholders are significantly affected by standardisation processes and their participation in such consultations remain vital. The National Standardisation Strategies work taskforce comprising of senior members of the Ministry of Trade including professionals with the knowledge and experience in standards will be involved in this work. The taskforce may include specialists from other sectors outside the National Standards body on a case-by-case basis. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the ISO methodology, the taskforce will see that the following processes are undertaken: • Conducting an analysis of priority sectors of the national economy; • Conducting an analysis of a social and non-economic priority areas; • Reviewing National Development Plans to identify new and emerging centres that are • expected to have significant importance in the future; and of the top of my head ICT sector and the BPO sector is probably one of the most obvious ones combining economic, non-economic and priorities from these newly emerging sectors into a single work obtaining inputs and feedback from stakeholders and developing a list of topics for the required new national standards that correspond to priority sector areas. In a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the standard is primarily a combination of the socio-economic assessment which identifies areas that needs standardization together with stakeholder priorities based on critical areas I have mentioned. The proposal ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be to turn these areas into standards identifying national needs which could undergo identical adoption or modified adoption depending on the final recommendations of the taskforce put together after substantial or extensive consultation. A National Standardization Strategy for Fiji could indeed provide a framework for alignment on a regional level collaborating with other Pacific countries. You would have noted the honourable Prime Minister’s mention of Fiji being the hub of the Pacific. By identifying common elements and priorities among these national strategies, Fiji can contribute once again significantly to the development of joint standards for the benefit of the region. Also, as co-Chair to the Pacific Islands Standards Committee, Fiji’s leadership can advance this project and foster greater cooperation and harmonisation across the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by saying that having a National Standardization Strategy will map out the future standardization in Fiji. We do not only assess our current needs and challenges. However, we also have the ability to use information available to develop future looking policy tools, in this case the National Standardisation Strategy. A national strategy that will forecast standardisation solutions though the adoption of international or national standards that can change the dynamics of trade, product performance, safety and linking climate change mitigation and economic efficiency.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>546</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, standards play a very important role in everyone’s lives, whether you are buying medicine, construction materials or anything for that matter. It can take your life away if the standards are not in order or it can enhance your living condition if the standards are of an applicable level, in terms of insurance, et cetera. The question that I have for the honourable Minister is, the DNTMS that we have plays a very important role, is there any plan for the Minister to give the importance it deserves and try and create a statutory body so that it can also get donor funding and do its job better? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Kumar for that excellent question. That is exactly where we are headed. Basically, we see great potential in the enhancement of a centralised standards body. We have some capacity issues, we also have some infrastructure needs, and we feel that through a strategy that is well articulated and then bring in the development partners, we can develop something that has not only national significance but more importantly regional significance, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hope that answers the question. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, just listening to your presentation on this, there are organisations or institutions that use devices, measuring or weighing devices, even for those that use meter to charge fees or fare. This problem of going off this standard, I know there are a lot of complaints coming about the e-card system because of these devices failing to redeem bus fare cards and the recalibration process to bring them back. You mentioned something about getting back the system. How do you, under this strategy, ensure that the compliance level is there all the time so people will not be overcharged or undercharged or the wrong weighing and those kind of things are happening to the customers? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tuinaceva for his very good question. There are programmes in place for monitoring, let us say for example, all the weighing machines we see around Fiji, they are regularly checked sort of on a progressive basis. Also, just as an information to Parliament, the speed guns for the Police, that has to be checked as well. There are standards and programmes in place to monitor and are checked regularly. I think it is fair to say, I am sure honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Koya can agree to this, there is probably more capability if resource this year better to do a much better job. For example, we have standard weights to check machines and some of the weights have been around for quite some time and are beyond their use by date, but we still use them because of budgetary constraints. These are some of the challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have but we are progressively trying to work on them. There are two pieces of legislation under DNTMS that needs to be reviewed. Those are in the legislative programme now to be reviewed as well. I am comfortable that we do have regular checking, but I think we can do more. Perhaps a bit of less resourcing or maybe working smarter with some technology. If I may be allowed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just because I have some time just to divulge a bit. I know honourable Tuinaceva mentioned something about e-Ticketing. That is also under active consideration by the Government at the moment. Hopefully we can come and make some announcements soon on that particular aspect, hopefully in the next session of Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move on, before I offer the floor to honourable Peni Ravunawa in his question, I would like to acknowledge members of the public in the gallery. Thank you for making yourselves available to come and attend and observe the sitting today.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>547 A special mention goes to Komal and her parents. You do not mind standing up, Komal? (Acclamation) She has been a long serving member of our Secretariat. It has taken a while for other ethnic groups in our society to show that keenness in coming to work in our Parliament and Komal has been an outstanding staff. We are going to lose her; she will be moving across from Monday to her new workplace at the UNDP. At this juncture, I would like to thank your parents who are sitting here. We are so proud of your invaluable support all these years to your daughter especially for her going abroad, coming back and understand she is now married. We wish her well and wish the family well. Thank you very much. Medical Imaging Science Technologists (Question No. 36/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament of the strategies in place to address the critical shortage of almost 30 vacancies for Medical Imaging Science Technologists in public hospitals? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Medical Imaging Science Technologist, the cadre at the moment is facing shortage as it is. In replying to the honourable Member’s Oral Question, I would like to first brief the honourable Members of this august Chamber and the public who are watching what the Medical Imaging Science Technologists do in the hospitals, before I touch on the strategies that the Ministry is currently doing, in terms of retention and holding back some of our graduates and staff. Medical Imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions from detecting cancerous tumours, to assessing bone fractures. Medical Imaging Technologists (MIT) have revolutionised modern healthcare. Fiji has also seen its self-radiological imaging development in the last two decades with the introduction of high-quality ultrasound, technology, computerised axial, tomography or commonly known as CT Scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging known as MRI capabilities both in the public and private sector, the availability and accessibility of these highly advanced testing technologist for our people have dramatically increased. These advances in healthcare are very positive for the people of Fiji and contribute greatly for the overall achievement of the health targets under the SDGs. With these new technological developments, there is also the important need to ensure that our medical imaging workforce are well trained and equipped to handle these new technologies and deliver the services that our people expect to receive at our health facilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue with critical shortages and what the Ministry is doing about it, the Ministry is taking the MITs submission into consideration, the reason for its resignation and high turnover. The Department of Radiology has submitted a proposal for a salary restructure for MITs. Additionally, incentives for those who will be posted in the subdivisional hospitals and maritime zones which include housing allowance and on call allowance are being considered. This will motivate MITs to take up posting as all MITs have resigned from their respective stations and moved on to the private sector. All maritime posts are currently vacant and CWM Hospital is providing staff to relieve on a rotational basis throughout Fiji.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>548</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the private sector and overseas countries offering better working conditions for MITs, this is the only way to retain our current human resource. The competitive markets are targeting our experienced MITs as they do not progress in their salary scale even after five years to 10 years on the job. The public sector is losing our skilled MITs as it takes years to train them on special modality such as ultrasound, CT and MRI. With the proposal submitted, this has been factored in to allow experienced MITs to progress up the ladder in their salary band. The FNU produces 25 graduates every year with 20 locals and five regional students. There were only 11 graduates who had applied this year, with the rest going straight to the private sector for employment. As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry hopes to work with FNU to roll out an intensive programme similar to what we have with doctors and the dentists. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, not really a supplementary questions but would like to commend the honourable Minister for forward looking because when the graduates leave the public sector to go to the private sector, the salary that they are looking for is only $2,000 margin. It is critical right now, it is good that we are looking into incentivising these officers for the speciality that they do for the healthcare service. Thank you, Sir. Physical Education - Music, Arts and Crafts (PEMAC) (Question No. 37/2024) HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on how the Ministry is aiming to improve Physical Education, Music, Arts and Craft (PEMAC) in schools throughout Fiji? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to respond to the question raised by the honourable Tuiwailevu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education, not only aims to improve Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) and TVET subject areas, but we acknowledge the crucial role that Physical Education, Music, Arts and Craft (PEMAC) plays in the holistic development of our children and our education system and provides equal opportunities for children in Fiji to unearth and showcase their God-given talents. First and foremost, through all the communication platforms, our Heads of Schools are constantly reminded about the importance of strengthening and maximising the existing learning time allocated to all PEMAC classes in both, primary and secondary school level. That means PEMAC classes should be used to teach the skills in these subjects. Strengthening of PEMAC also includes allocation of adequate resources for facilities, equipment and having qualified teachers. Moreover, equally important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is restoring our multi-pronged community partnership approach. One is our local partnership at community level with local artists, musicians and sports organisations to provide additional opportunities for students which include, teaching traditional art like mat weaving, tapa designing, traditional pottery making and wood carving. Partnering with communities in teaching traditional songs with musical instruments, accompaniment alike, like the use of lali, ukulele, dholak and guitar to reverse the trend of programme music. This aims to preserve our traditional heritage and knowledge, and an opportunity</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>18 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>549 for income earning, especially in our thriving tourism industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Teachers Registration Authority (FTRA) facilitates this partnership, along with the need for the development of an accelerated short course on teaching our own community partners, techniques on how to teach. Second, Mr. Speaker Sir, is a partnership with Government and corporate entities. They have already started reviving partnership with the corporate and Government entities so the Ministry of Education can reinstate music and drama festival such as Tadra Kahani, Fiji War Dance Competition, film making and Fiji Times or design school newspapers. I strongly believe that with these strategies reinforced again in our school system, they will reduce unwanted behaviour and criminal activities like that are escalating in society amongst our students, both at primary and secondary school level. The adage – an idle mind is a devil’s workshop would be encountered by organised educational activities that my Ministry partners with the community at large. These strategies will ensure that our children are empowered and equipped with life skills that will potentially lead to professional careers and income opportunities. HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to ask my supplementary question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Most of us have seen the beautiful photo of Dr. Hussein, the first local student to receive PhD, Philosophy in FNU and most of our students too in school wore the traditional garland during the graduation. My question is will the art of making salusalu or traditional garland be included in the craft curriculum in schools? MR. SPEAKER.- I think before the honourable Deputy Prime Minister answers that question, honourable Assistant Minister, it is for your Ministry to look into that. That involves a lot of very important aspects of our culture and tradition and that needs to be safeguarded, even to the extent of it being patient. So, I think you are answering your own question, but I leave it to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister to answer. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I officiated the graduation at USP and FNU and just seeing the faces all with this traditional garland - the sisi, I was quite impressive, just about everyone graduating had a sisi, and I asked the Chancellor of FNU, “How do you make this?” It is so much in demand, it can be an industry on its own and I am just hoping that it can also be part of the crafts that we can teach our students. I understand it comes from the vau tree where you cut it and soak it in water for a couple of days and then you take off the bark. So, it is a craft that we need to teach across the country because the demand for sisi is quite huge, not only for Fiji, even our people overseas want the sisi. So, I like that question because I will ask our team to include this in the curriculum in terms of crafts for our students. The economic value must be huge because one sisi now cost about $60 to $80, so there is quite an economic value in this one. I was just worried that maybe the raw materials may not be there, so we need to plant a lot of vau. The danger here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that someone was using the bark of the mangrove ( dogo) and that is danger. We we do not want to encourage that, we rather just stick with the vau - the traditional material for sisi. But it is something that I will ask the Ministry to try and encourage as a craft for our young people. HON. H. CHAND.- I have a very simple question. Recently many teachers have resigned and that may have created gaps in schools, especially secondary schools. For effective delivery of</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>550</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>18 th April, 2024 PEMAC lessons, qualified teachers are needed in specific areas, especially PE, Music and Art and Craft. My question is, what is the Ministry’s plan to address the issues until the gaps are filled? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- If I listen correctly, Mr. Speaker, there is a general question regarding the whole teaching profession or is that PEMAC?</p></body>
