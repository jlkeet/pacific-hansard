<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p>New and Innovative Approaches for MSME Businesses (Question No. 25/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the new and innovative approaches to raise funds for MSME businesses? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I, obviously, launch into my response, I may be allowed just to comment on the word “wizardry” by honourable Ravunawa, who is a fellow clansman from Tailevu and from Tokatoka. So, we know how they manipulate words, Sir. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am somewhat surprised that the honourable Members on the other side are preoccupied with the imagery of Nabukalou Creek. It is about the second or third time they have mentioned it this week. I think sometimes in our lives, imagery hurts if it resonates and is telling the truth. Imagery hurts when it is signifying the truth. The truth hurts sometimes so I will use the words of honourable Tabuya, and I quote, “ ciqoma, jiloma. ” (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to answer the question and I thank honourable Vocea for the question. Please, allow me to start with some obvious facts. I will start off by saying that for any business to grow, expand or diversify, it needs a capital injection. That can come in the form of an equity where you contribute your own funds or access to finance where you actually lend money from a bank or some sort of institution. I guess it is no secret that access to finance remains a major challenge for MSMEs, not only in Fiji but globally. There are several ways that small or large businesses can raise funds from the formal or informal sector and, obviously, it involves using retirement funds or borrowing funds or cashing up on stocks and those kinds of ways of funding. To answer the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the People’s Coalition has endeavoured to do is try and look at some innovative ways to raise funding or finance to particularly assist the small to medium enterprises in Fiji. As we know, some of the most aspiring startups in our country do not have personal savings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, or a strong network of friends or relatives that can actually allow them to lend money and sometimes they do not qualify for grants. In Fiji, just as a matter of fact,, it is recorded that MSMEs make up 95 percent of all businesses and less than 20 percent of them have access to credit from formal lending institutions. The in-depth assessment of the MSME landscape, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reported that there is a funding gap of up to $2.2 billion in Fiji. This demonstrates the excess demand there is for finance from the financial sector. In the last financial year within our Ministry alone, we had received excess demand for grant applications up to four times more than our budgetary allocation. So, even this year, there is already a funding gap we can see of about $2.5 million.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>470</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, one may ask, what are we doing about it? We must create the enabling environment that will unlock finance in a more seamless manner. We need to be innovative, forward looking, inclusive and entice private sector to increase their investments. We are working on developing the robust MSME ecosystem, as we have mentioned, that connects the dots better and fosters more innovation productivity and stimulates economic activity. With the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF), we are developing a law that will enable alternative sources of financing to be introduced into Fiji, apart from the traditional way of raising funds for businesses. The draft Bill was approved by Cabinet in November 2023 for public consultations. During the consultations, we have received positive responses and also important feedback from the business community. This will be the first in the South Pacific, while Australia and New Zealand already have similar legislation, that enabled them to undertake these forms of capital raising for businesses. Just to explain the methods of financing, the first method of raising funds under the Bill is called Small Offers. Small Offers is basically where an equity based financial modality whereby a business will have the ability to seek limited capital injection of up to $2 million into a business from a limited pool of investors (up to about 48 investors) that include family, friends and business networks. The second method is Crowdfunding, and this will be undertaken through two structures either through equity or debt-based Crowdfunding. Essentially Crowdfunding provides a way of raising money on an approved online platform to fund businesses, including MSMEs. The RBF will be issuing licences to the online platform provider that acts as an intermediary between the business and the investor/lender. The Bill also details the disclosures or information that the businesses must provide before seeking request for funds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary, these are alternative ways that the Government will try to introduce equity or financing for our small businesses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the conclusion of the current consultations, the Bill is being vetted and will be presented at the next Cabinet sitting. Subsequently, the Bill will go through its own consultations and then make its way into this august Parliament. When the Bill is ready to be brought to Parliament, which I am eagerly looking forward to, we will definitely have more discussions and debates on the Bill. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that one has to look at the funding for the MSMEs. Currently, big businesses can get access to loans at a very cheap interest rate, sometimes 2 percent or 3 percent, but when it comes to small businesses, they struggle, despite the Government trying to get assistance or setting up some mechanism to assist MSMEs through Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) as well as Fiji Development Bank (FDB), but that is not sufficient. We do have some loan sharks through which MSMEs try and raise loans or get some money to get on with their business. Also, we have other micro-financing agencies and they charge very exorbitant rate of interest. Sometimes it is 20 percent, and it is not even viable to borrow from them. We look forward to what the Bill is all about, and my question to the honourable Minister is, on that initial step of consultation on the Bill, which stakeholders were involved in the initial stages of discussion? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we consulted quite extensively and that involved Vanua Levu and Viti Levu both, in traditional settings as well as the normal business MSME consultation. I think it is the first round of consultations and I am sure if we take this Bill through the normal process, there will be another opportunity to do some more consultations.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>471 For me, Mr. Speaker, this kind of new mechanisms are only successful if they are simple and workable. Uptil now, I am heartened by the fact that I have not heard any negative suggestions about the funding mechanisms, but I am keen to hear more because it is very important. Sometimes we think we know the answer, yet, we are totally missing the need, particularly for MSME. I look forward to the deliberations that will continue once the Bill gets through Cabinet and just to ensure that we put out something as practical and benefits what is potentially a very big sector for Fiji which is the MSME, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the honourable Minister, perhaps, clarify more on the difference between Small Offers and Crowd Funding because you did not mention any figures on both, Small Offers and Crowdfunding? That $2 million that you were referring to, is that the MSME turnover or is that the debt ceiling that is available to them? What is available for Crowdfunding as well in terms of that? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the guidelines provided by the RBF, I think they are comfortable with the limit of $2 million on the total funding that can be provided under the Small Offers and Crowdfunding Scheme. I think it is a work in progress as well, but as we progress and get comfortable with the workings, perhaps the threshold might be increased. But it is really trying to target those who cannot really play in the wider spaces when it comes to financing. Again, it is a learn and see as we go, and that is consultations is important and we are keen to continue that discussion as we go through the formalisation of the process because it is very important that we can get more often than not. We suggest things and then we get a shock when we realise it is not hitting the need of the audience or the people that we are trying to target. The $2 million is actually a threshold, upper threshold you can ask for $15 million or $20 million or whatever, but the $2 million is like a cap on the funding, just to create some prudential guidelines. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while listening to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica, especially the proposal that he has placed forward, he was talking about equity and then funding that is going to be available to MSMEs to get from commercial banks and other institutions. What is funny, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that when FijiFirst used to give grants, we were criticised and now dinau to MSMEs. How can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister justify by increasing the burden whereby MSMEs have to give equity and 80 percent funding will be dinau? They are already struggling, the economy is not doing good and then they will have to pay the loan. What kind of funding is this? HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this modality of funding, the investor decides what sort of level of return that they wish to impose. Because it is targeted specifically at the start up market, it is only venture capitalists who have the money that actually go in and play in those spaces. Again, we can all just rely on grants and leave it there, but we do have limited funds. Then if a ventured capitalist comes along and sells for zero cost, I will offer some businesses in Fiji up to a potential equity injection of $100,000 to $200,000. That will go a long way for an MSME. It is not a loan.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- You said about equity:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Equity can be a loan or it can be an actual injection from you own pocket:</span> You are being semantic, unfortunately, honourable Maharaj.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>472</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 The fact of the matter is that we are trying to create solutions. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- If you had listened to what we have been saying since this morning, this Government is committed to economic diversification. Stimulating the MSME market is a key pillar of the People’s Coalition’s strategy for economic diversification. Actually, you had zero economic diversification during your time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I think honourable Maharaj did need the banks to support his business, even though he tried very hard, but the end result was not that good. But when his business was running well, the banks were writing to him, seeking how best they can offer. He has been through the mill. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; this women’s bank that has been targeted by the honourable Minister for Women all along and may be an opportunity also, have you consulted with her and I did not hear you mentioning it in your answer. Is it one of those solutions also, or you have thrown it out, you did not consult it with her? (Laughter) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for the question, there is a bit of conspiracy going in there, Mr. Speaker. Again, it is a difference between that side of Parliament and this side. I have been privately having a discussion with honourable Tabuya on what we can do in that space. Really, once she forms the views of the Ministry, we will be there to help her, Sir. There is already a women’s bank out there, the SPBD that we know of, but it does not mean that it does not need to end there, there are other mechanisms that be used, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am not sure why they are so critical. They should be happy that we are trying to find more ways to fund MSMEs, or are they suggesting that we should not have any SMEs funding.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I think that imagery of Nabukalou Creek is somewhat flooding their view of things:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Selection Criteria - Appointment of Special Administrators (Question No. 26/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament on the selection criteria and tools employed in the appointment of Special Administrators for towns and cities? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was hoping for another honourable Member to ask me the question before Parliament this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question by honourable Chand, first, I would like to join the previous speakers in wishing our Hindu brothers and sisters a Happy Rama Navami.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>473 I think it is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to understand why Special Administrators are appointed and the rationale behind the appointment of these Special Administrators. The concept of Special Administrators was introduced in 2009 by the previous Administration under section 9A of the Local Government Act 1972 going to suspend election of Councillors and reduce the independence of the Municipal Councils. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a reorganisation of Municipalities done to bring two Councils together into clusters. That was done purely for the purpose of administration, sharing of resources and ease of management. However, this reorganisation created more problems than benefits. The Special Administrators working for two Councils had lost touch with the ratepayers and residents for some Municipalities. Why? Because they did not reside within those Municipalities. The above has created issues like, lack of town rates collection initiatives, and even not attending to issues and complaints by ratepayers and residents in a timely manner. The needs and interests of the Councils differ, Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore, the Special Administrators were not able to focus time and resources to both Councils, which was detrimental to the Councils. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the need for improvement and to ensure the Special Administrators in office supported the efforts of the Government and prepare the Councils for Local Government Elections, a review of the performance was approved by Cabinet in January 2023, leading to subsequent actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government’s appointment of Special Administrators marks the beginning of a transformative phase for local governance - the phase of elections. This will pave way for a new era of accountable and transparent Local Government. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Answer the question!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I will come back to the question:</span> Please, listen.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the review indicated that despite several discussions and consultations with former Special Administrators regarding the services of the Councils, mainly the Special Administrators were not active in attending to the matters of the Councils or the issues of interest of the residents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were several other major challenges noted in our review which included, supervision and monitoring of Municipal Council capital projects. Poor monitoring of basic essential services, like waste collection and management was a concern, and demands innovative and new approach. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another fundamental concern was the Councils’ internal governance and control measures, which were weak. Most of the Councils had outdated SOPs that needed urgent attention. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a change of mindset was required, especially with regards to the reliance of the Central Government for funding of projects and other basic services due to income limitations. Now, we have empowered the new Special Administrators to think outside the box, to be innovative and initiate strategies that would bring about financial sustainability in their own Municipalities, irrespective of their size. The reinstatement of market stall fees, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an example of a revenue stream</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>474</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 that can assist Municipalities financially, especially in smaller Councils. These small Councils need cash flow so by collecting stall fees on a monthly basis, it supports the way they do their business. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move to the criteria, I want to emphasise some of the remarkable achievements of these new Special Administrators. Within just three months of assuming office, these achievements are testament to our unwavering commitment to the people, the ratepayers and to the residents of our towns and cities. For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nasinu Town Council, you must have heard in the news today.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- All political appointment:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> After undertaking an institutional review of the Council, they have successfully resolved a long outstanding issue by signing off a long outstanding union claims on Monday, 15 th April, 2024. This is, indeed, a significant achievement. For Nadi Town Council, the Council’s recent agreement with the unions and workers in January 2024, ensuring staff receive their rightful dues. This achievement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, directly benefits our hardworking workers of our Municipal Councils. Other key achievements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Nadi Market bird nesting. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Selection criteria! HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- When I first toured Nadi Town, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was the first complaint I received from the Nadi Market vendor - all the birds’ wastes in most of the tables in the Nadi Market. So, the Nadi Town Council and the new Special Administrators have fixed this. I invite the honourable Members of Parliament to go and see the work that the new Special Administrators have done for the Nadi Town Council, as well as the newly appointed Nadi Special Administrators and even the approval of the acquisition of an essential vehicle which is like a working tool, to assist the Council in the delivery of some of the services that are provided by the Nadi Town Council.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Come to the point:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Even the Sigatoka Town Council Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the two Special Administrators have installed 50 new garbage bins and it is working on 50 smart bins, enhancing waste management. Another important issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is on community engagement. When we appointed the new Special Administrators, they are connected to the ratepayers, as well as connected to the residents of their own Municipalities. Within three months, they have conducted ratepayer consultations within their Municipalities. They have done consultations for Lautoka City, Labasa Town, Savusavu Town and Nasinu Town. Tomorrow, the new Special Administrators are going to conduct consultations for Nadi Town. These achievements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, underscores the dedication of the Special Administrators and Local Government to serving the people with integrity, transparency and effective governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to outline the selection criteria for Special Administrators, which includes the following - competence with diverse experiences, people with business entrepreneurial</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>475 skills, former decorated civil servants, lawyers, architects and doctors, in their respective towns and cities. Most importantly Sir, is that they have the passion to serve their Municipalities. Next is our commitment and availability, they are required to be committed to serving the residents of their respective towns and cities. Another one on diversity and inclusivity. Most of the Special Administrators appointed, there is a good mix of gender in the appointment of the new Special Administrators. There is one female Special Administrator. One is currently the Chairperson of the Nausori Town Council. HON. K. K. LAL.- What about the NFP appointment there? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Special Administrators are expectd to prioritise the interests of the ratepayers first, then themselves later. The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is leadership and communication. They must have the potential and qualities to lead, while serving their Municipalities. They must have the skills and competence to engage with their communities, so community engagement is very important. They have to be strategic. They must have the skills to be strategically thinkers. When you are a strategical thinker, you should be able to solve problems on more analytically. Preference is given to candidates who are residents of towns and cities where they ought to serve. Following an expression of interest through an advertisement in the local newspapers, applicants meeting the criteria were shortlisted. The final Special Administrators were appointed in December 2023 by the Minister of Local Government with the endorsement of the honourable Prime Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Very good:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> For the larger Councils, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are four Special Administrators appointed - one for the medium and small Councils, three Special Administrators were appointed. The Ministry undertook due diligence to ensure compliance and some legal requirements were adhered to. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also developed various documents, including Appointment Letters, Code of Conduct, the duration of confidentiality and interest and resource manuals, all reviewed by legal authorities. The Special Administrators also signed the Conflict of Interest and Confidentiality Declarations and adhered to Code of Conduct to maintain integrity and public trust. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Local Government elections is being prioritised by the Coalition Government, it is vital as Special Administrators are committed to the cause and will support the Government’s efforts to reinstate the Councils. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are also guided by policies promoting governance, transparency and accountability. The Ministry also developed and reviewed policies and manuals to help them in undertaking their new roles as newly appointed Special Administrators. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government is committed to establishing accountable, responsive and efficient Municipal Councils, ensuring good governance, practices and public</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>476</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 confidence in the Local Government System. I thank you once again, Mr. Speaker, for giving me time to respond to the question before Parliament this afternoon. HON. H. CHAND.- According to a media report and I have the report with me dated 3 rd January, 2024, the General Secretaries from the three Political Parties - SODELPA, PAP and NFP had chosen and went through the list before it was sent to Cabinet for approval. (Chorus of interjections) HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in breach of the OMRS Guidelines. According to OMRS Guidelines, the recruitment process should be fair and transparent to eliminate any nepotism and discrimination. Mr. Speaker, Sir, many meritorious applicants were not considered because according to concerned applicants, the due process was not followed. My question to the honourable Minister, can he inform the Parliament why the selection of Special Administrators was based on the three Political Parties’ recommendation? (Honourable Members interject) HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, I wish to respond to the question by honourable Chand. I will explain, Sir, the criteria on the selection of the Special Administrators, as well as the expression of interest that was advertised in the local dailies. Sir, everyone was given the chance to apply. We received a total of 166 applications, so they were chosen. That was the prerogative of the Minister with the endorsement of the honourable Prime Minister, that has led to the confirmation of the appointment of the new Special Administrators. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, I feel pity for the honourable Minister in trying to explain the mess that was created by the Coalition agreement to appoint the Special Administrators. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Ministry of Local Government Expression of Interest, criteria of expression of interest number one on residency, the applicant must be a resident in the municipality in which they seek to serve, demonstrate a deep connection and understanding of our community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to know if Naitasiri is part of Nadi because someone from Naitasiri was appointed as a Special Administrator of Nadi Town, but he declined because he cannot travel from Naitasiri to Nadi. Secondly, Sir, because honourable Minister has actually spoken for almost 25 minutes now, the simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, can the honourable Minister confirm that the appointed Special Administrators had met the residential qualification of being a resident of that particular municipality, as outlined in the Expression of Interest? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- In 2013, there was someone living in Ba but was appointed as Special Administrator for Lautoka, as well as Special Administrator for Nadi. (Honourable Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- That is the simple answer to your question:</span></p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>477 MR. SPEAKER.- It is hard for him to answer because all of you are talking. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I just got a message from my General Secretary, who says that what honourable Chand was saying is false. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- What is your Point of Order? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- He needs to clarify whether he is just using a Fiji Sun report or whether he has got evidence to say that the three General Secretaries met to decide the appointment of Special Administrators. MR. SPEAKER.- It is quite difficult to answer that Point of Order. Are you seeking clarification on that, based on the article that honourable Chand was reading?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, what I said was, it is according to a media report dated 3 rd January, 2024, and I have the article with me. It is a media report. HON. L. D.

SPEAKER.:</span> Another Point of Order, honourable Chand. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Standing Order 44(15) and I quote: “A question must not be asked on whether statements in the press, or statements of private individuals or private concerns, are accurate.” He is asking a question from the press. You should not ask questions from the press, that is what it states here. The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was on the Nadi Special Administrator. He lives in Votualevu, Nadi, so that is misleading.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not come and lie here:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Sharma, I now offer you the floor. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, breaking news for the Coalition Government. The General Secretary of Political Parties selecting candidates was quoted by one of the General Secretaries from the Coalition. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who?</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>478</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> SODELPA, read the articles.</p><p>(Laughter) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Honourable Minister for Local Government, it is a mess. How do you justify that these appointments are based on merit and not political appointments? Secondly, do you admit this is the practice of democratic values and governance under this Coalition Government? Yes or No answer. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have already explained the criteria and the process the Ministry took prior to the appointment. I also want to mention here that they were stating that they were political appointees. I need to tell them that two of the newly appointed Administrators were part of the previous Administration. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And one of them was NFP anyway:</span></p><p>Workers’ Complaints and Labour Inspection Cases (Question No. 27/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on the investigations conducted by the Labour Standards and Compliance Services on workers’ complaints and labour inspections cases lodged with the Ministry from 1st August 2023 to 31st March 2024? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just before answering the question, I was listening to the honourable Hem Chand talking about the Open Merit and Recruitment System (OMRS). I was the General Secretary of the Fiji Teachers Union when he appointed Head Teachers (almost 600 of them), outside the OMRS and the Minister who questioned him was honourable Premila Kumar.
