<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Fiji Airways’ Charter Policies and Procedures (Question No. 20/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament of Fiji Airway’s charter policies and procedures they follow when processing charter requests? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer this question, I think it is important for me to state this. If the Opposition were to be in Government and we were in the Opposition, and if we were going to ask this question, we would have been told that it is a private company. It is a private company in which Government has more than 50 percent share and that is why, Sir, as a Government, we will present to Parliament the Annual Reports and Financial Reports of the Fiji Airways in May. But let me answer this question on the policies and procedures followed by Fiji Airways when processing charter requests. These are normal commercial policies that different organisations have and they devise this as part of their check and balances and how they offer charter services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways has a very detailed set of procedures when it comes to assessing charter flights. To begin with, upon receipt of the request, the Fiji Airways Charter Team gathers all relevant information from the customer, including flight dates, number of passengers, special needs,</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>454</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 ad hoc items, potential flexibility on dates and times in case aircraft is not available on preferred dates and an assessment is conducted to determine available resources to support the requested charter, aircraft, crew, et cetera. Mr. Speaker Sir, if a request cannot be supported with the available resources, the request is declined and if the resources can support the charter, then Fiji Airways proceeds to assessing operational feasibility and cost quote. The goal with any request is to ensure that safety and security are achieved, operational feasibility is confirmed, and revenue covers the cost and justifies the efforts, complexity and a reasonable amount of risk. Operational feasibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, depending on the nature of the charter, a complex geography, short timelines, et cetera, internal teams such as the Operations Aircraft Crew, Safety and Security Ground Handling and Catering Crew, et cetera, are asked to assess the operational feasibility before the cost quote is finalised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a comprehensive analysis is conducted to determine the cost of operating the charter to Fiji Airways. This starts with an assessment of the Airline’s related costs, further proposed routes such as fuel, route costs, accommodation costs, catering, insurance, engineering, et cetera, and the expenses that are associated with any flight. This may also include the cost of flight consolidation, opportunity cost or cost to cover additional risks, particularly when operating a charter to destinations Fiji Airways does not normally operate to. Once an operational cost forecast has been assessed, a profit margin is added to the cost to finalise the quote. The quote is provided to the customer, who then has an option to accept, decline or negotiate. Fiji Airways may decide not to negotiate the rate. The charter agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon confirmation from the customer, and as I have said, which is normal in any charter services, that the cost quote is acceptable and operational feasibility is attained. A charter agreement, usually a contract is drafted and provided for sign off by both parties. Fiji Airways has a template - a charter contract drafted by its in-house legal team that is provided which can be subject to negotiation and adjustment on a case-by-case basis. On payment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from providing a cost quote, a payment timeline is negotiated with the customer and documented as a part of the agreement. And if the customer fails to meet payment, the standard charter contract gives Fiji Airways the right in its direction to cancel the charter and retain a pre-agreed cancellation fee. Alternatively, it would be open to the company to accept revised payment terms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways tendered charter contract requires full payments to be made by no later than 38 days prior to the first charter flight. More complex charters may also require initial deposits to be made before the 38 day deadline, to fund costs associated with obtaining approvals and otherwise preparing to operate a charter flight. Many charter requests are made at the last minute and within days or hours of the requested charter fights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, each case is assessed individually, and in some cases, Fiji Airways may be willing to accept other payment terms after the charter has occurred. Factors that are considered, include - 1. 2. 3. credibility, financial or reputational, of the customer; Previous business activity of the customer; and an assessment or review of the past payment history.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>455 Passenger taxes are generally finalised and paid within one to two weeks after the charter operation and all details are fully accounted. Last point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the policies and procedures adopted by Fiji Airways to assess charter flights, in my view, and anyone who looks at it would find that it is transparent, robust and all decisions, if you consider the whole policy, is based on operational feasibility and is in the best interest of the company, without bias or political intervention, as claimed by some in the recent case. So, that, in a nutshell, is the process, the procedures and the assessment when a charter flight is requested or booked with Fiji Airways. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his comprehensive explanation which we appreciate. During the FijiFirst time, we never had a ‘travel first pay later’ scheme but now, with the Coalition Government during their time, a so-called private company which was funded by the Government, the pensioners or which we can call FNPF account holders and we all have shares in it, so being commercial, honourable Minister, why in this particular case such as small deposit was taken by Fiji Airways when they were assessing this charter arrangement - a very small deposit? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two points. I think the honourable Member is confusing herself. It is a private company in which Government has more than 50 percent share and that is the point we were making that if Government has survived eight years, it is like other organizations where Government has more than 50 percent share, which means that taxpayers are involved and, therefore, it requires any Government in the past, except in the case of the FijiFirst Government, where they refused to bring Annual Reports, Financial Statements to this Parliament. We will do that, Sir, we will be tabling Financial Reports. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we could have done another thing in the Business Committee. We could have said, “This question is a subject of investigation.” I do not want to get into the details but let me say that any decision as per the policy, as per what I have described, the company assesses each case on its own merit. Sometimes, it may be based on the previous record, the company was involved in charter flights, it could be potential, but any company that does business will assess the risk. There is always a risk in anything any business entity does, either you book a flight, you cancel it and Fiji Airways has processes and procedures. The CEO is on record to make it very clear that as far as they are concerned, they have a payment plan that they are confident that whatever is owed to Fiji Airways will be paid and that is a normal business transaction and decision. This is within their policies, within their procedures, within their operational feasibility, cost feasibility assessment that they make and these are people who have the experience and who have the legal basis to do so. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a simple question to the honourable Minister. We understand that it is a company policy but two parts to this question. What is the update on the repayment and is Government concerned? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition, as I have said the CEO is on record to say that they have a repayment plan, already agreed and they are confident that what is due to Fiji Airways will be paid. Let me just remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition, again, Government has a majority share, the other shareholder is FNPF, and there are other minority shares by other countries as well. Of course, the Government would be concerned about any commercial company in which Government has a share and that is why, Mr. Speaker, we, on the other side, for eight years, had been</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>456</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 asking them to bring reports to Parliament because it is here in this Parliament that the report is presented, it goes to the Committees and it is debated, but they denied the taxpayers of this country for eight years. Now, we are teaching them what is transparency and that is why we are answering these questions. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification from the honourable Minister of Finance. I think in his first response, he suggested that within 38 days, payment should be made. Then during his second explanation, he went on and said that it was within the company policy to get an agreement done, whereby they will actually ensure the payment will be done to Fiji Airways. That is contradicting. If someone has actually surpassed that 38 days, is there any interest charged to the company who owes money to Fiji Airways? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think they are trying very hard to score a point. (Laughter) It is actually getting them nowhere because I said very clearly and let me just read this again for their clarification and to get their mind to ease. “Fiji Airways standard charter contract requires full payment to be made by no later than 38 days prior to the first charter flight”. Then, Mr. Speaker, I also said, in the policy, that every case is decided on its merit on a case by case basis, then there is an agreement. The agreement is there. If the agreement is not adhered to, it can happen in any commercial agreement, those who run businesses know this on a daily basis, it is being renegotiated and this is what the CEO has said very clearly, that they have a repayment plan, as per the agreement, and it will be paid. We are confident from what the CEO has told the Board, and the Board has communicated that to me as line Minister. I am confident that the company will do what is in the best interest of the company and the country to run the business in an efficient way. We are very confident in the ability of the people and the Board to deal with this effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me remind them again. They will have the opportunity to peruse, debate and discover what was happening in the Fiji Airways in the last several years from the annual reports. That is the standard that this Government is setting. That is the standard of democracy, transparency and accountability that we practise on this side, and I want the Opposition to learn from it. Revival of the Rural Housing Programme (Question No. 21/2024) HON. I. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management inform Parliament on the progress of the revived Rural Housing Programme Initiative? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I had addressed this subject in my last Ministerial Statement last year but I believe an update is due. I thank the honourable member for the question.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>457 If I can give an update on the re-establishment of the Rural Housing Unit, it was reinstated in the Ministry. This involved transfer of the Unit staff who were previously with the Ministry of Housing, who were mostly carpenters. The Head of Rural Housing Unit and other key personnel were recruited at the beginning of this year. The team is to oversee the administration of the programme from the Ministry’s Headquarters and inhouse carpenters to assist in the implementation of the Programme. Mr. Speaker Sir, the four housing schemes offered under the Rural Housing Assistance Programme are: Scheme 1 Government assistance to applicants to purchase building materials at a minimum cost of $30,000, to which Government will facilitate the cartage cost of building materials. Scheme 2 Requires the applicant to pay one-third contribution in cash, while the Ministry pays two-thirds of the total project cost. The Scheme is targeted at individual applicants with the following options: (i) (ii) Newly built house construction using the approved 24 x 16 feet house plan. The extension of an existing structure which includes the attachment of sanitation and kitchen facilities. (iii) Retrofitting of the existing structure to withstand Category 4 and Category 5 tropical cyclones. (iv) Completion of an existing structure. Scheme 3 Mainly targets timber resource owners with either pine schemes, native tree resource owners or lease beneficiary holders who can use these resources as their one-third contribution. The Ministry works with the Ministry of Forestry on this Scheme. Scheme 4 Meant to assist beneficiaries under the Family Assistance or Social Welfare Housing Scheme. This Scheme will adopt the same Rural Housing Unit Standard House Plan with additional disability friendly facilities. So, those who request this assistance needs the support of the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Programme prioritizes assistance to those who are permanently residing in villages and rural settlements and in non-urban and peri-urban areas. The Ministry is developing this initiative to maximise the assistance to the most overlooked communities in our Fiji, thus the Ministry, through the Rural Housing Assistance Programme, will work to narrow this gap. On the progress to-date, the Rural Housing Unit has produced an engineered approved designed timber framed house plan with material list as part of the Rural Housing Assistance New House Programme, and as I speak, rural and maritime communities are receiving this assistance through the four Divisional Commissioners. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry has allocated $3 million for the Rural Housing Assistance Programme in this financial year in which the Ministry has released funds for the implementation of the Programme. The Ministry is targeting to complete 130 projects in the current financial year, and the breakdown of released funds and the number of projects per Division are as follows:</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>458</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 No. 1. 2. 3. 4. Total Division Western Northern Central Eastern Number of Projects 42 23 37 28 130 Cost $816,578.32 $607,164.15 $684,365.00 $498,221.00 $2,606,328.47 This year is the first financial year that the Ministry is taking on the responsibility of Rural Housing Programme again and based on the experiences encountered this year, the Ministry is working on reviewing the Standard Operating Procedures and Guidelines for the Rural Housing Assistance Programme, taking into consideration the different earning power of our rural communities and the fluctuation of the market prices that prompted the increase and the cost of building materials. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review will also allow the inclusion of women and children privacy and promote the inclusion of safety and security of our vulnerable population in our new model design. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe, as honourable Members of this august Parliament, we are aware of the objectives of the SDGs and you have a responsibility to institute strategies to achieve those goals and targets. Sir, SDG11 relates to making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Target 11.1 states and I quote, “By 2030, ensures access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.” The Ministry is doing its best to work towards achieving this target and to ensure that our rural and maritime communities will have conducive and durable houses that they can call home. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his detailed response. I had a look at the question and chuckled to myself, the question said, “revival of rural housing programme initiative”. There was no revival as such, this programme was already revived by the Ministry of Housing with a couple of things that was done. One was the review of the policy, plus the development of various plans, like CAT4 Engineer Certified Programme, so quite a lot of work went into it. My question to you, honourable Minister is, how many projects have the Ministry completed in the 2023-2024 financial year? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the projects at the moment are ongoing, none have been completed yet. There are quite a number of applications that were received, about 6,600 applications and at the moment, we are working hard to complete whatever needs to be completed and we will come back to Parliament with a report when those projects are completed. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, we have NGOs like the Habitat for Humanity Fiji, that is heavily involved in rural housing, and those kinds of projects. In this framework or policy, do you have some kind of working partnership with them because I feel that they can be involved and assist with your projects in a bigger way? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have some working partnership with some of these NGOs, Habitat for Humanity in some projects, as well as ADRA Fiji, as I had mentioned yesterday. But as far as the Rural Housing Project is concerned, it is a purely Government enterprise. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a simple question to the honourable Minister. When the Rural Housing Unit was with the Ministry of Housing, they had come up with a new design, but you have stated that you have gone back to the normal 24 x16. So, the question honourable Minister is, has the plan been approved?</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>459 When I inquired late last year, according to your staff, it is still going through the approval process and what is critical in the plan is whether that 24 x16 also includes the ablution unit, meaning the bathroom and the toilet, because this is something that was learnt from previous disasters. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current houses that we have are engineer- certified and this has been approved by the Ministry of Works as well. Sorry, what was your second question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The ablution block:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- The ablution block is part of the plan as well:</span></p><p>Measures to Combat Increase in HIV Cases (Question No. 22/2024) HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: There is an increase in HIV cases and a contributing factor, amongst others, is the practice of injecting diluted methamphetamine into bloodstreams, then sharing the drug- infused blood with other users. Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on the measures in place to combat this issue? HON. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of what the Ministry is doing with the current surge in HIV cases within the nation, allow me to first give a brief status of the current HIV status within the nation. Sir, addressing the sharp rise in HIV cases in Fiji in recent years is, indeed, an uphill battle and will require our collective effort. Our latest Ministry statistics on HIV positive cases show a near doubling of new cases diagnosed each year from 2021 to 2023, and we anticipate that this trend will continue in 2024. However, the numbers recorded at the Ministry may only be a fraction of the real number of HIV cases in the community and this should be a concern for all of us in Parliament. I had highlighted in Parliament in the last session that injecting drug users have been reported to the Ministry to be using a new method called “blue toothing”. Blue toothing, as what honourable Lal mentioned, is a means to share injectable drugs amongst users, which involves injecting drug users, plunging a syringe of diluted methamphetamine into the bloodstream, drawing first blood and sharing the syringe with a second person who can then pass it on to a third. This is a very high risk activity which poses a number of serious health issues for those involved, such as serious adverse effects from sharing unmatched blood that includes severe anaphylactic reactions and death; transmission of serious infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C; bacterial infections at the injection site; as well as passing bacteria into the blood stream that can cause severe infections from unhygienic injecting practices. I wish to advise all IV drug users to refrain from this activity as it can lead to more serious health outcomes immediately and in the long terms for users. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to touch on to what the Ministry is doing, the solution for the HIV situation in Fiji requires several actions and approaches involving critical stakeholders collaborating or working together to comprehensively address the many aspects of the issue. The Ministry is finalising the HIV Surge Strategy which will facilitate our collaboration with health partners across Government Ministries and our communities, to – • • strengthen prevention; increase national HIV testing by 3 percent for key population groups;</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>460</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 • • • improve access to diagnoses and treatment; reduce stigma and discrimination relating to HIV/AIDS; and strengthen the governance of our HIV Response Programme. Our HIV Clinics across the country are working with stakeholders and community groups to increase awareness, understanding all the dangers relating to injecting drug usage and understanding the risks associated with the practice is important in curbing the practice amongst new and potential users. The Ministry will facilitate the decentralisation of service delivery, testing, treatment and care with oversight provided by the specialist at Sexual Reproductive Health Clinics in Fiji’s three largest Divisions, mainly Western, Central/Eastern and Northern. This will facilitate the collaboration that addresses universal access and inequity for service delivery to the public and private health sectors across the nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by reminding everyone in Fiji that unsafe sexual practice and the use of injectable drugs are contributing to the rise of HIV in Fiji. Avoiding these risky behaviours can prevent you from getting HIV infection. I also want to reiterate that having HIV is not the end of the world and not a death sentence. With treatment, people living with HIV can lead a normal and productive life and have children who are HIV infections-free. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on policy formulation and legislation, Public Health Officials need to advocate for a healthier law and policy targeting the stigmatisation of HIV and AIDS and also drug users. Stigma can discourage affected individuals from seeking necessary help. My question to the honourable Minister is, would he consider the formulation of a policy advocating non-criminal treatment of drug abuse or drug users, emphasising it as a public health concern rather than purely its legal issues and encourage the needle users or drug users to seek assistance in our public and private health facilities? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Ravunawa for his supplementary question. As I had mentioned, we have a HIV Surge Strategy that is currently in place and most likely will be implemented next month. That will incorporate all what the honourable Member has suggested and, again, it is cross-cutting across all Ministries and throughout the communities as well - from NGOs, CSOs, religious organisations, traditional leaders, et cetera. This is a task for all of us in Fiji. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, UNAIDS is a vital and essential institutional platform for the United Nations as the main advocate of accelerated and global action on stopping HIV/AIDS pandemic. However, it is noted there is a reduction in UNAIDS’ presence in Fiji, which has resulted in less support of funds for technical support given to the Ministry of Health. With the reduction in support, there is high rate of HIV incidence in this country. In 2017, there were approximately four staff based in Fiji, but this has been reduced to only one in 2023. For the same period, HIV cases has increased from 150 to 450. Honourable Minister, the question I wish to ask you, do you think that there is a high degree of correlation between the increase in the number of HIV and the decrease in funding from UNAIDS? MR. SPEAKER.- That is a very technical kind of question - correlation between the number that we have and the decrease in the funding. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to UNAIDS here in Fiji, since taking office and when I first met with the Team from UNAIDS, they were also saying</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>461 after our meeting that they will be moving their office to another region. With that being said, there is only one staff currently, she is acting as an Advisor to the UN Residency Office. I had written to UNAIDS earlier in October last year requesting that they re-consider in terms of moving their office away from Fiji. I will, again, follow that up and hopefully, I will involve the honourable Prime Minister. They are very much needed, and I look forward to that. MR. SPEAKER.- I was a bit lost on the intention of the question because it came from your Government side. (Laughter) Mining and Land Use Policies (Question No. 23/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament on the Ministry’s plan to balance economic development with environmental conservation in the context of Mining and Land Use policies? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question posed to Parliament this afternoon. It is almost given that when people talk about mining or when mining is mentioned, people often associate that word with environmental destruction and exploitation. However, as we understand the world over, mining has been around for many centuries. Mining is a crucial and perhaps, a critical component of any national development and more so particularly for those countries that have a large deposit of mineral resources because it provides for the necessary raw materials that are used in today’s developing world in construction, energy and in technology. Minerals are fundamental and are also important to the ingredients that we have in our everyday consumables, from the toothpaste that we use on a daily basis, jeans that we wear, the latest technology that we enjoy such as our mobile phones, laptops, smart televisions, all those contain products that are extracted from mining activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mining Industry contributes to Fiji’s economy through job creation and employment opportunities. This sector offer both, direct and indirect employment, positively impacting our local communities and, of course, our regional economies. Direct employment in mining involves jobs such as the miners, technicians, engineers, surveyors, administrative personnel and mine labourers, to name a few. These positions offer competitive wages and benefits, attracting skilled workers and contributing to local economy and its stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just by way of background, currently, three mining operations in Fiji employs about 2,000 people, while the exploration sector employs another 100. By the latest count, the recently opened Tuvatu Mine in Nadi has a total of 420 registered workers, plus eight expatriates, with an estimate of $120,000 being their figure of fortnightly pay. The Vatukoula Gold Mine on the other hand, employs 1,058 workers, with 19 expatriates. Their pay bill hovers around $800,000 every fortnight. It is important to mention that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mining sector continued operation, and continues to bring in the much needed employment income for our local people and boosting economic activities in their communities. These companies’ employees were not laid off,</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>462</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 but further recruitment of new staff was made. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry always strives to strike a balance between development, and when I say development, any development for that matter, not just mining, and emerging issues about environmental protection and economic growth. There is always this hard task of managing what would development caused to our environment because we are always in need of economic expansion. For mining, it is enshrined in the Mining Act 1965 and is facilitated through mineral exploration and mining, using, of course, sustainable best practices that are practised worldwide. The Ministry of Lands is mandated under the Mining Act 1965 to safeguard the environment and also the people who live around it. In addition, there are also requirements now under the Environment Management Act 2005 to which we are also aligned to. The main reason for doing that is to ensure environmental stability and protection, and when there is mining, environmental rehabilitation through a very comprehensive rehabilitation plan. Mining development approval can only be permitted if the various authorities have given their relevant endorsements. For example, the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Department of Environment and the surface lease from the iTaukei Lands Trust Board (iTLTB) are a must before any mining lease is issued. Director Mines cannot approve any application if such endorsements from these authorities, within the mining approval process, is questioned or not granted. It is also worth noting that responsibilities of environment conservation is not solely the responsibility of the Department of the Mineral Resources, but with the respective authorities of the law governing all these sectors that I have alluded to. The Department of Mineral Resources works within the premise of the legislation that regulates that resource sector in Fiji. They are the: 1. Mining Act 1965; 2. Quarries Act 1939; 3. Explosives Act 1937; 4. Petroleum (Exploration and Exploitation) Act 1978; 5. 6. Fair Share of Mineral Royalties Act 2018. International Seabed Mineral Management Act 2013; and Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the practices adopted by the Ministry to address the balance needed between development and conserving environment includes collaboration with other line Ministries such as the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, Department of Environment and Climate Change, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and other agencies that I have referred to, such as, iTLTB, Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) and the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA). While applications for mineral exploration and mining are being processed, these stakeholders are consulted to identify areas of ecological or cultural interests. If they are agreed upon, they would then be demarcated as exclusion or no-go zones in mining. Secondly, the ERA and Environment Management Plans are integral components of the application process for mining and special prospecting licence. Also, monitoring of compliance is undertaken on a quarterly basis during the mineral exploration and during the mining phase. Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a requirement for active mines to submit monthly reports to the Director of Mines which requires updates on their environmental management strategies whereas for exploration, companies need to submit quarterly reports to the Director of Mines, which include updates on the environmental management measures that they have undertaken.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>463 Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, under section 16 of the Mining Act of 1965, a performance deposit is paid to the Department of Mineral Resources that is withheld as a guarantee of their company’s performance. Part of the deposit calculation also includes and accounts for environmental rehabilitation. It is a mandatory requirement for areas disturbed from exploration activities, such as drilling, trenching, et cetera, to undergo approved rehabilitation work. For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the planting of pines for the Nawailevu Bauxite Mines, 160,000 pine trees at Nawailevu site while another 5,000 trees replanted at the second location for the sole benefit of the landowners of Nawailevu. Mining rehabilitation is value adding, taking into account post-mining land use for the benefit of the landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any land use development, including mining, protection of the environment will remain to be a challenge, not just in Fiji as a developing nation, but elsewhere around the world where there are development needs on land and sea, be it at a global, regional or local here in Fiji. That is why, Mr. Speaker, it is important to maintain the right balance between land development, the need for economic extension of a country and the absolute need for environment conservation. Section 21(1) of the State Lands Act 1945 states, and I quote: “No lease of any State foreshore land or of any soil under the waters of Fiji shall be made without the express approval of the Minister and such approval shall not be granted unless the Minister declares that such lease does not create a substantial infringement of public rights.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources has the legislative mandate or authority to allocate and approve foreshore developments in our country. However, this is done and can only be done within the ambit of ensuring that decisions are made with consistency and accountability. Together with obtaining approvals from relevant Government agencies, in addition to the Ministry’s own checklist, requirements and lease conditions, all of these aim to identify the most sustainable action between land use in the case of foreshore land and social and economic development and, on the other hand, preservation of our environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry have received complaints on the delay of obtaining ministerial approvals. This is, indeed, essential to ensure that thorough and careful considerations are made to preserve our natural landscapes, traditional values, heritage, whilst also embracing the modern opportunities that are available to develop our country and make it attractive. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry works in collaboration with the Department of Town and Country Planning in ensuring that its leases are in alignment with the Department’s land zoning system. The Town Planning Act is a guide or a checking tool for sustainable development and further, the Ministry also consults with the Land Use Division of the Ministry of Agriculture regarding the highest and the best use of all of its agricultural leases. Mr. Speaker, having to consult the Ministry of Agriculture, also allows the Ministry to issue the most suitable commodity for our agricultural leases, for example, identifying whether the land is good for grazing, rice, ginger farming, et cetera. However, for all leases issued, there are lease conditions which must be adhered to. If a lessee does not follow these lease conditions, there are penalties and implications and quite possibly, the last resort would be re-entry and cancellation of</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>464 lease.</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, the Ministry had been working in collaboration with the Department of Town and Country Planning on its State Land Use Master Plan along the Western corridor which should be finalised in this financial year. Also, the Ministry is currently reviewing its Mining Act 1965 and the State Lands Act 1945, together with the recent Land Use Act 2010 where we anticipate integrating sustainable development on all State land, minerals and, of course, one of Fiji’s best buys - groundwater resources. The review seeks to strengthen and improve on aspects of how best we could attempt environmental management. Mr. Speaker, finally, there are discussions on the need to formulate a National Land Use Policy for Fiji, incorporating the three major land tenure - State, iTaukei and freehold land. We understand that this will be a very huge exercise where we will require the services and assistance of those other various relevant Government Ministries and institutions. But nothing is impossible if we combine our resources for a united course. For the benefit of our future generation and to also leave this world better than how we found it, the Ministry is committed to have this policy in place. I borrowed that off from the motto of the Adi Cakobau School. This will ensure, Mr. Speaker, that we are developing holistically, and our strategy encompasses both, environmental protection as well as economic advancement of our beloved home. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Minister for his reply. It brought some glimmer of hope, particularly, in some of the projects that have been probably on the list for quite a while. We fully understand the challenges, particularly, when you deal with extractive industries in trying to balance the environmental issues together with social and economic benefits. The simple question to the honourable Minister is, what is the progress on Namosi? It is in the interest of the country and, hopefully, if the issues are resolved, that this can proceed. What is the possibility of it being graduating from an exploration to a mining, should all the conditions are met? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, for Namosi, we are almost at the tail end of the decision-making process on the renewal. There is only one outstanding matter that we are going to be attending to the week after next and after that, a decision will be made by my office on the renewal of the Namosi Special Prospecting Licence. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question, this is on mangroves, honourable Minister. There is a decreasing acreage in our mangroves, and I think there is a study to show that where there were mangroves, that has disappeared and the i qoliqoli adjacent to it becomes barren. I am just wondering whether we are slowing it down somehow, given the the biodiversity protection? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as mangroves and mangrove plans are concerned, in every foreshore development lease that is issued by the Ministry and if it affects mangroves on the foreshore, there is always a plan. If those mangroves are required for development to be removed, then the plan is that they will plant more than the equal number of mangroves that they remove either in the nearby area or in the area that is approved and agreed to by those traditional landowners or freehold landowners that are within the vicinity. So, there is always a concerted effort now, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that our acreage of mangroves are not lost.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>465 With the development of the Mangrove Policy, I think in the future, we are going to have a very a cohesive and detailed plan that can be easily executed by all the Government Ministries. However, I can assure the Parliament that from the viewpoint of the Ministry as well as the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, we are working together to ensure that the standing mangroves of Fisheries and Forestry, we are working together to ensure that the standing mangroves of our country are not less than what it is now, and we will need to improve and increase that in the future. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, going back to the question on the balancing of land use, the economic growth and the environmental protection right in the initial question, we see this in every areas - in mining, agriculture, forestry and even commercial activities. My question is, are you going to come up with this overarching policy that looks after all the areas? I know that you mentioned something about ginger farmers maybe cutting down the forest and all those kind of work. Then we have on the other side, the environment was supposed to be coming in to give guide on how to protect our forest. That is the question that I want to ask, if you have or are planning to get this overarching policy that covers every area of land use to balance environmental protection and economic growth. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we talked about it in the morning with honourable Tuinaceva. He spoke about his own experience of leasing a piece of land and that land is identified as agricultural. It has standing trees, so because his need is to plant ginger, they had to uproot everything that is on that piece of land. What happened is after that, they have lost the birds that usually sing to them in the early mornings, but that is the price that I think is usually paid when such developments are undertaken without the consideration of what else would cost the local environment and how that can be sustained. I think the important part that has been raised by the honourable Tuinaceva is for Government to find how we can provide for a coordinated inter-governmental environment preservation scheme that would, for example, permit our Ministry, Ministry for Climate Change and Environment, Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, to better coordinate land use so that whilst we have land made available for economic advancement, we do not totally lose the environmental aspects of our own local villages and towns. Plans to Improve Team Fiji in the Pacific Games (Question No. 24/2024) HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: Given the dismal performance of Team Fiji in the last three Pacific Games, can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports inform Parliament on the plans to improve and elevate Fiji’s performance in the next Pacific Games?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Naivalurua for his question.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, reference to the question raised by the honourable Member, the results at the Pacific Games very much depends on the performance of the individual sports competed. Government can only assist with funding allocated to each sport who applies for the development and travel to international events. Sadly, Sir, the results at the last Pacific Games was considerably down, so as the previous</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>466</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 two Games as well. From the latest we had in the Solomons Islands in 2023, we had 21 Gold, 30 Silver and 40 Bronze. In 2019, in Samoa, there were 35 Gold, 38 Silver and 43 Bronze. In 2015 in Papua New Guinea, we had 33 Gold, 45 Silver and 37 Bronze. In those same years, funding provided for the preparation and participation at the Games in 2023, the latest one we had in the Solomons, it was $1.04 million. In 2019, we spent $364,483 and in 2015, it was $749,444. These funding figures do not include grants given for the development and preparation in the years leading up to the Pacific Games. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funding provided for the last Games was substantially higher than that provided to the previous Games, so it indicates that funding is not the problem. We are working with Fiji National Sports Commission to identify how we can better develop and equip our athletes for international competition, but it still relies on the talents available to work with, and the National Sporting Organisation’s (NSO) Development and Strategic Plans for athlete development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving forward, in terms of elite athlete development, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, as part of its Strategic Plan, is to review the Fiji National Sports Commission to ensure that it is strengthened in terms of its role in NSO development and also establish the Fiji Institute of Sports for the management and development of elite athletes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently we are going through the budget submission process and with request from NSOs received, we are asking Government this year for an overall grant of $17.6 million. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question; given the importance of sports in a nation like Fiji, it not only adds value to the economy and likewise in international relationship as a foreign policy tool to bring about good relationship and we benefit from dividends through this relationship. Can we consider, as part of the strategies in improving our sports standards today, on a foreign policy relationship through sports diplomacy that we can have as co-operation to bring about more funding, explore more on those that are willing to help that can improve our standard and performance, not only at the national level, but over and beyond? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, before you reply to that question, I just want to add a bit more, especially on the interest here on how it affects the rural people. We had one good athlete from Tavua lately, he has been doing really well. Apart from that, we have two gold medallist here - the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, in athletics. So really that kind of question needs to be taken at a much more deeper level so we can get the best out of it. How have we not been doing well? That was the first question that was raised. Now, honourable Naivalurua is looking at the funding of this through international relations. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appreciate that supplementary question. Yes, sports is an investment, there is no doubt about that. We appreciate the input put in by the honourable Member and we would love to pursue that with other countries where we can establish partnership with them and how we can develop our local talents. As you know, Mr. Speaker, sports has become a pathway for our youth, especially in the rural and outer islands, to be able to play in the international arena and earn a living for themselves. Sports has become a very crucial part of our economy with what our players in overseas have been sending to their relatives in Fiji through remittances. So, sports, in totality, is something that we cannot ignore. As I had mentioned in my submission, for the latest Pacific Games at the Solomon Islands, the Government did put in $1.04 million, so we will continue to support sports from this side in whatever way possible to lift the standard of the games and to empower our athletes.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>467 I have mentioned that we are looking at reviewing the role of Fiji National Sports Commission and the possibility of introducing a Fiji Institute of Sports where our elite players or athletes can go through, they are nurtured and developed for international competition. Our players become marketable overseas. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the former Prime Minister, I switched sports once I got married from athletics to sumo. My simple question to the honourable Minister is participation in minor sports. There is so much focus on the main sports like rugby and football, but these minor sports are something that used to bring Fiji a lot of gold and particularly, when it comes to individual sports as well because it helps in building the character and personality of individuals. A best place to start with this is probably in our schools. In that plan, what is there between the Fiji Sports Council and the Ministry of Education in promoting these minor sports starting from school? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had mentioned about the Fiji Institute of Sports. It is one area where we can identify athletes at a very young age, when they are still in schools. The question we always ask every year is, where do our athletes go to when they finish from the Coca Cola Games? We are about to witness another Coca Cola Games this year, there is no pathway for them, a place where we can nurture these athletes and prepare them for international duties. The Fiji Institute of Sports will be a better way where they can work with Fiji Secondary Schools and identify talents, while the athletes are still in school. We can develop those who have talents in sports and put them through the Fiji Institute of Sports. Yes, for minor sports, it may be a minor sport in Fiji but it is a major sport in other countries, for example, surfing. We are trying to introduce surfing in the Lau Group of Islands, and swimming.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Sumo:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. J. SAUKURU.- We are also trying to revive boxing for those in the interior of Fiji, in Bukuya and Navosa. Those were places that were well known for boxing before. Yes, we are also looking at minor sports to be developed further. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nabukalou Creek was used by the Government for some hilarious illustration yesterday, which in my view, is a disgrace to the MSMEs kiosk operators who are operating along that Creek and also Tui Suva and the Vanua o Nadonumai, the honourable Minister for Works who is a distinguished chief of Rewa and also the honourable Minister for Local Government, looking after the Suva City Council and the honourable Prime Minister himself as the Minister for Environment. It has been 16 months now. My supplementary question is, the Government has spent $1.9 million for the new running track at the HFC Stadium, which was officially re-launched by the honourable Prime Minister last month. We are now advised that the new track is already lifting and showing damage. Can the honourable Minister, please, advise Parliament what is happening here and when is the CEO going to be appointed to the Fiji Sports Council to ensure proper governance?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I believe that is a new question.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>468 MR. SPEAKER.- The Minister is very good at this. He is a former Ratu Kadavulevu student. He is good in playing rugby, like he used to do in his village in Vitogo. Just a housekeeping issue, honourable Members, and for the purpose of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move his motion.</p></body>
