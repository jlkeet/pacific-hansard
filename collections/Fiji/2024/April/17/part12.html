<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following honourable Ministers have given</p><h4>notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40, the:</h4><p>1. Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 2. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operative, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 3. Honourable Minister for Youths and Sports; and 4. Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>433 Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, we will then invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. I now call on the Prime minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to deliver his Statement. COP 28 and Climate Change HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, it is good to see you back. You were very capably replaced by your Deputy Speaker yesterday. While we enjoyed her presidency of the meeting, we also prayed for your good recovery. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- I welcome all honourable Members this morning - the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and Members of the Opposition, as well as ladies and gentlemen in the gallery and ladies and gentlemen who may be watching us on the livestreaming of our procedures in Parliament. Sir, we also wish our Hindu brothers and sisters a very meaningful and happy Rama Navami celebration today.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver this Ministerial Statement on the proceedings of the 28 th</h4><p>Conference of Parties, otherwise known as COP 28, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The Statement will elaborate on the following: 1. 2. 3. the outcomes of the Conference of Parties (COP 28) Meeting; reflect on global progress in responding to climate change; and outline directions and priorities on climate change in Fiji. On the Overall State of Play – Towards a Region of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Prime Minister and Minister for Environment and Climate Change, I remain very concerned at the scale of the effects of climate challenge that we face and the existential threat it poses to the wellbeing of our nation and the region. As we have seen and experienced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the seasonal patterns our ancestors lived by are very quickly shifting. From more frequent and extreme rainfall events to unseasonable droughts, intensified cyclones and higher average temperatures, the challenges and changes are disorienting for the island population for the Blue Pacific. At the same time, we experience different localised permutations of climate threat, depending on where we are, how we live, and what we depend on. What is constant in this complexity of crisis is that the collective effort of Pacific Leaders to build unity and mobilise action to protect our collective future. While we can rely on this unity in the Pacific, unfortunately, in many cases, this is an exception to the rule. Looking further afield and reading beyond the political rhetoric, it is clear that global cooperation is faltering at a time when we need it most.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>434</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, geopolitical rivalry remains a core driver of many interests. Rather than find motivation and common purpose to -combat the shared suffering of the climate crisis; combat the staggering loss of biodiversity we are experiencing; or commit a realistic and equitable share of international capacity and resources to reduce damage to livelihoods, many large economies remain focussed on short-term gain and inter and intra-regional competitions. We are experiencing some of those right now, and this is why we continue to bring attention to the broad concept of peace and security, which must underpin our regional and global vision. Rivalry and disunity is undermining efforts to address climate change at the scale that is required. So, when it comes to concepts of peace and security, and the need for our region to share these aspirations, I speak to issues of geopolitics and climate change as one and the same. On the Mitigation and Global Stocktake, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you have heard in Dubai, the world is not on track to keep global average temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees is not a political objective, or by perspectives or preferences, instead, it is a guardrail identified by thousands of leading scientists and is the threshold beyond which life on earth changes dramatically. In the Pacific, the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2.0 degrees or 3.0 degrees is the difference between habitability of our island homes and forced migration. It is the difference between catching your own fish and growing your own family’s food or being wholly dependent on imported protein. It is the difference between economic sovereignty and fully fledged dependence on external aid and disaster relief. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference between 1.5 degrees, and 2.0 degrees or 3.0 degrees Celsius is a distinction that involves great consequences for all people in all regions, not just for our people in the Pacific. However, here in the Pacific, the difference is not subtle - the difference is a knife edge.</p><h4>The Pacific must continue to present the voice of pragmatism and influence to those who</h4><p>appear increasingly committed to disunity and ultimately, self-harm. Last year’s 28 th Annual Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (COP 28) convened from 28 th November, 2023 to 13 th December, 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, COP 28 was mandated to reflect on progress made since the Paris Agreement agreed in 2015 (COP 21) - seven years prior to that. The final decision text agreed upon in Dubai, which is referred to as the UAE Consensus, documents the lack of progress made to-date. It is also the first decision, Mr. Speaker, Sir, text agreed upon in the 28 years of these gatherings that makes explicit reference to fossil fuels and introduces a global commitment to transition away from fossil fuels. While there are few large economies that continue to push against this transition, many are working hard to embrace it and there is increasing potential in the uptake of renewable energy globally. Mr. Speaker, to ramp up our own efforts to decarbonise our economy, we need to be clear on why we are pursuing decarbonization in Fiji. With our minimal contribution to global emissions, our reasoning is more about economic benefits of this transition.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>435 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, Fiji is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels and as such, we are exposed to the increasing oil price volatility that we see annually. The price of oil impacts all aspects of our daily lives. It is felt across our value chains, at the shops and markets, in our daily purchases, in our transport systems and our whole economy. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it drives our inflation and the high cost of living. While we must be practical about how and where renewal alternatives will be viable, we know that there is huge benefit that is largely untapped. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must be pragmatic when it comes to decarbonization. We must focus on transitioning energy systems in ways that build resilience and increase economic independence. Whether it is landowners (either iTaukei or freehold) releasing their land to host solar arrays to power communities, or electric buses that reduce emissions and increase public transport uptake, or strategic investments into locally produced biofuels, we must be open to these opportunities. At COP 28, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we signed the Global Renewable and Energy Efficiency Pledge, to triple the world’s installed renewable energy by 2030, which involves a further commitment to collectively double global average energy efficiency improvements every year until 2030. We hope Fiji can benefit from this global pledge. On Loss and Damage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for our people, struggling with flood waters and rising fuel costs, we must continue to bring attention to the loss and damage we already are experiencing. At COP 28, a major headline was the agreement on the operationalization of the new Loss and Damage Fund agreed to at COP 27. Fiji and the Pacific nations engaged in a 12 months negotiation process through the Transitional Committee to design the governing instrument of this new Fund in 2023. Our collaborative work with our Pacific Small Islands Developing States (PSIDS) family led to Fiji’s inclusion as a member of the new Loss and Damage Board. What Fiji brings to this process is our experience with the limits of adaptation which we are actively facing daily in Fiji. At the national level, following endorsement of the Standard Operating Procedures for Planned Relocation last year, we are moving forward with the relocation of Nabavatu community. We had a question raised yesterday on that. On Adaptation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we signed our additional pledges and declarations at COP 28 and these are: • • • • The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health. The Climate Relief, Recovery and Peace Declaration. The Gender Response, Just Transition and Climate Action Declaration. The UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action. We will follow up on opportunities for these pledges to translate into tangible benefits for vulnerable Small Island Developing States. Following COP 28, it is clear that irrespective of support and opportunities that exist, Government must take the lead in ramping up domestic adaptation efforts. This means developing more robust and larger scale climate financing proposals and engaging effectively to support our access to finance. On the Overarching Priorities into 2024, with those in mind, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government will accelerate adaptation programme to build resilience and create a prosperous future for our</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>436</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 communities. In addition, for the rest of 2024, we will focus on the following priorities on the domestic front: 1. Delivering against the Strategic Implementation Roadmap for Fiji’s Climate Change Act 2. 3. to increase collaboration across sectors and better coordinate efforts. Increasing access to financing through the new Loss and Damage Fund; the new Pacific Resilience Facility; and other international climate finance mechanisms. Engaging effectively in global negotiations on the new quantified collective goal for climate finance in preparation for COP 29. In concluding, on Bipartisanship and Collaboration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to thank the members of the Fiji delegation to COP 28. In particular, I must thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and your team, and respective Cabinet Ministers for engaging in the COP 28 process. I also wish to specifically thank honourable Inia Seruiratu, Leader of the Opposition, for joining the Fiji delegation and in so doing, embodying the bipartisan approach to climate change which is so important for our nation, and he brings along with him the experiences from the previous Government where he was one of the Champions of climate change. Within this Government and this nation, addressing climate change and preventing further harm to the people of Fiji is a bipartisan priority, which is above politics. In saying that, we must now shift gear to accelerate the implementation of our objectives. We need to be increasingly strategic, collaborative and open minded to manage the long-term nature of this existential threat. Fiji maybe recognised as a world leader for our efforts to lead on policy and international advocacy on climate change over the years, but we will be judged by our ability to deliver results. It is the results, rather than the diplomatic fanfare upon which the People’s Coalition Government is focused. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcomes of COP 28 are a reminder for Fiji to deliver at the national level to underline our commitment to both, international leadership and domestic action. No nation is exempt from the impact of climate change. No nation can address it alone, but if we work together, we can achieve much more. Keeping momentum on this priority is the only way to create the enabling environment for the peace, security and prosperity we all expect from the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this stage, I would like to join with the people of Namosi, in welcoming back Na Turaga Bale na Vunivalu na Tui Namosi, who will be instrumental in one of his new developments of the search for a new source of renewable energy from Namosi inland waterways. I thank you, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do join the honourable Prime Minister and also on this auspicious occasion of Rama Navami to convey to the Sanatan followers who are celebrating Rama Navami today a very happy and meaningful Rama Navami celebration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for his Statement and he has stated a lot, particularly on what is happening at the global scene and, particularly, what is relevant for Fiji in terms of the way forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Again, I also acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for hearing the plea and advice from the honourable Chairman, to do participate in COP 28. I know that it is a big learning</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>437 experience for all of us. I do acknowledge as well the Government, especially the honourable Prime Minister, in considering including the Leader of the Opposition as a member of his delegation and, of course, as member of the IPU joining your delegation, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have made some recommendations, honourable Prime Minister, to the Senior Officials. I think we need to have a debrief, and congratulations to the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Climate Change – Dr. Sivendra Michael. I think he is in the process of organising this because there is a lot to learn from COP and COP is not easy because there are geopolitics, there are thematic areas and there are processes within and there is a lot that we could learn. There are Senior officials and Diplomats out there, who are already exposed in this arena, who can help us, help the Government and help all of us. Even in the discussions in the Opposition Chamber on Friday last week, they were interested, and I talked about COP and SIDS4, et cetera. These are capacity development, but it is good that we have a debrief, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, and honourable Members of Parliament, I will just focus on three areas, probably just to look at Fiji particularly as a country, and the honourable Prime Minister has alluded to most of what Fiji is considering. Of course, in terms of our role in the wider Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) and Alliance Of Small Island States (AOSIS), that is very, very critical and I link that, Sir, with SIDS4 that is going to happen in Antigua and Barbuda in May this year. This is a very critical year for SIDS, given the special circumstances of SIDS in the space of sustainable development and, of course, the role of Parliament, as you have alluded to earlier, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, again, on the areas of improvement, you have mentioned it, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, but the increase to climate financing is so important for us. It is one thing to have finance available, but it is about the accessing of those finances that is very important for us. Strengthening our pathways to Net Zero in terms of renewable, in terms of transportation and the so many good things, we need to focus on that. But may I remind Government, let us not only concentrate on adaption. Adaption is for our survival, but mitigation is important in every aspects where we can do mitigation, that is always recommended because more mitigation now means lesser adaptation in the future. Loss and damage, of course, we are in the Board, and we congratulate Fiji for that. Waste and pollution, of course, the monitoring of our biodiversity. Perhaps, in terms of few of our priorities forward, Sir, the improving of data, the enabling environment and also finalising the National Adaptation Plan, the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan because these will complement the work that has already been undertaken. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just focus on the year 2022 to 2024. As I have stated, we have come a long way from 1990 into 1994 where we had the Bridgetown Barbados Action Plan, and then we have the Mauritius International Agreement - that was the first cycle after 10 years, then we have the SAMOA Pathway, and this year is a critical year for Small Island Developing States. The honourable Prime Minister said we really need to strengthen the link between PSIDS and AOSIS. If I am correct, Samoa is now the Chair of AOSIS, so let us support Samoa because although the priorities have not changed in terms of the SAMOA Pathway, the Barbados Action Plan and the Mauritius Strategy, but what worries us is that the situation has gotten worse. There are special</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>438</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 circumstances for SIDS, and that is why Antigua and Barbuda this year in May is so important for the AOSIS. In terms of leadership, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I will beg the Pacific Leaders, including you, me and Mia Mottley is doing an excellent job as a leader from the Caribbean. We need that strong voice as well from the Pacific, given the situation that we are in now and the review of the SAMOA Pathway that is happening this year. We can discuss too on this. Lastly, Sir, the role of Parliament. We have an Act, you are reviewing the National Adaption Plan, and then we have other plans, we need to continue with this. You are well aware with this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because there need to be a convergence between what the IPU is doing and Mr. Speaker is well aware of this, what is happening in the General Assembly and what is happening in the UNFCCC process, particularly, when it comes to this issue. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in COP 28, the Pacific has launched its mobility framework. This is one issue that we have been raising as a country and Mr. Speaker is also leading on this, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, on the issue of migration and forced displacement. You have mentioned it, but the question that we have now is, we have the Pacific Mobility Framework but what will we, as a receiving country do, when it comes to our brothers and sisters from the Pacific Islands coming into Fiji? We need to prepare for that. There is so much to discuss, but thank you for the extra time allocated, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We will always work together on this and we, from this side of Parliament, will offer all that we can so that we can continue to move this forward. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition. Thank you so much for your great contribution. Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning tea and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.32 a.m.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>439 The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. Fiji’s Engagement at the 13 th WTO Ministerial Conference HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, before I begin my remarks, may I just first re-echo as did the honourable Prime Minister the well wishes to our brothers and sisters on a blessed Ram Navmi celebrations today. Also, may I be allowed to just offer a word of tribute to a leader of Fiji who served as a Minister as well for a short time, and I speak of the late Ratu Esira Rabuno who passed away about a week ago. After serving his country well, he spent a lot of time in university academia and served as a Minister in the 2006 Government. He, of course, is my chief and I rise on behalf of the people of Tailevu and vanua of Navitomi to acknowledge his great contributions to our country and also to our vanua. We will miss him and may his soul rest in peace. Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I rise today to deliver a Ministerial Statement on Fiji’s engagement in the recent World Trade Organisation 13 th Ministerial Conference held in Abu Dhabi from 26th February to 2 nd March 2024. Every two years, the Ministers for Trade for all WTO member States converge on what is called “the Ministerial Conference” which is the highest governing body of the WTO, which decides on the rules of trade for the globe. The meeting this year was held in Abu Dhabi, and it was the 13 th Ministerial Conference of the WTO, or as it is commonly called “MC13”. Madam Deputy Speaker, two new members were admitted into the WTO - the Republic of Timor-Leste and the Comoros bringing the total membership of the WTO to 165 members with 24 observer governments. Fiji attended MC13 together with five other fellow Pacific countries who are member States namely, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. In fact, the Pacific had a very high level delegation attending MC13 which included two Deputy Prime Ministers from Vanuatu and Fiji and full Trade Ministers from Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Tonga, the exception being Solomon Islands only because the honourable Minister could not attend due to election commitments. At this juncture, I wish to acknowledge the Pacific Heads of Delegation which formed a very formidable team for the Pacific at MC13. For Vanuatu, the honourable Matai Seremaiah Nawalu, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Internal Co-operation and External Trade. From PNG, the honourable Richard Maru, Minister for International Trade and Investment. Samoa was honourable Leota Laki Lamositele, from Tonga was honourable Dr. Viliami Uasike Latu and from Solomon Islands was honourable Natalia Patternot, Director for External Trade, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In some ways, Madam Deputy Speaker, the quality of the delegation reflected the importance of the topics that were to be covered at MC13. Apart from the issues around e-Commerce, moratoriums and agricultural subsidies, MC13 was viewed as the Conference to resolve the final issue relating to fisheries subsidies over capacity and overfishing as we know a very dear topic to the Pacific and its people. Fiji was invited to head the delegation and, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can assure you we fought really hard for the Pacific. I hope when the history of MC13 is written, I am confident or relatively confident that all WTO member states will be in no doubt, that when matters relating to oceans or climate change arise, the Pacific are big boys, not small boys and I will return to this later. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Conference our negotiating posture was to advocate for fair and equitable trade practices that prioritise the needs of developing nations, stability in trading systems, a functioning multilateral system and reliant supply chains that includes smaller nations. The WTO Conference provided the Pacific and Fiji an opportunity to shape policies that resonate</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>440</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 with our own unique circumstances, contributing to more equitable and prosperous global trading systems. Fiji particularly emphasised the importance of addressing challenges such as Climate Change and Sustainable Development within the framework of the trade agreements. Madam Deputy Speaker, I will now just focus on the Fisheries Subsidies which was in essence the main purpose of the Pacific’s attendance at the MC13. Why are Fisheries Subsidies so important? According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization - 2022 State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture Report also known as the SOFIA Report, 35 percent of fish stocks worldwide are exploited beyond sustainable levels. We suspect, Madam Deputy Speaker, that that has increased. Experts note that Governments around the world are paying more than US$22 billion a year in subsidies and this drives overfishing. The subsidies primarily go to industrial fishing fleets to artificially lower their fuel and vessel construction costs while enabling them to catch more fish farther and farther out to sea for longer periods. As a result, Madam Deputy Speaker, it should be no surprise that there is virtually un- negligible presence of a local tuna industry in the Pacific in terms of vessels and operations. Fiji and the Pacific, of course, has been an advocate for international disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies and the preservation of the last sustainable stock of tuna in the world. In fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Pacific holds two-thirds of the world’s tuna stock. The Pacific leaders when mandating the Trade Ministers to attend MC13 had given very clear directives, encouraging that we conclude a comprehensive set of disciplines of overfishing and overcapacity which will deliver reasonable outcomes for the Pacific. What do I mean by comprehensive disciplines? After more than 20 years of negotiations at the WTO, a Partial Agreement of Fisheries Subsidies was concluded at the last Ministerial Conference (MC12) in June of 2022 in Geneva. The Partial Agreement prohibited certain forms of Fisheries Subsidies in the following three situations: Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing; • • Fishing of already over-exploited stocks; and • Fishing on unregulated high seas. I wish to acknowledge the contributions of honourable Koya who was quite instrumental in concluding the first wave, if you like, of the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement. However, as was acknowledged at the time, it was merely a partial agreement that was concluded which did not fully achieve the Ministerial mandates on Sustainable Development Goal 14.6. It did not address subsidies that contributed to overfishing and overcapacity. For this reason, the WTO viewed the MC13 as the Conference where this was going to be resolved. How did we go, Madam Deputy Speaker? The Pacific did go to Abu Dhabi to fight for the Pacific. We worked very long hours to protect our key offensive and defensive interest on Fisheries Subsidies. We demanded that our voices be heard as equals. We asked the WTO to ensure that fisheries resources are sustainably managed and not overfished. We pleaded that our oceans and resources are protected for future generations and the Pacific. Fiji was honoured to lead the Pacific group with an aim to negotiate disciplines on the Fisheries Subsidies considered harmful that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing. We emphasised that it was vital to recognise that appropriate and effective Special and Differential Treatment (S&amp;DT) be in place for developing country members such as Fiji and least developing</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>441 countries and these were to be central parts of the negotiations. In layman’s terms, we simply wanted to correct the injustices of the past and present, that is, to enable nations that own the fisheries resources to develop their own fisheries sector and to do so sustainably. The Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) that fish over 90 percent of the fish stocks may not do so sustainably. If current practices continue, Madam Deputy Speaker, the risk of overfishing and overcapacity is real. This will be disastrous for the Pacific. We have not been able to have had any significant input in our own industries as I had mentioned, thus it is better that we be custodians of our own resources. As such, Small Island States like Fiji, will need the flexibility to assist local fishing co-operatives and communities with support such as fishing equipment, provision of outboard motors and fishing nets, to name are few. Additionally, we also needed an equitable platform where the Pacific and Fiji has not been able to compete with the bigger operators that are subsidised, as I had mentioned. Therefore, that is why the meeting in Abu Dhabi was very important. Madam Deputy Speaker, we worked tirelessly to attain the support of the Members when we got there. We went past that deadline of a conclusion of the negotiations on 29 th February, which was extended into the early hours of 2 nd March. We regrouped countless times, re-drafted our textual proposals, we met the WTO Director-General, Secretariat, Chairman of the Rules Committee and in fisheries negotiations, the Permanent Representative of Iceland to the United Nations in Geneva, His Excellency Einar Gunnarsson and the Fisheries Facilitator, the Permanent Secretary for State (Assistant Minister) for Iceland, Mr. Martin Eyjolfsson respectively. The main reason for the numerous around the clock meetings was to ensure that we would have a successful outcome and deliver a comprehensive agreement on Fisheries Subsidies for our people and our leaders. I had the pleasure and honour of working with the Chairman of MC13, His Excellency Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade who expressed his understanding in terms of our Fisheries Subsidies aspirations. We did not stop there, Madam Deputy Speaker, we continued to have meetings with the WTO members such as Australia, New Zealand, Bangladesh, Barbados, Canada, CARICOM Group, European Union, Guyana (Coordinator for CARICOM), Japan, India, New Zealand, Singapore, United States of America (USA), United Kingdom and the Distant Water Fishing Nations such as China, Korea and Taiwan. Just imagine this, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Pacific was talking as equals with some of the largest economies in the world when it came to our fishing resource and our oceans because our future generations’ lives and livelihoods were at stake. What was the result? Unfortunately, despite all our hard efforts of the Pacific, Fiji and other like-minded members in calling for prohibitions that contributed to over-capacity and over-fishing, unfortunately MC13 was not able to conclude an outcome for a Comprehensive Agreement on Fisheries. Since the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a consensus-based organisation, it is required that all the 165 members provide full endorsement and even one dissension means that an outcome cannot be reached. While the WTO members were not able to conclude a second wave at MC13, trust me, Madam Deputy Speaker, when I say, our efforts have not been lost. At the concluding remarks in the General Council session, in the informal session, I made an impassioned plea to all WTO members to not let this opportunity of safeguarding our oceans particularly the Pacific slip. Whilst we could not seal the deal in Abu Dhabi, we should continue to negotiate with the same passion and vigour. I asked as a symbolic gesture for all Trade Ministers and Ambassadors that agreed with Fiji and the Pacific to stand up and be seen. I am happy to report, Madam Deputy Speaker, that almost every delegate stood and gave a standing ovation to the Pacific and Fiji towards the continuation of negotiations. It was a strong signal of the commitment to continue negotiations after MC13 and we are acutely aware that time is ticking.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>442</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 I am also happy to report that we are not giving up. There are two positive developments, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I would like to share with this august Parliament. A coalition against over-capacity and over-fishing. While we will continue to fight and progress our efforts towards negotiating a comprehensive and balanced agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, Australia, Fiji and New Zealand will instigate a regional and multi-lateral initiative to form a coalition against over-capacity and over-fishing. This idea is a start of what we hope is a group of like-minded countries that are ready to act in terms of disciplining high subsidies that lead to over-capacity and over-fishing and eventually building global momentum. The idea is to also reach out for low hanging fruit that can lead to more sustainable practices including channelling investments in the Pacific and other countries. The second news that I would like to share, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that, out of these discussions with MC13, there is a clear desire now for the Pacific to create their own industry. I have the blessings of the honourable Prime Minister to explore these opportunities seriously and there are actually about, at least I can count, three opportunities on the table to move this forward. I liken it, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the Arabs getting foreigners to come and mine their oil. Why should we surrender the tuna resource of the Pacific to others to come and harvest for themselves when we should do it in our own backyard? Finally, a word of appreciation, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Pacific Islands Forum who through their Secretariat supported us in the meeting. I acknowledge Secretary General Henry Puna and the Ambassadors of the Pacific in Geneva; Ambassador Falemaka, Ambassador Daunivalu, Ambassador Levy from Samoa and Ambassador Antas from Vanuatu. I would also like to acknowledge the small but hardworking team in my Ministry who assisted in the negotiations and who have left an indelible mark on WTO MC13 in ensuring the momentum continues. As we move forward, Fiji remains dedicated to harnessing the benefits of international trade while ensuring our policies promote inclusive growth and protect the welfare of our citizens. Above all, we remain committed to ensuring a meaningful agreement on fisheries subsidies that would ultimately contribute to sustainable fisheries management, a thriving fisheries sector and meaningful livelihoods for our peoples in the region. With those few words, Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing me the floor to deliver my Ministerial Statement. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica for his extensive covering on the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement. I would restrict myself to the operationalization of the Agreement and what Fiji has contributed to in the past as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has exclusively covered the negotiations that has been recently held. Fiji was the first Pacific Island to sign this agreement on fisheries Subsidies which is a major step for Fiji’s position in the Pacific. The agreements basically restrict harmful subsidies that continue the depletion of fish stocks. It also includes provision for technical assistance and capacity building to help developing countries implement this agreement. Madam Deputy Speaker, this is an agreement that basically take the rich and big successful nations against the small developing nations and these subsidies has been an ongoing subject for a very long period. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has stated, they have exclusively come into our fisheries zone and take everything that is within. Fiji’s position has always been that Fiji, Samoa and Tonga do not have the stock that is available to our small island nations up the north, Tuvalu, Kiribati and all those rich tuna stocks. However, Fiji has taken the stand that we will take the lead role even though the benefits are for our small island friends. Fiji has taken this position</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>443 because it has allowed our voice within the international arena. You might have heard that Fiji negotiated for the US Tuna Trade Agreement which was increased from $19 million to $60 million a year. So, the Pacific nations looked to Fiji as the fighter at the front and they will get the benefit at the back. We have developed a great idea in fighting for our small island Pacific states. In the international arena, I have always called us “big ocean states” because even though our landmass is quite small, our oceans are quite big. So, to put the positives on discussions, I always say, “we are large ocean States”. The benefit to this agreement is to conserve fish stocks and the issue is that these fish stocks are migratory. Basically, when it comes to your EEZ, you have the opportunity to catch as most as you can. But Small Island States do not have the capacity to be able to catch the fish themselves, and that is where subsidies come in. They are basically being funded by their home countries to come and fish in the Pacific and now the Caribbean Islands, take the fish and then have it for the benefit of their population or increase their trade capacity within the International Trade Organization. The WTO and Food and Agriculture Organization FAO have been quite vocal in trying to protect the Small Island States so that they can get the maximum benefit out of their fish stocks, but it is a huge war. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has stated, we will have to keep fighting until there is some recognition from the big island States to say, “we know that you own the fish, we will develop and take away the subsidies so that more benefit is realised by small island States”. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Fiji National E-Commerce Strategy HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Cabinet and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and those of you who may be listening in today, bula vinaka and a very good morning to you all. I rise today to provide an update on Fiji’s National E-Commerce Strategy and also the next steps, once it is formalised. You may recall in some of my utterances this week, I was talking about Nabukalou Creek, I was talking about the need to plan better in our country, and I was talking about, where we can, look at some of the work that has been done by previous Government and actually leverage on it. This strategy falls into a bit of the planning side, Madam Deputy Speaker, but also more importantly, it falls into the groundwork that was done by the previous Government to actually move this forward. The other thing that I thought I would mention, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that from the People’s Coalition’s perspective, we are looking at a very strategic process for Fiji in order to digitise the whole Fijian economy. There is a national strategy for digitisation that is currently underway and it is underpinned by the e-commerce strategy as one of its central pillars. In actual fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would recall that I was talking about the MSME sector and the MSMEs strategy will fit in well with the efforts that are being made currently in e- commerce. So, going forward, the people of Fiji will have a very clear direction in terms of where we want to take both, the MSMEs digital aspirations and also e-commerce in our country.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>444</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 In today’s rapidly evolving world of digital economy, e-commerce, as we all agree, plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth, fostering innovation and expanding opportunities for business, especially micro, medium, small and medium enterprises. We have witnessed a global shift towards online transactions and digital marketplaces, and this is crucial for Fiji to capitalise on this trend and position itself strategically in the digital landscape. Hence, developing a national e- commerce strategy for Fiji is imperative to harness the potential of e-commerce and ensure that our businesses can access global markets, reach a broader customer base and compete effectively in the digital marketplace. It will also encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, driving job creation and, of course, the diversification of the Fijian economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the positives, I think, is that Fiji’s e-commerce sector is currently in an emergence state of maturity or is really maturing with various sectors showcasing growth trajectories. The tourism industry has been at the forefront of e-commerce adoption in Fiji. The business process outsourcing industry is another success story for Fiji, contributing significantly to the economy and offering employment and thousands of employment opportunities for Fijians. As someone who was involved in the setup of the industry whilst I was outside Government, it is pleasing to see the progress that has been made. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the domestic market, sectors such as food delivery, groceries, electronics, tools and furniture, are experiencing significant e-commerce activity, driven by the consumer demand for convenience and variety. Cross border e-commerce activity is also present, particularly in export agricultural markets, like kava. Some of you might be aware that people can actually order Lami kava from Fiji. It gets on a plane through DHL and arrives on the other side of the world. Ginger and turmeric are other examples. Fiji has made strides in exporting these products to markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and United Arab Emirates, with opportunities for further value addition. Madam Deputy Speaker, furthermore, e-commerce platforms are also facilitating the promotion of wellness, beauty care products and unique Fijian crafts to global markets. Rising Beyond the Reef products are now available on Amazon - the world’s fastest growing online shopping site. As we navigate through the vast opportunities presented by the digital age, we are also confronted with significant challenges, such as access to viable internet payment gateways, access to finance, trust in e-commerce transactions, lack of consumer and data protection. Considering these challenges, Madam Deputy Speaker, the development of a national e- commerce strategy became a strategic imperative for economic development and resilience in the digital age. This strategy will provide a five-year roadmap, outlining tangible measures to support the enabling environment for e-commerce and setting a clear plan for its implementation. Madam Deputy Speaker, our journey towards developing the National E-Commerce Strategy has been one of collaboration and foresight. With the support of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD), we thoroughly consulted stakeholders from Government, statutory bodies, the private sector, particularly MSMEs, civil society and academia. Hence, they have actively participated in the strategy design process. Our journey towards this milestone began even before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, as I had alluded to, Madam Deputy Speaker, with the National E-Commerce Readiness Assessment, which was conducted under the previous Government in 2019 and early 2020. One of the key</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>445 recommendations stemming from the Readiness Assessment was the imperative need for Fiji to develop its comprehensive e-commerce strategy, involving both public and private sector stakeholders. Madam Deputy Speaker, in early 2023, amidst our recovery from the pandemic impact, we embarked on formulating the e-commerce strategy with invaluable insights gathered from national stakeholder consultations held in September 2023. Recent validation workshops were held in March 2024, which have provided a platform for further discussions with diverse stakeholders to refine our strategy. In addition to this, Madam Deputy Speaker, a roundtable discussion to engage our development partners in the National E-Commerce Strategy implementation was conducted with the aim to foster collaboration and identify areas where our partners can contribute their expertise and resources effectively. Once finalised and endorsed by Cabinet, its implementation plans will pave the way for our competitive digital economy in our beloved country. Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to extend my appreciation to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Team and all the development partners for their invaluable support in shaping this trajectory in our e-commerce landscape. I thank you for this opportunity. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement. Yes, we need a strategic plan in developing our e-commerce, there is no two ways about it, we just have to get that done. The use of electronic medium to do business has really taken off after COVID-19. There is more B2B and B2C transactions taking place in e-commerce, so it simply means that we have to protect both, the buyers and the sellers, in the marketplace. The strategic plan can work towards developing those protective mechanisms required for consumers, as well as the businesses. E-commerce landscape has significantly changed with time because of the new technologies that were introduced, like MPAiSA, MyCash, and other mobile wallets that is in the marketplace. This has given ways for Fijians to engage in online shopping, buying goods and services or paying their bills, transferring money, et cetera, and it is the most convenient way of carrying out a transaction. From the comfort of your home, within the 24 hours at night, whenever you want, you can carry out this transaction. Gone are the days where you have to go and line up physically outside a shop to make those payments. So, that is how convenient it has become. It is not just convenient but also secure. However, this security that I am talking about is actually not fully secure and that is where the strategy needs to take that into account as well because we do hear about the cybercrimes and many other forms of financial crimes that take place through online mechanism. I do agree that with e-commerce, new businesses can be created for women and youth and, in fact, for all of us. We can have a day job, we can have some kind of hustle business after hours, and that you can through online. So, it is going to contribute a lot to the economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, consumer choice has widened now with access to technology and when we talk about access to technology, it comes with a lot of problems. I have mentioned a few, but the problems are there because you physically do not see the product. You cannot feel the product, but you are buying it online, so that gives rise to substandard products to be sold to consumers.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>446</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 When you are not happy with the product, how do you return this product? Is there a cooling off period where, if you are not happy, you will be able to get your money back? So, there are a range of issues that need to be addressed, so protection is needed. The Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) had already developed a separate relating Guideline for e-commerce and a lot can be seen from that Guideline and more can be done from that particular document. Madam Deputy Speaker, the FijiFirst Government had a vision to develop a modern economy. In 2018, Government announced its intension make Fiji’s economy cashless and contactless. MPAiSA and MyCash has greatly helped the nation moved towards a cashless society. Madam Deputy Speaker, I was disappointed when I saw the headline just recently which says, and I quote, “No consultation done on cashless payments, and it will be withdrawn”. This statement was made by the honourable Prime Minister. Now, this is shocking. It is shocking because we are talking about e-commerce on one hand, and we are trying to remove this cashless payment system. In the 2023-2024 National Budget, every Ministry was given $50,000 to turn their systems into cashless mode. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services had done but now that system has been withdrawn. So, I am emphasising the words “consultation” and “withdrawn”. Consultation, in my view, is overromanticized by the Government side - over, at the expense of the taxpayers. What is there to consult? There are only two options there, Madam Deputy Speaker, and they are, you can provide the cash payment system, you can also provide the technology-driven system... HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is what we are doing! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- …both systems can be there. But to say that we are withdrawing, what are you withdrawing? I am merely speaking from the statement that was made, Madam Deputy Speaker, and that needs to be looked into because it seems that the Government side is in disarray, and they do not know what we are talking about. The honourable Minister of Finance is saying, “Loo, we will go towards cashless society, we will do a cashless economy.” The honourable Prime Minister, despite sitting in Cabinet, is aware of the National Budget but still says, “Hey, but we are going to withdraw this.” So, this is not sending a good signal to the people, the country and to the Fijians. Finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, my concern is, which generation do we belong to? We belong to either silent generation or baby-boomers. We have got Gen Z and we have got Gen X, these are the modern people - the young ones, who only know about digital age. They are born in digital age, and here we are sitting and saying, “Guess what? We are going to withdraw this.” So, take your words back and, please, look into this matter. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you for your contributions so far, honourable Members. At this point, we will suspend proceedings for lunch. I know that several Members of Parliament want to go and celebrate Rama Navami. We will resume proceeding at 2.00pm. The Parliament adjourned at 11.47 a.m.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>447 The Parliament resumed at 2.08 p.m. Naleba Youth Training Centre Fire Incident HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and viewers who are watching through live television broadcast from the comfort of their homes; I rise today with a heavy heart to address a strategy that recently struck the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, four days ago, the boy’s dormitory at the Youth Training Centre in Naleba, Labasa, was engulfed in flames, leaving nothing but ashes in its wake. While we are grateful that no lives were lost in this devastating incident, it pains me to report that the 25 trainees who called this Centre home have lost everything they had possessed. On the background of Naleba Youth Training Centre, Mr. Speaker, it is one of the two Training Centres situated in the Northern Division and it is one of the five Youth Training Centres under the Ministry of Youth and Sports. It became fully operational in 2005 with the construction of proper classroom for learning. Prior to that, youth were only called in for short courses lasting for three weeks to learn about agriculture. The land area of the centre is approximately 22 acres. Mr. Speaker, approximately 30 to 50 youth enroll at the Centre annually. The Training Centre provides Certificate Level IV Training on Organic Agriculture to encourage self-help project, entrepreneurial opportunities and farming amongst young people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, other short courses, such as screen printing, SRHR and Climate Resilience Training, are offered at the Centre to create an institution where young people are able to make informed choices and wise decision for their lives. Mr. Speaker, the Training Centre provides a second chance to education to education, particularly for those who have fallen through the mainstream education system. A major focus of the Training Centre is towards creating young replacement farmers, who then return to their communities to practise intergraded farming for diversified income, as well as to contribute towards reducing hunger and poverty by improving food security, creating employment and building resilience to disasters and shocks. On the importance of the Youth Training Centre at Naleba, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Centre was more than just a building. It was a sanctuary for young minds seeking guidance, education and opportunities for a better future. It serves as a beacon of hope for our youth in the North, offering them a chance to learn variable skills, engage in meaningful activities and connect with their peers in a supportive environment. The Centre’s aim is to provide non-formal vocational training for unemployed young people and to provide pathways where they would gain practical skills, enabling them to establish sustainable living through employment, income generating activities, or provide a platform for progress to further education in either the formal or non-formal context. Mr. Speaker, Naleba Youth Training Centre offers free education to young people on agriculture and is accessible to both, male and female. Training is intended to substantially increase the number of youth with relevant skills learnt for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities within the agricultural sector, involved with semi-commercial farming.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>448</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 At our Naleba Youth Training Centre, we accommodate and have facilities for young women and provide them with equal opportunities for learning. Through our agriculture training, we educate our young people on organic farming methods in order to cope with the current impacts of climate change with respect to farming for sustainable living. On the impact of the fire on the trainees, Mr. Speaker, the destruction of the dormitory not only robs these young individuals of their material possessions but also shatters their dreams and aspirations. It has left a profound impact, not only on the trainees themselves but also on the entire community, which has lost a vital resource for youth development and empowerment. As alluded to, all items in the dormitory were completely destroyed by fire. However, there was no causalities during the incident. The incident had left the trainees in a state of shock and questions of whether training will continue is a lingering thought in the minds of these young people. Our immediate relief efforts for the affected trainees – As the relevant Ministry, we pledge to work closely with the relevant authorities to provide immediate support to the 25 trainees who have been left affected as a result of this tragedy. We have begun coordinating with local and international organisations, businesses and community leaders to mobilise resources for emergency relief efforts including temporary shelter, clothing and essential supplies. On the investigation into the cause of the fire - Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise the urgency of conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire. As a Ministry, we cannot allow such senseless acts of destruction to go unpunished. I assure you that the Ministry will collaborate with law enforcement agencies and relevant authorities to ascertain the causes and to ensure that justice is served with the measure put in place to prevent similar incidence in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the extent of the damages being currently assessed by the relevant authorities, National Fire Authority (NFA) and Fiji Police Force and a comprehensive report is expected to be released soon. Just recently, the Youth Training Centre has completed the OHS compliance requirements as a training centre for this year with completed inspections and clearance by NFA and the Ministry of Labour. Effective from the date of fire, the police have been exchanging shifts to oversee the site of the accident. On our commitment to rebuilding the Youth Training Centre – The Ministry is committed to overseeing the re-construction of the Youth Training Centre in Naleba, Labasa with the utmost urgency. This Centre must be rebuilt sooner, stronger and more resilient than before, equipped with modern facilities and amenities to better serve the needs of our youth. The main aim is to make a very fast turnover from current destructive form to normalcy. This initiative will obviously incur costs, however, the return on investment on educating these children will be repaid in an estimated four years’ time. This will be achieved through employment, beefing up IGP’s and knowledge sharing among the peers and communities. This will have direct impact of the GDP hence benefitting the Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training centre started with scoping for minor repairs and maintenance to organise temporary accommodation for the trainees continue with the training. The centre will propose for a capital project in the new financial year through the normal budget process. Preliminary works will be completed this financial year to prepare the plan and the scope of work of the new construction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our efforts to rebuild and strengthen our youth infrastructure cannot be</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>449 achieved in isolation. We have plans to work hand in hand with local authorities, line ministries, organisations and community leaders to ensure that the needs of our youths are met and that they have access to the supported resources that require to thrive. The Commissioner Northern Division was informed, and the team are on standby for any support that could be rendered. The list of items needed instantly has been prepared and shared with our divisional network through the Commissioner Northern Division for support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, sincere appreciation to respective line ministries that have assisted in various ways to return their trainees back to their respective homes, accompanied by staff to advise parents on the incident. Long term sustainability of Youth programmes - Mr. Speaker, Sir, our efforts cannot stop at rebuilding the Youth Training Centre. We must also invest in the long term sustainability of our youth programmes, ensuring that they are adequately funded, staffed and equipped to empower young people across our nation. The Training Centre is earmarked to be one of the major source of training providers for the youths in terms of formal and non-formal in the Northern Division and these will require the expansion of the infrastructure and its staffing as well and the diversification of youth programmes in accordance with the need of the nation in terms of the skills. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Ministry’s aim of leaving no youth behind, the Youth Training Centre is a stepping stone towards achieving this long term goal for the benefit of the Northern Division as well as the nation at large. This incident will ensure security is strengthened and further enhanced to ensure that government assets are secured at all times. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing I plead with our stakeholders and individuals to let us not forget the resilience and spirit of our youth who have faced adversity with courage and determination time and time again. Together, let us stand in solidarity with the trainees of the Youth Training Centre, Naleba and reaffirm our commitment to supporting and nurturing the next generation of leaders, innovators and change makers. The fire incident at the boy’s accommodation building of the Youth Training Centre was swiftly responded to and brought under control by the timely intervention of National Fire Authority and Police for the fire not to spread further into other buildings in the Youth Training Centre. In response to this incident, the Youth Training Centre management is committed to undertake appropriate measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. This includes conducting thorough review of the facility’s fire safety protocols, implementing any necessary improvements and organising mandatory fire safety training for all staff and students. I wish to take this opportunity to address the parents and guardians in the vernacular. Kivei kemuni kece sara na i tubutubu, na dauniveisusu ni cauravou kei na goneyalewa vuli e Naleba, au kila ni ra se tiko voli ga e vale na gone ena gauna oqo ena vuku ni kama ni bure mai koronivuli.

Mo ni tiko vakacegu saka ka mera maroroi vinaka na gone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last but not least, I wish to, once again, sincerely thank everyone who assisted in this through one way or another. I thank the management and staff of the Ministry and in particular the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations who had visited the Centre on behalf of the Government immediately after the incident to provide reassurance</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>450</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 and comfort to the trainees in such a crucial time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, please, allow me to respond to honourable Premila Kumar’s comment on a cashless Fiji. I wish to advise the honourable Member that the Coalition Government is not withdrawing the project, but we are doing everything right in consultation with all stakeholders. We will eventually get there. I will share with the honourable Member what Ronnie Chang of Martintar, Nadi wrote in the Fiji Times in the Letters to the Editors column, and I quote: “In doing so, please remember our fellow sisters and brothers who are not computer, tablet, fast phone and IT savvy. The poor members in our community who do not have access to internet services will suffer the greatest. Our old school senior citizens unfortunately will be left out, they toiled to earn a decent dollar. To them cash and their cheque books is their means of economic survival. Let us have a generous and accommodative heart, let us have a more caring nature in this field of economic progress. Most back office employees still have work to do manually. Do not deprive them of their bread and butter in progress’s name.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a leadership that listens because we do care about our people. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to respond to the Ministerial Statement presented by the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports on the importance of the Training Centre and the impact of the recent fire on trainees and the community, the Ministry’s commitment to rebuilding the Youth Training Centre and the long term sustainability of youth programmes. We are all now aware of the importance of vocational training and their opportunities as it provides for personal and professional growth. The training programme fits a much needed role in providing for training and education in sectors that are not found in formal education institutions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the FijiFirst’s term in government, we invested considerably to the Naleba Youth Training Centre by ensuring that there was sustainable recognised curriculum with modern agricultural machinery as well as standard infrastructure in place. The Naleba Youth Training Centre has accredited its training through the Fiji Higher Education Commission, where school dropouts can further their education in agriculture tertiary institutions after graduating from the Training Centre. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were negotiations in place to also introduce the Seafarers Training Programme where youths from around Fiji, particularly, those in maritime areas are to access this firsthand training on deckhand, cook, engineers, to name a few. The FijiFirst Government further invested in the Youth Training Centre by building a hostel and a gym worth $381,200 in the year 2020. This goes to show that the FijiFirst Government was always committed in ensuring increased educational, employment and leadership opportunities for young Fijians. It was rather unfortunate to hear of the recent fire incident that destroyed Naleba Youth Training Centre’s boys’ hostel building and all its contents. We understand that this incident will have some drawbacks and impacts on the trainees, and we sympathise with all the youths who have been affected by the fire. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the cause of the fire is yet to be established, we urge the Youth Training Centre’s administrators and staff to supervise their trainees and practice fire safety. It is important that the Training Centre administrators take the lead role in teaching its students on fire safety. The Naleba Youth Training Centre serves the Northern Region, and we thank the Ministry of Youth and Sports for its commitment to rebuilding the boy’s hostel in order for our youths from the North to continue with their training. Having heard of the importance of the Youth Training Centre from the honourable Minister, it would have been wise to provide ae grant to the Ministry of Youth and Sports Training Centre rather than to Pacific Polytech, an institution that is occupying a</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>451 school illegally in Nabua, Suva and the Government is funding it. Please, fund the Ministry of Youth and Sports and rebuild the Naleba Youth Training Centre. Wood Utilisation Project HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; a very good afternoon to you all, ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Statement on the Wood Utilisation Project with the main objective of maximising wood resource utilisation through the use of harvesting and processing residues as an alternative sources of raw materials for wooden products manufacturers. The project focuses on utilising mahogany wood left in the forest after a harvesting operation and, in this regard, works closely with the Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry completed a baseline survey, extraction, processing and classification of wood residues using specialised machines at our Ministry of Forestry workshop in Nasinu. Following the internal research and information gathering, the project started an initiative to engage and train selected mahogany landowners on how to utilise these mahogany harvesting residues to operate as small cottage industries. Consultations were undertaken initially in the three villages within the Nukurua Mahogany Station, that is, Sote, Savu and Naimasimasi where mahogany harvesting was being undertaken. The main objective was to engage and select suitable young men and women from these villages to be trained in wood processing and furniture making at the Ministry’s Timber Industry Training Center in Nasinu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, after taking up Office in December 2022 saw the potential of this initiative to significantly improve the livelihoods of our rural communities and jobless youth. Additionally, this programme was seen to have to have potential enhance the forestry’s contribution to the national GDP and identified that the level of funding was not sufficient to invest in this initiative. As the Minister responsible for Forests, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my aim to have the forestry sector adequately supported so that it is able to continue to enhance its capacity to improve the livelihoods of our people, especially our rural landowning communities. This can be achieved through increasing our investments in the training of our people to have the right skills and knowledge, and also in having the appropriate value adding machines and the application of new technologies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with this objective, Government during the financial year of August 2023 to July 2024 announced an increase in the budgetary allocation for Forest Subsidy Grant from $50,000 in the previous financial year to $200,000 which is an increase of $150,000. This grant is supporting our people to purchase value adding machines, especially our mahogany landowners who were trained at the Ministry’s Timber Industry Training Centre to operate as small cottage industries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are currently engaging four small cottage industries and one registered co-operative. The Gaunavou Co-operative, comprising the villages of Sote, Savu and Naimasimasi has also recently received the Ministry of Trade and Investment’s approval to use the Fiji brand on their products. Three cottages are currently working on manufacturing products, while members of one are currently undergoing training in wood processing and manufacturing.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>452</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to inform Parliament that my Ministry is not only providing training and technical advice to support the above initiative but has also taken the step to connect the cottage industries to the markets. Market outlets for the wooden furniture items to be produced were arranged and each cottage industry was taught to focus on a specific product. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in April last year a contract agreement between Gaunavou Co-operative and Vision Group was signed by the two parties for the supply of mahogany wooden beds through Courts (Fiji) Limited. Gaunavou Co-operative managed to supply 80 beds and with the support of the Forest Subsidy Grant of $28,864 managed to generate a total revenue of $70,200. The other three cottage industries also supplied mahogany wooden products which generated a total revenue of $220,500. Currently, there is ongoing discussion between my Ministry and the Ministry of Rural Development for the funding of a workshop for Gaunavou Co-operative. This is crucial as it provides the opportunity for Gaunavou Co-operative to run on their own using their own facility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Forestry is happy to inform Parliament that one of the cottage industries from Kalabu Village has begun construction of their own workshop at Colo-i-Suva. With their own workshop and machines, the cottage industry will be in a better position to be hived off from the Ministry and to operate on their own. The Ministry will continue to monitor the cottage industries once they are hived off focusing on the quality of products being produced and also in terms of their administration and finance. During their engagement period in Nasinu, each cottage industry is expected to build sufficient working capital to allow smooth operational transition once they are relocated to their own premises. The support and assistance of other arms of government are also being solicited to strengthen our monitoring of these cottage industries. The Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry has plans to widen its scope of assistance of cottage industry and value addition to the 14 mahogany based stations and other interested forest-based communities. The Ministry of Forestry believes that this initiative will boost economic activities, for the rural sector will contribute to rural economy and improving livelihoods. The engagement of young men and women in forest-based businesses will reduce urban migration, alleviate poverty, reduce crime including drug related activities, and also create a generation of people who are contributing positively to the development of their communities. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for the Statement and thank him for the continuation of this project. The project started way back in 2010. I know it very well when I was the Permanent Secretary for Fisheries and Forests. It was born out of this argument, if you like, with Fiji Hardwood. The Forestry staff was saying that the utilisation rate for mahogany was too low, about 40 percent at that time. We asked for a budget and so we would go in and collect the waste. As we know for mahogany, you cut it from as close to the ground and then when it begins to branch, that is why you chop it off and then that log is sold off. So, we collected those branches. We employed a gentleman who had a very good qualification in interior decoration, and he started to turn those branches into pieces of furniture, and we started to learn from there. We went back to Fiji Mahogany and said, “Hey, look, this is the waste that you are leaving in the forest. The utilisation rate for that mahogany needs to be much higher than 40 percent.” We planted those trees in 1960 and then 40 years later, started harvesting them in 2003. We thought that after waiting for 40 years and then just use 40 percent of the plantation is not a good return. So that was where it was born, at the Utilisation Division. I thank the honourable Minister and the Ministry for its continuation. It is helpful to the youth. We would bring in our young people and train them at that facility in Nine Miles. At that</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>453 time, there were two main machines that we thought was useful to set up those cottage industries. One is a lathe machine where it rotates and you can do bowls, lamp stands, et cetera. The other machine is the bench saw that cuts it down into workable sizes for those communities. One of the suggestions we had before I left and maybe you can take this up was, for those who are doing those pieces of ornamental mahogany, we can supply those ornamental pieces to all our embassies overseas, to put in those embassies as a marketing tool where people come in and visit. You can tell them, “Look, this is available in Fiji, it is Fiji mahogany.” Fiji has the second largest mahogany plantation, apart from Brazil, it grows well in Central America. The mahogany that we have in Fiji is Swietenia macrophylla, commonly known as big leaf mahogany from Honduras. The Fijian mahogany, according to those that deal with it, say it is very unique because it has pin knots. If you look at Fiji mahogany, you see a lot of those black dots which are very unique and some of the importers would not buy it because of those pin knots. So, we are always in competition with those that sell mahogany from Central America because theirs is like free from pin knots. Even those pieces of mahogany that has those pin knots can be turned into wonderful pieces of furniture and brand it as the brand for Fiji Mahogany which has got all those dots. I wish the Ministry well and I hope those cottage industries thrive and extend it to all the landowners. One of the problems we face then, I do not know whether you face it, is that mahogany belongs Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited and if they can give those pieces for free or the standing low grade mahogany. I think they mostly buy A to C and D to E grade - mostly left standing, if that could be given free, it will benefit those landowners very well. But thank you for continuing with the project and I wish you well.</p></body>
