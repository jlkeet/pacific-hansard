<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - NATIONAL FIRE AUTHORITY 2016 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - NATIONAL FIRE AUTHORITY 2016 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the review of the National Fire Authority 2016 Annual Report for the seven months period ending 31 st July, 2016.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>482 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- The National Fire Authority (NFA) provides firefighting, road accident rescue, urban search and rescue, HAZMAT, natural disaster management, flood and swift water rescue and emergency ambulance services to protect life, property and the environment. Its core strength is a service delivery model that ensures shared responsibility with various communities to minimise the likelihood and consequences of emergencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pace of change in NFA’s environment, both internal and external, is increasingly significant presenting both, challenges and opportunities. These changes will impact on Fiji’s communities and will challenge the traditional way that NFA delivers programmes, products and services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period under review, NFA continued to achieve targets, as followss: 1. 2. It was noted that as at 31 st July, 2016, the total income for NFA increased to a totalling amount of $8.1 million. This was attributed from the increased fire insurance levies, the water levies, structural fire safety compliance earnings and receipt of Government grant and ambulance operating grant. The NFA’s emergency incident response for the period, totalled up to 2,884. These emergency incident responses are from property fires, bush fires, malicious fires, vehicle fires, ship and boat fires, road accident rescue, private fire alarms, swift water rescue and emergency ambulance services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee highlighted a few findings and recommendations: 1. 2. 3. The Committee notes the increased number of structural property fires and high level of grass, bush and cane fires, as this is still a growing concern and that response time to incident sites is still lacking as notification to NFA are delayed. The Committee recommends that NFA continues to build on its community outreach programmes with rural and urban communities, agencies responsible for housing development, and other relevant stakeholders. The Committee notes that NFA needs to establish a training academy to capitalise on capacity building, not only for Fiji but for the region as a whole. On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor, I have a list of speakers that have been confirmed by the relevant Whips, as follows: 1. Honourable N. T. Tuinaceva; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 3. Honourable K. K. Lal; and 4. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the Review Report of the National Fire Authority Annual Report for the seven months period ended 31st July, 2016, that is before Parliament. Firstly, I want to congratulate the Committee for putting the report together.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 483 On the Committee’s recommendation Item 4.2 it states that NFA to continue its community outreach programmes in both rural and urban areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation was for a report submitted seven years ago but to my view, it is valid and pertinent, and I do support the recommendations. The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been grappling with fire incidents. In a NFA Consolidated Report on Structural and Small Fires which damaged or destroyed buildings including homes, it proclaims that in 2016, there was a total of 330 fires. It was the same number in 2017; in 2018, there was a total of 337 fires; in 2019, there were 310 fires; in 2020, there were 278 fires; in 2021, 125 fires; in 2022, 323 fires; and in 2023, a total of 358 fires. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a media report stating that in the month of January and February 2024, there were 29 cases reported. At one point, a few months ago, 30 people were left homeless in nine fire incidents that occurred within 10 days. We have even reached a stage of having four fires in less than 24 hours and 10 home fires in seven days. In fact, according to the figures, 2023 was the worst in 10 years. For this year (2024) between January to March, we have a total of 62 fires. Mr. Speaker, the pattern emerging is strongly suggesting that we will surpass the 2023 figure if NFA is not going to lift their campaign and awareness work. This is why I am saying that I strongly support the Committee’s recommendation. Just like road safety when we say it is everyone’s business, the same goes for fire safety, it is everyone’s responsibility. We need to educate people on the better understanding of fire, its destructive impacts and the preventative procedures needed. I understand that NFA has developed and delivers a range of community initiatives to educate people on the prevention of potential fire hazards and how to manage and control fires at the early stages. The whole purpose is to minimise damage and protect lives. Mr. Speaker, according to NFA, around 40 percent structural fires are attributed to electric faults. It becomes the major cause of fire in Fiji, and that is alarming. This basically changes the whole fire incident dynamics and calls for a different level of awareness. Fiji is about 90 percent electricity access, therefore, increasing our vulnerability to fire on structures due to electric fault if standards are not met. Mr. Speaker, NFA has to closely work with EFL and other agencies that are involved in structural wiring work on practices and procedures that strictly ensures fire safety. Mr. Speaker, under the key findings, Item 3.2, the Committee commented on NFA’s response time, asserting that it is still lacking as notification to NFA is a delay. That is unacceptable and we cannot afford that kind of retard in the NFA system. Mr. Speaker, it can take 17 minutes for a fire to consume the entire structure of an average home built 10 years ago. That is remarkably a long time, compared to today’s estimate time which is roughly about six minutes. That is basically how quick a fire can just destroy or kill. The question is, how long does it take a fire to extinguish? Some reports are saying that, for example, a fully involved one-storey average framed structure can have a fire knockdown within 10 minutes. It all depends on how quickly the Fire Department can access the fire and has adequate water supply to put that out. Mr. Speaker, the response time to incident sites is very important. I can only imagine the number of properties and lives saved if the response time was at its best. The good news is that,</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>484 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 between the period of 2013 to 2022 during the FijiFirst Government, NFA has expanded its operation. They built and commissioned new fire stations in Taveuni, Korovou, Korolevu, Lami, Nakasi, Seaqaqa, Savusavu and Nabouwalu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA also purchased several second-hand good quality vehicles from Country Fire Authority in Australia. In addition, they also purchased two ladder firefighting trucks and one powerful Scania firefighting truck to cover the increase in high-rise buildings in Suva- Nausori and Nadi-Lautoka corridor. Mr. Speaker, I am also aware that NFA is in the process of purchasing land for new fire stations in Navua, Pacific Harbour, Korovisilou, Wainibuka, Natadola, Navosa, Navakai and Tavua. All these, Sir, will improve response time in a big way and uplift NFA firefighting capacity. Mr. Speaker, NFA will need to expedite the latest fire software which can help them to prepare for emergencies much better. It is a critical tool that can assist in reducing response time by optimising response through managing resources smartly, communicating more effectively, checking response time and preparing for emergencies and can response quickly and efficiently to response time and preparing for emergencies and can response quickly and efficiently to emergencies. The importance of response time cannot be overstated. If fire can be kept small, lives and properties can be protected. Mr. Speaker, before I take my seat, I want to say NFA needs funds to carry out the recommendations and address findings mentioned in the Report. Most of their services now is a bit slow down and low, and they are struggling to cope. Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA is a life and property saving organisation and to be at the top of their role, they must be well resourced. They need manpower who are well trained, specialised and are properly remunerated. They need the right tools which are at the best level of their service and technology to boost their performance. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the leadership and the staff of NFA for the great work they have carried out over the years, despite the challenges faced – a broad and diversified role on their shoulders, but their commitment has been unwavering. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before this august Parliament this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government takes note of the key findings and recommendations by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs and also takes this opportunity to thank the Committee for doing a wonderful job and doing a thorough investigation, even undertaking visits to some of the Fire Stations around the country. One of the key issues identified by the Committee is the timely submission of annual reports. The Ministry had highlighted the importance of this, and the National Fire Authority (NFA) is currently working on annual accounts for 2018-2019. The Office of the Auditor-General has also completed auditing of 2017-2018 annual accounts. The Authority is targeting to complete the pending accounts for the years 2019-2020, 2020- 2021 and 2022-2023 by December 2024. There is also a need for the Authority to continue to build on its community outreach programmes with rural and urban communities, as well as the agency on</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 485 responsible for housing development and other relevant stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NFA is committed to enhancing and expanding its community outreach programmes, particularly with the rural and urban communities, housing development agencies and other relevant stakeholders. These programmes are designed to educate and empower communities to prevent fire hazards and minimise the devastating impact of fires, thereby, safeguarding their homes, basic necessities and human lives. One of the core initiatives undertaken by the NFA is the development and delivery of community safety programmes and preventative initiatives. These efforts aim to educate individuals and communities on fire prevention measures and strategies to mitigate fire-related risks. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NFA conducts awareness campaigns in schools, delivering crucial messages on safety initiatives and the causes of fires, while also providing practical demonstrations on fire safety measures. The NFA’s Community Fire Warden Programme is a pivotal initiative scheduled for implementation across 1,193 villages and communities during the five-year training period from 2021 to 2026. The Programme entails the meticulous selection comprehensive training and certification of community Fire Wardens, ensuring that each community has capable individuals as Fire Wardens, trained to respond effectively to fire emergencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, progress has been made to-date with the completion of 11 community Fire Warden Trainings in the Western Division, nine in the Central Division and six in the Northern Division. I was so fortunate that one of the trainings was conducted in my own village about two weeks ago. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also imperative to emphasise that fire safety is a collective responsibility. The NFA remains steadfast in its readiness to respond to fire incidents properly and offers invaluable service to homeowners and tenants on effective fire prevention measures and to safeguard their belongings and properties. There is also a need for the Authority to engage in public-private partnership. The initiative to address housing needs for its officers in the three Divisions, I think, is one of the major challenges now for the Authority, which is the provision of accommodation for its officers and the Authority has been working in collaboration and consultation with the Ministry of Local Government to address housing needs for its officers. There are projects that are currently underway, the Taveuni barracks for staff. Therefore, housing needs are prioritised based on the place where the Fire Station is situated. There is also a need for the Authority to organise training for its officers locally and internationally for capacity building and specialised training and this area of NFA has programmes to train staff locally and internationally. The training for Fire Fighters applied annually for the year 2023-2024 and in-house instructors undertake specialised training in Japan, Singapore, Jakarta and other agencies. The local training on core operational activities are conducted daily for the duty crew in all Fire Stations. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to take this time to thank the staff and Management of the NFA for doing a wonderful job, fully dedicated to the call of the duty in ensuring that our properties are protected and also attending to some of the very important rescue operations around our country.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>486 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 Thank you once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to respond to the motion and I fully support the motion before Parliament this afternoon. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to have you back and I hope you are feeling well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today to support the commendable efforts of the National Fire Authority (NFA) as highlighted in the recent review conducted by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in its Annual Report for the seven month period ended 31 st July, 2016. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this comprehensive review, not only celebrates the achievements of the</p><h4>NFA, but also presents constructive insights for further enhancement.</h4><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, NFA serves as a beacon of safety and security in our communities, tirelessly working to protect life, property and the environment. Throughout the period under review, the NFA demonstrated unwavering commitment and dedication, despite facing challenges such as increased structural property fires and delays in response times. The NFA remained steadfast in its mission, responding to emergencies with professionalism and efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the testament of the effectiveness of the NFA’s service delivery model which ensures shared responsibility with various communities to minimise livelihood and consequences of emergencies. The NFA’s ability to adapt to changing environment and evolving challenges is commendable, reflecting its commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the report highlights the NFA’s proactive responses to emergencies, particularly during the devastating effect of TC Winston. Despite facing unprecedented challenges, the NFA continued to provide essential services, working alongside other service providers to increase its duties between agencies and taking the lead role during major disasters. Sir, this is the testament again to the NFA’s resilience and dedication to serving our nation. In addition, to its emergency response effort, the NFA also pursued capital projects aimed at enhancing its capabilities. The completion of the new Fire Stations in Korovou, Korolevu, Seaqaqa, Taveuni and Savusavu stands as a remarkable testament to the foresight and dedication of the former FijiFirst Government in ensuring equitable access to essential services across our nation’s diverse landscapes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visionary initiative, not only underscores the former Government’s unwavering commitment to the safety and wellbeing of every Fijian, but also exemplifies its proactive approach to infrastructure development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through prudent investment, the former FijiFirst Government purchased and upgraded new equipment and facilities at these five Stations, allocating millions of dollars to modernise our firefighting capabilities. This strategic investment reflects the former Government’s responsiveness to the needs of its citizens and its ability to deliver tangible results that directly impact the lives of Fijians. By prioritising the establishment of new Fire Stations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the acquisition of the state-of-the-art equipment. The former FijiFirst Government demonstrated effective governance and leadership, fostering trust and confidence amongst Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this commitment to enhancing emergency response infrastructure, not only fulfils the Government’s mandate, but also provides essential services and strengthens its reputation</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 487 as a proactive and forward-thinking administration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, the establishment of new Fire Stations and the procurement of upgraded equipment and facilities carry significant economic implications for our nation. By bolstering firefighting capabilities, the former FijiFirst Government has created job opportunities, stimulated local economies and attracted investments to communities in both, urban and rural areas. Additionally, by mitigating the risk of fire related losses and property damages, these initiatives help safeguard investment, promotes stability and foster resilience, thus contributing to sustainable economic growth and prosperity. By investing in Fire Stations and equipment upgrades across various region, the former FijiFirst Government has demonstrated its commitment to leaving no one behind, regardless of geographic location. This inclusive approach strengthens the social fabric of our nation, fosters a sense of unity and security among all Fijians, and reinforces the Government’s mandate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through capital grants and collaborative initiatives, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that NFA remains at the forefront of emergency response and disaster management efforts. This support is essential, enabling the NFA to fulfil its vital mission. Furthermore, I also urge for increased emphasis on fire safety education in our schools and universities, recognising the paramount importance of safeguarding the lives of our young children and adults. With the alarming number of fires occurring last year, as highlighted by honourable Tuinaceva, especially in our schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative that we prioritise fire drills and safety trainings to ensure preparedness and awareness among our young youth and students. By instilling fire safety practices earlier on, we can empower our future generations to respond effectively in the event of an emergency, potentially saving lives. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I encourage the NFA to explore modern techniques and technologies to enhance its firefighting capabilities. From advanced firefighting equipment to innovative fire suppression systems and adopting modern techniques significantly, improves the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response efforts. Mr. Speaker, by embracing technological advancement, the NFA can stay at the forefront of firefighting innovation and better serve our communities in times of need. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge all honourable Members of this august Chamber to acknowledge the commendable work of the NFA and support the Report that is before us. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to rise to provide my contributions on the debate of the Review of the National Fire Authority Annual Report for the seven months to July 2016. Admittedly, as mentioned by previous speakers, the Report is somewhat outdated. However, Sir, my remarks would be more in terms of looking forward rather than opining on what is in the distant past. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to note some of the key findings and because I have had the pleasure and honour of interacting with the NFA of late, I, perhaps have an insight running in terms of some of the good things that are already happening at the NFA. One of the key findings of the Committee, Mr. Speaker, was the concerns around the response time to an incident, which was found to be lacking, given notification delays. I report with some</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>488 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 pleasure to Parliament today that I had the honour of being in their National Operations Centre less than a month ago, and they do have now very modern equipment, which actually allows them to start notifying and deploying services to the needy as soon as the calls come in. It is actually quite at an international standard, I do note, however, that there were some concerns raised just recently about the fire in Navuso but other than to say, Mr. Speaker, the systems that current NFA had that I saw in Suva, allows for oversight. When calls come in, they can actually issue instructions to the fire trucks on the ground, on situ to the fire, and they can call other parties on the way, like the Police, the medical ambulances, if need be, to actually provide comprehensive report. So, I thought that, that was a positive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thought just for the purposes of our discussions here today, that I highlight that as a positive for the NFA. The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is more an economic point of view and, that is, generally, when we create support services such as the NFA, I think those of us who lived in the 1970s can recall that in the 1970s, there was no such thing as the Fire Authority and it was a very small operation. Since then, it has grown into a very large operation with quite a few stations across the country and I think, as a Government going forward, we will probably need to look at how…. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- This is the thing with the other side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker. They set up big operations systems but do not think of the implications. Where will the funding come from? What I am trying to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of the Parliament, we are trying to think about how we can deploy user-pay. For example, at the moment, the NFA goes around and now does search and rescue for accidents all over Fiji. In doing that, they get no direct funds from anywhere. There are funds that are going towards Land Transport Authority. Perhaps, some of that can be deployed to assist with the NFA’s good work in that area. The other thing also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is looking at the national fire levy. We have a lot of buildings around the country and the question we need to ask is, is the fire levy adequate enough and can we not increase it to allow us to service better the fire services that our people need. So, those are some of the innovative things that this side of Parliament are thinking about, Mr. Speaker, rather than creating, sort of, kingdoms if you like, without thinking through the implications and what it means to the national coffers. HON. K. K. LAL.- Very poor!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is something like Nabukalou Creek again:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, just looking at some of the futuristic things that the NFA, they now do have a strategic plan that incorporates Sustainable Development Goals and it is not worthy in terms of what they are trying to do in terms of integrated community approach which was alluded to by one of our fellow speakers, introducing community fire wardens in the communities to assist in the care of our people during fires. I congratulate the NFA for that as well. Finally, I think the discussions around a training centre is an interesting one, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think we all agree that should we find the right funding, maybe from some donor partners and institutes that serves our fire authority in terms of providing capacity building for what we will</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 489 become as the economy continues to grow on ever increasing demand and imposition on the country in terms of servicing fires, the need to have very skilled fire wardens and fire officers is a necessity and we hope that in time, something can be done on that. Mr. Speaker, I do commend the Report by the Committee and I support the motion before Parliament. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all the honourable Members who have contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament. Sir, whilst we acknowledge the previous Administration for extending the services of NFA, it is the duty of any Government of the day to continuously improve such services for the benefit of its citizens. On that note, Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament so we can have dinner and then when we return, we will try and look at the two pending motions before we complete the day. The Parliament adjourned at 6.17 p.m.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>490 Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 7.26 p.m.</p></body>
