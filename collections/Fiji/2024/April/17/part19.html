<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture for the year 2018-2019 which was tabled on 22 nd November, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the former and current honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion in regards to the Committee’s Review Report of the 2018-2019 Ministry of Agriculture which was tabled in Parliament by the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Inia Seruiratu, on Wednesday 22 nd November, 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Annual Report was initially referred to the former Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources in 2022, chaired by honourable Sanjay Kirpal. Nevertheless, the current Committee proceeded with its scrutiny as mandated to the Committee under Standing Order 110(1)(c) and made recommendations as a way forward for the Ministry of Agriculture. During the period under review, the Committee noted that the Ministry had six Departments and had set out plans and implemented key policies and key activities to achieve high economic growth whilst ensuring sustainability of Fiji’s agriculture sector. The Ministry continued in partnership with relevant stakeholders to enable more land available for productive and social purposes, which encouraged farming, adequate production, and committed agriculture workforce. The Ministry of Agriculture in 2018-2019 provided enabling environment for direct efficient delivery of services to stakeholders throughout Fiji. The adoption of the professional service delivery by the Ministry promoted maximum production through increased investment in the agriculture sector. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan (NDP) highlighted the strategic goal of the Ministry of Agriculture, which aligned every Fijian to access adequate food for acceptable quality and nutritional value, and to achieve the overall goals of the Ministry of Agriculture. Additionally, the other notable strategic goals was the competitive, sustainable and value adding non-sugar agriculture, promoting food self-sufficiency and the production of those agriculture products where Fiji has a competitive advantage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bipartisan Committee report not only examines, compares and analyses the performance of the Ministry of Agriculture but also took note of the Ministry’s administration, legislation, organisational structure, financial management, functions and programmes. The Committee was grateful to the Ministry of Agriculture Senior Management for their</p><h4>response to the questions which provided more references towards its final report to Parliament.</h4><p>In summary, the Committee noted the following:</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 497 • • The Ministry of Agriculture’s total budgetary allocation for the fiscal year 2018-2019 amounted to $96.8 million, which was an increase from the previous budget. However, the Committee noted that despite this significant increase, the Ministry only achieved 66 percent utilisation rate. The efforts of the Crop Extension and the Animal Health and Production Division in providing feeder food and nutrition security. Feeder food and nutrition security needs are well noted. • While export figures are valuable, equally important is the domestic production and consumption figures in order to fairly represent the Ministry’s contribution to the overall food and nutrition security needs, apart from the agriculture sector’s economic share. • • The Report also needs to reflect the main challenges faced by the Ministry during the fiscal year. This will help in identifying critical issues that will need fixing in order to enhance performance efficiency and production levels as expected by the Ministry and the Government as a whole. Diversify and broaden Fiji’s economic base, the agriculture sector both, sugar and non- sugar, needs special attention and relevant support in order to realise its untapped potential. The Committee would like to see that improvements are made, and changes are undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture, and that the Committee recommendations are considered for implementation. With those words, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list before me from the Whips and the batting order will be led by: 1. Honourable S. Nand; 2. Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; 3. Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and 4. Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before Parliament on the Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture’s 2018-2019 Annual Report. I would like to thank the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for reviewing the Ministry’s Annual Report and coming up with recommendations. These recommendations will enable the Ministry to better it service delivery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture is a crucial industry for Fiji’s development and country’s nutrients in several ways. Food security is one of the key responsibilities of the industry. Agriculture is the primary source of food production. A strong agriculture sector will ensure Fiji can feed its population adequately and reduce dependence on imports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on economic contribution, agriculture is a significant contributor to Fiji’s economy. It provides employment to a significant number of people, especially in the rural sector. The agriculture sector generates income for farmers and those involved in the agribusiness. The agriculture sector is the backbone of rural economy and not only rural economy, but it is also</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>498 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 the backbone of Fiji’s economy. It generates significant foreign exchange in terms of exports like fresh vegetables, root crops, ginger, et cetera. These are some of the agriculture base exports. The research and development done by the Ministry provides our farmers with new techniques, new seeds and better management practices, and how to best control pests and diseases. It also improves the social standing of our population. Overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture reduces the inequalities in our population and also helps in alleviating poverty. Fiji’s agriculture sector is not only essential in making the basic human needs, but it also promotes, as I have said earlier, the economic growth. The Ministry, not only in 2018-2019 but all these years until 2022, had achieved quite a lot under the FijiFirst Government. As the Report states, apart from the meat and dairy sector, pork and poultry industry had a very good performance and almost reaching self-sufficiency level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the thousands or so employees or staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, who have dedicated their lives and their service to the agriculture sector. Their dedication to the sector cannot be stressed enough. I thank them. Crop, Research and Extension has achieved a significant growth. Some commodities have reached self-sufficiency and also are being exported. Rice production Mr. Speaker, Sir, some may not agree, was almost killed by the other Governments but the FijiFirst Government revived it and under their leadership, it achieved a record production. For the other sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government had a multi-pronged approach to developing the industry. These were direct assistance to the farmers, programme management, improved extension services, access to quality inputs and tariff protection to grow the industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government needs to continue providing assistance to the agriculture sector. It is good to see that there is an increase in budgetary allocation to the Ministry. Thank you very much, but we are yet to see all the money being transferred there. You need to assist our farmers by reducing the cost of inputs…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Talk about dairy money:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> … - fertilizer, seeds, transportation cost of raw materials, skilled labour is also an issue in our agriculture sector, the high cost of chemicals, and in the livestock sector - feed. I will talk about dairy on Friday. You wait and listen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I say duty protection, it is to control the cost of production because Fiji is a small State, and we are competing with other countries where the economy of scale really drops us down. Removing duty protection in the agriculture sector could be counterproductive, like the way the Government removed fiscal duty on imported chicken portions. When I talked about it, I was told the whole bird industry is protected, only the portions had no duty on imported chicken. However, one must remember that we do not swallow the whole bird, we cut it in portions and eat it. So, portions coming here, people will go for that and that will encourage dumping in our market because the other countries have a market for premium poultry meat, which is the best meat. The rest, they do not care, they can even dump it here at a very cheap price.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 499 We need to protect our industry. We need to ensure that the cost of production in those industries are controlled, and we need to subsidise the cost of production. We cannot let our farmers out in the cold, we need to protect, encourage and assist them. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government will take heed and protect our agricultural commodities and not throw them under the bus, like they do to their Members. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture for the years 2018 and 2019, that was tabled in this august Parliament on 22 nd November, 2023. Even though the Report is an old one, most of the challenges identified by the Committee on the Ministry’s administration structure, budgetary allocation, programmes and activities undertaken throughout the functional Divisions are still relevant and the Ministry is working towards improving that. One of the weaknesses, in particular, is the failure of the Ministry to fully utilise its allocated budget, and the Ministry is working very hard to make sure that it utilises fully the budget that it is allocated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry takes note of the findings indicated in the Report - failing to highlight linkages of the Ministry’s programmes to the United Nations’ SDGs 1, 2 5 and 15. These UN SDGs are relevant to the Ministry and the Ministry has recently developed a Strategic Development Plan for 2024-2028, and places emphasis on achieving those. The 11 recommendations put forward by the Standing Committee are noted and will be used as a guide for the Ministry, to align the development of its policies for the implementation of its programmes and activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry ensures this august Parliament that the upskilling and recruitment of its officers and realignment of the organisational structure will happen. In addition, the Ministry is increasing the volume of production through mechanisation, assisting agro-processes, capacity building, improving research infrastructure and facilities and the use of new technologies to grow the sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the contribution of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the Review of the 2018-2019 Annual Report of the Ministry of Agriculture and on that note, I thank you for the opportunity and I support the motion before Parliament. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the time given to me to also contribute to the motion before Parliament as presented by the Chairman. This Report was presented during my term as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee and I wish to first acknowledge the Committee and, of course, the Ministry of Agriculture and, most importantly, the stakeholders, particularly the farmers. I will be brief as well, like the honourable Minister. The recommendations are there and as acknowledged by the honourable Minister, although the Report is old for the years 2018 and 2019, the challenges are still relevant, and I thank him for the commitment that he is making to ensure that they make improvements towards the recommendations. However, for the sake of moving the sector forward, something that is not in the recommendation, but you will find in the Chairman’s Foreword, is a recommendation for the establishment of the special committee because I, as Chairman, was unsure of section 101. So, that recommendation is for a special committee under section 129 of our Standing Orders, not only to look at non-sugar, but to look at the whole agriculture sector. I did mention this during my contribution to His Excellency’s Address on the Opening of Parliament last year, that there needs to be commitment by Government to have a special committee</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>500 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 to review the sugar sector. Perhaps, it is time that we look at the whole agriculture sector rather than demarcating between sugar and non-sugar agriculture. We have been communicating as well with the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and probably that is something to consider. The potentials are still great, thank you, again, to the Ministry, the honourable Minister and the honourable Assistant Minister. I asked for their strategic plan just to have a look, and I note with interest and, again, this highlights that gradually, with the right focus and available data, when we link up to the market and look at the whole supply and value chain, the agriculture sector can contribute a lot. What caught me yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I read through this strategic plan, they mentioned about the contribution made by the agriculture sector during the 2021 period where agriculture contributed $763.9 million to total GDP. If you subtract the sugar contribution from that figure, the total amount came to $689.3 million and non-sugar agriculture, according to the strategic plan by the Ministry, grew a share of the national economy from 5.5 percent in 2010 to 8.2 percent in 2021. It can be better and that is what the Government needs, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We look forward to the next Budget and, hopefully, with the continued provision of financing, particularly, in the three areas that are important to agriculture investment - public sector investment, private sector investment and investment at the farm level by farmers, and if they can probably link up to the MSMEs, they should be able to finance some of their expansion programmes and then graduate as well into semi-commercial and commercial level farming. They still highlight the Report by IFC, honourable Minister, perhaps this is the low hanging fruit on what can be the focus, particularly, for the tourism sector. May I conclude, the honourable Minister has talked about administrative issues. One of the key problems, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, with the agriculture sector, and I promised the team that I will raise this when we discuss this Report, is the high turnover. It is happening in almost all Government Ministries, but I think it is quite serious in the Ministry of Agriculture because in here, we have the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP) agencies – Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) have established an office here, the Pacific Community (SPC), our universities, et cetera. The Government invests a lot in its human resources but then, as soon as they come back, we lose them because they are attracted by the offers provided by the other organisations. Honourable Prime Minister, when we visited the Papua New Guinea (PNG) a few years back, I asked the same question to the honourable Minister at PNG and they stated that they also faced the same problem. But they came up with something and probably we can consider this, they always have a counter offer available in order to retain the staff because those particularly with Masters and PhDs have better chances of moving across very quickly, particularly, in the area of research, nutritionist, plant and animal breeders, et cetera, and the honourable Minister knows this. That is probably something that we can consider, not a counteroffer that exceeds what we have been given but to match or is equivalent, perhaps with some terms and conditions that will help staff to reconsider the offers that they have been given because otherwise, we will keep investing in our people and we will keep losing them. However, we have so many potentials and this is very much dependent on the capacity within. We want to do a lot of value addition, et cetera, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but it is the capacity within. Unfortunately, we keep losing them and, perhaps, that is something that the Government can consider.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 501 I wish the honourable Minister all the very best and, again, to the team in the Ministry of Agriculture - keep up the good work and we hope that we will get the necessary support as well, particularly on funding when it comes to the next Budget. I strongly am in favour of the Report before Parliament and support it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition. I think we will take note of that bright suggestion of getting the two Committees to come together, as you have suggested. We will take note of that and probably when we finalise the issue of scrutiny and oversight, then we should be able to get the two Committees together. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion that is before Parliament which is the Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture for the Year 2018 to 2019. I would like to thank the Committee for the formulation of this excellent Report. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture faces quite a lot of challenges, as have been highlighted in the Report. Of course, most of us are quite aware of these challenges which include climate change, market access constraints and the sluggish adoption of technology, access to finance, human capital, pests and diseases and, of course, inadequate infrastructure which has been highlighted by some of the honourable Members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to, perhaps, raise a few issues with regards to some of the policies that the Ministry can, perhaps, adopt to improve the Ministry and, of course, the delivery of their services in the sector as a whole. The first one which I have put down here is the critical need to look at new ways of implementing any project that is being implemented by the Ministry. From my experience in the Ministry, all the policies and everything is there, but I think the implementation is one of the problems. Of course, we need to come up with a new modality of trying to implement the projects. For example, we had this funding from the Indonesian Government to the Prime Minister’s Office which we thought that, perhaps, we give the funds to the private sector, and they will be able to implement the project. We found that quite successful because the private sector is the one that needs funding and they will be reporting also to us about what they have achieved. Of course, we need to have a look also into the consistency of our policies. One of the things that I have found out is the inconsistency in policies. After three years, we have a new policy and a few years, we have new policies again. The farmers are there, and they are always suffering because when they ask for funding for a new commodity, staff, of course, say that the funding has finished. I would suggest, maybe for projects to go more longer term, instead of four years, maybe for projects to be implemented on a 10-year phase. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should be looking at how we can change the mindset of our people. I think the honourable Leader of the Opposition will know about this because he has been talking about that for the last five years. How do we change the mindset of our people in the communities? It is quite important that there needs to be a more integrated approach towards changing the mindset of our people if we are going to have any success in the agriculture sector. The Coalition Government is thinking about these new ideas of working directly with the communities in trying to change their mindset and linking up the communities to the market. We have a few plans and I have discussed it with the Minister on how we can take this plan forward. There are so many opportunities for people in the rural areas but, of course, they are waiting, and they need someone to come in and hold their hand and introduce them to new technologies,</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>502 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 finance and the markets that are there. One of the things that I wish to highlight is the need to train more local people in the communities. I used to work on a project in Tonga where we trained local facilitators as Extension Officers, and I have already shared this with the honourable Leader of the Opposition. It was quite successful. Those are things that I have also shared with the honourable Minister, perhaps the need to train some of our people in the local communities to be Extension Officers because the cost will be much more or less, and they will be quite effective because they are in that community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all from my side and I wish to thank the Committee for the well- produced Report, and I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to speak in reply. Perhaps, if you could take a leaf from what honourable Tubuna is suggesting on what he learnt from Tonga. (Laughter) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions and support the motion before Parliament. Sir, I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the Sitting today. I thank you for all your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 8.32 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77</p></body>
