<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the public gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and internet. Thank you for taking an interest in the workings of your Parliament. Words of Gratitude – Deputy Speaker and Members Also, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Speaker for holding the fort whilst I have been subjected to medical test yesterday. I heard when sitting in the office that the sitting in of the Deputy Speaker and your participation, honourable Members, all went well. I thank each and every one of you for that and also, Madam Deputy Speaker. Chamber Electronic System Honourable Members, you are kindly requested to refrain from or avoid moving your Chamber Bosch System Cards. These are the ones on your electronic system that you have there with you. Over the last two days, the ICT team experienced some disruptions to the control system and the Technicians had advised that it was caused by the card movement. That was quite similar to when we came in in 2014, we even took the card out. We were then advised, again, by my predecessor, “No, you don’t take the card out, you leave it as it is, otherwise it will not work.” So, honourable Members, please, could you leave the card where it is. As soon as you touch it, it shuts down that particular unit with the control system at the top there. The other complication that can arise is that microphones of Members of Parliament will be disconnected from the main central control unit where all microphones are connected and controlled.</p><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>429 A Member will not be able to register a vote and he/she will be registered as absent, as the card will not be recognised in the system. So, please, honourable Members, I trust that we will take heed of this advice. Written Question No. 29/2024 For the information of honourable Members, Written Question No. 29/2024 by honourable Sashi Kiran will be dropped from the Order Paper as the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways had provided a substantive response during his Ministerial Statement on Monday this week. Shipbuilding Industry – SVT Government I would just like to reflect a bit on the issue that was raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications in response to a statement that was made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition yesterday regarding the shipbuilding industry and what transpired after that. For the information of Parliament and honourable Members especially, I happened to be around as a Member of Parliament then. The then Minister of Finance, James Ah Koy, had tried to balance the books of the Government. In so doing, the Government with the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister under the SVT Government, had worked on a plan to try and balance the books and in so doing, they sold off existing assets of the Government and this included shipbuilding. When we came back into power and the books were balanced, they were finally balanced, that was an achievement. But, again, sitting here, I am hearing you talking about $10 billion, et cetera, but when we tried to balance the books, it is a bit of a long story. For this one here, it is totally different from when the honourable Prime Minister was leading the Government then. That is the great story about that. It was not SVT Government that killed the shipping industry, even though I was tasked to revive the shipbuilding industry when I came back as Minister for Transport after serving time in prison. We managed to begin that huge task of trying to find the people who were highly experienced in the shipbuilding industry and most of them had gone abroad, seeking better opportunities, working in shipbuilding industries in Australia and New Zealand. So that is the story of what was raised by honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications to something that was referred. We have checked the Daily Hansard and, again, nothing sinister was said by the honourable Leader of the Opposition to indicate that the SVT Government caused that. No, it was an exercise done by the SVT Government to balance their books.</p></body>
