<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT- FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT- FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports which was tabled on 22 nd November, 2023. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports in November 2023. While deliberating on the Report, the Committee noted the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit (FFIU) contributions towards building a stronger, legal institutional, operational and regulatory environment on anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism in Fiji that addresses domestic risk of money laundering and complies with minimum international standards. In its findings, the Committee noted that FFIU has Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) in place with several local and international stakeholders which enables them to exchange information regarding suspicious transactions of possible money laundering activities, gain direct access to FFIU database, including seconding staff to FFIU. It further noted that in addition to scams, tax evasion was found to be the other top possible underlying criminal activity identified in the suspicious transactions report. The FFIU investigated cases where businesses had not lodged their income tax returns since 2006 and cases where business owners had not registered their business with Fiji Revenue and Customs Service. The Committee expressed its concern on the increasing online scams, pyramid schemes by using mobile money wallets and international debit cards to facilitate various online scams in 2021 and 2022. We would like to urge the public to be vigilant and ensure that they do not fall prey to malicious scams of such nature which would lead to losing their hard-earned money and savings. Honourable Members felt that at present, there is no coordinated approach to deal with scams and money laundering and the law enforcement agencies need to act swiftly. A timely report to FFIU from financial institutions can assist in quick action. There is a lack of a single agency taking responsibility for ensuring that these scams are filtered out in their initial stages and exposed to the public. On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list of speakers provided by the two Whips, as follows: 1. Honourable P. D. Kumar; 2. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 3. Honourable V. Naupoto; and 4. Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice.</p><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 491 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this motion that is before Parliament. Before I speak on the seven recommendations that was made by the Committee to enhance the performance of Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit (FFIU), I would like to express my appreciation to the Director and staff of FFIU for their commitment to maintaining a credible and stable financial system, despite the evolving challenges that come with the sophisticated financial crimes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FFIU was established in 2006 to assist our law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute financial crimes by providing financial intelligence and evidence which is very crucial. The FFIU collects and analyses suspicious transactions and activity reports related to money laundering, terrorist financing and other serious crimes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FFIU can only do its job if it receives quality and timely information from 344 domestic stakeholders and international organisations, as the Chairman of the Committee had mentioned earlier. In 2022, FFIU reported 16 breaches where financial institutions did not adhere to the five-day transaction reporting rule. Also, FFIU reported 19 data quality issues by financial institutions such as incomplete or incorrect information. The number may look small, but we cannot ignore the fact that every transaction matters to uphold the integrity of Fiji’s financial system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FFIU has been verbally warning the institutions for non-compliance, although they have the powers to fine these institutions. It is for this reason that the Committee recommended FFIU to impose fines for breaching the reporting requirement. Again in 2022, the estimated value of suspicious transactions that lead to criminal offence and tax evasion was around $252 million and the top two possible criminal activities identified by FFIU were tax evasion and scams. It is important to highlight that 57 percent of the suspicious transaction cases were referred to the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) for possible violation of the Income Tax Act, Value Added Tax Act and Customs Act. The question is, how is FRCS protecting Government’s revenue and creating a fair and transparent business environment? In this regard, the Committee recommended that FFIU collaborate with FRCS to develop strategies to improve compliance with tax and customs regulations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister of Finance needs money, he needs revenue to provide essential services to all Fijians. He has already fired the warning shot that the 2024-2025 Budget will be a tough one, so every effort must be made to plug any tax revenue leakages. We are all aware of the study carried out by the Asian Development Bank on the black economy in Fiji and in this Parliament, we had discussed this report so many times. Though this report is old, it highlighted that Fiji lost $2.8 billion as a result of informal economic activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering the rise in drug and human trafficking, I believe this figure could be much higher. I think Fiji’s financial crime is much bigger than what is being reported with the increase in the illicit drug trade. Drug peddling is a big business, people engage in drug sales, and they make a lot of money. The money trail needs to be detected to ensure our financial system is not used for cleaning dirty money, and I believe more needs to be done by the FFIU and the enforcement agencies. In 2021, FFIU noted an increase in online and pyramid scams with the sudden surge in the use of digital platforms during COVID-19. We are aware of Fiji's biggest eBay pyramid scam. What we expect is timely intervention from FFIU and also from the enforcement agencies. The Committee made recommendations 1, 2, and 3 to ensure that FFIU uses other social media platforms to increase its online presence rather than just relying on press statements.</p><p>492 Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Fiji Police M-PAiSA Taskforce for their prompt action against M- PAiSA scammers. Almost weekly, we hear someone being charged for scamming mobile phone users, so I thank the Fiji Police Force for that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has proposed that FFIU establish a feedback mechanism either through legislation or a Memorandum of Agreement and I emphasise, Sir, that this is very, very crucial. In 2022, the FFIU forwarded 76 percent of suspicious transaction cases to FRCS for tax evasion and the Fiji Police Force for proceeds of crime and multinational crime. Unfortunately, FFIU receives no feedback - absolutely no feedback - from these enforcement agencies. The lack of oversight and accountability hampers the assessment of FFIU's performance on successful convictions or whether enforcement agencies are doing their job diligently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a recent segment on the 60 Minutes programme revealed that a former Chinese national, now a Fiji citizen, has been on the radar of FFIU for some time. I am not surprised with that information, given the absence of checks and balances that should be put in place. Sadly, the reputation of the Fiji Police Force has been tarnished because of a few corrupt officers, who have been involved in tampering with drug evidence or causing files to go missing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to curb sophisticated financial crime, it is important to change regulations to ensure our financial system is credible and stable. In August 2022, the Financial Transactions Reporting Act and Regulations were amended to reduce the threshold transaction reporting from $10,000 to $5,000. With the increase in financial crimes like tax evasion, money laundering, human trafficking and drug peddling, it was imperative to amend the law. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will recall when this Bill was debated, we had honourable Members, like honourable Qereqeretabua, who was very worried that people would not be able to send money freely because of the new reporting requirement. We had honourable Gavoka who went to the extent of saying that it would affect the ease of doing business and, of course, we had honourable Ro Tuisawau, who was worried that this amendment was introduced to restrict money flow for the elections. We still have that law in place, remittance has increased, in fact, increased a lot, the election was held, and the legislation did not hinder PAP from receiving funds from overseas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, law must evolve with time, and I hope the new CEO of FRCS, Fiji Police Force and FFIU will consider these recommendations to protect Government revenue, create a level playing field for businesses and, above all, protect the integrity of our financial system. I support the motion that is before Parliament. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a brief contribution on the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports as tabled in Parliament. Firstly, may I congratulate the agency for submitting their reports in a timely manner. Currently, we are seeing this as a rarity to get reports here in a timely manner so that when we make contributions on these reports, they are actually relevant. For that, I would like to congratulate the former Manager of FFIU and his team for submitting the Report in a timely manner, which has allowed us to actually have some constructive discussions today. In terms of the FFIU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is without the question that it is one of the leading agencies in Fiji, responsible for the detection of money laundering and terrorist activities. Established under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004, as alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar, notwithstanding the comments from the other side of Parliament then, it is a great initiative because it has allowed the country to create visibility in a very challenging area in terms of</p><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 493 money flows and business. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Report, the FFIU recorded $1.9 million in Electronic Fund Transfer reports in 2021, as a result of increases in money remittance services from across all sectors. The FFIU analysed 752 suspicious transactions and provided 174 cases for dissemination to law enforcement and 27 cases to other agencies. What we have seen, as alluded to as well by honourable Kumar, is the rise in online scams and pyramid schemes, and the use of mobile money wallets and international debit cards to facilitate online scams. On this side of Parliament, I am pleased to report that rather than just looking at this information when it first came to hand last year while we just started in Government, we decided to form an Anti-Scam Taskforce, which is already in existence. Through it, the M-PAiSA Police Taskforce came into creation and what that has done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that for the first time, we have visibility over what is happening in terms of money laundering and scams in our country. The idea, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that it is not going to be a long-term Taskforce. We are combining together across agencies merely to create visibility on issues regarding to scams and then create teeth in legislations. So, I hope, in the not too distant future, to return to Parliament to actually talk about, through the honourable Attorney-General and the honourable Minister of Finance, what we are going to do to ensure that there is teeth in the legislation to be able to prosecute on the scams. One of the interesting things I discovered, Mr. Speaker, and this is information for both sides of Parliament was that, in the current legislative framework, you cannot actually stop a scam until it is actually reported. If the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) sees a scheme and feels that it does not look right, nothing can be done until someone reports a loss on that scam. So, we are hoping that through this Taskforce, we can create a more proactive approach so that we clamp down on some of these schemes as they evolve rather than when the horse is bolted, we then are talking about a historical event. That, I think, is a positive contribution from this side of Parliament, reacting to circumstances as they had happened over the last year, particularly, and we hope to come back to Parliament to actually make good on our intent to really tighten up the laws and ensure that the agencies involved have the powers to actually do what they should do when these types of schemes or scams emerge. Another interesting fact from the Report alludes to cases where businesses had not lodged their tax returns since 2006, as well as business owners that had not registered their businesses with FRCS and perhaps, just as a comment I know this is something that the honourable Minister of Finance is looking into, is to see what can be done for the two agencies to collaborate a lot closer to ensure that this kind of leakages, if you like, in the tax system can be plugged so that the money owing to Government is rightfully collected Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two other points, we are facing one of the major challenges of our generations right now in terms of the drug crisis in our country. So, it is important that Government and certainly we will make sure that the FFIU continues to be well resourced to address the scourge that is occurring in our country and ensure that the drug crisis that currently exists is thoroughly addressed in terms of the money flows in and out, and to ensure that we can crack down to this criminal activity. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in wrapping up, I would like to congratulate the FFIU for engaging with our Australian counterparts that do tracking. It is called the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). I understand the engagement is to try and capacity build and strengthen the FFIU and from outside of Parliament, we will certainly ensure that we build on this</p><p>494 Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024 regional solidarity, as we try and remain united in our battle against money laundering, the drug problem and, of course, terrorist financing activities around the world. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the findings and recommendations made by the Committee and I thank the FFIU for all the good work they are doing. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before Parliament. I would like to thank the Committee for the Review Report, thank you for the findings and the recommendations that are in there and I hope the relevant agencies will read the Report and look at the very good recommendations and findings that you have. I would like to pick up on your finding number eight and if I read it, it says, “FFIU analysed 752 suspicious transaction reports, provided 174 case dissemination reports to law enforcement agencies and 27 cases linked to other cases already disseminated but did not receive feedback on the outcome of these reports.” I hope that something can be done so that they can provide the feedback for those who work in the intelligence community. They know that information requirement or Request for Information (RFI), the loop needs to be closed before that information is turned into intelligence, then it is the intelligence that is useful. This is an Intelligence Unit and if agencies do not close that loop and report back, as they found out in the Committee Report, then they are not giving the FFIU the tool for them to do their job - intelligence and it just remains as information and is never turned into intelligence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had raised this before, crime of this nature is transnational and what FIU is looking at, and I refer to the Budapest Convention. I had raised this before on when will we sign up to the Convention. I know that our Committee had looked at it and brought it back to Parliament and it is up to the Government to bring it back for it to be passed by Parliament because it is transnational. We need the cooperation; we need to link up with those that are at the front of this fight against cybercrime and that Convention provides a very good tool in that fight that we have. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion before Parliament. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are seven recommendations. First of all, may I also highlight how appreciative I am in terms of the Report. It is a very educational tool, neatly done, comprehensive and anyone can pick up this Report by the Standing Committee and follow what the FIU does. It is very elaborate and, again, I echo the same sentiments as expressed by honourable Kamikamica, it is a lesson for Government Departments. On Monday, we were dealing with an Annual Report for after eight years, here we are dealing with 2021 and 2022 - more relevant, easier for planning and also, it is detailed and it is very informative for anyone, even for Parliamentarians and outsiders. There are few issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I just wish to highlight and one of which is Recommendation No. 2 in terms of how they reach out to members of the public. I hope that through the relevant Ministries that this information regarding the scam, reaches the Tikina level and also the Bose ni Yasana. Why? Because most of them, in my view, are the people in the rural areas who are not familiar with the kind of scam that are going on. They need to know how the game is played, otherwise, they will be easily cheated. Some are represented at the provincial level, others, I believe, should be more information at the Tikina level. Also, the issue that has been highlighted by honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Naupoto is the close interaction. I reached out to one of the members of the Council in 2022 and this is the concern, she has never attended any meeting. I am told that there is no meeting of the council for the whole of last</p><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 495 year. There has been a meeting of the council this year. They are important people, very busy people, and this could also be one of the reasons that affects how often they do meet. My concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that if an important entity wants information but that information has not been positively used. I reached out to a staff of the Ministry of Home Affairs and was advised way back in 2014. Honourable Naupoto would be aware as well as honourable Naivalurua, as he was the Commissioner of Police, honourable Vasu would be aware as he was the Commissioner of Prisons. The combined law enforcement agency is a very important agency that digest some of the information that comes from FIU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that I found out last year was that it is non-existent. So, we wonder why the detection and the number of agencies have actually been lower in the past years than initially in 2018. I will take on board, as the Minister responsible, to ensure, first of all, that the Council meets. I am told there was a Terms of Reference that was supposed to be circulated and probably was not finalised. The advertisement for the Director will soon be put in the papers so that a substantive post can be filled. I also wish to acknowledge the role played by the former Director for many years as the Director of FIU. It is a very small unit with two staff on secondment from Fiji Revenue and Customs Authority and one from the Fiji Police Force. Maybe, it is high tide from 2004 to really look at the legislation, review the members, and also make sure that they are more accountable at their work so that the intelligence collated are put into practical action. I am pleased of the fact that there has been some successful prosecution, I have noted 32 in all. I also note in one of the press-release regarding the role played by FIU in terms of Musa. I echo what honourable Naivalurua said. Yes, there is a transnational crime being committed or practised here in Fiji and there are a lot of cases of unexplained wealth. It is so visible, but what we need is to use that information and with a close collaboration with the Police and FICAC so that it leads to a successful prosecution. Only then, then we can say that FIU is playing its key role in terms of combating the financial crimes that are being practised in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, I commend the Report to Parliament. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noted the need to have more check and balances within the financial system, with the increase in drug trafficking, money laundering and human trafficking - the role of FIU is very critical. Money remittance is a critical source of revenue to the country and the use of mobile wallets need to be closely monitored. Dissemination of information has been highlighted by most of the contributors and it is very critical so that information reaches the relevant institution and particularly, our communities in the outer islands. Inter-agency collaboration is very critical. It is quite important that the various agencies play the usual role and, of course, ensuring that they address the regulation that they are supposed to be policing. I wish to thank all the honourable Members for their contribution. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p><p>496 Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 17 th April, 2024</p></body>
