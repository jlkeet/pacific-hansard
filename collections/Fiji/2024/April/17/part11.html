<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Review Report – Fiji National Sports Commission 2020-2022 Annual Reports HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 Annual Reports of the Fiji National Sports Commission. This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), which mandates the Committee to investigate matters related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and media.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>430</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 The Committee with its thorough inquiry and deliberation, was able to fulfil its mandate and report back on its findings to Parliament. Although the years under review were hampered with the presence of COVID-19, this did not impact the work of the Commission in delivering its services to every citizen to actively participate in sports and physical activity. The Committee was grateful that during these years, sports development continued to be improved for our youth and communities and also for the welfare of our players. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the annual reviews were from 2020 to 2022, the Committee acknowledged the current data and information provided by the stakeholders. This assisted the Committee in its review. Therefore, I commend the work that is being carried out by the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) and extend my deepest gratitude to the Executive Chairman, Mr. Peter Mazey and his staff, for their timely assistance in this review process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs; honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, honourable Parveen Bala, honourable Viam Pillay, honourable Aseri Radrodro and a former member of the Committee, honourable Sashi Kiran, for their valuable input and support. May I also thank the Committee Clerks who have served and assisted the Committee for the past 14 months - Marica, Leba, Tevita, Lia and Susana. Thank you very much for your hard work and commitment. I would also like to thank honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Penioni Ravunawa for their assistance during several occasions, serving as Alternate Members for the Standing Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121 (5), I hereby move a motion without notice: That the debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Sugar Industry 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020 Annual Reports. The Committee conducted a site visit to the Western and Northern Divisions late last year and earlier this year, to gain a better understanding of the current practices of the Sugar Industry. The Committee also heard submissions from Officials of the Ministry of Sugar Industry. The Committee was made aware of the various challenges that the Ministry has been facing which include acute shortage of labour, aging infrastructure and abandonment of farms, amongst many other reasons. The Committee noted that the Annual Reports presented by the Ministry of Sugar Industry lacked essential data during the period under review, which would have enabled the</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>431 Committee to make more informed recommendations. The Committee further noted the various programmes introduced by the Ministry of Sugar Industry to assist sugarcane farmers, such as Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance, weedicide and fertilizer subsidy, cane access roads, mechanical harvesters, grants to new farmers and cane cartage grant. While discussing the Reports, the Committee noted that transporting cane through rails would be far more cost effective than through trucks which required more fuel. It would also relieve road congestion and damage caused by cane trucks. While the Committee was satisfied with the Annual Reports during the period under review, it noted that there were areas that can be improved through more enhanced coordination, commitment, and accountability of all stakeholders. At this juncture, I would like to extend our appreciation to all the stakeholders for their valuable input. Finally, I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced this Report - Deputy Chairperson, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Tomasi N. Tunabuna, honourable Premila D. Kumar and honourable Semi T. Koroilavesau. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Ministry of Sugar Industry 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020 Review Reports to Parliament. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. S.

S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present to Parliament the Review Report of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018-2019. Pursuant to Standing Order 38(2) of the Standing Orders of Parliament, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was referred the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018-2019 on 14 th July of last year. This Report captures the review findings and recommendations of the Committee with respect to the Department’s Annual Report. The Committee noted six key findings from its review which are as follows, the: 1. High staff turnover in comparison from 2018-2019 to-date. 2. 3. Low budget allocation for the reported year which, in turn, constraints parliamentary work. Lack of awareness of the powers and authority of Parliament and its Committees by civil servants. Lack of full digitisation of its Committees. 4.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>432</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 5. 6. Significant number of Bills stated for the reported year that stands at 88.5 percent and as a comparative, 99 percent for the year 2023 that were enacted under Standing Order 51. Parliament has considered the inclusive participation of communities at all levels through the medium of broadcasting, and further notes the lack of information supplied with respect to gender composition within the two divisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those were some of the key findings that the Committee noted in its review. I, therefore, would like to highlight some of the recommendations that the Committee had agreed to unanimously: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The Committee recommends the timely submission of Annual Reports. The Committee recommends that a Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) be conducted for the Department, given that the last JEE was conducted in the reported year. The Committee recommends the upgrading of IT systems and full digitisation of Committee sittings. The Committee recommends that Standing Orders be amended to review the use of Standing Order 51 by referring it to a specific sub-committee. The Committee recommends that the Department ensures there is a formal SDG compliant component in all future reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mandated by the provision of the Standing Orders of Parliament, those were some of the recommendations that the Committee had sought following its review. I would like to commend the Members of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. In that regard, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee, I commend the Committee’s Report on the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report to Parliament and seek the support of all Members to take note of the recommendations by the Committee. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion without notice: That the debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
