<body><h3>HON. H. CHAND.- 42.</h3><h4>HON. H. CHAND.- 42.</h4><p>(Laughter) HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 60 on Relevance. I am asking the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations to produce evidence. MR. SPEAKER.- Did you say that because I have noticed this Standing Order moving across. (Laughter) You stood up on a Point of Order without being fully prepared. I think I will not allow that, honourable Hem Chand, please. Time is of the essence here and we are nearing the end of the day,</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>479 plus programmes that are still very much pending here, so I will ask that we continue.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, hypocrisy is well practised in some places.</p><p>(Laughter) Labour inspections, complaints and investigations are crucial roles in upholding labour standards and regulations set forth under the Employment Relations Act 2007. Sir, by conducting regular inspections, Labour Inspectors can identify and address violation of labour laws, such as non- payment of wages, overtime payment, holiday pay, leave entitlements and other dues in accordance with the Employment Relations Act 2007and relevant Wages Regulations. Through these inspections, we can safeguard the rights of workers and hold non-compliant employers accountable for their actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, compliance with labour laws is not just a legal obligation but a moral responsibility. When employers adhere to labour laws, they contribute to the wellbeing and dignity of employees. By providing fair wages, ensuring safe working conditions, and respecting workers’ rights, employers create a positive work environment that fosters productivity, loyalty and mutual respect. Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, compliance with labour laws is essential for promoting social justice and equality in our society. By enforcing labour standards, we can combat exploitation, discrimination and unfair labour practices, that undermine the rights and dignity of workers. When we uphold labour laws, we uphold the values of justice, equality and human rights for all individuals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Labour Standards and Compliance Section of my Ministry is responsible for the enforcement and compliance of the Employment Relations Act 2007 and Wages Regulations 2010, as well as the National Minimum Wage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has conducted 2,017 labour compliance inspections from 1 st August, 2023 to 31 st March, 2024, achieving 86 percent of the targets set for the eight months which was 2,336. Our annual target is 3,500, and we now intend to increase this to 4,500 or up to 5,000. We were not able to do this in the past year because there were 30-plus vacant positions that had not been filled for a number of years. We are almost on the verge of completing that exercise, so we can increase the number of inspections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has resolved 746 labour complaints out of a total of 999 cases received from 2022 to March 2024, achieving a settlement rate of 75 percent. These complaints were regarding the non-payment of wages due, annual leave, overtime, meal allowance and maternity leave. The Ministry has over 600 cases before the Employment Relations Tribunal for adjudication, where employers have failed to pay dues to workers and comply with the minimum standards. The total recovery from 1 st August, 2023 to March 2024, stands at $660,000 which has been paid out to the workers through the efforts of the Ministry’s Compliance Section. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; does the Ministry conduct training and awareness for employers and employees on compliance with the minimum standard? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s proactive role is crucial in reducing the number of labour complaints received. Both employers and workers need to be made aware of the</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>480</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>17 th April, 2024 Employment Relations Act 2007 and its subsidiary legislations for compliance purposes and avoid potential legal issues and disputes. During the eight months from 1 st August to 31 st March 2024, the Ministry has conducted a total of 2,044 awareness trainings to employers. Out of those, 2,022 were conducted for awareness while 22 were structured training sessions which were conducted with employees. The list of 22 are the bigger employers – Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji; 1. 2. Natural Waters of Fiji; 3. Freebird Institute; 4. Makans Drugs &amp; Pharmaceuticals; 5. Epic International Fiji; 6. Water Authority of Fiji; 7. Fiji Revenue and Customs Service; 8. Fiji Marriott Resort Momi Bay; 9. BSP Life; 10. Brijlal &amp; Sons; 11. Sheraton Fiji; 12. Namale Resort and Spa; 13. Bank of Baroda; 14. Double Tree Resort; 15. Hilton Fiji Resort; 16. Radisson Blu; 17. Fijian Broadcasting Corporation; 18. National Fire Authority; 19. United Apparel; and a second one was done for 20. Namale Resort in Savusavu in November 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, training in employment relations helps improve working relationships between workers and employers, leading to a more positive work environment, equips individuals with skills to effectively resolve conflicts and disputes that may arise in the workplace. Similarly, by promoting a better understanding of employment rights and responsibilities, this would contribute to increase in productivity and efficiency at the workplace. It also enhances the spirit of good faith, which is the cornerstone of our employment relations in Fiji. We try to bring employers and workers together - bring about the awareness, so that they can work together and build their trust in each other which, of course, had been missing for quite some years now. We are in the process of rebuilding all that, which had been dismantled because of the amendment of the labour laws that disallowed that kind of interaction. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister. Yesterday, I raised my concern about how our local workers are treated in Australia and New Zealand. I was not satisfied with the answer by the honourable Minister, talking about the role of Country Liaison Officers because there is a difference between liaison and arbitration, and that is my concern. You have talked about labour laws and workers’ rights. My simple question is on employment relations, preparing our workers who are to leave for offshore employment. Is that part of the training package pre-departure? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, we have four days of training and this training is provided not only by our team but we also have resource persons from Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and they do it together. They try to do their best</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>17 th April, 2024 Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 481 to familiarise themselves with what they can expect in terms of terms and conditions or labour laws in Australia. As I have stated earlier, four days is not enough, and we are now working with our counterparts in Australia to assist us, to extend the four-day training to, at least, two weeks where we will be able to do a better job. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the investigation conducted by Ministry of Employment is really effective in terms of helping our employees. What I wanted to ask was, for example, justice delayed is justice denied. We do understand that there is an Employment Tribunal which sits to deal with all the cases referred to the Tribunal and sometimes we do not have a sitting Magistrate looking after this Tribunal. Has there been any work done to have a full time Magistrate who can fast-track all these cases? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have is what we had inherited. With my experience, Sir, being a trade unionist under that Administration, I waited for four years for the Employment Relations Tribunal to give a decision. There are cases that had been pending for four to seven years in the Employment Court and in the Employment Tribunal. so, it is nothing new from what we are doing now. I have spoken to the honourable Attorney-General, we are also requesting the honourable Chief Justice to appoint more tribunals and we are also now revising the labour laws. We are now going to straighten things so that we can expedite the whole process. Written Question Immigration Laws and Policy (Question No. 28/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: In light of the changes in our Immigration Law and policy as announced by the Minister, can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament inform Parliament on the following – (a) how many that have come to Fiji as Business visitors are now employed and the general sector where they are employed; (b) how many of those non-citizens that are registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula have entered Fiji through the permit exemption granted under the Immigration (Amendment) Act 2023; and how many foreigners who are descendants of a Fiji Citizen on 10 th October, 1970 have entered Fiji through the permit exemptions granted under the Immigration (Exemption by Descent) Order 2023? (c) HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I will table my response at a later sitting date as permitted under Standing Order 45(3).</p></body>
