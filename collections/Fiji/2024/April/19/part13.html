<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, may I remind you that each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes. The Minister or Minister’s responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech may response. No seconder is required, and there will be no other debate soon after the speech has been delivered. Farmer’s Perspective on the Dairy Sector HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my End of Week Statement in relation to the Dairy Industry from the farmer’s perspective. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dairy industry in Fiji started after the World War I by the European servicemen. These farms in Tailevu were involved in churning cream and supplying to the first butter factory which was established in Korovou in 1921. By 1924, another two butter factories were setup - one in Waila, Nausori on the banks of Rewa River, later to become Rewa Cooperative Dairy Company Limited; and the other was in Navua known as Fiji Pastoral Company. Later on, some Sikh community moved to Tailevu to help further develop the industry and now are major contributors to the total national raw milk production. I was told Kashmir Singh, together with his son Harvindar Singh, who are the largest single producer of raw milk in Fiji. By 1968, all these three companies had merged to become Rewa Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (RCDCL) and also by this time, the factory had moved or relocated to Nabua so it could be closer to the market. Mr. Mr. Speaker, Sir, production from the peak of over 10 million litres has dropped down to 6 million litres in 2023. This decline in production was not the result of the factory being sold to RCDCL but was due to prevalence of Bovine Brucellosis and Bovine Tuberculosis in the dairy industry. The industry has lost over 5,000 productive animals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see any other career as dedicated and demanding as a dairy farmer. Day in day out, they have to go out there and manage the stock and carry out their farming duties. Farmers have to wake up as early as 3.00 am to bring the cows in for milking. This is not done five days a week or seven days a week, this is done in 365 days a year. No other job demands this kind of dedication and for this, I salute our dairy farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, not specific to dairy, but in Fiji, agriculture or farming is not seen as a career and this has resulted in aging farmers, the dairy is no exception. This has been influenced by the</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>592 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 urban sector drift and for employment in non-agriculture sector, it is perceived to have better salary and better life. Dairy is seen as a labour intensive, risky and lack of prestige profession compared to the jobs. In most of the small holder farms, dairy farming is not commercially looked at. Some farmers resort to selling their animals to meet community engagements or other financial needs. They do not realise that this is their stock which is generating them income and replacing this sold stock will take, at least, a year and half or two years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmer trainings by relevant authorities have almost grinded to a standstill and the focus of these institutions have been shifted from serving the farmers and advisory to running coffee shops and supermarkets. Institutions have lost focus of its responsibility of serving the dairy industry and the dairy farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of farm inputs have risen significantly. To gain efficiency in production, the industry needs consistent supply of dairy feed of good quality. Apart from two ingredients, the rest are either imported or a by-product of imported commodity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, soil conditions on the farms after generations of grazing has deteriorated. Liming is a common practice that needs to be done to improve soil condition, particularly in acidic soils. This neutralises the acidic soil, improves soil condition and improves nutrient uptake. Mr. Speaker Sir, land lease security is mandatory for dairy farming. There are some farmers whose land leases have not been renewed and this is sending chills down the spine of few other farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, stock or animal theft on the dairy farms negatively affects production and the overall farm efficiency. The dairy sector has recently seen a surge in theft of dairy animals. Just on one farm, Sir, 24 animals were stolen within a span of five months. Reports have been lodged, culprits have been identified and still, nothing has been done. Despite the assurance of the Permeant Secretary of Ministry of Defence, nothing has been done so far. The farmers are questioning whether the Police is capable of resolving the issue. The faith on the efficiency of Police is dwindling down. The farmers have also requested Government’s assistance in establishing pasture and fodder banks. Malato and juncao are two fodder species introduced by the previous Government, but more needs to be introduced, including other good fodder products. This will enable the farmers to provide required nutrients to the dairy animals. Good quality pasture and good fodder can have a positive impact on milk quality and milk production. It also reduces the supplementary Fiji requirement in the dairy. Having a fodder bank on the farm will also cushion the effects of climate change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our farmers are struggling to meet the high cost of farm inputs. Farmers need assistance in dairy feed. The price of one of our local product, molasses, have almost doubled in the recent years. Farm chemicals is mandatory for dairy farms to maintain quality and hygiene, and this needs to be subsidised so that, we are able to use the right product on the farm. The reliance on labour on dairy farm is heavy, therefore, investment in milking machines and</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 593 The reliance on labour on dairy farm is heavy, therefore, investment in milking machines and other machines is important. They are requesting Government to subsidise the cost of milking machines and milking machine parts and dairy drugs. Animal health is of utmost importance in maintaining good efficiency on the farm. Therefore, the farmers are requesting the Government to assist them with subsidised dairy drugs, including antibiotics for control of mastitis, which is prevalent in our farms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture in conjunction with the relevant authorities needs to embark on a breed improvement plan for all farmers, especially those who have lost a significant number of animals due to bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis. The large farms are the ones which are commercially run and have the capability of increasing production. Often these breed improvement programmes are not run on these farms. Farmers are asked to either eradicate the disease off completely before any assistance can be provided. If the Ministry starts waiting long enough, there will be no large farms to provide any assistance to. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that Fiji cannot import cattle from Australia and New Zealand due to diseases prevalent in these countries. Therefore, the Government needs to embark on a major artificial breeding programme using embryo transfer and artificial insemination. New Zealand has over 4 million cows and out of that, 3.9 million cows had been artificially bred in the dairy. Fiji has less than 10,000 cows. There is nothing that should stop us from doing so. Calf rearing is another area the farmers need assistance in. The subsidised calf milk needs to continue so that the farmer can rear good quality calves which can become better quality milking animals later on. Mr Speaker Sir, the elements of climate change has seriously affected the dairy industry. First is the availability of clean water on the farms. Some farms have almost no access to clean water on the farm. The farmers have requested if other means could be explored, including boreholes on the farms so that they can have access to clean water and maintain quality on the farm. Heat stress has significantly contributed to the decrease in the milk letdown. The erection of pre-milking covered holding yards can help in reducing the heat stress. The reduction of heat stress can increase the milk production by 5 percent to 7 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, continuous training is very important in the industry, therefore, the farmers have requested if a model farm and a heifer rearing farm can be established. These farms, together with these courses run by FNU can provide training for optimum management of dairy farms. Farmers, together with their farm hands can be trained there. This week, honourable Tubuna, while deliberating on the Ministry of Agriculture’s Annual Report asked if the farmers are prepared to change. Yes, farmers are preparing for change. MR. SPEAKER.- Please, do round off, honourable Nand. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Famers, if see it, feel it, they will change it. Finally, raw milk price has slightly increased over the last few years. However, it was not sufficient enough to cover all the costs of production. I thank the Government for providing a top-up on the farm gate price and look forward to their continued support. However, Sir, they have also pointed out that the price of butter fat still stands at $5.80 a kilogramme. One only needs to look at the price of butter on the shelves in the market to see the huge disparity. The farmers have humbly requested the Government if they can intervene and ensure a just price for excess butter fat is received by farmers. They will be forever grateful. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this, I would like to thank the honourable Members for listening to this End of Week Statement and thank the Government for its continued support to the dairy industry,</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>594 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 and I look forward to this continued support. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me thank the honourable Sachida for a comprehensive speech on the state of the dairy industry in Fiji. Let me just take us a little back in time. On Friday, 24 th March 2017, just a little over seven years ago, honourable Prof. Prasad had moved a motion and I quote: “That this Parliament agrees that in light of the struggling dairy industry and worsening plight of dairy farmers, an extensive rehabilitation package be implemented for the vibrance and vitality of the dairy industry and the dairy farmers.” Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the then FijiFirst Government rejected the motion outright. The then Attorney-General and Minister for Economy labelled the call for assistance to dairy farmers as political. The honourable Prof. Biman Prasad was likened to a spider moving from the sugar industry to the dairy industry. Now, seven years later the former CEO of FCDCL, the honourable Sachida Nand who is now a member of the FijiFirst Opposition wants dairy farmers helped and I thank him for that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, call it political grandstanding, one upmanship, taulo, masipolo or whatever it was then, I call on the Opposition to show a genuine sense of bipartisanship for now for the good of our dairy farmers and the nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, milk production statistics from 2009 to 2023 shows that milk production has grown by 1.1 percent annually. However, the volume of formal milk production that is supplied directly to the dairy industry has fallen by 34.5 percent over the same period. During this period, formal milk production peaked at 8.96 million litres in 2014. In 2023, it was 5.8 million litres. Worse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, only 46 farmers supply 74 percent of formal milk production as of December 2023. This is out of the 161 farmers engaged in the dairy industry. In 2023, the total milk production was 11.35 million litres, only 5.87 million litres were from dairy farmers as formal production which is 51.7 percent of total milk production. Therefore, 48.3 percent was not formal milk production. Despite giving zero rated exclusivity to a corporate giant for 10 years, the former government miserably failed to help dairy farmers in terms of both boosting their production, increasing the number of farmers and reducing cost of production. That company a subsidiary of a corporate giant milked profits and left the dairy farmers high and dry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- The formal milk production figures is testimony to this indisputable fact. Honourable Sachida Nand knows this too well but will not say it for obvious reasons:</span> Nevertheless, dairy remains one of the important industries as it provides economic benefits for livelihoods and income generation to hundreds of dairy farmers and their families in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering the high number of challenges faced by the industry, the Government continues to support and provide incentives through various programmes to strengthen the dairy industry. From 2010 to 2023, a total of $29 million have been allocated by the Ministry through the following programmes; • Dairy development programme; and • Dairy industry programme. The highest amount of $5.5 million was allocated to the dairy industry this financial year by</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 595 the Coalition Government. Under these programmes, farmers have been assisted with initiatives like the price incentive where the Government provides a top up related to the milk price, subsidises milk cartage, feed, and calf milk replacer, provides basic infrastructures such as dairy sheds, calf sheds, stock yards, et cetera. These initiatives have been provided to enhance the productivity of dairy farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as has been rightly stated by my friend, honourable Sachida, apart from the above programmes, the dairy industry has also assisted in the control of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis. In 2009, Brucellosis re-emerged while Tuberculosis reached its peak of infections in 2014 causing severe devastation to the dairy industry. Initially some farms experienced a high prevalence rate of TB infected animals reaching up to 60 percent. However, due to the Ministry’s Ongoing Testing Programme, these farms now have a prevalence rate of 1 percent to 2 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has successfully decreased the Brucellosis infection with no cases being reported over the last three years. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Ministry’s Rehabilitation Programme, farmers have been assisted through the improvement of fencing, provision of calf rearing facility for farmers, provision of stockyard for birth control of animals, compensating farmers who lost their livestock through TB and Brucellosis. Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the challenges due to inbreeding on farms have been addressed by the Government through the introduction of the artificial insemination programme, and of course, the embryo transfer programme where we now have four new cattle breeds, one of them being the Brown Swiss which turns out to be both a dairy and beef breed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apparently the Ministry is providing bulls with improve genetics to farms that have been declared free of TB and Brucellosis in order to improve the genetics on those farms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, like any other agriculture sector, the present generation are not interested in making dairy their livelihood. To combat this endemic issue, the Ministry and Fiji Higher Education Commission in collaboration with Navuso Agricultural Technical Institute have introduced a National Qualification Certificate in Dairy Production to young farmers. The first cohort of 15 young farmers have recently graduated from this Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address labour shortage, the Ministry has provided machines to assist farmers which include milking machines, roto harvesters, soft cutters to ease the process of milking harvesting and feeding cattle. Funds have been provided to farmers for the improvement and establishment of parcels through land preparation using tractors and diggers. Recently, the dairy industry has encountered a significant increase in the cost of inputs. To mitigate these high costs, several activities are subsidised through the dairy development programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, land as correctly stated by the honourable Sachida is a sensitive issue and the Ministry is not mandated to negotiate lease renewal with landowners, but it works with iTLTB to deal with this issue and has been collaborating with other stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lack of reinvestment by dairy farmers on their farms and farmers are mostly dependent on Government assistance to improve their facilities. These farmers also tend to invest elsewhere from the proceeds gained from the dairy business. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial technical support provided by Government has contributed to an increase in milk supply from 4.2 million millilitres to 5.87 million millilitres in 2023. There is an indication that the milk productivity per farmer and account numbers have increased, and farms are recovering well from the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of TB and Brucellosis.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>596 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, efforts are underway by the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways to develop the informal dairy sector and capitalise on milk production mainly from smallholder farms to ensure that milk is pasteurised to reduce the risk of transmission of zoonotic disease. As part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s expansion plan, we will further develop the necessary infrastructure for dairy farms in the Western, Central and Northern Division. The Ministry is committed to assisting farmers in addressing their challenges in collaboration with all stakeholders through various interventions to improve farm productivity and profitability. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to draw your attention that we might be going over the 12.30 mark in our sitting today, and as such for the purpose of complying with Standing Orders with respect to the sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of Government in Parliament to move a Suspension Motion.</p></body>
