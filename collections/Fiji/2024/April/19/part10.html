<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for the week and also those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. USP Law Students Honourable Members, please join me in welcoming the law students from the University of the South Pacific. Welcome to your Parliament and whilst Friday’s proceedings are usually short, I hope that you will have an appreciation of the mechanics of Parliament proceedings. This is about the second incoming batches to attend the sittings and we are so humbly proud of your presence here because at times we do not know whether there is interest in the workings of Parliament or not. People place less importance in the proceedings of Parliament, but this is where, let me remind you, you may have been taught this, this is where they make laws, this is where they repeal the laws, and this is where they amend the laws of the country. It is a very important duty that the honourable Members here are charged to be responsible with and answer back to the people who voted them in. This is the people’s House, this august Parliament, and we wish you well in your stay here with us. Learn as much as possible when you are here with us. Only learn the good things, not the bad things. The bad things you leave behind in Parliament. I am supposed to welcome another gentleman, but he is not here, and that is alright.</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024</p></body>
