<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE END OF WEEK STATEMENTS Cost of Living in Fiji Today HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, one of the single greatest thing affecting your normal every Fijian today is the cost of living. The cost of what they have to pay or what they have to purchase in order just to live their normal lives. Everyday (I think all of us), we meet people who complain about these all the time. We meet them in the taxis, buses, churches, outside here or wherever we go – in the markets, people are always complaining about these. It is in sessions, and it is never ending. I think people have the right to be able to do that because they are just talking about the problems that they face every day. They have the right to talk about their day-to-day problems and we have all noticed these with our own eyes as we move around Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for me in particular, just speaking about myself, I live in Nakasi and we buy our vegetables at a little roadside market there. There is a lady by the name of Mouna that we buy from, and this past year, I have seen the sizes of the pile of cassava that she sells for $10 get smaller and smaller and smaller. Just in one year, it has really shrunk the amount of cassava that you can get for $10. It has become much smaller.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 597 Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few months ago, you could buy a sack of cassava wholesale at maybe at $60 or $70. At one time, it shot up to $150 but that is what is happening, everything is getting much more expensive. My family is one which eats rice very rarely, but today $10 worth of rice now goes far more than $10 worth of cassava. The $10 worth of cassava just goes in one meal, so even for people like us, our dietary habits are beginning to change. As people try to make do with the resources that they have, I am lucky, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have this job, I earn an income and if I want to eat cassava, I will eat cassava but that is not true for everyone else in the greater Suva region. It is not true for everyone else. The price of everything has gone up. Everything! HON. K. K. LAL.- Hear, hear! HON. J. USAMATE.- Nothing where the price has gone down, everything has gone up, not just food items, wherever you pay VAT, that price has gone up and it is affecting everyone right across this country. To a large degree, people’s incomes have not moved up; so, when your income is not moving up and the things that you are paying, the price is going up. What happens? You are creating more and more hardship. What this Government has done so far, so this country this past year, one thing it has achieved is giving more people hardship to the cost of living that is high. You have created hardships. HON. K. K. LAL.- Hear, hear! HON. J. USAMATE.- The Deputy Prime Minister is smiling there, but he has not looked into people’s eyes, as I talked to them face to face, you can see the pain that they have in their eyes. Pain in their eyes when they talk about this thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They wring their hands like I’m wringing my hands. What is going on? What is happening? What is this Government doing? (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hardship has been created in all of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- You created it during your time. That is why it is happening:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Miniter is going to say, “hey, that inflation, a lot of it is imported.” That has happened, we know that all that has happened because when the imported inflation comes in, it affects everything in your domestic. It affects the costs of fuel and affects everything else. But here, the really bad thing is this. This is the really bad thing. HON PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Oh come on!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Very, very bad thing that happened.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> What is that? HON. J. USAMATE. – Were you being hit by this imported inflation then this Government decided to increase VAT. HON. K. K. LAL.- Yeah!</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>598 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- More and you are wrong:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> When we were being hit by this imported inflation, let us put another nail in the coffin HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Hogwash HON. J. USAMATE.- Then they increased VAT and then just exacerbated the whole thing. It made it worse right across the country. Everybody felt it, there is no part of this country where people did not feel that. What they basically did, they took our people, they waited for the bus, and they threw them under the bus… HON. K. K. LAL.- Very poor HON. J. USAMATE.- … even while they were going through all that imported inflation. There are all kinds of things that happened then. Have you have seen some funny things happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir? We have had even this thing happened in Fiji, it is shrinkflation. That means, there used to be a bottle of milk cost like this, maybe it costs $5, they will say. “oh, the same bottle of milk is still at $5 but they reduced the amount of milk in the bottle; that is called shrinkflation. That has been happening in some places and it has happened a lot in other countries and probably happening here too though. Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this week, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was talking about the reduction in import excise of 10 percent. But the funny thing is this, with the reduction of that import excise on chicken portions, what happened to the prices of chicken portions in the shop, did it decline?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPPOSITION MEMBER.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE:</span> – No, it did not.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- So there is something going there. Somebody is making money out of these policy changes. We run to the shop, we see it does not decline much. The point is, what is happening to all these things? Apology, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not only affecting the buyers. This week we went and visited some small shops in Suva. We visited one lady that sells handicrafts, and she says that the amount of sales that they have got from last year to this year has declined. When we interviewed her, she had not sold a single thing. It shows that people have less discretionary income to buy the things that they normally want to buy. Two other shops that we visited too they said the same thing, they did not have enough money and sales were down. People do not have enough money to buy the small things that they used to buy before and we hear this across the board for all the businesses in Suva where revenue is down. Government has been saying that inflation is because of imports (fair enough)... MR. SPEAKER.- Is it shrinking?</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 599 (Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Government needs to start asking what they can do. We are thankful to Government for all the assistance to the social wages, all the things that it has done to help the people of Fiji, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has already hinted one thing this week that maybe we could buy chicken from Indonesia rather than from New Zealand - we can explore those things. We note also that FCCC has just announced it will undertake a market inquiry into the present practice of the supermarket industry from the 1 st of next month. This is welcomed but I think this should have happened long time ago. As you have seen what had happened in the chicken portions. Obviously, when these things are happening, some people are playing funny business around the place. Government needs to look at what it can do, so that it can help the people who are suffering. People are suffering under the high cost of living, suffering abysmally, they need some assistance, the Government needs to relieve the pressure. Inflation was there, yes, but Government needs to do something to help the people of this country so that they can live with the high cost of living that they are facing right now. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his statement. I am afraid honourable Usamate is fast earning a title of Mr. Hogwash. The literal meaning of ‘hogwash’ is nonsense and a word designed to deceive the people. Precisely, that is what the honourable Member was trying to do when he was talking about the cost of living. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of us appreciate the fact that there has been changes in the prices and honourable Usamate, being a statistician, understands this very well. The other point that I want to make is that the Opposition actually fails to appreciate what the Coalition Government has been working very diligently to address some of the fundamental issues in the economy, starting from looking at how we can reform our revenue measures and aspart of that, we have instituted and implemented tax reforms. They talk about VAT, they make a big deal about it, they go and actually lie to the people that everything has increased in terms of prices is simply because of VAT, and that is a complete lie. Let me just give for their purpose and for the people of this country the history of VAT. Mr. Speaker, Sir, VAT was first introduced in 1992 under the SVT Government of 10 percent. It was raised to 12.5 percent in 2003 and in 2011, under the Bainimarama Government, it was increased to 15 percent. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was under Bainimarama Government:</span></p><p>Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we, in the Opposition, were raising the impact of VAT in 2016, it was high. In 2016, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same Government (FijiFirst Government) adopted 9 percent VAT with no zero rating on basic food items. Then in 2021 and 2022, they changed it further to three rates - zero percent for 21 basic food items; 9 percent and 15 percent. Obviously, that created quite a bit of distortion. Government was actually losing revenue, so when we came into Government, we reformed the system. We kept the 21 items zero-rated, and on top of that, we added</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>600 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 prescribed medicine. So, if you go to a doctor, you get a prescription, you go to the pharmacy, you do not pay back. We have now 22 items and we raised the VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent, and those that were 15 percent, we kept it there. So, that is the history of VAT, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate agreed that there are other factors that cause the prices, for example, the Red Sea crisis right now, and he talked about imported inflation, that is always the case. But, as a government, we recognised that even with zero percent VAT on 21 basic food items, post-COVID-19 and during COVID-19, when the freight costs went up by three times or four times up, that pushed the prices with zero percent VAT on basic food items. So, even post-COVID-19, the freight cost remained high, so in some cases, even with zero percent VAT on basic food items, the prices still went up. However, we, as a government, recognised that and one of the first things that we did when we came into Government, in the first month, we recognised that people needed support, we allocated $50 million, we paid $200 each to more than 200,000 students right from pre-school to Year 12. We repeated that, again, this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Again, we put in $43 million and, again, we have more than 212,000 students. We also allocated $7.5 million to continue the 10 percent reduction in bus fares for additional six months, and we made sure that we forgive $650 million – the burden on 53,000 families. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Graduates coming out of the university, having to start paying all that income, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is now in the pockets of those families and households. We also made sure in the Budget that we did not touch the income tax threshold, so all those people earning below $30,000 are not paying any income tax. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not want to hear the truth because this is what they do. They go out there and lie to the people. (Chorus on interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- In the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also reduced duties on a number of items. This is the report I received from Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) - a brief, and contrary to what honourable Usamate said when he made the generalisation, he said that the prices of all things have gone up. All things! That was what he said and that was also what the report said. Let me redo the list of items on which the prices have actually gone down, Mr. Speaker. I will give them this report so that they can take it and show it to the people and stop lying. Let me read the list - edible oil, butter, liquid milk, powdered milk, baby milk, canned fish, corned meat, salt, margarine, tea leaves, under the produce, the prices of potatoes, onions, and garlic have gone down. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Additionally, Mr. Speaker, from the Budget, whatever</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 601 additional revenue we got, we increased monthly pension for all Government pensioners by 15 percent, monthly allowance increased from $100 to $115 for people above 65 years and increased those from $100 to $125 for people over 70 years. We increased the Family Assistance Scheme. We increased the monthly Children Protection Allowance, allowance for Persons with Disability was increased from $90 to $104 per month, Bus Fare Allowance for the elderly and disabled has been allocated $25 per month, free health schemes provided to patients by private general practitioners with a combined household income of $30,000 or less, continuation of the EFL and water subsidy. So, these are things, Mr. Speaker, that the Government has done to mitigate, not impact… (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- Not only that but also the impact of the imported inflation:</span></p><p>The other point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate…. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Honourable Kumar is always very irritating, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>(Laughter) HON. PRO. B. C. PRASAD.- Honourable Usamate is a bit of an economist, he needs to understand this because you cannot hold the prices, even if you had zero VAT or no VAT at all, still you will find that the prices will increase because there are other factors. The important thing for us as a Parliament and as a government, including those in the Opposition, is that we have to understand that we have to find ways to increase the income, put more money into the pockets of the people. Some of the measures we have done, are actually doing that. I have said this in Parliament before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as a result of shortage of labour, formal sector employment has not only increased but the wages in the formal sector has also increased by about 10 percent to 12 percent. So, there are some natural corrective measures, and he talked about vegetables. He was trying to give the story about vegetable prices. Mr. Speaker, vegetable prices is based on supply and demand. If it has been raining for one-and-a-half months and there is flooding, and you go to the market, you are going to get cassava this much and costing you more. What is the economics there? Oh, that is simple supply and demand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the people of this country, yes, we understand that some prices have gone up, we that some people might be struggling, but as I have indicated, the Budget has a very clear plan in terms of helping our people. In the next Budget, we have already announced that minimum wages is being reviewed and during the next Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will announce that. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- So, I want assure the people of this country that the Government is fully aware of that and the measures that we have to put in will help the people. Thank</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>602 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 you, Mr. Speaker. Fiji’s Air Services Agreement HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament and members of the public sitting in the gallery and all those tuning in live on Parliament Facebook channel; I am pleased to present an End of Week Statement that gives insight into the rights that governs airlines of each country to fly into another country’s air space and land at their airports. The freedom to fly from one sovereign State to another is not a right but rather an outcome of interstate negotiations, the outcomes of which are embedded in bilateral Air Services Agreements (ASAs). Mr. Speaker, Sir, ASAs permit international air transport services between two parties involved in a negotiation process and specify a wide terms and conditions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the life of aviation is an admiration for whoever looks up to the clouds, stars and sky. Civil Aviation is a transnational global enterprise that supports the world economy by facilitating efficient cross-border air transportation. Air transport supports integration into the global economy and provides critical connectivity on national, regional and international levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the importance of air transport stems from its ability to create and support jobs, enhance trade and connectivity between people and countries, promote tourism and connect remote communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bilateral Air Transport Agreement, also known as Air Services Agreement, between two sovereignties, comprise various clauses and rules that govern the terms and conditions of international air travel. Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the importance of this Agreements and the unique characteristics of individual countries, the content of an ASA may vary, depending on a number of factors, most notably the preferences of parties and their territories. Nonetheless, there are certain basic components seen in most ASAs. These features include the route designation, tariffs and pricing, capacity and frequency, safety and security standards, customs and immigration regulations and environmental and regulatory compliance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three types of ASAs - 1. 2. Traditional ASAs which specify the number of carriers, which country, the aircraft types, the number of flights and the destination that each country airline can serve. Liberal ASAs which allows for greater flexibility and less government control over the number of carriers for each country, as well as the aircraft type and frequency of flights and destinations. Liberal ASAs allow for market-based pricing but they also allow for government intervention. 3. Open Skies ASAs which do not limit the number of services, capacity and route an airline can operate. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, airlines in each country can determine their own prices based on market conditions. Fiji currently has a total of 29 bilateral ASAs that have been negotiated over the years. A few of these ASAs dates back to colonial times. These ASAs are traditional and have</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 603 limitation on capacity, frequency and the routes to be operated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fundamental consideration before engaging into discussions for potential destination is it will bring significant benefits to the Fijian economy and the tourism sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ASAs allow airlines that are parties to the Agreement to operate commercial air services under the terms of Agreement. Presently, nine international airlines provide commercial air services to Fiji, as a result of this ASAs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our national airline - Fiji Airways, directly operates to 24 destinations both, regional and international, and have recorded six consecutive years of successive growth in passenger numbers from 5 percent to 20 percent for the period 2018 to 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the existing ASAs are considered outdated and restrictive with specific limitations. This is the case with our existing ASAs in the Pacific Island region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is committed to support Fiji’s growth as a heart in the South Pacific through the restructuring of these ASAs whilst at the same time, safeguarding our national airline and the Fijian economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, negotiations are currently ongoing with likeminded countries about reviewing ASAs, as well as expansion of existing bilateral ASAs to cover code-share services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, airlines are continually finetuning their routes to accommodate traffic growth, changes in aircraft technology and other factors. Consideration is extended to the economic viability of our national airline. Marketing arrangements through code-sharing is being aimed to extend the scope of Fiji Airways’ route networks, eliminating double marginalisation, to establish our presence in foreign markets where they would otherwise not be allowed to operate due to regulatory reasons. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government in this regard has been able to establish a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on co-operative marketing arrangements with the government of Korea in 2023. In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Government of New Caledonia and Fiji have entered into a new Code Sharing Agreement that has enabled code share relationship between Fiji Airways and Air Caledonie. As I speak, Sir, similar arrangements are being pursued with other countries as well. Mr. Speaker, market access privileges which is commonly referred to as ‘traffic lights’ under the ASA have historically been subject to a number of protectionist conditions, including inter alia or ‘caps’ on the number of flights flown over a given period of time, pre-determined limits on the number of passengers or cargo carried and the rates of return regulations. Mr. Speaker, the commercial aviation industry is cyclical, such that revenues are generally high in the period of economic prosperity and expansion and are lower in the period of economic downturn and contraction. There is a need to rationalise capacity and explore new markets in order to grow and generate revenue. Mr. Speaker, greater commercial freedom allows airlines to improve productivity and efficiency. The Fiji Government is supportive of liberalisation of air services that will create the freedom for airlines to operate on a fully commercial basis, allowing them to allocate capital more</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>604 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 efficiently, to respond better to changes in demand and markets and to improve productivity. Mr. Speaker, an Open Skies approach is now being implemented, allowing for the negotiation of Open Skies ASA on a case by case basis. In advocating the review and potential modernisation of our existing ASAs, Government, at this time, is negotiating an Open Skies ASA with United States of America to boost passenger numbers and revenue for our national airline. Mr. Speaker, this initiative aims to attract 40,000 additional passengers in the first year, leading to projected annual increases for up to 75,000. This growth is expected to generate $150 million to $170 million per year in revenue, along with an extra $20 million to $30 million from cargo and ancillary services, benefiting Fiji’s foreign current reserves. Mr. Speaker, entering into an Open Skies ASA with the United States, will also allow code sharing between airlines of both countries. Fiji Airways is a member of One World Alliance, which also includes American Airlines. Therefore, Fiji Airways plans to include the Dallas-Fort Worth Taxes as a new service destination. It is home to the second largest airline hub globally and serves as the base for American Airlines. Mr. Speaker, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow citizens, the role of ASAs in Civil Aviation in Fiji cannot be over emphasised. These Agreements are instrumental in the efficient regulation of international air transport, promoting growth in the aviation industry and ensuring connectivity between Fiji and other nations. Mr. Speaker, please, allow me, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister and the People’s Coalition Government, to convey our best wishes to both our men’s and women’s Fijian Drua Team the very best in their respective matches this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to acknowledge the support of the Australian Government, its people and sports organisations and sports development in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, just before I take my seat, I would also like to wish all the schools that will be participating in the Fiji’s Secondary Schools Rugby League semi-finals this Saturday. I would like to send good wishes to the Under 15 and 17 of Queen Victoria School Knights and the Under 19 Ra High School Roosters, that defeated the defending champion last Saturday to claim a spot in the semi- final this week. Mr. Speaker, lastly, may I also wish all our athletes who are also preparing for the upcoming Coca-Cola Games, the very best in their preparation. I wish the athletes from QVS and ACS also the very best in the upcoming games. Kui tale mada o Waimanu! Vinaka. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation for his response. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to commend the honourable Assistant Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation on her comprehensive statement regarding Air Services Agreement (ASA). As we navigate the skies of progress, allow me to augment this discourse with figures and percentages that underscore the significance of this Agreement. Air transport is not just about planes and runaways, it is about livelihoods. Our aviation industry contributes significantly to Fiji’s economy.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 605 To quantify these impacts, the passenger numbers, Mr. Speaker, Fiji Airways since consecutive years of passenger growth has grown from 5 percent to 20 percent, which reflects a robust demand for Fiji and for our national airline. We may know that our national airlines is now a billion-dollar company, so it is growing quite significantly. The Open Skies Agreement with USA aims to attract 40,000 passengers in the past year, leading to projected annual increases up to 75. There is this belief that we have tried to correct from the other side, that they are the only ones who care about Fiji Airways. (Honourable Members interject) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Everyone in this country have been supportive of Air Pacific and its growth over the years. We were weak, we intervened at a critical juncture in the life of Fiji Airways. Just cool down and please realise that it is our national airline, that we all love our national airline and we want it to perform to the best and under this Coalition Government, the years ahead are going to be very promising. As indicated by my Assistant Minister, the American service will generate $150 million to $170 million from passengers and then cargo and as indicated, we are in the process of negotiating with the Americans. The agreement as it stands today allows Fiji to fly to Honolulu, Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco whereas the Americans have unlimited, there is no restrictions for them in this part of the world, even on a freedom basis, you can fly to Australia and New Zealand. The ASA that we are negotiating with them will allow us to fly with any points in America. Cabinet recently revamped our ASA policies to enable us to go on open skies on a case by case basis with countries and the Americans, welcomed that, hence the confidence that we can fly into other points other than Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Francisco. On the current routes now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have Australia, New Zealand, USA (as stated), Singapore, Hong Kong, Narita and various Pacific Islands. In the eyes of the global community, when they look at the Pacific Islands, Fiji is pivotal, and Fiji Airways plays a very big part in that. We are also in the process of talking to the Chinese, they are also interested in coming to Fiji and we are also looking at ways we can facilitate that. On code sharing and global reach with Fiji Airways and Air Calédonie, a new code sharing agreement enables seamless travel between our nations, fostering connectivity and tourism. We are looking at improving connectivity within the South Pacific - New Caledonia, Fiji, Apia, Cook Islands up to Papeete, and we want to bring in that connectivity that connects the island countries. A lot of dialogue is going into this and driven also by our neighbours. They want the connectivity, knowing the strength of Fiji Airways. On Dallas Fort Worth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the home to American Airlines. They have 1,000 flights a day into Dallas. With American Airlines, they have a frequent flyer programme numbering 154 million members. Immediately we fly to Dallas with American Airlines, 154 million people will know about Fiji. It will become part of the network, you cannot pay for that in dollars with that kind of numbers, committed frequent flyers while the people in the loyalty programmes for American Airlines and by extension, Fiji Airways. We have had historical constraints, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we are addressing that through bilateral on a case by case basis, opening up the skies. We must explore new markets, adapt to the economic cycles and optimise routes to maximise revenue.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>606 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 I am asked questions about Korea. We have an agreement now with the Korean Government where we can talk to Korean Operators and co-share also. People keep asking me about Korean Air, there are other operators in Korea, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years we will continue to have this dialogue and get a better link to Korea. The passenger surge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Nadi now, we know that from the airline perspective it is exceeding two million passengers now, where they counts inwards and outwards. Nadi itself is getting busier by the day, indeed they are plans to expand the facilities in Nadi to enable us to cater to more flights. Currently, if five or seven big jets leave at the same time in Nadi, you can feel the strength on what we currently have. So that is all part of the aviation going forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of ASAs, let us recognise that these agreements are not merely guarantees, they are the conduits of progress. We have to embrace liberalisation, rationalising capacity and fostering global partnerships to elevate Fiji’s aviation aspirations. Our skies show old promise, our national airline soars as a beacon of connectivity and something that we a proud of and will continue to support going forward.

VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this use of drugs used and abuse amongst our children continue to be a challenge in our country today and that problem is multifaceted in nature and to address it will require the involvement of our children, parents, communities, government, civil society, religious organisations and partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2023 Denarau Declaration, the health and safety theme targets the measures to be taken to ensure the protection of our students from harm caused by drugs and other illicit substance. This includes proper legislation, education and psychosocial support services. The Substances Abuse Advisory Council regulates combats and school drugs surveys on an annual basis. In 2022, there were 2,700 cases which represents 1.35 percent of the registered student. In 2023, there were 3,500 cases which represented 1.75 percent of the students. The percentage of student reported to be using drugs is less than 2 percent even though the percentage is small, a gradual increase in three years is a concern and will need the full attention of all stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot address the issue of drugs used and abused unless we answer the “why question”. Why do the user use drugs? Secondly, there is a need to understand the relationship between the user and the drug of their choice. In my address this afternoon, Sir, I will provide some insights into the drug’s use and the drug abuse that was sourced in our nation and our young people and the children have become victims and in some cases peddlers and mules. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years the Substances Abuse and Advisory Council has gathered evidence and with the referral reports from school, we have begun to now clearly identify and understand the drug problem in our society today. Some use drugs due to peer pressure. Sadly, some observe drugs being used in their families, communities and out of curiosity decided to experiment. Another sad reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the fact that students use drugs as a coping technique to mask the emotional pains they endure in their lives, such as abuse, neglect and exploitation. The other level is students being exploited by adults to peddle drugs for petty cash. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of drugs by students contribute to many of the social ills, school dropout, mental health issues, economical disempowerment, rise in our petty crimes, increase in unplanned and unwanted pregnancies, and general decays in the morale and social fabric of our society today. To address the issue effectively, we must address it as a national security crisis, a</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 607 public health crisis, a social crisis, an economic crisis, a community crisis and individual crisis that transcends religious, cultures, geographical, age, status and educational identity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this regard, our Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs, in the development of our National Narcotic Strategy. The strategy outlines the role of each Ministry and stakeholders will play in questioning the problem of drugs in our society. The Ministry has also been working with sects to draft the Volatile Substance Abuse Act 2024. The Drugs Regulation is currently in the workflow circulation, and we investigate, and once adopted will provide more power to our teams and stakeholders to uphold the retails and the peddlers of getaway drugs and inhalants responsibility by our current society today. The possibility of penalties and the threat our prosecution will act as an additional deterrent to those peddling and using inhalants to get high in society that we are in, and at present we can actually see the impact in our country today. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the demand and the high reduction components. The demand components involve legislation, curriculum, training and awareness programme, targeting our students today, the youths and the community members on changing their mindsets and attitude. The harm reduction on the other hand involves the provision of psychological support through counselling, mentoring service to students and likewise our parents who are here in our beloved nation. The Ministry of Education gets in place the legislations and policies to guide teachers in schools, and procedures they will follow to help and discipline students who are involved in any drug related issue. These policies are reviewed every three years to be relevant to the new changes experienced. However, the topic on the drugs and other illicit substance are included in our school curriculum in the subject of Healthy Living at Primary School and through Family Life Educational at Secondary School. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training programme is conducted every year to teachers and student leaders on how to address problems of drug use by various students in our schools. Some schools have increased their level of monitoring and supervision by installing close circuit television cameras within the school premises and working closely with parents and community leaders during community outreach programmes seeking their support in their children’s education. The Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC) has conducted training to prefects and teachers in schools on the dangers of drugs and other substances. The content includes the policies, signs of drug use, effect of prolonged drug use, health coping skills, good mental health, leadership and life skills. Those that attend the training would conduct training and awareness in their respective schools. Sir, SAAC has a total of 1,053 students, prefects and 384 teachers from 2023 to 2024. The SAAC conducts training to teachers, faith-based community, leaders on the topics of drugs abuse and strategies on how to assist the students in their respective communities. They conducted schools and community-based training, empower individual to contextualise the solution to fit the local government, resource structure that is family, the vanua and the faith- based system. In addition to the awareness carried out in schools, communities during this Annual International Day Against Drugs Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking on 26th of June every year. The school take parts in the drugs prevention and awareness programme performing various activities including oratory, artwork, debate and essay writing based on the theme. The school also invites special guest speakers to address the students on the danger of drugs. The Ministry also conducted community awareness during school organised community</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>608 End of Week Statements 19 th April, 2024 awareness programme, parents are targeted and reminded of their roles and responsibilities. Sir, SAAC has also participated in faith-based rallies where our groups conduct awareness during evangelism and during church service on Sunday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry through SAAC has also developed and printed into fabric materials all platforms including school media have been used to campaign on the importance of substance abuse drugs as a chronic health education and social implication and notedly on the child but the family. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are thankfully in partnership with the government of Australia under the Vuvale Partnership. The Education Ministry might have to setup four counselling hubs as students support hubs in the government schools in the four educational divisions, the provision of counsellors in schools is needed as drugs and addiction is treated as mental health problem. To conclude with Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite the members of this august Parliament to be proactive and join the Education Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us be heroes and not zeros, say no to drugs, do not even try it and help to save our children here in our beloved nation, Fiji. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to reiterate that my Ministry is committed to the fight against this drug scourge. We are dedicated and committed to holistic education of each student, and this includes their health and well-being. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our other strategic partners are the Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC), NGOs such as Drug Free Fiji, Empower Pacific, Medical Services Pacific and International Non- Government Organisation (INGO). In our most recent dialogue with Drug Free Association and PCC, we are pleased to confirm that a taskforce will be setup to develop a framework that will target youths in an age-appropriate manner. We know that one size does not fit all but the need for targeted interventions for specific population and age including targeting specific groups in the community will be key to systematically addressing this issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also begun dialogue with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, the Bose Levu Vakaturaga and the Ministry of Rural Development to partner with us to eradicate this scourge from within our homes and villages. This approach is in response to our recognition that the drugs have infiltrated our villages and rural settings. Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I invited the Council of Churches for dialogue on this and in the dialogue His Grace the Archbishop together with the Council of Churches will be working closely with the Ministry of Education to find ways to eradicate drug usage from within our youth population in Fiji. We are quite encouraged with the way His Grace set up presented the structure within the Catholic Church on how they segmentize youth and how to approach those issues. I would be asking other churches to visit us and do likewise because what I shared with them yesterday, Mr. Speaker, is that we now know that it is coming into the villages, but our people appear to think that it is someone else’s problem, and it will just go away. It is like burying our heads in the sand, Mr. Speaker. So, that is why I am asking the church to play a big role in this and let people know at the vanua level that they cannot divorce themselves from the initiatives or from whatever we need to do to eradicate drug usage in our villages. I am sure we all know that they know in communities who is dealing in drugs, who is using drugs, but they seem to be waiting for someone else to do something about it. I am encouraging the churches through the pulpit fire and brimstone, get the message across that we cannot just sit back and let this thing happen. You have to take ownership of it.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>609 His Grace was talking about some of the retreats that the youth in the Catholic Church normally go to. He said that at the end of the weekend all the youth come back really motivated, fully committed to whatever the retreat was trying to impart to them, but he said that as soon as they come home, it is a different story. So, it is going to be the youth and the parents also hence my request to the church to really take this on from the pulpit and get people to realise that it will not go away. We have to take ownership of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That said, the Ministry of Education has in place legislation and policies to guide teachers in schools on the procedures they will follow to help and discipline students who are involved in any drug related issue. These policies are reviewed every three years to be relevant to the new changes experienced. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again invite the Members of Parliament to be proactive and join us fight the drug problem very slowly plaguing our beloved Fiji. I reaffirm the statement by the honourable Assistant Minister for Education, “let us be heroes and not zeros. Say no to drugs and help to save our children and our Fiji.” MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the End of the Week Statements. I like that suggestion that the Churches be involved. Perhaps, if you could take it further, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation, the financing of these Churches to take care of those surveillance because from our National Budget, the Churches need to be helped as well. They have the network there, but it is just the funding of this, extra hands to be brought in on board for them to fully undertake what is required of them. I have had some very bad experience in my village, the young gentleman murdered his wife. He had three children, two are attending QVS and there is another one who is still in the village, but they are left without a mum now, and their mum happens to come from my clan, so it is a nasty experience. I think we need to all pitch in and help the Government, Churches and our communities to try and tackle this scourge. It is quite a challenge, but it is out there for us. It is amazing, even in my village, there is this drug - ice. It is freely exchanged there but my village is some distance away from Suva. Anyway, we shall move on and hopefully we can get some mind sets there to thrash this out once more. MR. SPEAKER.- I have been advised that there are no Bills for consideration today. Honourable Premila is always very, very watchful of this particular item. If there is no Bill, then slowly she reacts. I think you just bear with us and hold on for a while. Five are coming as advised by Attorney-General.</p></body>
