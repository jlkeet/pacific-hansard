<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Redemption of Student Bus Cards (Question No. 39/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the status of the redemption of student bus cards? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Parliament has changed all for the better. In the past, if a questioner was not here, the question was not asked. So, thank you, Sir, for the new rules in Parliament that allows Parliament to operate as it should be in a democracy. The Ministry of Education has data that 63,454 out of the 77,539 students have successfully redeemed their subsidised cards for Term 1 2024, inclusive of 2023 eligible students. The public was informed accordingly regarding the redeeming of subsidised cards for Term 1 2024, via a Press Release on 15 th January, 2024. The data given above is from the eligible families whose combined household income is below $16,000 per annum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a process that is involved in all these, and as highlighted, about 18 percent of the students have not redeemed their cards. There is a process in place which says, and I quote: “Parents and guardians must ensure that the transport assistance application form are submitted at school. Head of School assesses the application and update verified application into Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS). The Head of School will verify the status of the application in FEMIS. Headquarters staff extract the transport assistance data of students that have applied and send it to Vodafone Fiji to provide the student recent card number and balance. Headquarters staff calculate the fare from the families’ data and end balance from Vodafone Fiji to upload the funds to the subsidised cards to cater for them for the school term. Students redeem their subsidised cards at the redeeming centres.”</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>573 Some of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why there is non-redeeming of cards by 18 percent is that the non-verification of student application in FEMIS is factoring this. An area of concern is the change of card due to loss or damage. However, the new card number information is not submitted to headquarters who, in turn, are unable to submit it to Vodafone for loading of funds. This is a critical area. Sir. The new card will not work if the process is not observed about the lost and damaged card. We also had 2023 subsidised card holders who have not applied for the assistance of this academic year 2024. They may have balances from 2023 and used it all at the beginning of the year, but because they have not applied for the new academic year, the card is not topped up. Then the card has zero balance, students can no longer use it. Then they or their parents realise and then they try to get new cards and re-apply. The verification and lodging of the new application will depend on our schedules of payments with Vodafone. Also, multiple tapping of subsidised cards for other students and utilising the funds intended for a term are more rapid. We, in the Ministry, are taking mitigation plans. Our continuous reminders are being sent out to Education District Offices and schools for eligible students to apply for the assistance. Replacement cards are being updated in the FEMIS, District Offices are being informed accordingly, and new card numbers are loaded with funds. Head of Schools to verify the 3,024 applications not verified, in FEMIS. We are also looking at the introduction of Vodafone Point of Sale terminal for the redemption of subsidised and non-subsidised cards in other outlets, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the action plans, new students’ application cards are registered and sent to schools. Change of cards are submitted from the District Offices and funds are loaded accordingly. Head of Schools remind parents and guardians to apply for the assistance. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is for those whose family income is under $16,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also looking at Point of Sales in schools, as opposed to what we currently have, to help rectify this. Let me just say that the system has been in place since 2018. We started off with 56,728 students, and at the end of 2023 and into 2024, there are now 71,203 students who are now using the e-ticketing system. So, it has been there, it is growing by the day, but there are processes that need to be observed which is affecting the full implementation of the scheme. But be assured that we are working towards ensuring that everyone has access to this. It is mostly operational, and assistance is forthcoming from the Ministry to ensure that everyone benefits. HON. H. CHAND.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Transport Assistance Scheme for students was introduced by the previous Government to ensure that no child is left behind and students do not drop out of schools. Recently, many parents and students have expressed concerns over their failure to redeem student bus cards eight weeks into the term. Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the reasons behind that disarray, how the Ministry will compensate the parents, and the strategies to ensure that is not repeated in future? According to the honourable Minister, thousands of students were affected. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of the Parliament and the people of this country, there is no disarray. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a process. As I have said, 82 percent of the students are benefiting already. The Heads of School, parents and students who are not benefitting from this, is due to the process not being observed, and we are taking steps to mitigate this. There will be POS now in schools and there is back up every day. There will be reminders</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>574</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 everyday. This is a system that has been here since 2018 and these are recurring problems. When I listen to my people and the way they present this to me, they are very experienced people. They know what is happening and it is amazing how they are controlling this, but like I always say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it takes two to tango. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- The Ministry of Education is doing its work, the parents and the students do their job and everyone will be cosy in this country in terms of this, Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- That sounds good; it takes two? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem with that side of Parliament is, they can make the announcements during budget, “We are helping the parents, we are helping the State, we are helping everyone”, but the implementation is so poor… (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- …and that is an example of poor implementation. It is called “implementation deficit”. The question to the honourable Minister is, when are you going to use all these money? Why are you keeping that money for the last eight weeks, while parents are forking out money from their pockets? Is that fair to the parents? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, if we can all cooperate to educate the parents and the students on how to do it, instead of going around spreading lies, we can all be happy about this. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- There is funding there! There is money there. We also play a role here. There is money there… HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Where is the money? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- … and it is public funds. There is a process in place, and as I have said, 82 percent are already benefitting, the 18 percent need our help to try and get them to do the right thing and the Opposition can help instead of telling other stories. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka, in my area in the border between Ra and Wainibuka, down to Northland, the Licensed Carrier (LC) operators have not been fully paid for 12 weeks now. Does your Ministry have the funds, and if so, when will full payment be made to them?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Poor performance:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 615 Road Service Licence (RSL) providers in the country, about more than 600, and there is a process in place. Let me read this out, and I quote:</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>575 “The following payment process is followed by transport providers. The RSL summarizes, and the vouchers are submitted by the transport provider to the District Officer. The District Transport Assistant Officer counts the vouchers and verifies the RSL voucher summary is correctly filled as per the checklist. Once the verification is complete and the checklist filled, the relevant documents are submitted to Headquarters. Headquarters verifies the summary before HMS input and further processing, and within three to five days we make payments.” You submit the correct summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Within three to five days, it is paid. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- The question is, why are there delays? As I have said, there are 615 RSL providers in the nine Education Districts. Non-compliance by RSL providers often lead to delay in payment - RSL voucher summary being incorrectly filled, checklist accompanying the summary being incorrectly filled, the requirements of the checklist not being met, so for any errors or incompleteness discovered at Headquarters for any of the summaries received, the summaries are reverted to the District Office. So, that is where the delay is. You do it right at that point, you get your money within three days or five days. That is it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are doing what we can to educate them. So, again, I say – it takes two to play this – them the RSL people, the Ministry of Education, and if the summary is right, within three or five days, you get paid. Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute (Question No. 40/2024) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the establishment of the Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute (FPSLI)? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also join you in welcoming the students who are here with us this morning. I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to be a little late and have my question deferred to the next Sitting, but I tried to be back in time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was at the funeral service for the late Apisalome Tudreu, a long serving civil servant of Fiji and a product of the training systems and processes that were in place during his time as a civil servant. To answer the honourable Assistant Minister’s question, Cabinet approved the establishment of the Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute (FPSLI) earlier this year on 19th March, 2024. By that time, we were well into the process of serving out the budget of the year, and the establishment of the FPSLI which will ensure the Fiji public sector as a skilled and experienced workforce needed to build a strong future for our nation. The Institute, delivering high quality work and relevant learning programmes using timely and cost-efficient approach, will support the realisation of Government priorities and improve service delivery to the community and businesses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training will cover the following: service examination; customer service; ethics and code of conduct; quality circles; project management and monitoring; various policies and</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>576</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 initiatives introduced in the Civil Service, finance and non-finance officers, government legislations, governance and leadership, public administration and management; human resources management; and local government administration and management, et cetera. The Institute will also provide high quality specialised courses for Fiji’s Foreign Service officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be a centre of excellence for sharing best practices in modern diplomacy. Through the Vuvale Partnership with the Australian Government, support is being confirmed through various training providers including the Australian Diplomatic Academy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Institute will also help in creating a learning organisation, separate from the Civil Service, that will eventually build a reputation for quality learning and be accepted as a provider of choice by the Civil Service and the business community. And I refer to the late Apisalome Tudreu, who grew up in the Civil Service using the various stages of training provided by Public Service Commission of his time. In the future, it is intended that fee-for-service programmes will also be provided or offered to other organisations outside of the public sector, also in the Pacific, especially the Small Island States. The budget will be implemented as part of the 2024-2025 Budget and the Cabinet approval was received towel into this Budget year. Work programmes will also be initiated. It is envisaged that an amount of $1.3 million would be sought for operational and capital expenditure. The timeframe for the Institute to be implemented will be in three stages, including the: • • • design phase; preparation of the physical classroom and centre; and various MOUs with partner institutes in the region. Stage one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the Institute involves enlisting the expertise of qualified consulting services to provide guidance and support to the Ministry of Civil Service in establishing and developing the FPSLI. The consulting team will work closely with Government stakeholders to design the Institute’s structure, develop its curriculum, and establish key partnerships to ensure its success. A Terms of Reference for a consultancy service to investigate the establishment of FPSLI will be advertised this week. The following deliverables for the consulting firm are: • • • • • • Research and scope of the establishment of FPSLI. Development of FPSLI’s strategic plan, including vision, mission, goal and structure. Design and develop comprehensive curriculum framework and course materials aligned with FPSLI’s objectives. Facilitation of accreditation and registration processes with relevant authorities. Implementation and management of IT services, including website development, Learning Management Systems (LMS) setup and review and revamp of the current Moodle Platform and Training Packages. Delivery of training programmes to upskill current MCS, including how to write training packages for online platforms. Stage 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, involves improving the physical training and learning facilities to support face to face learning and provide allocation for the Institute to operate as a recognised institute.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>577 The refurbishment of the Government Training Centre in Nasese will include scoping in 2024, source funding 2024-2025 and completion in 2025-2026. The budget of $1 million is requested under Head 50 for OAHU. The MOUs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance and the Vanuatu Institute of Public Administration and Management have been developed and submitted for endorsement. The MOUs seek to explore opportunities for jointly extending learning services provided by these similar institutes in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, and provide roles in Fiji, including participation in experience sharing and institutional building activities. With regards to the nature and legal status of the FPSLI, there will be consultations with the Office of the Solicitor-General to determine this. Before I resume my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have allowed the Civil Servants today to take half a day off and support our rugby teams either at the ground or on television. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I also wish to pay contribute to the late Mr. Apisalome Tudreu. We, the old students of Ratu Kadavulevu School, presented our reguregu there yesterday. He was at RKS from the late 1970s to mostly 1980s. Of course, Vice-President of the Methodist Church of Fiji. He was a civil servant, he contributed a lot and we do remember him and our condolences to Eka and the family. My simple question to the honourable Prime Minister Sir, is about Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute (FPSLI) as being a recognised institute. This is going to deal mainly with adult training and one of the key aspects of adult training is what we call Recognition of Current Competencies (RCC) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). My simple question to the honourable Minister is, how is FPSLI preparing or prepared for this? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition knows there are entry requirements which are perused by the selection panels and there are also competency assessments carried out by the various departments. Those all account towards a clear progression of a civil servant and also towards a non-recommendation of a civil servant to continue their training in the Institute. As we enjoy this afternoon’s match, I hope we will be mindful of those who continue to serve in the police services, fire services and military services of our country - those who will not be able to come and watch the game with us. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just along the same lines of the question that was asked by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, one of the things that we find in a lot of Ministries is that there are people that have the competency to be able to do things. They have proven it in the way that they can write, and they can do things but because they do not have the same academic qualifications than others and not recognised as such. So, my question is – is there a possibility of ticking off the competencies that they already have, so that when they fit into a programme, they do not have to go and re-do what they are already able to do.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Cross credit:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Cross crediting, that is what we mean by Recognition of Current Competencies (RCC), so instead of having to do the whole programme, you will just have to do the portion to plug the gaps.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>578</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for some time now, I have been asking the office to try and reduce the size of the submission, paperwork required that they send up for my final approval for the final ‘yes’ or ‘no’, to the filling of some civil service positions. Sir, there is a lot of that being done right now but it is all on paper and I have asked the Service to reduce the paperwork. As you have heard, we are trying to have a lot of interaction with the computer, have a portal ready and available, as well as the starting point of the Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS). HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for coming up with such initiative. I am just trying to get some clarity, Mr. Speaker. The Government has actually funded Pacific Polytech with a couple of million dollars. Now, we are actually forming a new institute. For clarification, why can we not use Pacific Polytech to provide the same training because the honourable Prime Minister is asking for another million dollars to establish this institute? Having funded a particular institute, why can that institute not be used to provide this training? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member, but there was a distinct difference between what is provided for under Pacific Polytech and also in-service training and progression as will be covered by the Institute. Status of the Seaweed Programme (Question No. 41/2024) HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: With the seaweed farming having huge potential in coastal communities and maritime islands, can the honourable Minster for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament on the current status of the Seaweed Programme? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before responding to the Oral Question this morning, please, allow me to clarify the issue highlighted in the Fiji Sun today, indicating the non-clarity of my statement yesterday. The Fiji Sun indicated that I spoke about the assessment of net emissions under the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF). HON. K. V. RAVU.- Yet, the statement by the honourable Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was actually providing some clear information on the REDD+ and FCPF arrangements, with the Government detailing the work that has been carried out so far and where that works is currently placed at, as of this week. A written statement clarifying how the statements for the net emission under the FCPF</p><h4>Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be presented for the information of this august Parliament.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, allow me to respond to the question and I thank the honourable Member for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farming of seaweed was initiated under the Commodity Development</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>579 Framework Project in the 1980s. It is a low-tech process, well suited to the lifestyle of rural coastal communities. Echeuma seaweed has already been technically feasible in Fiji. Seaweed farming has proven to be a stable income source with proven health benefits and alternative food source. Its universal appeal is evident as it flourishes across the Northern, Central, Western and Eastern Divisions, establishing clusters in various locations, like Lakeba, Nakalou, Dama, Sasa and Dakuniba in the Northern Division. It is providing economic security to coastal communities, women and youth groups alike. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the commodity is well developed and ready for large scale commercialisation, until now the industry has not reached the level it was anticipated to reach. Seaweed farming has slowed momentum over the last three years with productions volumes dropping from an annual volume of 200 tonnes down to 85 tonnes. Market prices has always been a major challenge in seaweed farming. It must be sufficient to maintain grower interest, compared with returns to competing rural income sources, like fishing, copra, dalo, yaqona, to name a few. The Coalition Government is here to change that. The unwavering commitment by the Coalition Government towards the Seaweed Programme is evident through the increased allocation of $330,000 for the 2023–2024 fiscal year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a major turnaround made by the Ministry which aims to bring us back to where the seaweed industry needs to be. This will allow investors to partner with Government through the funding setup of seaweed farms and market accessibility. The Ministry will, in turn, provide suitable extension and advisory services for the 10 viable communities to considerably supply to this market. This partnership will also improve the seaweed farming pricing and payment structure. Communities will be able to make an arrangement with the investors on agreed buying price and this establishes quality standards and seaweed operating procedures for market needs. The Ministry has been instrumental in augmenting value addition and expanding market reach. Through strategic partnerships with other Ministries, we aim to unlock new avenues for growth and sustainability, paving the way for a brighter future. Looking ahead, our vision is ambitious, yet attainable. We aspire to produce 500 metric tonnes of seaweed annually within the next three years, engaging communities beginning with the Northern Division, expanding to other Divisions. By 2029, our goal is to involve 60 percent of coastal communities in seaweed farming, fostering inclusive economic development with an approximate return to community project owners of $1.2 million annually. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government believes partnership with investors and the establishment of seaweed farmers’ cooperative will help to ensure the sustainability of the project. One of the major aspects the Ministry believes it could enhance further, is to develop a strategic approach in handling over the commodity setup to investors and support community development programmes. In April last year, Cabinet approved the Ministry’s proposal for the adjustment to the current farming arrangement of seaweed to cater for the growing market demand. This underscores our</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>580</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 dedication to the growth and success of this initiative. Our proposed strategy for mass production and integration underscores our dedication to improving efficiency and ensuring economic prosperity for all stakeholders involved. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, for the first time ever, has signed a Public Private Partnership with a private entity, Soluk Island Fresh Company Limited. This strategic partnership aims to establish a community-based seaweed farming collaboration for sustainable ocean management. Through this partnership, we will work together to promote eco-friendly and modern seaweed cultivation practices, creating new economic opportunities while preserving marine ecosystems. By leveraging the collective expertise and resources, food security will be enhanced, climate change mitigated, and socio-economic development fostered in targeted seaweed farming communities. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. That was quite a mouthful too. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can understand that the global seaweed market has a forecasted value of $14.6 billion by 2031, and the 2023-2024 National Budget has allocated $330,000. So, with this new allocation and knowing that the climate is one of the major issues, with the seaweeds being planted in shallow areas, with this $330,000 allocation, what innovative approach has the Ministry taken to mitigate these challenges for the farmers? Mr. Speaker, Sir, part two of that is, if there is an issue of accessing to finance, you have mentioned about partnerships, what are the multilateral and multisectoral participatory collaborations your Ministry is endorsing to boost these assistance and initiatives.? MR. SPEAKER.- Would you like to answer that question because you have covered the first answer quite well?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, my question is quite simple. After giving us all the figures with respect to what is happening within the seaweed programme, what have you done to educate or otherwise, the community that does this seaweed farming with respect to value adding? MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply, honourable Minister, remember the initial question was raised by honourable Niudamu. Are you doing seaweed farming up there in the hills? You can reply to that question. (Laughter) HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. We are now starting with a new 360 degrees turnaround. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Listen! MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the new variety? HON. K. V. RAVU.- It is not the new variety, Sir, it is the damage they do to the seaweed</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>581 industry. As I have mentioned in my statement, it has dropped from 200 tonnes to 85 tonnes, which means they are not producing for the last few years. So, we are trying to build up this industry before doing training into value adding. First, we need to start farming before we go into other things. HON. V. LAL.- My supplementary question is similar to what honourable Rinesh Sharma asked. The honourable Minister has just informed that there is increased budgetary allocation to the seaweed programme and despite that, there is a huge reduction in the production. So, why so? My question is when there is increased budgetary allocation, the production should increase. Is it due to the other factors? What are the other factors? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of research done during this period. We need to shift into various places that are suitable for seaweed farming. They have not been doing that in the previous years. So, we need to go further, we need to do research on that. Thank you. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, seaweed farming is we farm and we sell it a raw product. There is an option. If we set up a factory or facility just to extract the carrageenan which is extracted from seaweed and is used in packed tinned product. Canned meat, you have carrageenan in there. If we go that way, set up that facility, maybe that will entice more people to go into farming and then we can export the carrageenan which will bring in higher value. Has there been in discussions along those lines? HON. K. V. RAVU.- As I have mentioned earlier, once we have the stock the investors will come and they will establish that for that purpose. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members. The reply from the honourable Minister is very clear. They are setting up the stock and then the investors will come running. So, we will take it at that and leave it at that as well. (Laughter) Budget Implementation – Disaster Operations (Question No. 42/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on how it has progressed with budget implementation, concurrently with managing disaster operations during the course of the current financial year? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I am pleased to provide a response on how the Ministry has progressed with its budget implementation and I thank the honourable Member for the question. Whilst it continues to manage disaster operations during the course of this financial year. The Ministry strives to do its best in achieving its core responsibilities, that is, both the coordination and facilitation of rural development and managing disaster operations in its season. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the average results of 93 percent budget utilisation during the last three years when the nation faced multiple hazards, namely Category 4 TC Harold, Category 5 TC Yasa, Category 2 TC Ana and in the midst of COVID-19, is a testament of the Ministry’s commitment to</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>582</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 diligently serve its people. I have continuously informed and updated Parliament on the vulnerabilities that our nation is exposed to that has made extreme weather events a constant threat to our development gains. This historical perspective not only sheds light on the challenges faced by the country but also underscores the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of its people. Environmental hazards including cyclones, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis have, over the years, brought about devastating consequences, prompting the Government to prioritise disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Adoption of Global and Regional Agendas and Mechanisms, Fiji has tailor-made the Disaster Risk Reduction Initiatives so that our development is risk informed and sustainable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I stand here today, the various communities of practice on Disaster Risk Reduction continues to churn our literature, programmes, initiatives and policies, all racing against time to ensure that the Globe, including Fiji, achieves the Sustainable Development Goals within agreed timeframes. While implementing them in-country to some extent, as reduced disaster risk, there still remains a level of risk for financial investments towards our public sector development programmes. As Minister responsible for Disaster Management, I have been entrusted the task of mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into all aspects of development for our community, as well as Government as a whole, and within this enormous task lies the responsibility of ensuring sufficient financial investments to manage the existing risks through mitigation preparedness, response and recovery efforts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to shed some light to Parliament of the Ministry’s overall budget utilisation rate in the recent past three financial years, as follows: • • • in 2020-2021, 87 percent utilisation rate on the budget allocation of $16.6 million; in 2021-2022, 96 percent budget utilisation rate from the budget allocation of $14.5 million; and year 2022-2023, 97 percent utilisation rate on the budget allocation of $15 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these achievements were realised in the same period where Fiji experienced TC Tino, TC Herald and TC Yasa in 2020 to 2021 and 2022 to 2023 with TC Harold, TC Ana, TC Cody and TC Mal. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite those achievements, I would like to state that the Ministry has had its fair share of staff retention challenges in the recent years, sometimes Government takes for granted. This is mostly in the forms of previous Government’s lack of appreciation and compensation of the staffing ability to work long hours with little to know benefits provided any disaster management operation, despite the assistance of our key line Ministries. As most civil servants usually take rest during any disaster, our Ministry staff are usually engaged full time for this purpose, to ensure timely response and recovery for the people of Fiji. As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our staff resignations have increased from 2 percent to 5 percent in these three financial years. In the year 2020-2021, it was 2.4 percent; 2021-2022, it was 5.21 percent; and 2022-2023, it was 5.46 percent. Staff resignation was mainly due to better offers from other line Ministries, including regional organisations that offered much better salaries and benefits to our staff because of the nature of work</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>583 they undertake in the Ministry. For the current financial year, the resignation rate has already reached 3.82 percent and we are confident that the removal of short-term contracts by this Government will bring some sense of security to our staff and civil servants as a whole. On a positive note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges the dedication and commitment of the remaining staff who have decided to continuously serve the people of Fiji, despite all the challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had been allocated a total budget of $29 million for the current financial year (2023-2024). Out of this, $15 million is the operating budget, of which about 51 percent has been utilised. Our personnel costs budget is about 51 percent of the total operating budget, and the Ministry has utilised 67 percent of its budgeted personnel costs. Combined expenditures for the other five Standard Expenditure Groups have reached only about 35 percent. Out of the $13 million capital budget, 85 percent or $11 million has been released to the Ministry and overall, 48 percent of this has been committed. However, I would like to note that budget utilisation for a number of capital development projects have exceeded 80 percent commitment. Those are: 1. 2. Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF) Programme where 85 percent of its $2 million budget has been released to the Ministry, of which 88 percent is now committed. Self-Help Programme where 100 percent of its $1 million budget has been released to the Ministry, of which 87 percent is now committed. 3. High Risk Water and Sanitation Programme, where 100 percent of its $0.8 million budget 4. has been released, of which 84 percent is now committed. Seafaring Entrepreneurial Assistance Scheme where 100 percent of this $0.5 million budget has been released to the Ministry, of which 82 percent is now committed. 5. Upgrading of Staff Quarters Programme where 50 percent of its $1 million budget has been released to the Ministry, of which 83 percent is now committed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as this august Parliament is fully aware, the Ministry was assigned three new Capital Development Programmes in this financial year, and they are the: 1. 2. 3. Rural Housing Assistance Programme; Rural and Outer Island Development Programme; and Seafaring Entrepreneurial Assistance (SEA) Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SEA Programme is a relatively easier one to implement as it only requires procurement of boat and engine from approved tender suppliers, hence utilisation rate is now above 80 percent. The Rural Housing Assistance (RHA) Scheme and Rural and Outer Island Programme (ROI) requires more work, including the tender process for machineries to be procurred or hired under ROI, and finalisation of plans and housing materials for RHA, let alone finetuning guidelines for implementation. I believe that will answer a lot of the questions from honourable Premila Kumar, who was asking about the number of houses we have completed uptil now. I must highlight that the Ministry was able to recruit the required personnel for these Programmes in the past three months, which has greatly assisted in progressing with the administrative works required for the programme implementation. For RHA Programme, I have already provided an update in my earlier response on Wednesday whereas for the ROI Programme, the Ministry is now successfully completing all the necessary Tender Board approval processes which should be progressing with procurement and</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>584</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 service delivery in the next two or three months. I note that the tenders, once awarded, will be valid for three years, which means for the new financial year, the Ministry should be ready to implement in the first quarter, once development projects have been identified. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November 2023, the Fiji Meteorological Services provided the 2023- 2024 Cyclone Season Outlook, forecasting two to three tropical cyclones which are likely to pass through Fiji’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) during the 2023-2024 tropical cyclone season. Even while Fiji was impacted by Category 2 TC Mal, the intense rainfall brought about by rainbands has impacted parts of our country with flash floods and riverine flooding in the month of November, mainly impacting the Wainadoi area and recent March floods heavily impacting the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of responding to TC Mal was $212,000, catering for fuel to support operations and initial damage assessments, the charter of vessels, procurement of food ration for evacuees, and communication, support and subsistence allowance for the officers manning our emergency operations centres. Whilst the investment of the Fiji Government is acknowledged, it would be remiss of me not to mention the critical support provided by our partners in the region, particularly the Governments of New Zealand and Australia, who have always provided disaster response support in both cash and kind, in particular, the humanitarian emergency relief supplies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must acknowledge the work of the Ministry staff in trying to press on with its two core roles through a 12-month period. One new programme that has been assigned to the Ministry is the co-ordination for relocation as per the Standard Operating Procedure for Planned Relocation Guidelines. I have already informed Parliament earlier this week about the progress on the relocation of the Nabavatu Village. We are working with existing resources and agencies to co- ordinate this project with other agencies of the Government. The Ministry has already made its submission to the Ministry of Finance for the establishment of a new Relocation Unit as per the Planned Relocation Guideline. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the Divisions of the Ministry worked together during cyclone and non- cyclone season to achieve its planned activities. Of course, when it comes to saving lives, development work will be secondary. I must say that it is not always an easy journey for the staff as they know that their deliverables for those two core roles still have to be achieved, and I commend them for their passion and dedication. Mr. Speaker, Sir, like many of the Ministries, we are also working on reviewing our 10-year (2021-2031) Strategic Development Plan. Obviously, we will have to align to the new Strategic Development Plan, and we are mindful of the review of the Fijian Administration which may have some impact on how the Ministry provides its service to the people of Fiji. Nevertheless, the Ministry is also working on improving its employee satisfaction and retention strategy through ongoing training and re-training opportunities that would be ready for any inevitable change that may come our way in the foreseeable future, including mitigation efforts for our staff turnover. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, SDG17 on Partnership for the Goals stands as a guiding principle in our pursuit of sustainable development and disaster management and rural development which underscores imperative cooperation and partnerships in our collective endeavour. By emphasising the significance of multi-stakeholder partnerships, capacity building and resource mobilisation, we affirm our shared obligation to address global challenges including disaster risk reduction and resilience in developments.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>585 HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the worst disasters that we had was the flooding that happened in the village of Cogea. Cogea is a place where two rivers converge, and I was actually in that village to see it flooded, homes filled with mud and completely destroyed. We were also part of the programme of trying to relocate the village, and we were there at the ground break. I just would like to know if the honourable Minister might give us some update on how far that has progressed - the relocation of Cogea Village to the new site? HON. S. D. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, the Fiji Council of Social Services (FCOSS) has taken lead role in the Cogea relocation, and we have given her our assurance and commitment to see what she can be assisted with from the Government. At the moment, I believe there is a German NGO, I think it is Brot fur die Welt, that is financing for that. Sir, FCOSS has taken lead on that, but we are also providing oversight, and if there is any assistance that they need, we will provide that when they need it. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is on the Rural and Outer Island (ROI) ProgrammeROI. Sir, ROI as you are aware, honourable Minister. was with the Ministry of Agriculture. You have just stated in your statement that there are still a lot of projects, or whatever it is, that is still undergoing the tender process. My question is, there was a purpose behind ROI when it was in the Ministry of Agriculture, what has changed that the programme has now been shifted to the Ministry of Rural Development in terms of the purposes in which it was established, and the type of projects undertaken when ROI was with the Ministry of Agriculture? So, what is the main difference now when that has been transferred to your Ministry? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, before you reply could you just explain what ROI stands for? HON. S. D. DITOKA.- It is the Rural and Outer Island Development Programme. I believe that it is aligned with what the Coalition Government has decided to focus on, which is to give all the core agricultural aspects of the Ministry of Agriculture’s work to them and the development of the rural areas which, sometimes in some areas, they overlap with each other, and it is that overlap area that we have decided to focus the development work on ROI.</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being no further supplementary questions, I</h4><p>intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.51 a.m.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>586</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.24 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- We shall move on and before we proceed, honourable Members I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of His Excellency the Australian High Commissioner, honourable Ewen McDonald. Thank you so much for being with us this morning, Sir. It is a very important occasion for us especially when we were preparing for this afternoon, the Drua. They are becoming rugby crazy as well. (Acclamation) Plans for Upskilling Individuals (Question No. 43/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Considering the skilled labour shortage due to many workers leaving Fiji, can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation inform Parliament on any plans to quickly upskill individuals to fill the vacancies in the tourism industry? MR. SPEAKER.- I would just like to recap what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation said earlier on. Strictly speaking, the tradition in Parliament is, when a question is being proposed and the mover of the question is not present, then that lapses automatically. But, again, this time around, given that we are trying to build a very close relationship that we have and also to be mindful of the time taken in preparing questions, et cetera, especially from you, honourable Members, to our Tables and Committees Unit, it is a hell of a task being taken there to have them in this final form and after going through the Business Committee as well. So, I have taken it upon myself not to be so strict but to be lenient in the understanding that we can all enjoy this whilst the time is still here. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address the question raised by honourable Koya regarding the plan to quickly upskill individuals to fill the vacancies in the tourism industry. The concern is the increasing exodus of social skilled workers from Fiji to overseas countries. Let me just, at the outset, Sir, say that the question is quite timely because the migration side of the story is well publicised while the education and training story is less known. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to acknowledge the remarkable resilience of the tourism industry. Despite the significant challenges brought by COVID-19 which led to a massive exodus of workers from the sector, many of whom transitioned to alternative careers or pursuing further education, the industry not only survived but is thriving. Visitor arrival and hotel occupancy rate is at its highest level which is a testimony of the flexibility and adaptability of the industry. We all know that 40 percent of GDP in this country is from tourism. However, the increased departure of skilled professionals has underscored the pressing need for swift action to upskill and reskill workers and fill the resulting vacancies. I wish to highlight the proactive efforts of the Ministry of Education and the Higher Education Commission of Fiji in spearheading training, upskilling and reskilling initiative for both, unemployed and employed people, to take up jobs becoming vacant upon migration of the existing workers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 4 th January, 2024, a meeting was held at the Sheraton Hotel among the tourism stakeholders, Ministers and Ministry senior staff members to find solutions for increasing skill gaps in the industry due to the increased departure of skilled workers. The Director of Sheraton</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>587 Training Academy presented its industry-based interactive training method and offered to work with the Fiji National University (FNU) and other training providers in the country. A follow-up talanoa session was organised by the Higher Education Commission Fiji on 17 th January, 2024, bringing together key stakeholders and higher education providers to discuss how they could work together and collectively address the skills gap problem. The dialogue and development of a new programme is underway. I thank the Coalition Government for providing 1,800 grants for upskilling and reskilling unemployed youth in the country. Out of 1,800, 1,000 were allocated to the programmes of the tourism industry - 500 to mechanical courses and 300 to the construction industry. This grant award gave a second chance to the unfortunate people who missed out on education themselves because they could not afford it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a player that has recently entered into the field of education is Pacific Polytech. With the grant given to them, they have graduated about 824 students with competency- based certificates in various skillsets for the tourism and hospitality industry. This is an example of the service providers that are out there. The Higher Education Commission Fiji has started to hold Career Expo last year (2023). It had one in Suva in October 2023 and in Lautoka in March 2024. It plans to hold one next month in Labasa. At the Careers Expo, Universities and Technical Institutions have their display booths and provide one stop platform to students and parents to understand the details of the qualifications they offer and respective job openings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the recent Lautoka Careers Expo, the topic, “New demand trends within Fiji’s tourism industry and skills required” was discussed. The panel discussion was broadcasted live on Fiji One. The issues raised by the panel members and the feedback from the general public is shared with the qualification providers for their consideration in developing new tourism programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was unfortunate that Vocational Centres in Secondary Schools were closed by the previous Government. We are now reopening them, and the aim of these Vocational Centres is to offer Technical, Vocational and Education Training (TVET) programmes for Certificate Level I and Level II to Year 11 and Year 12 students respectively, and articulate them into Certificate III, Diplomas and Degrees offered at the universities and technical institutions. Sir, the above initiative is per the curriculum reforms outlined in the 2023 Denarau Declaration of the National Education Summit. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Higher Education Commission Fiji is implementing Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy within the higher education institutions. This policy is a framework to evaluate the extensive experience of individuals without formal qualification, and award them with appropriate qualifications based on their industry experience. Within the tourism industry, there are skilled professional workers whose industry expertise surpass formal qualification. Yet, a first limitation in career advancement due to not having a recognised qualification certificate. The introduction of RPL addresses this gap by providing a pathway for recognising and accrediting the valuable experience and compensating them with deserving higher remuneration. The aim is to hold back good workers from leaving the industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the imperative task of addressing the skills gap has been diligently cascaded to the Provincial Council level as well. In November 2023, the Higher Education Commission Fiji held a meeting with the representatives from the 14 Provincial Councils, including Rabi and Kioa.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>588</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>19 th April, 2024 The aim is to provide education and training to the unemployed people living in the rural communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, most of the people living in the nearby villages work as service staff in the hotels and resorts. From the Provincial Council meeting, one representative from each Provincial Council has been chosen to identify unemployed youth who would be trained to work in the hotels and resorts located within their Provinces. Sir, I have the pleasure in informing this august Parliament that through this initiative, a number of villagers have been trained and assisted to obtain gainful employment in nearby hotels and resorts. The cost of the training was paid by Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Services (TSLS) from the 1,800 competencies-based skills training grant budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the relevance and efficacy of upskilling and reskilling initiatives, the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Tourism, will continue to strive in strengthening strategic partnership with the leading industry players. This partnership will facilitate the development of industry relevant curriculum, provision of practical career opportunities and access to mentorship programmes, thereby, assuring that upskilled individuals are well prepared to meet the evolving needs of the tourism industry. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that from the above discussions, initiatives and plans of the Ministry of Education and the Public Service Commission, working collaboratively with industry stakeholders and the qualification training providers is adequately addressing the emerging skill gaps of the tourism and hospitality industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the testimony to my claim, I have here a table - a total of 2,035 students graduated with qualifications in various skillsets within the tourism and hospitality industry over 2023 and into 2024. On the other hand, Sir, it is interesting to note that in the year 2022, almost 100 people were listed in the National Information Centre and are looking for work in the hotel tourism industry. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform this august Parliament that whilst there is an increase in skilled migration workers, our education and training providers are standing to the task and producing qualified and trained workers for the available jobs. I thank the honourable Member for asking the question and giving me the opportunity to update Parliament on the issue of skills gap, the education and training of workers within the tourism and hospitality industry. HON. F. S. KOYA.- I thank you for a comprehensive answer with respect to upskilling, et cetera, that needs to be done and seeing that a lot is actually happening. In the short term, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, is there a contingency plan, bearing in mind that our tourism workers are quite highly sought after, not just by Australia and New Zealand and also by the UAE and other places, and bearing in mind also that migration is happening at break neck speed and the numbers are quite large, is there a contingency plan that incorporates us for the short term, bringing in foreign workers into the industry and also for the ancillary industries to tourism, like the laundry guys, construction guys, et cetera? Have we had discussions with the Ministry of Immigration so that that can be facilitated? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- The foreign content of the workforce is based on speciality bases - special skills. We do not have a programme in place where you could bring in workers, for the want of better words, at the entry level. We are confident that we are producing sufficient numbers to meet any gaps at that level. Just two weeks ago, I officiated in a graduation ceremony of 484 of our</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>589 people, who had a six week training in tourism by Polytech, and that is the kind of training that we will do or carry out. We know what they need to do, and we have people like that - service providers -FNU and others, who can train people within six or eight weeks to replace any gaps at that level. For foreigners, as I have said, it is only at that special skills level. I do not think there is a need right now, Mr. Speaker, to go and bring in numbers as maybe contemplated by other industries in Fiji. We can do it in tourism locally. Thank you. HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Would the honourable Minister have the percentage of the graduates who have been absorbed into the workforce so far? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the exact numbers, but I can assure you that our graduates are competent. Something that I need to impress upon the employers is that they cannot be insisting on people to be work ready. That appears to be a limiting factor sometimes in the way we view our local graduates. They have to give them time to adapt into their system. I was part of a global chain, and it has its systems, its culture and everything else. It took me a couple of months to get to know their system - some of the best developers. In Fiji today, we have chains like Hilton, Sheraton, Intercontinental, and they are some of the best in the world. So, our people are world trained, they can do the job, but work ready would take three months, four months or five months to get them to be accustomed to the system. I was at the graduation ceremony for USP and FNU lately and being a hotelier myself, what I saw, I am very confident that our people there can rise to the challenge and take on senior roles or specialist roles in tourism. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister, I totally agree with you that those who are coming out of institutions are not work ready. They need to work under someone who will then pass on to them the nous of the job. But in order to that, you need to have people in place that still have that level of competence that allows them to pass on the right things, the right habits, the right attitude, et cetera. So, do you still have that class of worker in the industry that will then be able to pass on this to the new graduates coming out into the hotels? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- The answer is ‘yes’. Indeed, some of the big chains, like Mariott, are now working with FNU to help our graduates adapt to the Marriott system and this also happens with Intercontinental and other chains. So, the answer is ‘yes’, the training programmes in these big chains is quite solid and I believe our people –joining those chains will perform to the expectations, as anywhere else in the world. The beauty about this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that our graduates, with a couple of years with the lives of Intercontinental, can join any Intercontinental in the world, and that is how good our people are. Your time in a big name like that, we are marketable globally. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the next author of the question that is going to be raised, I would like to acknowledge once more the presence of a few faces in the gallery. The first one being Mr. Devo, sitting in the gallery on the left, and he will be in charge of our retreat that is going to take place next week. He is from Canada. With them on the same side is once again Mr. Rasova and he is wearing blue and Mr. Rajesh Singh, the former Assistant Minister, not forgetting those on the right, the members of our public. Thank you for taking time to be present here. HON. J. R.

NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation inform Parliament as to whether the Fire Report from the National Fire Authority on the Vatuwaqa Primary School fire in 2022 has been received?</p><h4>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be my lucky day, three questions in a row.</h4><p>Yes, I can confirm that the Ministry of Education has received the fire report of the fire at Vatuwaqa Primary School. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 347 students and nine teachers were at the school and they have been relocated to the neighbouring primary school, except for the Head of School. The Police have reported that that incident is not accidental. My Ministry has requested a thorough investigation and to prosecute the liable party or parties. There is a bit of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The school started as a Government School in 1906. The controlling authority is the Parents, Teachers Association (PTA) after Government ceased supporting the school. The number of rooms fully damaged were four classrooms, one office and one canteen; partially damaged - one library, one classroom and school hall. The fire started from the canteen area. We leave it at that for this time, Mr. Speaker, but students were relocated to surrounding schools including Draiba Fijian School, Veiuto Primary School, Yat Sen Primary School, John Welsey Primary School and Pundit Vishnu Deo Memorial Primary School and other home zone schools. Furniture was also supplied with school stationery items for students. So, every student and teacher have been placed elsewhere. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you have noticed, the fire happened long time ago. I had asked this question last year and we were told in this Parliament that they were waiting for the fire report. My question is, 16 months now, his predecessor in the last sitting committed to repairing the school. Is the Government still committed to repair the school, now that they received the fire report in this financial year? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school budget for 2024-2025 includes the budget for the rehabilitation of the school. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the students from Vatuwaqa Primary School were moved to other schools. Did the Ministry carry out any survey to understand the emotional impact on students in their studies? (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>19 th April, 2024 End of Week Statements 591 MR. SPEAKER.- Order! MR. SPEAKER.- Hold on honourable Minister, it is rather noisy.
