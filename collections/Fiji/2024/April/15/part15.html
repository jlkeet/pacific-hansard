BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Fiji National Provident Fund 2022 Annual Report, which was tabled on 20 th November, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the Fiji National Providence Fund (FNPF) is a defined contribution Fund that provides superannuation services to its members. The operation of the Fund is guided by the Fiji National Provident Fund Act 2011. The Fund collects compulsory contributions from employees and employers towards the retirement savings of all workers in Fiji. It also provides pre-retirement benefits such as housing, medical, unemployment, education assistance and funeral. In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Fund is also known to be the major investor in Fiji and is one of the country’s largest property owner. It also owns majority shares in Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Pte Ltd, Home Finance Company Pte Ltd, and fully owns the Intercontinental Fiji Golf Resort and Spa, the Natadola Bay Championship Golf Course, the Yatule Resort and Spa at Natadola Beach, Holiday Inn in Suva, Fiji Marriott Resort Momi Bay, Sheraton Fiji Resort, the Westin Resort, Denarau Golf and Racquet Club and the Grand Pacific Hotel. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the year under review, the FNPF accumulated a total of $8.7 billion worth of assets. This achievement was a result of the following: The net income of $650.8 million as compared to $543.5 million in the year 2021. 1. 2. General Reserve stands at $1.7 billion. 3. Members Fund is at $6.7 billion. 4. Total Contribution received from employers for the employees was at $395.2 million and $370.3 million was the credited amount as interest to members’ accounts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee’s findings and recommendations, the Committee had highlighted the following. It is recommended that the FNPF: 1. Continues and builds on the participation in environmental, social and governance investments by FNPF through public private partnership. 2. Work on a scheme that is accessible for voluntary members in the informal sector. This will ensure that when retiring from being farmers or market vendors, they have saved for life after retirement. The Committee had further recommended that the FNPF develop schemes and create awareness for voluntary members in the informal sector as well. 3. Had highlighted that it is still a challenge to pursue the substantial number of inactive 4. members. To continue to build on the Fund’s awareness programmes, targeting tertiary institutions and secondary schools. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024 Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 366 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. The two Whips have provided a list of speakers as follows – • • • • Hon. V. Pillay. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. Hon. K. K. Lal. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.</p><h4>You have 10 minutes each.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I stand today in support of the Fiji National Provident Fund 2022 Annual Report as reviewed by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs. This Report paints a positive picture of FNPF’s financial health and its commitment to the wellbeing of its members and Fiji as a whole. Firstly, let us acknowledge the impressive financial performance with total assets exceeding $8.7 billion, net income of $650.8 million and a strong member fund of $6.7 billion. The FNPF stands as a pillar of financial security for Fijians. This translates into tangible benefits for members. Over $467 million was paid out in benefits in 2022, including retirement payments, housing assistance and death benefits. This highlights the crucial role FNPF plays in safeguarding the future of Fijian families. The Committee’s findings reveal another commendable aspect - FNPF’s commitment to responsible investing. Their involvement in environmental, social and governance initiatives to Public Private Partnership (PPP) demonstrates a focus on sustainability and positive social impact. This aligns perfectly with the growing global focus on responsible investing and ensures that FNPF’s growth benefits both its members and the wider Fijian community. Furthermore, the development of Schemes for voluntary members in the informal sector is a significance step towards financial inclusion. A large portion of Fiji’s workforce operates within the informal sector and this initiative has a potential to empower these individuals and provide them with much needed safety net for their future. However, the Report also identifies key areas for improvement. A significant number of inactive members highlights the need for increased awareness programmes. The Committee commends FNPF’s existing initiatives targeting young people in schools and encourages further expansion of these programmes. Educating future generations about the importance of saving for retirement will be crucial in ensuring long term sustainability for the FNPF and the financial security of Fiji. The Committee’s site visit further eliminates the tangible impact of FNPF’s investment, the success of projects like the Nadi FNPF Plaza and the renovated Sheraton Resort showcases the potential for economic growth and job creation. Additionally, the Ba Aspen Hospital, a product of PPP provides the advanced medical care and free heart surgeries, directly addressing a critical need within the community. However, the challenge remains. Addressing ambulance service limitations, parking deficiencies at the Ba Hospital and the shortage of medical personnel are crucial steps in assuring the continued success of this vital facility. Finally, the Report highlights the FNPF’s contribution to several Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations by providing retirement savings and facilities access to healthcare.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024 Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 367 The FNPF tackles poverty and promotes good health and wellbeing, that is, SDG1 and SDG3. Their commitment to Environmental, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) investing in climate friendly strategies showcases the alignment with SDG11 and SDG13 respectively. In conclusion, the FNPF 2022 Annual Report demonstrates responsible financial management and a commitment to social impact and a vision for a more secure future for Fijians. By implementing the Committee’s recommendations and addressing its existing challenges, the FNPF can solidify its position as a cornerstone of financial security and a driver of sustainable development in Fiji. Let us all work together to support the FNPF in securing a brighter future for generations to come. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the honour to rise and provide some contributions on the debate of the review of the FNPF Annual Report 2022. Perhaps, may I start by saying that when we were outside Parliament as aspiring politicians, one of the things that concerned us was the use of the FNPF as perhaps, the national cheque book by the other side of Parliament. I have to pay credit to the Management of FNPF under those who have left and the current Management. They were able to keep an even keel, even when there was a lot of pressure brought to bear at various times in its operation. I would like to congratulate FNPF for the tremendous contributions it has made to our country, and we need to attribute credit where credit is due, Sir. We need to credit the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and Mr. A. D. Patel for their vision and wisdom for mirroring the investment process and system that was in Singapore, which is now FNPF, and we are all benefitting from that vision. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me, because of my role particularly in the investment trade side, to perhaps, provide some colouring in terms of where FNPF is headed and some places where we are trying to work with FNPF to try and ensure that the Fund diversifies. As we agree, there is a lot of concentration in hotels and properties and clearly, there is a need to widen the investment net (if you like) so that we continue to have a diversified portfolio in the FNPF. Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, there are some very active discussions in terms of commercial agriculture with some very promising players and I am hopeful that in this year, there will be some investments in that area. If that happens, Sir, that will help greatly in diversifying the Fijian economy and I know its music to not only this side of Parliament but certainly to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, who is only too acutely aware of the potential of commercial agriculture in Fiji. The second, Sir, is in the area of communications. As you know that through the hard work of this side of Parliament, we managed to get Google to establish in Fiji within seven months. What that means is that we have an opportunity for institutional investors in Fiji, including FNPF, to participate in this investment. I am hopeful that they will be able to do it because there are some very good returns if they are able to secure a parcel of the investment that this company, Google, is investing in the Pacific wide network. Finally, Sir, as part of that, we have to congratulate FNPF, particularly Amalgamated Telecom Holdings (ATH),for their investment in Papua New Guinea. I have been closely watching what they have been doing there, even outside Parliament, Sir, and there is a major potential investment opportunity there with some very good returns to Fiji. Sir, those are some of the opportunities that are in front of FNPF and our Fund, if anything, will only make the Fund stronger and we look forward to some of these things coming to fruition. One of the things that we also talked about outside Parliament before we came in, Sir, is,</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>368 Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 15 th April, 2024 Perhaps, looking at a medical scheme for the members of FNPF. I am hopeful that, that conversation can continue because it will broaden the benefit of healthcare to all our people in Fiji. Finally, Sir, going back to the idea of a national cheque book, I am hopeful, Sir, that we will allow FNPF to invest more offshore. That is one way of taking funds out of the country and putting them offshore so that not even our government, but governments that may come after us will not have this ability to just go in and take the funds of our members and use them where they want to. I know the honourable Minister of Finance is also looking at that and if it does, as we know, the returns in offshore investment managed funds is a lot higher than what we get in our beloved country. With those few words, Sir, I totally support the Report before us and again would like to congratulate the management of FNPF for their prudent management of what is a core underlying asset in our nation. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Report presented by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Review of the FNPF Annual Report 2022. This Report stands as a testament to the diligent work of the FijiFirst Government in overseeing the anagement of one of our nation’s most crucial institutions. First and foremost, I commend the FNPF for its remarkable achievements during the Financial Year 2022 with total assets reaching an impressive $8.7 billion. It is evident that the FNPF is effectively managing the contributions of its members. The significant increase in the net income to $650.8 million compared to $543.5 million the previous year, demonstrates the Fund’s commitment to financial stability and growth. Moreover, the FNPF’s effort to support its members during challenging times deserve recognition. Despite the adverse economic environment, the Fund continued to provide essential services and benefits to its members, from early retirement withdrawals to housing assistance and migration support. The FNPF remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard the financial well-being of its members. I would like to commend the FNPF for its strategic investment and partnership, particularly in projects aimed at improving healthcare and infrastructure in our nation. The refurbishment of the Sheraton Resort, the completion of Nadi FNPF Retail Complex and the partnership with Aspen Medical for the upgrading of Ba Aspen Hospital are all initiatives that contribute to the social economic development of our country. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the FNPF’s commitment to environmental, social and governance investment as highlighted in the report by actively participating in ESG initiatives through Public-Private Partnership, the FNPF is not only generating financial returns but also contributing to sustainable development and community welfare. In addition to the FNPF’s achievements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the diligent work and the oversight conducted by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs. Through a thorough review analysis, the Committee has provided valuable insights and recommendations for the continuous improvement of FNPF’s operation. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I conclude and urge all honourable Members of the august Chamber to support the Report in front of us. We must recognise and celebrate the exemplary work of the FNPF in safeguarding the financial future of our citizens. We must commend the FijiFirst government, a responsible government which has always looked after its people, the Fijians and FNPF and for its unwavering commitment to good governance and oversight. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Ketan, you are referring to the past Government because we</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024 Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 369</p><h4>have the present Government here.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> The FijiFirst Government, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, the past government. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Chairperson of the Standing Committee and all the honourable Members who have spoken before me. I just wanted to pick on a number of issues and highlights some of the figures with respect to 2022. Although the Fund in 2022 still recorded negative contributions which is contributions less withdrawals of $71.8 million. This was a big improvement from the previous negative net contribution of about $179.5 million. This increase, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is attributed to an increase in the contributions received due to the 2 percent increase on contribution rates and a decrease in members’ withdrawals. One of the largest component of the Fund’s investment return is the interest income from Government bond, subscriptions and returns from equity investment. What honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica mentioned with respect to FNPF’s ability to diversify its investment portfolio apart from the investments in the hotels and properties, particularly offshore investment to be able to move away from perhaps just relying on the Government bonds subscriptions and returns from that. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the interest rate that FNPF receives from Government bonds when compared to what is available in the market right now could be much higher, so the Government will also have to look at whether we can continue with the same interest rate. The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government committed to restoring their contributions rates to the normal 18 percent in 2024 and we have done that accordingly as announced in the last Budget. The Fund’s investment portfolio was valued at $8.6 billion in 2022 and the Return on Investment (ROI) new was 7.4 percent. This was a significant increase from the 6.1 percent return in the previous year. Key investment highlights for 2022, of course, as mentioned by the Chairperson was the completion of the refurbishment and reopening of the Sheraton Resort, the completion and opening of the Nadi Retail Centre, Fiji Airways acquisition, and of course, the Ba and Lautoka Hospital as Public-Private Partnership. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can inform Parliament that the Cabinet has considered the situation with respect to the Public-Private Partnership with Aspen and FNPF, in which the FNPF owns majority shares within the Health Care (Fiji) Pte Ltd (HCF). Of course, there are several issues there and at some point, when we have dealt with, the Parliament will be informed of that. The Fund continues to invest in opportunities that align with its long-term objectives, and as honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica said that the Fund's portfolio growth must increase. It is important that they do that, but also as we move in the future, we need to look at very carefully what was the original intention, the Chairperson of the Committee mentioned that. Historically, honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica talked about the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and the idea of the FNPF was first mooted by the late Mr. A. D. Patel, the former Leader of the Opposition, and the National Federation Party as a member of social services in the Legislative Council, which led to the formation of the FNPF. The original objective was to make FNPF a retirement fund so that when members retire, they have significant a social protection because of their pensions.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>370 Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 15 th April, 2024 The Chairperson mentioned about the FNPF Act 2011, and you would recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was a Decree that was put in place by the Bainimarama Government and unilaterally, the pension rate of 25 percent based on whatever the actuarial advice at that time was. We can argue about the financial implications, but the fact is, the way in which it was done, about 1,500 pensioners abruptly were put off. Some chose to remain on pension at a lower rate, and the Coalition Government recognised the pain and suffering that some of them went through. In fact, we now have a pension rate of 9 percent and, in fact, the FNPF had already moved towards further reducing the pension rate. What is happening is, a lot of people are not going on retirement on pension. More than 60 percent of the people who were members of the FNPF have balances of about less than $10,000, and when these people retire, what they will have will not be enough. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FNPF Board together with the Government, we are looking at this very carefully. I think the Board and the management are working together to look at what are some of the other innovative ways, apart from looking at increasing the investment portfolio, increasing the return because FNPF by law receives a certain amount of income. There are, of course, voluntary contributors. In 2022, there were about 19,000 people, these were people who could voluntarily go and become members of the FNPF and contribute. So, there were 19,145, which is only 5 percent of the total Fund membership. What that means, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that while looking at the return, while looking at the investments, et cetera has to make sure that it looks at more innovations, particularly the National Insurance Scheme because that is one of the most difficult things for people who retire after 55 years (now after 60 years) is to continue with the income source through which they can look after their health and through which they can maintain their families. The Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises the pain particularly those who had low balances in 2011. They had planned their whole life based on what they were getting and suddenly some of their contributions went down by about 50 percent and less than that. In the last Budget, we recognised that, it was not tokenism, it was a recognition that the Government had some responsibility, Parliament which makes law about FNPF has a certain responsibility to look at those members who actually went to become members and worked in the country to ensure that they have retirement. So, we provided additional $100 for those below 70 years and those over 70 years, $125. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working with the FNPF to look at how best we can further compensate and make sure that those who are still alive, those who are still on reduced pension and those who took lump sums and have not been able to maintain their income level are compensated. That is what the FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, going forward will do. I know the Chairperson gave the responses on a number of recommendations. All those recommendations make sense, and as a Government, we will be working with FNPF very closely to make sure that some of the legacy issues are addressed to the satisfaction of, not only the pension plus making sure that the FNPF remains a credible retirement pension fund, not just a fund where people put their contributions, get the interest rate and withdraw it towards the end of their retirement. That is what the FNPF Board and the management are working on. I want to thank the Board, Chairman, CEO and the management team for co-operating and working with the Government and managing FNPF in light of the challenges that are there to ensure that it remains a credible retirement Fund. HON. A. V. B. C BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament. I have no further comments, Mr. Speaker.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>371 Consolidated Review Report – MIDA 2010-2018 Annual Report 15 th April, 2024 MR.
