BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review of Levuka Town Council Annual Reports 2014 and 2015 which was tabled on 20 th November, 2023.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>359 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 15 th April, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Levuka Town is a site rich with the historical landmarks with its Colonial infrastructure and cultural history that gives it a very unique and special significance to Fiji and the Pacific. The history of Levuka tells the story of different people, such as the Colonial White Settlers, the Indentured Labourers, Chinese, indigenous people and other immigrant races coming together in what is referred to as the melting pot of Levuka. The Standing Committee on Social Affairs was referred these Annual Reports on 17th February, 2023, and tabled its findings to Parliament in the November 2023 Sitting. During the years under review, the Committee noted a few highlights of the Levuka Town Council which are: 1. The Back to Levuka Carnival which was revived and held in October 2015 raised a revenue of $20,745. 2. Hosted Animals Fiji VET from UK for a week on de-sexing clinic for domesticated and wildlife animals. 3. Hosted the Levuka Weightlifters who represented Fiji in the 2015 South Pacific Games. 4. As part of improving its internal controls, the Council recruited an Accountant, an Events Coordinator and a Web Assistant in 2014. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee’s findings and recommendations, the Committee had highlighted the following: 1. 2. 3. Levuka is listed as a heritage site, and this is a challenge for homeowners and building owners as it is costly to renovate by keeping to its original plan. By way of recognition, the Heritage Bill, as a legal framework, is needed to support Levuka as a heritage site. Therefore, the Committee had recommended the re-introduction of the Heritage Bill in Parliament as this piece of legislation will protect and support the work in improving heritage sites in Fiji. The Committee was also informed that the CEO position had not been confirmed to-date and it was recommended that the process be expedited so that the position could be confirmed, and this is vital for the effective operation of the Town Council. The Committee notes the lack of financial support to fund and maintain these sites, infrastructure and buildings which are of heritage status and is recommending that the Council continues with the Public-Private Partnership Scheme to further develop Levuka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also wishes to highlight in this august Parliament that despite correspondences being sent to Government Departments pursuant to Standing Order 121(6)(b) on a substantive response to the Committee’s Report within 21 days of receiving the Report, it is unfortunate that those responses were not forthcoming. Such responses would contribute to debate such as this and with that being said, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor, I just wish to remind us that the honourable Whips of both sides of Parliament have agreed to that the following be undertaken in terms of the time: 1. Five minutes for the Mover of the motion, that is, the Chairperson of the Committee and he/she will have another five minutes with a right of reply;</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>360 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 15 th April, 2024 2.</p><h4>In between, two speakers have been chosen from each side and they are to speak for 10 minutes each.</h4><p>To open the floor for debate, I am now offering the floor to: 1. Honourable V. Pillay; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 3. Honourable H. Chand; and 4. Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Levuka Town Council Annual Reports 2014 and 2015 and would like to commend the efforts of the Levuka Town Council as outlined in the 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports. Levuka, a town steep in history and cultural significance is on an upward trajectory. The Council’s achievements are a testament to their dedication and commitment to the town’s wellbeing. Back to Levuka Carnival in 2015 is a prime example. This celebration not only injects vibrancy into the community but also serves as a potential economic driver, attracting tourism and fostering local businesses. Furthermore, the Council’s proactive approach is commendable - upgrading the drainage system, public convenience and market fencing through the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) projects which improve the lives of Levuka residents. These essentials upgrades enhance sanitation, public health and provide a more conducive environment for commerce. infrastructure development to However, the Report also sheds light on some pertinent challenges. Preserving Levuka’s historical buildings, a cornerstone of the town’s identity, presents a significant cadre. The stringent regulations associated with heritage status often led to exorbitant renovation costs. These highlights the crucial need for the Heritage Bill. Such a legislation will provide much needed financial support and streamlines the process, ensuring the continued preservation of Levuka’s rich heritage for generations to come. The Report also identifies the lack of confirmed Chief Executive Officer and the limited employment opportunities as areas demanding attention. A permanent Chief Executive Officer with a clear vision and leadership expertise can provide much needed stability and direction for the Town Council. Additionally, fostering trade skills and higher education opportunities in Levuka is critical to empower residents and expand their prospects. Encouraging Public-Private Partnership could be a key strategy in achieving this. Partnering with private entities can unlock investment opportunities, create new jobs and stimulate economic activities. It is important to acknowledge the positive aspects highlighted in the Report. The Council’s commitment to gender equality, evident by the high percentage of women in leadership roles, aligns perfectly with Sustainable Development Goal 5. Furthermore, their focus on sanitation and waste management initiatives contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 11 in promoting sustainable cities and communities. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Levuka Town Council deserves our praise for their achievements, they are tackling challenges head on while actively seeking solutions. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this Report, we can propel Levuka towards a brighter future, a future that honours its heritage, empowers its residents and fosters sustainable growth. Let us join hands in supporting the Levuka Town Council as they navigate this journey.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 361 HON. M. K. NALUSIMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the motion before Parliament this afternoon, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Coalition Government on behalf of the vanua of Nabukebuke, Namosi to extend our heartfelt gratitude on the release of the Vunivalu Na Tui Namosi yesterday 14 th April, 2024. It was indeed a joyous and gracious reception by the vanua. Today the Vunivalu is chairing the Bose Vanua o Nabukebuke. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to also thank the Standing Committee on the Consolidated Review of the Levuka Town Council Reports from 2014 and 2015. I also take this time to thank the Acting Chief Executive Officer, management and staff of Levuka Town Council for doing a great job in administering the affairs of Levuka Town. There are few areas that I need to share this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the findings by the Committee. One is the need to maintain and upkeep of the Council’s property as well as heritage sites. Levuka Town is a very small one with only 144 ratepayers and income level of close to $315,000. So, this is really a challenge for small Councils like Levuka to maintain its properties as well as maintain the heritage sites around Levuka Town. The Ministry is mindful of the lack of development in Levuka in this regard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, The Ministry together with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and Ministry of Trade with the support of UNDP is working on a comprehensive plan for the development of Levuka. Agencies are working with UNDP to finalise its terms of reference and engage a consultant who will work on a three to five years as well as 10-year master plan for Levuka. It will set out investment in strategic assets and infrastructure, strategies to attract investments from domestic and foreign investors focused on culture and heritage tourism. All these will be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst maintaining the heritage status of Levuka. Another very important issue that was highlighted was the need for a timely submission of Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to share that the annual accounts for 2018 has been audited while the annual reports for 2016 and 2017 had been tabled in Parliament this morning. The Council is in the midst of updating its accounts for the remaining years; 2019 till 2023 by end of July 2024. Also, the importance of the re-introduction of the Heritage Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is believed that this legislation once review is completed will aim to protect and support the work in improving heritage sites in Fiji. There was also a need for the Council to work in consultation with the Ministry of Local Government, relevant Ministries, tertiary institutions and resource owners to design and develop strategies to enhance paid skills in respect of TVET, as well as to provide higher education facilities to accommodate the students of Levuka and the Lomaiviti Province as a whole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Council will continue to work with key partners in Levuka to bring up these institutions. It is also very interesting to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that on 28 th October, 2023, the Soqosoqo Vakamarama of the Lomaiviti Province hosted a soli for the acquisition of land in Suva for the children of the Lomaiviti Province as their hostel or place of lodgement. Another important issue that was raised is the need to complete the process of appointing a Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been working in collaboration with all the newly appointed Special Administrators on the way forward on how the Ministry is going to appoint the new CEOs for all the 13 Municipalities and also develop an Expression of Interest (EOI), in terms of reference, as well as role description for all the CEOs. The EOI has already been advertised by the Ministry of Local Government on behalf of the Council. The EOI closes on 22 nd April, 2024.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>362 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 15 th April, 2024 There is also a need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Council to continue with the Private Public Partnership Scheme to further develop Levuka. The Government of Japan has provided aid in kind assistance to the Levuka Town Council to support essential services provided by the Council. The Government of Japan has assisted the Council in providing the Council’s fleet, such as garbage truck, lawn mower, tipper truck, excavator and a seven tonne truck, which also assists the Council in earning extra revenue by giving it on hire. The Government of Japan further assisted the Council in building seawalls in Levuka Town in 2015, which was destroyed by the Tropical Cyclone in 2018 and, again, they helped rebuild the seawall in 2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Women has also assisted with the construction of the Levuka Market, providing a sum of $400,000. The market is near its completion. It is waiting for the special interest for the furniture before the actual commissioning of the opening of the new Levuka Market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also, some key areas that the Ministry has done to actually assist and overcome the poor services to the people of Levuka - • The Ministry has collaborated with agencies like the National Fire Authority for the repair and upgrade of the Fire Station. I think this is very important for Levuka because with the old heritage buildings that we have, it is always important that we have a very vibrant and a very effective fire station in Levuka. So, the work has started in March 2024 and should be completed by May 2024. • We have also identified the need to have more housing provision in Levuka Town and also in certain areas of Levuka. The Public Rental Board has also identified a 28 acre land in Waitovu, Levuka, to assist in the development of housing to assist Civil Servants and those who work in Levuka Town in the provision of accommodation. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament, and I thank you for the</p><h4>opportunity to present this afternoon.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution on the motion before us. First and foremost, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for the Review Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight some of the achievements of Levuka Town Council, Committees findings and issues that have been highlighted in the Report. The first one on the achievements of Levuka Town Council is as follows - • • • The improvement of the drainage system that was done in 2014 and 2015. The construction of much needed retaining wall for Nasova and Batiniwai Creek. The upgrade of the public convenience in Levuka Town. These very important developments were done in 2014 and 2015. Huge amount of money was invested, and it is very important for the current custodians to ensure that maintenance is carried out as and when needed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very old port, but there are many more developments which took place after 2015 and one development which stands out is the new Levuka Market.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 363 HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. H. CHAND.- This modern Levuka Market has given Levuka Town a facelift and this will benefit the people of Lomaiviti and those who will visit Levuka. The Government has been supporting the improvement and renovations of the historical sites in Levuka since 2013 after the listing of Levuka as a World Heritage Site. The improvements have been going on for a number of years now, thanks to the FijiFirst Government, former Ministers, the CEOs, the Special Administrator and the Executives of the Levuka Town Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted from the Committee’s Report that one of the key findings of the Committee is the CEO position which has not been confirmed till to date. The Ministry of Local Government should give priority to this and fill the position at the earliest, but it should be done using the due process. This should be in accordance with the Open Merit Recruitment and Selection (OMRS) Guidelines and not in an ad hoc manner, not like the appointment of the Special Administrators which was done late last year. Appointment should be based on merit and not on political recommendations. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of issues, the road conditions in Levuka is in very bad condition - pathetic. Week before last, I was in Levuka and I have noticed lovo sized potholes, as soon as I entered Levuka Town. We were told that the road condition in the town area has been very bad for the last few months. Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the road is well maintained, is it PWD, FRA or Levuka Town Council? One concerned ratepayer told me that the Coalition Government does not care about the people of Levuka. That is why the road in the heart of Levuka Town is worse than the gravelled road. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka is of great significance to Fiji. Levuka is the first historical port town, first capital and the first UNESCO World Heritage Site of Fiji. Government should give importance to Levuka and address the issues without delay. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my very short contribution. I hope that the other side was listening to the issues that I had highlighted, and the Government will make lives better for those people living in Levuka as promised during the election campaign. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to contribute to the motion before Parliament. Also, I would like to thank the Committee on Social Affairs for the Review Report that they have provided to this august Parliament. As we know, in the last sitting of last year, one oral question was raised with regards to the concerns of the business community in Levuka and I have addressed Parliament in regards to what the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture and Heritage have been trying to do with regards to the improvement of the Levuka Town Council, especially on the heritage site. The Heritage Bill, I understand that it is with the Committee which hopefully that will help Levuka Town when the Heritage Bill is passed that we can solve most of the heritage issues that is being there for so long. We have visited Levuka Town early this year in regard to some of the concerns that was raised and we have formed a Committee to try and work with other stakeholders in regards to how we can improve Levuka Town, especially on the heritage site.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>364 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 15 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, an initiative that my Ministry is working on and, hopefully, will roll out soon with the Levuka authorities and the Department of Town and Country Planning is to explain about the process stipulated in the Levuka Town Scheme statements and provide simple explanations in visual form on how they can develop the town, while keeping in mind preservation principle of heritage. A simple case is the Westpac Office in Levuka. For those of you who have never seen this, I strongly recommend that you visit Levuka and see the Westpac Office which has been renovated to date. Through the Levuka Town Council and Department of Town and Country Planning, we hope to streamline the process and standard, including provisions of quick turnaround time for the development requests in the heritage town. Another key factor is the capacity building of Levuka Town Council’s staff and other stakeholders, including the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts. Sadly, a high staff turnover of institutions involved had slowed the work on the heritage preservation. A study of similar towns in Asia, Australia and New Zealand is critical and this is an area my Ministry would like to focus on, as well as in the coming months so that implementors themselves are able to accurately interpret heritage in Levuka and help the people of the town. Given the lack of the heritage field expertise in Fiji, we hope to bring international experts in the area of heritage buildings and infrastructure and conservation to do a thorough study of restoration needs which was to have happened in years immediately after TC Winston that hit the island of Ovalau. This, we envisage to roll out in August and September this year. Lastly, through the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts, there has been numerous assistances rendered to the Levuka Town Council to assist in the upkeep of the heritage town. This engagement is important since the Town Council remains the sole authority of the municipal boundary. Other departments and organisations are merely providing assistance to the Levuka Town Council in the fulfilment of their municipal councils. A most recent project which will begin soon is the restoration of the Deed of Cession site in Levuka. This iconic landmark is a symbolic of our history and the move to nationhood. We hope in the upcoming Budget process, Government will assist us and double our efforts in the preservation of Levuka World Heritage site, including the much-needed assistance to the Town, residents, business owners and the village of Levuka as a whole. I must thank our development partners and the Government Departments, such as the Ministry of Local Government, Department of Town and Country Planning, Department of Tourism, Fiji Ports Authority and others, who have boldly stepped up to assist us, as well as the Levuka Town Council in sustaining the historical feature of Levuka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regard to the road in Levuka, as we have experienced the adverse weather in regard to climate change, it happens throughout Fiji and the Government is trying its best to improve the roads out there in the rural areas. One area that I want to state here is that in Levuka, we can only allow a three-tonne truck to go into the wharf. If we need to go quickly into repairing the roads, we need heavy trucks and machineries to help in the construction of the roads in Levuka, or else we will have to go all the way to Buresala which is quite an expensive exercise. In regard to civil servants, they have been struggling with regard to the lack of accommodation. We need more civil servants out there to make sure they perform the duties that are required of them in the Town of Levuka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the honourable Members who have contributed to the motion before Parliament. I have no further comments. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>365 Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 15 th April, 2024 Question put.
