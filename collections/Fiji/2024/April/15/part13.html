<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Fiji’s Membership of GDN – Progress of (Question No. 02/2024) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on Fiji’s Membership of the Assembly of the Global Development Network (GDN)? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- I thank the honourable Member for her question for oral reply. Before I do so, I acknowledge the students of the University of the South Pacific and I convey to them the condolences of the Government on the loss of Dr. Samu Bogitini, a long serving member of the University. He started as the Director of Labasa Centre before it became a full blown Campus and asked me to be the Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the University Centre in Labasa. Our condolences go to his family and the sad thing is that his younger daughter graduated on the day he died. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question. The Global Development Network (GDN) is a public international organisation that supports high quality, policy-oriented, social science research in low and middle income countries with a mission to promote better lives. The GDN promotes research on the premise that contextualised the local driven research that leads to more informed policies, increased policy ownership, better informed implementation and more sustainable and inclusive development choices. Sir, GDN also focuses on strengthening research capacity across countries and their disciplines. The GDN fosters collaborative efforts among socio-economic research institutions, individual researchers, policy makers and donors that encourage capacity building and networking to accelerate development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 1999, GDN has supported over 4,000 development research grantees from over 140 of these countries. Sir, GDN was created in the aftermath of the landmark World Bank World Development Report 1998/1999 - Knowledge for Development, which set the stage for active promotion of policy research, particularly in developing countries. Some of their research and findings could easily have been seen as race-based, but it was mostly on the social difficulties that various groups go through in their countries. The GDN Headquarters is in New Delhi, India, with additional presence in Washington DC, USA, and a newly established office in Clermont-Ferrand, France. Furthermore, GDN works on all aspects of development and has previous experience in such field such as development finance, agriculture, research systems, governance, industrial productivity, natural resource management, biodiversity and education, as it continually incorporates new topics on an annual basis.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>336</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform Parliament that on 18 th October, 2023, Cabinet approved Fiji’s membership of the GDN Assembly, thereby, enhancing participation of our nation in GDN hosted events. The annual cost of Fiji’s membership is US$100,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Given that Fiji has always played a major role in promoting development in the Pacific, our membership of GDN will provide participating researchers and development practitioners with global recognition and visibility, and further strengthen the work carried out by our people for the development and betterment of the lives at both, local and regional levels. The Strategic Planning Office within the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is currently coordinating with the University of the South Pacific (USP), on behalf of the Fiji Government, to host the 25 th Annual Global Development Conference in Fiji in November of this year, marking the return of GDN flagship event to the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji to host this historic meeting is timely, as the Coalition Government has re-established the Strategic Planning Office within the Ministry of Finance to ensure better co- ordination and formulation of a strategic and robust development pathway for the nation. Through the Conference, we envisage building our research capacity, improving our network capacity and our networking and also strengthening collaboration with universities, as well as with GDN member countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Conference will be an important step in Fiji’s global engagement around sustainable development issues. Fiji has commenced initial discussions with the GDN and the planning and logistic aspects of hosting that Conference. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded earlier, the Strategic Planning Office from the Ministry of Finance is collaborating with the USP as a co-partner in hosting the event. The GDN Conference is tentatively scheduled for the last week of November of this year. The USP, being the local partner, will fund an amount of US$300,000 towards that GDN Conference. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s membership will enable policy makers, researchers, academic and professional bodies to undertake and produce evidence-based policies that are contextualised to the local and to the region. The GDN will generate and share knowledge and forge new working relationships with donors, partners and with key stakeholders, to deepen research capacity at individual and institutional levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, hosting the annual GDN Conference will enable a larger contingent of participants from the Pacific and local and regional research institutions’ knowledge to be featured on a theme to be mutually agreed in line with the 95 development priorities in the Pacific. Fiji will sign the agreement to become a member of the GDN during the 25 th GDN Conference in November of this year. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the annual GDN involves high level inclusive evidence-based debates on current development challenges and priorities. The GDN Conference intends to bring around about 800 participants in a hybrid mode, out of which roughly 250 to 400 are in person participants from across sectors and disciplines. Sir, we will be presenting Fiji to the world, and look forward to welcoming GDN Conference to Fiji. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his response. In his response, he did mention about building our research capacity which is something that we would appreciate. My simple question is, will GDN be doing all the research for us now or is there a Ministry that is going to be dedicated and working together with GDN so that we can start</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>337 with this research capacity that is badly needed locally? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, there are two parts of the question that was being raised. Is it going to be allocated to a separate Ministry? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just elaborate further because there are overlaps in this work. The honourable Prime Minister has mentioned about the Strategic Planning Office, we have Poverty, and then Rural Development under the Centre on Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP) which we are already a member of, so there are overlaps in the work that we do. With the linkage to GDN, where will the co-ordinating office in Fiji be – USP, Strategic Planning Office or Poverty? That is my question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will soon be with the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. They will initially push it forward, they brought a paper to Cabinet to work with the University, and they will have to sort out the finer details of that working towards the Conference in November and also after that. Reduction of Duty – Imported Chicken Portions (Question No. 03/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament of the impact of the reduction of duty from 15 percent to zero percent on imported chicken portions on the local poultry industry? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. In fact, the question is factually wrong, and I will explain why. But I think the intention of the question …. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! You have raised a question with the learned Professor here, so having a go at the way the question was couched, he is trying to answer that. Let us listen to the answer. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we allowed the question because the intention of the question is relevant. I will correct the factual side of it, as well as answer the question in terms of the intent. Before I do that, let me just set this in the context. Tariff protection has always been an important economic policy tool for countries to protect and support local industries where it is imperative. In the 1970s and 1980s, we started by that - we had huge protection for the rice industry, protection for manufacturing and some of it is still continuing. These were all done in line with fair market practices that eventually, encouraged competition and consumer options which could lead to price reduction as well. The idea of tariff protection, in economics we call it “infant industry argument”, where tariff protection is given to allow industries to grow up, to compete, and progressively reduce the tariff. Historically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has had substantial protection for numerous local business industries, and we started with tariff reforms. It actually started under the leadership of the</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>338</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 honourable Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, in the 1990s. It was designed to promote trade liberalisation, and in some sense, this outward looking strategy for economic growth paid dividend. Despite the initial reforms, certain protections persisted and were supported by all Governments in Fiji and continued over a period of time. Some, however, have been gradually phased out and the subsequent phasing out involved assessing and lowering of fiscal duties, and the most common form of protection is tariff protection - import duties and taxes on imports. Of course, the old strategy, again, was quota, but most countries do not go towards quota anymore, it is basically tariff protection. The global trading environment is one designed to gradually reduce tariff. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the poultry industry, this is one of the most heavily protected industries in Fiji. The good news, as a result of that, is that we are almost self-sufficient. However, self-sufficiency and the support for local industry must be carefully balanced with the cost to our people. What happens is, sometimes when the tariff rate is very high, even if the item is imported, the cost to the consumers can be very, very high and we need to ensure that industries that get tariff protection are, at the same time, able to reduce prices, improve quality and offer greater choice to consumers. In the budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise and reduce the import excise duty on chicken portions from 10 percent to zero percent, not 15 percent to zero percent. So, it was the import excise duty on chicken portions only, not the whole chicken, from 10 percent to zero percent and not 15 percent to zero percent, as the question puts out. That is why I said it is factually incorrect. But more importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the reduction from 10 percent to zero percent in the import excise duty, the duty of 32 percent still remains. So, even if someone who is importing chicken portions today, that importer still pays 32 percent instead of the original 42 percent. So, a total tariff protection of 42 percent is still applicable for anything which includes whole chicken other than chicken portions. What we found out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we were doing the budget, even with the 42 percent duty, some of the importers of chicken portions, chicken wings and chicken drumstick were still able to sell in the local market at a lower price than our local producers and that to me was, in some sense, unethical, because we realised that the whole chicken still has a duty of 42 percent. The other thing that we have in this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we are only, at the moment, importing chicken from New Zealand. If we import chicken from Indonesia, for example, and Indonesia has quality chicken, Japan imports (from the figures that I saw) about 40 percent of chickens from Indonesia, we will probably end up landing the chicken here with 42 percent duty and still sell those chickens at a much lower price than what our local producers sell. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we did in the budget, we reduced the duty and extended it to lamb, beef, prawns, ducks, corned meat and tinned fish, to facilitate price reductions for domestic products. What we have found is that the prices of some of those items actually came down. While we reduce the duty on chicken portions, we have still maintained a high level of protection for the whole chicken, which is about 42 percent - 32 percent fiscal duty, plus the 10 percent import excise. Again, I want to repeat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the highest level of protection. After the Budget, some of the producers played funny. It was all designed to bring out this negativity about the Budget and suddenly because of the Budget, because of the increase in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent on some of the items, that suddenly the price of chicken went up and then when the Government intervened, the prices were brought down.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>339</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It has gone up again:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> The other point that we want to make, Mr. Speaker, is the local producers. Between the three of them, they employ 2,400 people, and we know that even with the reduction in duty for chicken portions, their profitability has not been affected because the sign that we are getting, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, on the other day, officiated at the new investment made by Crest (another $22 million) and all the producers that we had discussions with are actually, in the end. satisfied with what the Government had done. So, I do not see, Mr. Speaker, any significant impact on the local production as far as investment and what the three producers are getting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point I want to make, again, as I have said, is that the poultry industry is still one of the most heavily protected industries. The Government is paying for it. When we put those very high duty, the cost, even if there was zero VAT, if you raise the duty, it is a tax on the consumers. The people who import, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not pay for those taxes. All they do is simply pass it onto the consumers. So, if someone imports whole chicken, for example, from New Zealand, they pay 42 percent duty and if they sell it in the market, they are not the ones who are going to subsidise. They will simply add that 42 percent onto the cost. So, the signal that we provided in the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was to say to the local producers, “Look at your pricing, look at your efficiency. Do not just concentrate on making exorbitant profit at the cost of the prices to the consumers.” In terms of jobs (2,400), yes, we appreciate that -n2,400 families or less than that, but the important thing is that we have 800,000 people in the country. So, that is the message that we wanted to give to the producers as a result of what we did and it brought down the prices of chicken portions, wings, and people appreciate that. HON. S. NAND.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Before I ask my supplementary question, I would like to correct the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. In the Daily Hansard of Friday, 30 th June, 2023, it states, and I quote: “The Government will also reduce import excise on chicken portions such as wings, drumstick, legs, feet, thighs, et cetera, from 15 percent to zero percent.” It is mentioned 15 percent to zero percent. If you are saying this is wrong, you should have gone and corrected the Daily Hansard.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> The question is, has your reduction in duty worked? How long does it take for a whole chicken to be cut in four or five portions and shipped to Fiji to destroy our local chicken industry and you have set the precedence? Has the reduction in duty from 15 percent (as mentioned in the Daily Hansard ) to zero percent worked? Has the price of chicken portions come down significantly? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- In the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear, it is from 10 percent to zero percent, that is the protection. It could have been a mistake, but the point is, when you reduce the duty and the duty, as I have said very clearly is not produced on a whole chicken. I also said that even with the 42 percent duty, those who were importing chicken portions were actually selling at a lower price than what was available locally. The price of chicken portions now being imported with a reduction duty of 10 percent (import excise duty) the prices have gone down.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>340</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, my question is more from the consumer perspective.</p><p>The intent of the policy was to assist consumers to get affordable protein. The intension was good, but if you look at the pricing itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 15 percent VAT increase -10 percent reduction in the duty, still the price has not been cheaper. Chicken is consumed by each and every household. If you go to the supermarket, you can see the price have gone up. In fact, my question to the honourable Minister is, can the Minister admit that his policy failed and that it failed the consumers? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes, I do not get what the Opposition is trying to point out. What is their point? (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- On one hand, they are worried about the impact on the producers, suddenly they turned away from consumers to be concerned about the impact it will have on the producers, then they are saying, “Oh, because of the reduction in the duty, you are not going to have….” The answer to her question is, firstly, she is wrong because the VAT of 9 percent it is not an increase of 15 percent, VAT was increased from 9 percent to 15 percent. Before the budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had three rates of VAT. We had zero on basic food items, we had 9 percent on others, and we had 15 percent. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- She is caught now! She said VAT increased by 15 percent. The VAT only increased by 6 percent. The reduction in duty was 10 percent, so there is a 4 percent net reduction in the cost to the produce and that has been passed on to the consumers. If they go around and look at the price in the market, ask the consumers who are buying chicken portions, chicken wings, chicken drumstick, they will find that the prices have gone down further because even with the 9 percent VAT and even with the 42 percent duty, the prices were lower than what was being made locally. So, that is a policy that is working. It is a signal to the producers to look at their own pricing, become more competitive and pass better prices to the consumers. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question would be, while we actually give duty protection to certain industries in Fiji, is Government looking at some kind of price regulations because what we have seen is that, when some of these companies are given duty protection of 30 percent or 33 percent, at the end of the day, their gross profit is much more than what their duty protection is. So, if we are giving duty protection, is the Government actually.… MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, the issue regarding the first question that was raised is to do with chicken - the 15 percent, zero percent and 10 percent VAT that has been added and decreased, so that is the argument that is going around. So, what are you really referring?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> I am still referring to the poultry industry, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR .- Chicken:</span></p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>341 MR. SPEAKER.- There are only three producers that are being affected. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, because if there are only two or three, price curtailing can go on and I think the honourable Minister of Finance is well versed with this particular scenario where it has actually happened in the past. So, what I am asking is for all the industries that do get duty protection, is the Government intending to do some price regulation so that this massive GP is not actually obtained by this particular industry? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the question makes a lot of sense and I thank the honourable Member because he his right. If the producers are not passing the benefits of protection - the profits that they make to the consumers, then it is unethical and some of them engage in unethical pricing. I think, as a Government, price control is economically not the best thing to do when you are trying to promote competition and all that, but if the Government finds that our producers, having had this huge protection, are not moving towards providing a price which makes sense, from their point of view, the profit they make and what the Government provides in terms of protection, then the question is right, that Government will have to look at price regulation as well. I think there is an End of Week Statement on the Dairy Industry but for 10 years, we had 32 percent protection for the import of dairy products. We protected one company and look at the prices of milk, butter, et cetera, until that 10 year period ended. You now see a reduction in the price of milk and dairy products generally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue about price regulation in the face of a lot of protection, a lot of the producers have carried on like that for many, many years at the expense of the consumers. The signal that we provided as a result of the decision we made on chicken portions is exactly that signal, and we want the producers to think about it carefully, pass the right prices to the consumers, at the same time keep on investing and making profit. Benefits of MSME Strategic Plan to MSMEs (Question No. 04/2024) HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on how the proposed MSME Strategic Plan will benefit the MSMEs and increase their contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP)? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Perhaps, before I answer the question, may I be allowed to answer a lot of utterances that have recently been made in media and social media about the Government doing nothing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- Just answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Sir, I was asked when I first came into Government what did I think. I said, it is like sitting at high tide in Nabukalou Creek. When you sit at Nabukalou Creek at high tide as you know, Sir, everything looks really nice. It is almost like being in Venice or France, but as soon as that tide goes away, what do you see? You see the mess that is there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Koya, what is your Point of Order?</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>342</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Point of Order on Standing Order 74, Sir, on relevance.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am coming to it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, he can make that part of his speech if he comes up with a Ministerial Statement. There is a question that is asked of him, could he, please, answer it. The time for Parliament is quite valuable. If he wants to answer things that have come up in social media or whatever it is, there is a different forum for him to do it, Sir. Please, stick to the question. We value the time that we get because we get little. please, relevance, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. I take note of your concern, honourable Koya, but I will allow the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, he is just coming to that point. I always provide that allowance to the Opposition. The floor is yours Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Sir, what I was trying to say is that this is a message to the people of Fiji as well. There are certain things that are a mess in this country. We have just heard the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport talk about it, so that is one aspect. The second is that we need to plan better in this country. That is why I am making this response here today. The third is, we are also picking up on the good things that our government did on the other side, Sir. So, with those ones, we are trying to develop. That is why it is relevant to the answer that I was trying to make. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, through the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications are embarking on, I believe, is probably the first Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Strategic Plan done, at least, in the last 20 years or so. The last one, I think, was done by the Qarase-led Government, which actually went well until they threw it away, but this is another attempt to actually plan better for the future of this sector. We all agree that the sector is a very important one in our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually the backbone of the country, with MSMEs worldwide, accounting for about 50 percent to 60 percent of the global GDP, 90 percent of businesses, and 70 percent of global employment. In Fiji, Sir, there are approximately 30,000 registered MSMEs that account for 82 percent, if not more, if you consider the informal sector. In addition, over the last three years, the sector has contributed about $191 million in taxes. So, no doubt, a well-crafted strategic plan will be an enabling tool to build capacity, organise participatory processes, empower stakeholders, and grow MSMEs in Fiji, as it is very critical. It will also allow the Government to actually build something that I feel is lacking, which is a comprehensive ecosystem, an ecosystem where, as we all know, MSMEs come into the economy at different levels. So, there are those that come at the micro-level and there are those that come at the operation level. The new strategic plan will ensure that all those needs are addressed in a comprehensive manner, and then it will allow this Government to actually plan and execute better. And I am reminded of that saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are hoping this plan will pave the way towards an increased contribution to the GDP, hence growing the economy. At this stage of the five-year plan, we are looking at a transition from about 18 percent to 25 percent, with a stretch target of maybe 30 percent. Having said all that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consultant that we are dealing with through the</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>343 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), has been engaged in carrying out consultations in the country from 26 th February, 2024 to 8 th March, 2024. I have to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the level of consultations has been very exciting, with contributions across the whole country – from the private sector, obviously, the MSME Sector themselves, business development providers, the banking institutions and also, a few Fintech institutions. Another initiative that occurred during this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the launching of the first ever MSME Conference from 7 th March, 2024 to 8 th March, 2024, which was organised by Business Assistance Fiji, that provided a very valuable platform on which the MSMEs have raised their concerns and also contributed towards the strategic plan. Some of the key elements that I would like to share and, hopefully, will come out in the strategic plan, include: 1. A more nationally-defined MSMEs – an actual database for MSMEs, which will allow us to track how our MSMEs are doing across our nation and target assistance where required. 2. Better coordination amongst Government agencies which will be critical. 3. 4. More importantly, ensuring that youth and women participation in business occurs in Increase in resource owner participation in business and commercial spaces. these sectors. 5. Adoption of technology and safe transition into digital spaces is also a key. 6. Regulatory compliance, of course, with business registration and others. While the other things that I hope to bring forth in this venture which has never been done is to actually try and enshrine within the education system for that secondary level and at tertiary level MSME entrepreneurial education, so that we do not start building our entrepreneurs up at 30 years, or on retirement, we start at a very young age, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have to say without a formal structure, what we are seeing in the MSME sector amongst our people is very exciting already, so this plan will only enhance their capacity. By addressing the things that I have mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plan seeks to maximise MSMEs’ contribution to shared prosperity, inclusive economic growth, sustainable production, and also contribute quite significantly to the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, the plan entails to focus on capacity development at MSMEs, including access to finance, formalisation, and also improving digitisation and also assisting with the green and blue economy. Access to finance is a key challenge for the MSMEs and this Government and the People’s Coalition will do its utmost to ensure that this issue is addressed. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MSME strategic plan will be a comprehensive forward thinking approach that supports the development of MSMEs in Fiji and laying the foundation for sustained growth in the long term. In short, the overall vision is to provide a clear path toward increasing GDP contribution, as I have mentioned, post COVID-19 levels and provide our roadmap with roles, responsibilities and an execution plan, if you like, to ensure that we have a proper blueprint for MSME development over the next five years. It will also have costing components, through the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, to navigate what he can provide, but the plan will outline a national vision for MSMEs, a strategic direction where we wish to take the MSMEs and also how we wish to get there.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>344</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 This roadmap with then consolidate from within Government and donor partners that implementation programme. We thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to answer this question. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for paying such close attention to the MSMEs network. As we all know, Sir, they form a considerable part of our economy and from memory, I think I remember that they contribute roughly about $300 million in taxes, et cetera, towards our economy pre-COVID-19 and it is about 18 percent of our GDP. In terms of strategic plans, I also do understand. Thank you for acknowledging all that has been done within that particular sector at the Ministry and I know you are building on it to do the strategic plan with a lot of work that actually that went into it. One of the critical components of this, and I am getting to my question is, for Fiji, it is a massive, massive tool for our engine for growth and also with respect to diversification. I appreciate the fact that he is now going across and doing some work with respect to education, et cetera. My question is, honourable Minister, this issue of diversification will require massive coordination with different Ministries, et cetera, in order for that to be done. Will that consultation take place so that, that coordination is done so that we can stop relying so heavily on tourism, Sir? MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koya. Honourable Members, please, take note that even to raise a supplementary question, we have timed that as well. So, if the bell is sounded, then you have gone over the time allocated for a supplementary question. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for that excellent question. In fact, the MSME strategy is very much part and parcel of the economic diversification of this country. If you have been hearing me in this Parliament when I talk about economic diversification, the MSMEs come under that particular deliverable, if you like, because it is very important that we actually drive the economy and diversify it through MSMEs. Allow me just to give one story, Sir. This is on the potential that exists in the MSMEs sector. There is a very young couple who have an IT company that is already doing IT blockchain solutions for the Government of Seychelles. Now, the Government of Fiji is using them thankfully a lot more. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a couple who have developed something from scratch in Fiji and now have about 20 staff, and the way they are going, they are going to be quite big. Honourable Koya was supporting them, and we have continued to support them. These are the types of initiatives that we will commit to support. So, just to assure honourable Koya, the MSME sector is very much a floundering sector when it comes to the diversification of the economy and in terms of the coordination with other agencies, that is something that we will need to improve on, but it is certainly going to be part of the overall strategy as mentioned, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge the presence of former Parliamentarian, Mr. Rasova. He has been fairly busy around the corridors of Parliament. Welcome to this Sitting, Mr. Rasova. We will move on to the next Oral Question. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister was extensively</p><h4>covered in his Ministerial Statement this morning, so I am quite satisfied with that.</h4><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>345 MR. SPEAKER.- Do you still want to raise it? HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question that I was supposed to ask this morning on the progress of drainage plans for farmers in Valley Road, as nearly all farms were inundated with the recent flash flooding with substantial cash income being lost, the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways covered this in his Ministerial Statement this morning, but if he wants to elaborate, he can do so. MR. SPEAKER.- This is like a fishing expedition. (Laughter) You just tell us whether you want to withdraw your question, or you still want to continue? You are putting in something half and half.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, if he can continue, that will be better.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- That still does not give us a clear. For the sake of you being a veteran in Parliament, now I will ask the honourable Minister to, at least, answer the question. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. I have covered this subject extensively during my Ministerial Statement. My Assistant Minister has already visited the area in question, and we are fully aware of the drainage problems faced by our farmers in the Sigatoka Valley. We are already moving to fix those problems. MR. SPEAKER.- I think that provides a good answer for your half and half fishing expedition, Sir. Update on the SPTE 2024 (Question No. 06/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the forthcoming South Pacific Tourism Exchange (SPTE) 2024 event to be hosted by Fiji? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of Parliament and the public, please, allow me to briefly share what the South Pacific Tourism Exchange (SPTE) is. It is a major annual event hosted by the South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO), formerly the Tourism Council of the South Pacific. It is the Pacific region’s flagship tourism event which brings together industry leaders, tourism professionals, stakeholders and partners from across the Pacific under one roof. The event was born from our collective commitment to offer our valued international travel partners the opportunity to see and experience our regional tourism products and suppliers so that they can sell the Pacific as their destination of choice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what makes this event more special is that, this is the first time for Fiji or any other Pacific Island Country to host the SPTE. It has been hosted primarily in Australia and New Zealand, and now we are proudly bringing it closer to home.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>346</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, well over a decade ago, we would host the Bula Fiji Tourism Exchange (BFTE). Over the years, Fiji, like many of our other neighbours, began hosting their own expos. That is how the Fiji Tourism Exchange (FTE) was born. With the Coalition Government’s renewed commitment to regionalism, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation has partnered with SPTO to bring this element of Pacific back. Fiji’s hosting also gives the opportunity for our small island brothers and sisters, who may not have their own expositions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is a founding member and host country to the SPTO. Nine Pacific Island countries founded this organisation and today, we have a membership of 21 countries and about 200 private sector members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SPTE 2024 will be held from 4th to 5th May in Nadi, serving as a platform for fostering regional collaboration, promoting sustainable tourism practices and showcasing the diverse cultural and natural attractions of our Pacific nations. There will also be a series of workshops and training. The SPTE 2024 will be held along the margins of our very own Fiji Tourism Exchange. We are expecting, at least, 80 buyers from across the Globe and 80 sellers from the Pacific during the two-day event. The SPTO and Tourism Fiji also collaborated on a co-hosted buyer programme to bring in 15 buyers from the United Kingdom and Europe, to participate in both, the SPTE and FTE events. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be a very busy few days for the tourism industry beginning 30 th April to 7 th May, 2024, so much so that we are calling it “Tourism Super Week”. Tourism Fiji will be leading a number of engagements, including workshops covering sustainability, adventure travel, digital, destination development and a two-day cruise symposium. Along the margins, SPTO will also be conducting workshops for its regional tourism organisations, including a four-day Research and Statistics Capacity Building Workshop, the Sustainable Tourism Regional Consultation, Pacific Tourism Digital Champions and Marketing Managers Workshop. Mr. Speaker, Sir, being selected to host this year’s SPTE is a testament to Fiji’s renewed commitment to regional tourism and the commitment of the Fiji Government to promoting tourism that is empowering, resilient, prosperous and inclusive. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge the presence of more students from the University of the South Pacific. I am sorry, I really do not know whether you are part of the old group or is this a new group altogether. Are you all studying law? STUDENTS.- Yes. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Students, we are so grateful for this kind of visit from you to come and learn where we make new laws, we amend laws and we repeal laws and even endorse dealings with the rest of the world in whatever policy the Government of the day fits that Parliament endorses, this is our attachment will other countries as well. We are so grateful for your presence, and we hope you will learn how best your representatives here have been trying all their best to, at least, say something in the hope that changes the view of Government in how it is doing things. Welcome, once more.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>347 Before I offer the seventh Oral Question for today, I would like to remind honourable Members that the first question that was raised, we have taken note of that, and I would like to offer this time to honourable Usamate, who was supposed to be raising that question and, hopefully, the honourable Minister for Public Works could also prepare for a reply. HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I apologise for being late. I would just like to add a note that the bell did not sound in the place where we were having our morning tea. MR. SPEAKER.- These are things that will eventuate because of these new clocks. If they do not reach your ears wherever you are in the precincts, we seek your forbearance. We will try and do our best to ensure that when the bell is sounded, it reaches the four corners of the Parliament precincts that we are in. Re-Establishment of PWD – Progress Of (Question No. 01/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on the progress of the re-establishment of the Public Works Department and what it has achieved so far? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise as I was not also here at that time and I thank you for allowing the question and my response. The Public Works Department (PWD) that is a work case study in what not to do. Looking back, it was, sort of, irrational in the way things were done and in terms of how it was dismantled without really assessing and analysing the critical role it plays in the development of our nation. It is a challenge in terms of the Ministry working through that. The decision, Sir, from the view of the Coalition Government, it was a huge mistake. It had its expertise in planning, designing, constructing and all those technical know-how in terms of public infrastructure, et cetera, as we all know. Looking back, we just cannot understand how that happened. It is not only a part of Government as a part of the Civil Service, but it plays a very critical role in terms of infrastructure and essential services such as roads and water. The consequences were, really, I would, detrimental. We can write a thesis on it …. MR. SPEAKER.- Will you be able to end that thesis? (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Let me just say that we do not want to dwell on the mistakes of the past. We will not look back. Basically, there was nothing there when we came in, in terms of equipment, manpower, et cetera, so it is really starting from scratch. I think the Opposition is asking, “why are you re-establishing it?” It is basically the lack of services to our people, for example, roads. When we look at roads, there has been a lot of neglect because they divided the roads - FRA and non-FRA roads. When you say non-FRA roads, there are quite a lot of communities involved in non-FRA roads. Also, rural roads were neglected. That is part of our policy is to rebuild it and it has commenced.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>348</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 We have issued contracts for the purchase of construction and maintenance equipment and the first batch of machinery have arrived. This marks a pivotal step towards equipping Public Works Department to effectively carry out its functions. As I have mentioned, there is nothing there – nil equipment, even nil experienced operations staff. For example, even a grader, you need to know how to operate it, not drive it. There has been quite a lot of complaints in terms of the private operators in terms of how they do that. That lack of know-how and skills contributes to the current predicament we face. In terms of the Building Section, we have already been engaged in repairing Government buildings that were left in disrepair. This is a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Health, for example, assisting in some of the urgent works at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, and also with other Ministries like the Ministry of Agriculture. This will intensify in the next financial year when the maintenance of all Government buildings is envisaged to be centralised. We are looking forward to this being streamlined and enhance efficiencies in property management, especially in terms of quality and durability of the kind of work being done which we have found to be lacking in terms of some of the private sector providers. While PWD undergoes the process of reform, the maintenance of rural roads and rural water will continue to be with Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) and Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), but with FRA, it will be working with PWD in terms of complementing each other, with some depots expected to commence operations in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2024. Sir, when you are looking at a technical department such as PWD, human resources is very critical. When PWD was done away with, that was a big gap in the sustainability of human resources in technical areas. For example, plumbers, electricians, even those who were operating specialised equipment, so it takes time to rebuild that. You cannot rebuild that in just 12 months. A lot of the experienced staff have left, so it is quite a challenge rebuilding that, but we will be doing that as we move forward, for example, in terms of apprenticeships. That is basically the update which, in order to answer that question, I think is a challenge, but it will be good to bring it back as we are doing now, as part of the Coalition Government’s strategy to plug the gaps that are there. We see that the Drainage Board is coming back. That will be working in collaboration with our Ministry and also, complementing the gaps which are there in the services by FRA in terms of our rural roads which have been neglected for quite some time. As I have mentioned this morning when I was discussing the Water Sector 2050 Strategy, we also need a Fiji National Roads Policy and Strategy moving forward, so probably with the same timeline and also by decade. Currently, we are engaging development partners. Thank you, honourable Minister of Finance, and not only them but also the Ministry of Climate Change to look into climate financing for water, energy and also roads in order that these are climate resilient moving forward for the next three decades. HON. J. USAMATE.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In August 2023, this was what the honourable Minister said, that he would equip some depots but no depots have been equipped. He said that they would work on some rural roads but according to his answer, no such work has been done. In January of 2024, he said they would work on the maintenance for the next six months, not any one of these roads have been maintained over the past six months. The other thing that I would like to say is that he is talking about the repairs…. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- How do you know?</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>349 MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. J. USAMATE.- I know because I walked some of the routes of those roads and we built those roads without PWD. We built it with the Divisional Engineers and their teams. My question is, if you say something that you are going to do, when are you going to do it? He has not answered my question at all, Mr. Speaker, Sir. He has gone on a long lament. I think you are learning from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister this side to go on this meandering round the Mississippi. So, when are you going to deliver what you said in August and what you said in January? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned, you cannot rebuild what you destroyed over 16 years in 16 months. Some of the issues he raised is very specific and maybe if he rephrases the question to specific items, I can answer that. But as I have mentioned, generally, we are doing it in a very responsible way. If we had been an irresponsible Government, we would have just come in and abolish FRA, like what you did to PWD, resulting in hundreds of technical people who are needed by the country who are just out there, and we do not know where they are.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Go to NEC:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> The other thing we do not know about is the $8.6 million worth of equipment, I do not know where they are. We are doing it in an incremental structured responsible way, so that whatever we do complements rather than duplicates. I do not want to repeat basic management. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my simple question to the honourable Minister is, where are we heading and what are we doing? If we read past reports by ADB and World Bank, it talks about reducing cost to government and those that can be taken by the private sector has to be outsourced. Where are we heading? My simple question to the honourable Minister is, when PWD is fully established, you have not given a timeline. What will be the overall cost to Government (taxpayers of this country)? Again, it goes back to my question, there were so many reports in the past about outsourcing, what can be done by the private sector so that we minimise cost to Government? MR. SPEAKER.- What the honourable Minister was stating in his earlier reply was that, you were looking at streamlining and having a system where both FRA and PWD are going to be brought together but the timing and all that, that is still left to the Government to come up with. Honourable Minister, the question now raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he raised one very important point, the participation of the private sector because basically, they brought in the private sector to replace PWD. One good example is what happened at FRA, where we have looked at the accounts and did a special audit. That was $400 million which was expended through questionable decisions. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That was revealed by special audit. The other issue with the private contractors, if you look at them, the one which was engaged by FijiFirst, nearly all of them were contributing to the FijiFirst campaign. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Oh!</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>350</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- When they are talking about the recommendation by World Bank, ADB or IMF to move to the private sector, as a developing country, we need to really assess that properly. We need to have the right balance.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> What number? (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- What Order?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Standing Order 60 – Relevance.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, what the honourable Minister should refrain from doing is point fingers at contractors, et cetera, because companies do not contribute to political parties, it is individuals that do that. So, please, do not point fingers at contracting companies because they are not involved with political parties, it is individuals who contribute to it. I think he should withdraw what he just said. MR. SPEAKER.- I think my answer to your Point of Order, honourable Koya, is that he is just making a grand statement here regarding the contributions and all from individuals who are also part of companies. I take that as just a general statement. But, again, if you want to continue to point fingers at people who are participating in campaigning and all that for political parties, please, you either name the individuals - that is their freedom, or the company that they are representing, and you have to have evidence. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I note that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Member. What I was saying was in terms of what was raised by the Opposition, the participation of the private sector to replace a government entity. What we, on this side of Parliament, are saying is that, that was the wrong decision because in terms of cost, it was quite astronomical. Was there was any cost benefit analysis properly conducted - the cost of engaging the private sector against the cost of keeping PWD? That is the fundamental question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That would involve a really good study. Honourable Usamate was saying, “when, when?” But we do not want to repeat the same mistake by bringing wholesome the PWD back to replace and remove everything that was there. We need to have the right balance. (Hon. J. Usamate interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, I may have said that but as a Minister...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> So you lied? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- … I need to move forward in a responsible way in terms of taxpayer funds. We need to have the right balance to complement rather than duplicate. That is the fundamental issue here. For example, in CWM Hospital, a lot of repairs that were done by private carpenters were not up to the standard because the monitoring was not done by the relevant section of PWD, which used to do it. That is something we need to have there, to have a more effective delivery by the private sector. I am not against the private sector, but there needs to be a right balance, moving forward. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, and I hope that I am going to get a short answer. In terms of what you have just philosophised now, and</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>351 in terms of the future of PWD and FRA, in short, you will not be engaging private contractors any more to do any work with respect to PWD and FRA? MR. SPEAKER.- That is the question being raised. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That is not correct. We will continue to work towards the right balance, both private sector and public sector, for cost effectiveness and responsible use of taxpayer funds. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. He has been educating all of us in this Parliament. He even came up with that idea of, ‘they are not driving, they are operators, so they have to be taught the right way to do that’. Ever since he became the Minister, I have noticed that he starts on the defensive, then he moves slowly to answering the questions because may be, he is from the province of the gift of the gab. (Laughter) Assistance to Cane Farmers and Cane Harvesting Co-operatives (Question No. 07/2024) HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on how the Ministry is assisting farmers and cane harvesting co-operatives to prepare their harvesters and personnel for the crushing season? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question by the honourable Pillay and thank him for his continued observation of the sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is committed to supporting farmers and cooperatives in optimising their operations and ensuring that we have a successful harvest this season, despite the many challenges that we have in the industry, such as the impacts of climate change, aged infrastructure, mills and shortage of manpower. As per my Ministry’s operational plan, we have, so far, implemented several initiatives in assisting farmers and cooperatives in preparing their mechanical harvesters and cane cutters for crushing. Firstly, we have been actively assisting cooperatives that intend to bring in operators for their harvesters from India by facilitating letters of support to the Department of Immigration. This initiative enables the cooperative to bring in harvester operators and technicians from India to address the shortage of skilled people to operate harvesters within the season. In addition to facilitating the importation of skilled labour, my Ministry has recognised the ongoing skilled labour shortage in the agriculture sector, especially during the harvesting season. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative to note that the labour shortage extends beyond the sugar industry and represents a nationwide challenge too, basically in almost all skilled areas of our manpower needs. I am also an employer and I know these problems first hand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken steps to engage with India and Bangladesh, to address these issues by sourcing workers for our farmers. Recently, a strategic partnership was established between the Sugar Cane Growers Council and the Anchor Care Global Migration Consultant Limited to bring in foreign workers from Bangladesh to benefit not only the sugar industry, but also broader the agriculture sector.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>352</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has collaborated with the Fiji Corrections Service from a Memorandum of Agreement under the Yellow Ribbon Project, engaging our inmates to harvest sugarcane, particularly in the hilly terrain where mechanical harvesters have limitations. This has alleviated some of the burden of the farmers in the hilly areas where the current mechanical harvesters are not able to operate and to also assist farmers with other cane cutters. This year, we are planning to engage 120 inmates in harvesting sugarcane for the 2024 season as per the Memorandum of Agreement. Recognising the need of mechanised harvesting in the hilly terrain, the Ministry has procured equipment and machines to the Fiji Sugar Corporation for this purpose. These machines will undergo trial during the harvesting season and if successful, will acquire additional harvesters to assist farmers in the hilly terrain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has also allocated funds for the procurement of 42 additional cage bins. These bins will support mechanical harvesting and decrease transportation expenses from the distant areas of Lautoka Mill and Labasa Mill. This investment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to facilitate the transportation of additional 20,000 tonnes of cane. Regarding direct support for the farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have allowed that the farmers receive a third cane payment of $2,314 without any deduction, while the next cane payment will be in May, just in time for the next crushing season begins. For the first time in our history, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the establishment of the sugar industry, the Government had implemented $1 per tonne payment for all manual harvesting to incentivise production and yield to further support the farmers. This measure has brought relief to our farmers who have to harvest cane manually. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in acknowledgment of the incentive of increased protection, a reward of $5 per tonne has been distributed to all farmers who have increased their production in 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative, historically, is strategically structured to alleviate financial burden of cane farmers and enhance cash flow, creating a conducive environment for the optimum of crops. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I would like to assure the honourable Member that we have fully prepared ourselves for the crushing season and we will make sure that this year’s crushing becomes very smooth flowing. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. Most of the cane harvesters have gone past their warranty period and the repair and maintenance is very costly due to the high price of parts and spares. Also, most of the harvesters are very old and those need to be replaced in the near future. What is the Ministry doing to assist financially to mitigate the high cost and what support will be there to replace the old harvesters with new machines? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very mindful that the machines are getting old and the parts are very expensive. However, our Ministry has done some submissions for the next budget so that we can assist the farmers. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in regards to the mitigation of manual harvesting cost. It is quite known that the manual harvesting price is regulated but the manual harvesting cost is not - it is quite intensive and expensive.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>353 Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe a bit of a background before I ask my question. On 7th April, 2024, the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry said and quote, “…Fiji is looking at bringing in more Bangladeshi nationals”. Sir, it goes out to show that the Ministry has failed to promote new sugarcane farmers and Fijian people to the sugar industry. (Hon. M. S. N. Kamikamica interjects) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, how is the honourable Minister working towards mitigating the manual harvesting cost with the increase of VAT and their recently announced National Minimum Wages that will go up because that is not regulated? Can farmers expect the price of sugarcane tonne to even go up? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just answered that we are getting Bangladeshi workers because our local workers are not interested to work, so what is wrong with that. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, the idea is this, recently I had brought in nine workers from Bangladesh. Now, by them being on the farm, the locals are now watching and the time will come again. I am telling you, they are doing a better job on the cane farms. So, as far as mitigation is concerned, yes, everyone has to bear the cost. The answer to your last question is, you surely will expect a better price for cane this year. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of mechanical investors is good but there are some teething issues as well. My simple question to the honourable Minister is the issue of drivers and technicians that do look after the machines. How is this being handled by the Ministry? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for your information, I was the first importer of harvester in Fiji. My harvester is still running well because they are maintaining it, we are maintaining it, and putting oil at the right time. Secondly, as far as the workers are concerned, there are technicians who have come from India and they are beside the farmers, on harvesters as well and even the operators. So, yes, those who have imported harvesters have managed to bring their own operators, but the supply of harvesters, they have technicians on the ground. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister, why is training not organised locally for our local people to operate our harvesters? A lot of people could be trained to operate harvesters. Why is the Ministry of Sugar, together with FSC, not organising and providing training to our locals? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have only been here for 1½ years but they have been in Government for 18 years, why did they not train them? (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, that was the last supplementary question that I was going to allow. Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch, and we will resume at 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.38 p.m.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>354</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, I would like to acknowledge, once again, another group who are out there in the gallery - another group of PL100 students from the University of the South Pacific. I hope I am correct that they are also doing law. We welcome you to your Parliament and I hope that you will learn more about the proceeding of Parliament and that relates to what you are studying at the University. We wish you well. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now proceed to the eighth Oral Question for today. Strategic Measures to Address Outdated Education Curriculum (Question No. 08/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the strategic measures that the Ministry is taking to address the issue of outdated education curriculum? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the question. Concerns have been expressed that our curriculum is outdated and irrelevant, not reflective of the needs of a modern society. Our Ministry believes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that to some degree, it is relevant, however, to improve the teaching, resources need to be reviewed to capture new emerging concepts, such as the Artificial Intelligence (AI), the 7Rs and the 3Rs, which is Reduce, Reuse and Recycle; the Blue Pacific concept of regional approach for resilient region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity that ensures opposite peoples can lead, free, healthy and productive lives and gender equity, to name a few. Hence, we acknowledge that it needs to change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that our Fiji citizens, who have graduated through our education system are quite marketable and are in demand abroad. Our neighbouring countries continue to provide incentives and attractive packages to lure our citizens which is proof that our curriculum, for the most part, is up to par with the knowledge and skillsets needed in a global market. Globally, we are competitive, we are succeeding and, however, the key now is to ensure that we continue to do so within our resources and in line with the strategic direction for the National Development Plan and SDG4, that no one is left behind. Mr. Speaker, Sir, strategies have been implemented to ensure that the national curriculum remain relevant, culturally cognisant, technologically savvy and globally competitive. Students who acquire concepts from these outcome-based curriculum apply and reinforce these at home and in different parts of their lives. We say that every space that a child sets foot in, is a school. The home is a school, the church is a school, this august Parliament is a school, our playgrounds and our parks are all schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our outcome-based curriculum syllabi and all the archaic prescriptive output driven one, however, needs to be reviewed to embed that very new emerging issues, such as those I have highlighted earlier, including the global pandemic resilience skills, online learning platforms,</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>355 knowledge and innovative world of engineering and technology and at the same time, sustain our cultural heritage, moral and civic values and responsibility in the forever changing global trends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, past Administrations, including some of my colleagues across the floor instituted a top-down approach like, “I have woken up this morning and I want to change the curriculum.” Last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was part of the two days’ USP Graduation Sessions, and it was quite conspicuous that 95 percent of the graduates, who were conferred with undergraduate and post- graduate degree - information technology, maths, physics, financial management and forensic accounting, already did not have many iTaukei and I hate to bring this into Parliament. But I am stating something that I believe is unfair. Is this the result of a new life math curriculum that one of you people thought and introduced overnight? The interaction of Life Math may have influenced most iTaukei students to opt for it instead of the Pure Math, which all of us in this august Parliament learnt in school. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I witnessed got me thinking over this weekend because of our forefathers used celestial spheres or coordinates in their inter-island travel, our grandmothers used geometry for weaving maths and metrics when they made salt or pottery, math has been part of our culture. But to have Life Math as an easy way out has a huge impact on the future of opportunities in terms of scholarships, eligibility criteria for STEM job opportunities from aviation, engineering, maths, science, including financial management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unforgiveable to create a new subject without much research and global benchmarking, nor contributions from maths experts in our tertiary institutions, and two streams of maths have been shoved down the Curriculum Unit for senior secondary school students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, honourable Members of the Opposition are fully aware that they even disallowed the monitoring of the implementation of the curriculum at school level. This led to a huge disconnect between those developing the curriculum and the implementation of the curriculum by our teachers. Teachers have limited training on the teaching curricula which is to deliver the new invented subjects, thus impeding teaching and learning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make matters worse, the Curriculum Unit was downsized from 60 Officers to 19. As a result of this, some of the curriculum specialists were sent back to school during the restructure of 5 th October, 2020. The restructure altered the roles of the curriculum officers. The above roles became highly taxing in many aspects, as one officer was expected to handle the tasks of two or three curriculum officers. For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the restructure, one primary curriculum officer took charge of Elementary Science for Year 1 to Year 4, Basic Science for Year 5 to Year 8, and Healthy Living for Year 1 to Year 8, and for the secondary curriculum specialist, for Year 9 to Year 13. Again, one sole officer was expected to look after three subjects, as well for maths for Year 9 and Year 10, Life Math for Year 11 to Year 13, Pure Maths for Year 11 to Year 13 and Physics for Year 11 to Year 13, along with preparation of national examination papers. It was quite a load, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was quite inconsiderate and, in many ways, modern slavery, and had, unfortunately, taken its toll on the health and wellbeing of my officers. I am saddened that with additional unnecessary work pressure, one of the Curriculum Specialists passed on in February, and another will be buried tomorrow, while two are still under doctor’s observations.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>356</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the heavy workload of the Curriculum Unit, we struggled with recruitment from January 2024 for another 17 additional officers, along with a Director and another Principal Education Officer, to be reinstated for much-needed professional ease for the Curriculum Unit to function effectively. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stated in this august Parliament with confidence that my capable, qualified and competent Curriculum Specialists have already begun the necessary work and the scoping within and across the key learning areas from Early Childhood Education (ECE) to Year 13 based on the correct curriculum perspectives that underpin the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) which are considered crucial to a broad and holistic curriculum framework to identify curriculum gaps. These include careers, citizenship, education for sustainable development, literacy, numeracy, special aids, spiritual and values education. These important perspectives are integrated across the curriculum to ensure meaningful and lifelong learning takes place in each student’s life journey. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry ensures that curriculum content is culturally relevant and inclusive, representing diverse perspectives and experiences. The curriculum is designed to be flexible and enables our Fiji citizens to adapt to changes in society, technology and industry trends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Curriculum Development Unit has been revamped. Work has begun in the right direction from the core function of curriculum review which involves working with the teachers in evaluating and identifying the curriculum gaps through hybrid workshop modes to national examination work preparations for Years 8, 12, and 13. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after 18 long years, the Ministry of Education held its National Education Summit whereby a framework titled the “ 2023 Denarau Declaration ” was formulated, which has the guidelines on the way forward for the curriculum and education sector for the next 10 years. The recommendations of the 2023 National Education Summit and Cabinet endorsement for the formation of the new Education Commission are interconnected and complementary in their efforts to review and improve the education sector and its curriculum being a critical component. The new Education Commission will contribute valuable insights and perspectives to the global education discourse and will also consult and make recommendations on the seven thematic areas and these includes enhancing our curriculum in terms of content, design, teaching, pedagogies and relevant types of assessments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I certainly believe in the potential of education to offer a pathway out of our current challenges, and the review of the curriculum framework will ensure that our children have the right skills and competencies to take on the challenges and opportunities of global trends. I plead with you and Members of this august Parliament to partner with us as the national curriculum review is a critical aspect of the transformation of our education system that will benefit our children and the future of our beloved Fiji. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, the honourable Minister was all over the place. The question was rather simple. He could have presented it as a Ministerial Statement, but he is so confused. That is why we need a change in the Minister. (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the way it was presented as if no work was done. Global partnership in education where we had already sought $1 million to get the work done, but here we have a Minister who does not know what he is doing or what he is saying. My question is, if you want a curriculum update, you need to work with Fiji’s National Curriculum Framework. Is</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>357 the Curriculum Framework done or not? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have highlighted that the Framework is being developed and as we all know, new things have happened - 2023 Denarau Declaration, the Education Commission, which was never considered by them all these years. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, the honourable Minister’s response has confused me. (Laughter) He was all over the place; very confusing. My question, Sir, which approach will the Ministry of Education take to review the curriculum? (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- As you may know, in the 2023 Denarau Declaration there are seven thematic areas and I have highlighted them in my speech, so that covers what needs to be done to take education forward. This is what you did not do, you did not have a summit, you did not have an Education Commission, so the confusion is on their side. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- I highlighted the Curriculum Unit used to have 60 officers. I believe he was in HR and he brought it down to 17, Mr. Speaker. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- What hope have we got? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister,. It is good that we have a curriculum developed and congratulations to those who were involved. But the question is, in terms of the training management cycle, it is one thing to have a curriculum, it is one thing to conduct a training but one of the most important components is training validation. How is the Ministry prepared to do the validation so that it can feed back into the system, particularly on labour demand?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Part of the process:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Wait, wait!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, that is all part of the process.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is asking the obvious:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.:</span> May I just add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of training providers that we have today is producing the number of people who need to fill in the gaps that have occurred over the last couple of months. We now have training providers at village level, even at tertiary level,</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 358 providing short courses. That is a highly educated and skilled citizenry in Fiji. I was at the graduation ceremony for Pacific Polytech last week in Nabua. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 443 young people graduated with their certificates and now they are skilled people and are entering the workforce. Most of them now come under the auspices of some of the hotels in Fiji. We train, they get recognised and the proof in the pudding is where they can join the workforce and they are.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Official Overseas Trips – Ministers and Assistant Ministers (Question No. 09/2024) HON.
