<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, all those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking an interest in your Parliament. On the same token, I welcome the students from the University of the South Pacific enrolled in the PL100 Unit. Welcome to your Parliament and I hope that you will learn more about the proceedings of your Parliament. Back to Office Report – 28 th Session of the Conference of the Parties The Back to Office Report for the 28 th Session of the Conference of the Parties better known as COP 28 which was held in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates is now available in the Library, for your perusal and reference.</p><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents</h4><p>325 Newly Elected Chairperson - Standing Committee on Natural Resources For the information of honourable Members, the newly elected Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources is the honourable Tomasi T. Tunabuna and the newly elected Deputy Chairperson is the honourable Jone Usamate. I congratulate the two Members for the duration of their tenure. Resolutions - Business Committee Honourable Members, at the Business Committee meeting held on Thursday, 11 th April, 2024, there were deliberations on the existing workload of the Standing Committees and further deliberations focused on the Chairmanship and Deputy of the Standing Committees. At this juncture, please, be informed that the honourable Prime Minister has agreed to the review of the Chairmanship and Deputy, and should there be any changes, this will be announced accordingly. From today through to Thursday, we will have debates on the pending Committee Reports, and to ensure that parliamentary time is utilised well, I am putting the Whips on notice to coordinate on their number of speakers, as well as the allocated speaking times. Finally, as I had announced in the March Sitting, Parliament is now fully equipped to continue with the broadcasting of the vernacular translations. You would have noted the timers on the wall. That will be programmed accordingly to the speaking times that are provided on your tables. So, when you notice a signal coming from the clocks on the wall, that is your time to round off and resume your seat. The Speaker will be making a ruling from the Chair.</p></body>
