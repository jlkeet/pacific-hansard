<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make</p><h4>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:</h4><p>1. Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport; and 2. Minister for Agriculture and Waterways The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. Water Sector 2050 Strategy HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery and those who are listening in nationally; I am pleased to stand today to brief this esteemed Parliament on Fiji’s first National Water Sector Strategy officially launched as the Water Sector 2050 Strategy earlier this month in the presence of all our major development partners. Before I delve into the document, I would like to stress on the profound significance of the Water Sector 2050 Strategy, as the roadmap for climate resilient and equitable water and sanitation service provision for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Water Sector 2050 highlights the Coalition Government’s robust commitment to address water and sanitation issues that continue to affect so many of our citizens. As I stand here, I note the difference between 16 years of previous Government versus just 16 months of this Coalition Government. In 16 years, Sir, under the rule of those opposite, our water sector endured sheer neglect. They had no plan and, at worse, they continued to reduce Water Authority of Fiji’s much needed capital budget. In just 16 months, this Government has worked with all segments of the Fijian society with our development partners with the renewed focus to restore the water sector. The Water Sector 2050 Strategy is our plan to deliver on that vision. Mr. Speaker, Sir, soon after my appointment as a Minister for Public Works, I was briefed by the Water Authority of Fiji’s Executive Team on the state of the water infrastructure the Coalition Government inherited from the previous Government. It was obvious to me at that very moment that we cannot get out of the mess that we have inherited by doing more of the same and keep on doing more of the same as the FijiFirst Government, which was the ad hoc reactive strategy. As of the first task, we appointed a skills-based Board with the right experience and qualifications, to lead the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF). I tasked the new Board and the Executive to urgently develop a Strategic Action Plan to improve water and sanitation for all Fijians. I must</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>327 commend the Chairman of the Water Authority of Fiji Board, Ratu Savenaca Seniloli, for his leadership in making the Water Sector 2050 Strategy a reality. I would like to quote the honourable Prime Minister’s speech, included in the Water Strategy’s Foreword, “This plan is more than just a blueprint for development, it is a promise to prioritise developing of our people. It is a call to action for collaboration and cooperation across sectors and communities.” Significantly, the Coalition Government is not planning for its survival in four years, but is planning for the next three decades, irrespective of who is in government. We are not here for political survival, but we are here for the people. Mr. Speaker, collaboration and cooperation has been the hallmark or process that WAF followed in developing the Strategy. This included consultation with major development partners through an ideation workshop which kick started the journey. The workshop formed the basis for the national debate during the National Economic Summit in April 2023. This was followed with consultation workshops in Suva, Nadi and Labasa, reaching out to WAF customers and all stakeholders. The Strategy outlines Fiji’s Water Sector Priority Projects and Programmes over the next three decades, aimed at transforming our services are delivered, responding to climate vulnerability, renewing our aging water and wastewater infrastructure, contributing to the succulent economy, enhancing the national environment. Sir, with the support from our key development partners such as UNDP, World Bank and Asian Development Bank, WAF was able to carry out extensive research, rigorous stakeholder consultation and obtained innovative expert insights. It is, therefore, a direct product of the first ever collective planning exercise that united stakeholders from the public sector, private sector, tourism, NGOs, academia, development partners, as well as citizens. The document is not just a list of priority projects and investments, it is a shared vision for water and sanitation in Fiji. I would like to seek the indulgence of Parliament as I highlight some key investment priorities in the Water Sector 2050 Strategy. It identifies that $3.5 billion is required over the next three decades to improve the water infrastructure. Half of this investment is earmarked for improving asset health, in other words, $1.75 billion is needed to renew Fiji’s new water infrastructure assets that now need replacement, as they are nearing the end of their life. I would like to reiterate in this august Parliament that the direct result of 16 years of under investment is resulting in current disruptions and inefficiencies. Just in the long Easter weekend, we experienced a double whammy of climate change and aging infrastructure. As honourable Members are aware, continuous heavy rainfall caused a landslide rupturing the bulk water pipeline to Tamavua. It resulted in thousands of citizens with no access to water. Such impacts of climate change now regularly affect our provision of reliable drinking water. It is exactly why the Strategy identifies critical water assets that now need to be upgraded with robust climate resilient design. I previously informed Parliament in my earlier water updates that our water supply system currently loses around 47 percent of the total clean water produce. Nationally, the WAF Team is responding to over 125 pipe leak breaks for every 100 kilometres of water pipelines. I would like to point out to those sitting opposite that water assets are not magic pudding, they need maintenance and renewal. Therefore, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy calls for significant urgent investments. Sir, the Strategy adopts a hub-and-spoke model for extending piped water supply to areas currently not serviced by WAF. This model will rely on investing in building water treatment plants</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>328</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 in larger population than just creating water treatment hubs, water catchments and reservoirs. As population in the adjoining areas would grow, pipelines will be extended to connect the hubs. Some of the key identified projects moving forward are as follows: • • • In the Northern Division, water treatment hubs in Labasa, Seaqaqa, extension from Savusavu, Nabouwalu water treatment hubs to other population centres; In the Western Division, hubs in Matovo, Keiyasi, Nadarivatu and extension of networks from areas around Nadi. In the Central Division, hubs in Wainadoi and Navua with extension networks in surrounding areas and, of course, additional reservoirs in strategic locations as mentioned. Sir, let me focus on wastewater and sanitation aspects of the Strategy. These requires or identifies a dire need of $5 billion in investments, including infrastructure and management. The complete and utter neglect of wastewater over the last 16 years is nowhere more obvious than in the wastewater infrastructure. The previous Government developed Fiji’s National Development Plan 2017-2036 and that Plan promised that they would ensure improved sanitation, promising 78 percent of the population will have access to centralised sewage system by 2036. Sir, as of today, only 17 percent of urban residential customers have access to sewage sanitation infrastructure, a staggering 78 percent of residents rely on septic systems. However, Fiji currently has no infrastructure in place to receive and treat septic faecal sludge from the systems. The current state of wastewater infrastructure suggests that while the previous Government had developed the National Development Plan, they were not serious about investing in wastewater infrastructure. The WAF’s 11 out of 11 wastewater treatment plants do not have the capacity to effectively treat wastewater they receive, they are well over-capacity. One of the strategic pillars underpinning the Water Sector 2050 Strategy is environment and tourism nexus. Sustainable tourism development is heavily dependent on healthy and pristine rivers and beaches. The wastewater services need to be urgently upgraded to ensure healthy rivers and beaches into which treated affluent is often discarded. Collaboration with our development partners is critical to develop the urgent upgrade of WAF’s aging wastewater infrastructure to ensure environmental compliance. On that front, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Wastewater Sector Strategy identifies upgrade works to the Kinoya Wastewater Treatment Plant as number one priority, and further discussions and progress is being made with our development partners. Sir, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy has given the current Coalition Government or those who will be coming after us, let me emphasise, coming after us, it does not have to be us, so we are forward looking and not for our political survival, with a structured roadmap to implement. To develop vision of this Strategy, we need to work together and look beyond one term parliamentary politics. Water infrastructure by definition requires long term thinking, and I urge the honourable Members on both sides to familiarise themselves with this document and committing for us to work together to making it a reality. I would like to end by noting that this Coalition Government has already made some tough decisions to save the Fijian economy. The Water Sector 2050 Strategy now provides us with an opportunity to invest in this critical essential service with a significant multiplier effect to strengthen the economy even further. A total investment need of $8.5 billion is, indeed, a sobering number. It</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>329 is obvious that the entire amount cannot be afforded by public sector investment. Asset upgrades for climate resilience will be suitable for seeking climate finance, which is what we are pursuing at the moment. At the same time, public-private sector partnership opportunities, especially in wastewater, will be explored. Our development partners like the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and World Bank, who have been part of this Water Sector 2050 Strategy, will also play a key role. Unlike our predecessors, this Coalition Government understands that water infrastructure needs investment and we will not shy away from making tough decisions in moving forward. We also understand that a financially viable WAF will be critical for delivering on the Water Sector Strategy. The financial model needs to be re-examined, there needs to be reduced dependency on public sector grants, which will give the WAF more autonomy and financial viability, which is something we envisage in the not too distant future. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to very briefly speak on the Water Sector Strategy for 2050 and I congratulate Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) for taking it to the next step. It is the height of naivety for this Government to imagine that just because it came into being that this Water Sector Strategy actually came in. The formulation of this was something that was already in place, so to try to take all the applause or credit for that, is really, really idiotic, to say the least. If you go back to the National Development Plan for 2017-2037, one of the major policy outcomes there is to come up with a next stage of the Water Strategy. That was part of the 2017- 2022 plan, so these things were already in motion… HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> …all these things that you are talking about.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> For 16 years, you did not have a strategy.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say, it is great that this is being done. I want to congratulate the WAF Board that was there before this current Board, and I think we have a very good team at WAF - Dr. Amit Chanan, Mr. Seru Soderberg and the Team. They have been very good at putting all these things together, then we have seen progress. When we had the 2017 Strategy, the access to clean water was only around 78 percent. From that time, it has gone up to 82 percent. The target that we had was to go up to 92 percent. There have been challenges because when you are talking about water, there is always the challenge of dealing with your own infrastructure and meeting your current needs. One of the problems that we have had over these past few years is the explosion of population into these greater Suva urban area. For the people at WAF, you always have to think, “Shall I use money just to replace the aging assets but also meet the current need?” HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- It took you eight years before you worked it up? HON. J. USAMATE.- Hang on, hang on! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Did you have a strategy for that? HON. J. USAMATE.- These things were in the process and we are glad to see that that is taking place.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>330</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tamavua Water Plant was built in 1961, the next one that came after that was Waila in 1982. The first government that used Green Climate Funds to deal with the biggest water problem that we have in Fiji was the FijiFirst Government that came up with the project. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. J. USAMATE.- That is something that is now in place in 2024. So, it shows the devotion of the FijiFirst Government at that time, to make sure that we can meet this need for water for everyone. Yes, that challenge is with sanitation with the treatment of wastewater, but there is a whole lot of other issues in that. It is not just about the plants, it is about the wrong stuff getting into the pipes - stormwater, wastage from the various factories and commercial areas, all of these things had to be addressed. I must say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate WAF. The honourable Minister now is riding on the horse that was already moving before he got there. The saddle was there, the stirrups were there, and he has gone hullabaloo saying, “We did it all along.” So, thank you, WAF, and we look forward. By the way, honourable Minister, it is not a plan, it is just a strategy. After this, you have to develop a plan. There is a difference between a strategy and a plan. A plan is what your actual target is. If you go to the National Development Plan (NDP), you will see the specific targets that were there for 2017 to 2022. I wish the honourable Minister well because the people of this country need water. There has been no Government in the annals of Fiji’s history that has done as much for water as the FijiFirst Government. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! MR. SPEAKER.- It is great to listen to these kinds of positive speeches where even the Opposition are praising the Board of the current Water Authority of Fiji. That is quite pleasant to hear, and I only hope we continue that way. Drainage Plans for Farmers and Reinstatement of Drainage Board HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, those in the gallery and those watching the live telecast; I rise to make a statement on the state and progress of the drainage plans for farmers in the Western, Central and Northern Divisions, and the reinstatement of the Drainage Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the importance of Fiji’s waterways, historically and currently, cannot be over-emphasized. Our major rivers and streams and creeks have sustained our people’s livelihoods as a means of transportation, source of food and supply of the much-needed water. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we take good care of our waterways, such that there is less pollution, erosion, dumping of household garbage, plastic bottles, containers and bags, these same waterways can be transformed into what it used to look like historically, and re-used as a means of transportation and livelihood for the majority of our population. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make clear that the Waterways Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is specifically tasked with de-silting the main waterways which includes our major rivers and main drains within the drainage scheme areas. It is important to note that the</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>331 maintenance of farm drains that discharge into these main drains falls under the care of individual farmers. Rest assured that the wellbeing of our farmers who play a crucial role in our community remains a primary focus for us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has taken significant steps to recognize the importance of drainage and protecting farmlands and wellbeing and reducing flood risks. As part of this effort, FJ$1.5 million has been allocated to the drainage of farmland areas through the Hire of Machinery Programme in the Ministry budget for this financial year. This initiative is a fundamental part of the Ministry’s strategy to tackle the impacts of flooding in farmland areas, including the Sigatoka valley. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also initiated several proactive measures through the Programme mentioned above to improve drainage infrastructure in agricultural areas. These initiatives involve maintaining current main drains, including building new ones, installing suitable water management systems and enforcing soil conservation activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the Ministry has effectively addressed requests from farmers by utilising the hire of machinery contracts with civil contracting companies in the Sigatoka area to perform the desilting of 24.2 kilometres of main drains and ensure sustainability of farmland in the valley. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of now, the Drainage for Farmland Areas Programme has effectively cleared 69.3 kilometres of primary drains in the Western Division, assisting approximately 295 farmers. However, there are still around 380 kilometres of drainage awaiting completion which, once finished, will bring benefits to more than 1,000 farmers. Additionally, the Ministry will conduct 233 kilometres and 262 kilometres of drain excavation and desilting works in the Northern and Central Divisions respectively, assisting approximately 1,158 farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is committed to tackling drainage issues in all active agricultural producing areas with the view to strengthening the resilience of our farming communities. Clearing of the main drains through desilting will promote better water flow and minimise the chances of localised flooding during periods of heavy rain in the short-term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is collaborating with the Ministry of Sugar and the Drainage Board, to ensure that all main drains connected to sugarcane growing areas are maintained. The Ministry machines are currently being utilised to upgrade farm access roads, and to maintain main drains in the sugarcane growing areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministry staff have also had meetings with their counterparts from Municipalities and the National Disaster Management Office on the state of drains that come under the Municipalities and how those drains are contributing to blockages from irresponsible garbage disposal. Municipalities currently do not have a budget for clearing and maintaining drains, so the Ministry will work closely with the Ministry of Local Government on how this can be accommodated under the current budget. We need to consult on future budgeting with the Ministry of Local Government for the maintenance of drains under the Municipalities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also main drains connected to drains that fall under the jurisdiction of the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), which are also in need of timely maintenance and clearing, to ensure necessary water flow. The Ministry is collaborating with the FRA to identify these drains and work with them to ensure that these drains are cleared in a timely manner.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>332</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the complaints received through my Office and the Waterways Division, it is evident that the abolition of the Drainage Board seven years ago has significantly contributed to majority of the problems relating to blocked drains and flooding that we face now, which has led to negligence of drainage infrastructure, with total neglect of the collapsed floodgates and clogged main drains during that period. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to inform this august Parliament that during my participation in the 2023-2024 National Budget debate, I had discussed and proposed the re-establishment of the Drainage Board. I am grateful for the support of the Coalition Government in passing the Drainage (Amendment) Act 2023, which enabled the reinstatement of the Drainage Board in Fiji. Just a few days ago, on 11 th April, the Ministry formally welcomed and inducted 35 new members to the Drainage Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rationale for introducing the Drainage Board is based on its crucial function in maintaining designated drains throughout the Northern, Central and Western Divisions. These drains encompass essential structures such as turbine, seawalls, access roads, culvert crossings, main drains and outfall structures including flood gates, flap gates and spillways. With a combined total value reaching into the millions, these projects primarily benefit both, sugarcane and non-sugar agricultural land. Acknowledging the crucial impact that efficient drainage systems have on farming, environmental protection and mitigating disaster risks, highlights the necessity of reviving the Drainage Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consequences of the abolition taken seven years ago led to the elimination of sanctioned drainage schemes under the previous Administration, creating unplanned development which converted land that had approved drainage schemes into residential subdivisions. The increase in rural-urban migration resulted in most of these unplanned development and expansion of residential subdivisions, which impacted both, sugarcane and non-sugar cane farmers in Fiji. As a result, the re-established Drainage Board is confronted with a daunting task of meeting these diverse demands from the sector to mitigate drainage issues, and to ensure efficient water management by all parties involved. Acting within my capacity as Minister responsible, as I had alluded to, members of the Drainage Board have been appointed and each Board will comprise of a chairman, a secretary and an engineer from the Waterways Division. This ensures a comprehensive representation and the availability of technical expertise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through collaborative efforts, a Standard Operating Procedure is formulated, ensuring a streamline process for addressing grievances from the farmers, stakeholders and the public. This framework will enable a smooth transfer of relevant information to the Waterways Division and the Drainage Board for timely maintenance and mitigation actions, promoting transparency and responsibility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our pursuit to improve service delivery, we are committed to tackling not just the drainage problems in the Sigatoka Valley, but also to address farmland drainage issues across Fiji. These issues can be achieved through the ongoing Drainage for Farmland Programme within the Waterways Division. The aim is to bolster resilience, safeguard livelihoods and ensure success and sustainability of our agriculture sector in the face of evolving climatic conditions. Moreover, the re-establishment of the Drainage Board will complement the Ministry’s efforts to address the various issues and obstacles impacting farmers and stakeholders in Fiji.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>333 Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I plead to all users of our national waterways, whether it be our major rivers, streams, creeks or main drains - let us act responsibly to keep them clean. Please, refrain from dumping household garbage into our waterways, as these can cause unnecessary blockage that leads to unnecessary flooding and contributes to unforeseen hardships within our communities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. To begin with, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways for the appointment of the Drainage Board. I hope these Boards are not just a setup but has good tooth to bite with and would love to see some work done by them. The FijiFirst Government had a reason for abolishing the Drainage Board. Previously, these Boards only looked after their own areas and were not concentrating on the holistic approach. For example, if a Board in Lakena is appointed, they will only look at the drainage in Lakena. What it does to the water or drainage in the other areas, whether it gets flooded or not, is not their concern. That is why the Ministry of Waterways was set up, to look at the holistic approach and that was what we were doing. The setting up of the Drainage Board is duplication of duties - we have the Ministry of Waterways and then we have the Drainage Board. Is the Ministry not capable of doing its own work? HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is why flooding is everywhere:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- The management of fresh water is also a key part of the drainage system:</span> So, is this Drainage Board which the honourable Minister has very proudly set up, will be involved in the management of waterways and the freshwater system? Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1.5 million has been allocated for drainage in this financial year and the honourable Minister has said that they have done substantial amount of drainage in the Western Division, and he is planning to do some in the Central and Eastern Divisions. However, he failed to mention the Northern Division. What is being done in the Northern Division? Are people there not requiring drainage solutions? Farms in Soasoa always get flooded with seawater during heavy rain and nothing has been done about that. I would have loved to see a holistic approach where all the areas are taken into consideration. On the drainage waterways, where is the demarcation of boundaries? There is town council drains, road drains, FSC drains and there is agricultural drains. Will the Drainage Board look after all these drains, or is the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways going to look after the other areas and the Drainage Board is only looking after the rural and agricultural drains? I see a lot of duplication of duties. I do not see a holistic approach, and setting up of the Drainage Board is just a promise being fulfilled by the Coalition Government. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Holistic approach brought you nothing! HON. S. NAND.- It is just a promise that is being fulfilled. It is creating jobs for old supporters and cronies so that they can come and sit in the Board. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>334</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>15 th April, 2024 HON. S. NAND.- Time will tell if they have tooth to bite. Time will tell if waterways in this country has improved. Let me remind Parliament, especially the Government side, that no government either previously or now, has done as much as the FijiFirst Government has done in terms of drainage. (Hon. M. S. N. Kamikamica interjects) HON. S. NAND.- In 16 months, how much have you done? So, put your money where your mouth is and get the drains intact. Do not create boards just to show the public that you are doing duties. Get the drainage issues solved, get the flood issues resolved. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank the Opposition for their response and I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.34 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>15 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>335 The Parliament resumed at 11.07 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- On the next item on the Order Paper, the honourable Minister is not in Parliament so we will hold that question to his name and we shall continue. He will be given a chance to come back and reply.</p></body>
