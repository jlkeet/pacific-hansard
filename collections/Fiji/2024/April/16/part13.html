<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, before we proceed, please, take note that I have allowed Question No. 13/2024 to be asked later on as the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection has to attend an official event at this point in time. When she enters, we will allow that question to be asked of her.</p><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Development of Yawe to Lomati Road – Status &amp; Plan (Question No. 11/2024) HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament of the status and plan to complete the road that was initially developed to connect the southern end of Kadavu from Yawe to Lomati and to Daviqele? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to respond to the question raised by the honourable Member regarding the road connection from Yawe, Lomati and Daviqele on the southern end of Kadavu. This road project through the Fiji Roads Authority actually started in 2017 which involved the construction of a new 4.7 kilometre road along the Yawe District from Nakorovou to Naqalotu. This was completed in 2021 despite the effects of COVID-19 disruptions which had impacted on the logistics and schedules including movement of contractors, labour and material supply. The contract was awarded to Prem Civil Engineering Limited to upgrade the existing 9.7 kilometres road from Vunisea to Nabukelevu-i- Ra and the further construction of a new 4.7 kilometre road along the Yawe District for a total value of $5.3 million. The Government through the FRA is planning to progress with this new road development in the next phase from Naqalotu to Lomati which is approximately eight kilometres in length. Following this phase will be the road connecting from Lomati on the east coast to Daviqele on the south coast with additional 3.5 kilometres. These proposed rural developments are part of the current FRA Plan Scope which will involve investigation and detailed design of the new road alignment, the necessary details of works will include topographical survey and environmental and social safeguards including community consultations, geo-technical investigation and necessary costing of the whole construction works. These planned requisite activities are envisaged to commence in the next financial year. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Do you have a supplementary question, honourable Leader of the Opposition? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the question to the honourable Minister is, have you been to this place? You will need to understand the problems and the difficulties that</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>384</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 these people face. Kadavu is well-known for drug cultivation, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have issues on access, particularly the vanua because Tikina Nabukelevu is divided because of the villages that are on the other side. This project was between rural development, they were undertaking the road from the Daviqele side (from Nabale). They were already pursuing that. Forestry was already doing some logging in the area, they were doing some work in that as well. So, it is bringing the stakeholders together and sharing the cost because rural roads is about access, not so much about standards. Have you been there, honourable Minister, and hopefully you can have a better understanding of this? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, I note the request from the honourable Leader of the Opposition. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- So, have you been there, honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> No, but we are planning to visit; it is part of the plan.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MOU - Australia and Port Infrastructure Services (Question No. 12/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Australia and Port Infrastructure Services. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, most Members would be aware that the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Port Infrastructure and Services comes under the umbrella of the elevated Vuvale Partnership which was a great initiative continued by the FijiFirst Government and we have decided to continue with that. We signed the elevated part of it in October last year. It was signed between the Prime Minister of Australia, honourable Anthony Albanese and I. You may also recall, Madam Deputy Speaker that the Vuvale Partnership articulates our joint development priorities. The priorities are encapsulated under five pillars and they include: • • • • • Strengthening our people-to-people links; Enhancing our security cooperation; Deepening our economic relationship; Regional international cooperation; and Fostering closer institutional linkages in support of strong inclusive societies. In December of last year, our joint teams (the Office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Australian High Commission) agreed on a range of development priorities to be considered under the umbrella of the Vuvale Partnership which includes support in the development of our port facilities and service sector. The development and management of key infrastructure, in particular Fiji ports, is of utmost importance in light of the broader implications on connectivity, security and prosperity and is</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>385 therefore considered central to Fiji’s sovereignty. The MOU also implements the People’s Coalition Government’s commitment to revive the shipbuilding industry which also includes include shipwreck and maintenance. That is to support my vision for Fiji to become the hub of the Pacific as the major port of entry, transhipment port and provide services to the Pacific fishing fleets. In light of the ongoing geo-political competitions, the upgrading of our ports is in line with the Zone of Peace concept that we had proposed as a vision for the region. Earlier this year in March, Cabinet agreed to the proposed MOU on port infrastructure services which was to have been signed on 16th March, 2024 in Lautoka but because of the flooding we were experiencing here in Fiji, at the last moment, the Australian Team decided to give us time to recover and later on come. They were supposed to have come this week but as I have mentioned this morning, the mother of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Honourable Penny Wong, died yesterday so she could not come for that reason. Madam Deputy Speaker, the MOU outlines the framework for the preparation of proposed life investments into Fiji’s Port infrastructure and services as managed by the Fiji Ports Corporation Limited (FPCL). The FPCL manages the Ports of Suva, Lautoka, Levuka, Vuda, Malau, Rotuma and Wairiki. The MOU falls under the Australian Infrastructure Funding Facility (AIFF). The development of Fiji Ports will provide the necessary impetus to strengthen the local shipbuilding industry. Due consideration will also be given to skills development, with the aim to see benefits to the local industry. In the meantime, Madam Deputy Speaker, preparatory work on the feasibility study continues. We are grateful to Australia for its understanding and support and especially, for standing with Fiji in this important infrastructural work. Last month, I was in Perth to receive the Guardian Class Patrol Boat, RFNS Puamau, donated by the Australian Government. Further and as for grant financing, Madam Deputy Speaker, Australia is Fiji’s largest development partner, having provided more than AU$95 million or US$62 million in ODA in the 2022 to 2023 period. During the period 2019 to 2021, Australia provided US$306 million to Fiji. As the maritime State, it is critical that ports and related services are developed to international standards and maintained at that level. We look forward to cooperating with Australia in the development priority, as articulated in our Vuvale Partnership. HON. F. S. KOYA- I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his answer. Honourable Prime Minister, as you had rightfully spelt out, we are a hub in the Pacific, and it is a massive opportunity for us. But one of the most critical components with this transhipment hub, et cetera, and Australia has been a party to all of these, is biosecurity. My supplementary question is, has biosecurity formed a big component with respect to the development of our infrastructure because the problematic part with respect to being a transhipment hub, et cetera, has always been biosecurity? I am sure the honourable Minister for Trade would agree with me that it needs to, and seeing that Australia is such a huge trading partner with us and because we are transhipment hub, is biosecurity a component in this particular agreement, Sir? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it is a very important part of the whole development. Two weeks ago, we had a Biosecurity Workshop in Nadi where this was brought up and discussed very, very seriously by the participants. It was an international participation workshop. We are very, very mindful, not only of our concern but also the region, particularly in ensuring</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>386</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 that what we get from overseas ports allow for our own participation in the inspections at those ports of departure. Also, we will allow officers from those designation ports to be in Fiji to make sure that those that tranship through Fiji to their country as destination will also participate. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a simple question to the honourable Prime Minister. It is good that he is mentioning about the shipbuilding industry in Fiji and hope that this can be expedited because under the SVT Government, the ship building industry lost its stature in Fiji. So, the simple question is, when will this be reinstated? It is important for us as a maritime nation, the fishing industry has a lot of potential in terms of the services and even the Naval boats. We have been in discussion with Australia if this can be serviced here in Fiji rather than the half-life refit and others to be taken to Australia. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be surprised at how quickly we are going to bring this. Last week, we had two of our Permanent Secretaries looking at the Bataan Ship building Port and they came back with recommendations which will very soon be discussed in Cabinet. The last big ship that we built was the 73 metre vessel, MV Reef Endeavour, and it was a really good vessel. We would like to use those who had participated in the building of that, while they are still alive and are still capable, and quite a few of them are still there and are capable. They would be among the first to be recruited, as well as those who will be coming through the technical training - thanks to our Ministry of Education and the FNU, et cetera. Yes, I am sure before the end of this year, we will be discussing the implementation of the ship building industry. Update on the Relocation of Nabavatu Village (Question No. 14/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the progress of the relocation of Nabavatu Village? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I thank the honourable Member for this question. Before I provide an update on the Nabavatu Village Relocation Project, let me give you some background. The Nabavatu Village was critically affected by a geohazard event that shocked the community in January 2021, following TC Ana. As we all know, TC Ana, although was a Category 2 Cyclone, it happened in less than a month after Category 5 TC Yasa that also hit Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, the geohazard event in Nabavatu involved a series of land slumps, landslides, tensional cracks and associated ground displacements, which were experienced in the village. The tensional cracks identified at the hillside posed risks to more than 20 buildings, resulting from high rainfall, associated with poor surface drainage. The rainfall recorded in Dreketi at that time was around 309.5 millimetres, one of the highest rainfalls experienced during TC Ana. The amount of precipitation received at that time was a decadal one, one in a 10-year event. Seismic activity with a magnitude of 5.8 megabytes was also experienced. Structural damages such as cracks on walls, floors and pavements, including detachment of concrete slabs, tilting of buildings and movement of building foundations, were evident on standing buildings, including the church.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>387 Madam Deputy Speaker, following the event, taskforces were formed at divisional, district and village levels. The Commissioner for Northern Division was tasked to Chair the Divisional Taskforce, assisted by the Divisional Planning Officer. The District Taskforce was led by the Assistant District Officer Seaqaqa, while the Turaga Ni Koro of Nabavatu led the Village Taskforce Team. The reporting line was a top-down and bottom-up approach, to ensure information integrity and accountability. Madam Deputy Speaker, based on GPS and aerial mapping conducted by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources over the current village site in February 2021, it was revealed that the majority of the dwellings in the village were at high risk. According to a report by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, all buildings and houses located within the medium to high risk zones would need to be relocated as a precautionary measure for the villagers and community’s safety. The village, in its present condition, was considered not safe for future habitation, as there remained the risk of reoccurring geohazard event in the future. Madam Deputy Speaker, due to this geohazard event in 2021 and upon the advice from the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, the villagers of Nabavatu had to relocate to the Dreketi Assemblies of God Church compound, which is approximately one kilometre from the village site. The church compound has been the village’s temporary relocation site since the geohazard even in early 2021 and I believe most of us have seen the pictures of the tent village and that is exactly where it is. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to state, at the outset, that the Ministry is managing this relocation in alignment with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the Plan Relocation Guideline. This SOP was designed in alignment with the Interagency Standing Committee Framework for durable solutions for internally displaced persons. The document launched in March 2023, sets out a clear process for the assessment of communities who plan relocation. The SOP has embedded lessons learnt from the previous six relocation projects, to ensure future relocations improve on the gaps identified from previous projects. We thank the previous Administration for a lot of the work that was carried out on this. Madam Deputy Speaker, the SOP streamlines Government’s approach, ensuring strengthened coordination of departments involved in the various stages of relocation processes. The SOP also outlines processes for non-government partners to provide support where expertise and resources can be leveraged to assist Government’s efforts. The SOP is guided by the Climate Change Act 2021 and Climate Change Policy 2018-2030 and includes a comprehensive Risk Assessment Methodology to assess and rank the communities, providing justification for selection of a community. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Nabavatu Village relocation is the first in the country to adopt the new SOP on planned relocation. On progress todate, there are four phases to the project. Phase 1 is civil works which includes road access upgrade, drainage works and land clearing, which is in progress at the site. The Ministry of Public works and the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways are two agencies involved in this activity. The first payment tranche was released last month through our Climate Change Division, totalling $244,335.06, and the breakdown are as follows:</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>388</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 • • $191,055 was paid to the Ministry of Public Works; and $53,280 was paid to the Ministry of Waterways. An expected timeline of completion of Phase 1 is by 17 th May, 2024. Madam Deputy Speaker, scoping is in progress for the connection of service lines through Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) and Water Authority of Fiji (WAF). Once civil works are completed, EFL is to peg and provide quotations. The expected timeline is by 30th April, 2024, for Phase 2. The WAF quotation stands at $278,801. Once EFL quotations are obtained, a submission of Waiver of Tender will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for approval. Madam Deputy Speaker, Phase 2 and Phase 3 implementation works has been tendered through the Fiji Procurement Office. Tender Reference RFT 49/2024 was advertised on 23rd March, 2024. The 30 days tender, which invites all registered construction companies to bid for the activity as design and bill works for 37 houses, communal septic tanks, footbridge and connecting footpaths. The tender process are as follows: Site pre-bid meeting will take place on 17 th April, 2024, at the relocation site at Nadoiviri. 1. 2. Closing of tender on 27 th April, 2024. 3. Tender Evaluation Team to meet and review the tender documents and that will take one to two weeks. 4. Submission of tender to Government Tender Board for approval. 5. Awarding of tender by Government Tender Board in about mid-May. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government and community partnership continues with the provision of timber logging activity to assist the community. The Mataqali Uluitoga, with the support of Government agencies in the Northern Division, has made arrangements with Gold Hold Pte Limited to log the timber from their land. This timber will be processed and Gold Hold Pte Limited will reimburse the value of the timber by supplying building materials to affected households. As of now, 207 cubic metres has been logged at the site. Consultation with the other five mataqali continues for the proposed logging sites. Madam Deputy Speaker, discussion is in progress with the re-diversion of initiative above towards the building of the community evacuation centre and community hall. The Ministry continues to allocate funds for payment of water usage by the community at the temporary relocation site. Payment of water bills from 2022 until today, stands at $11,385. This will continue until the community are safely moved to the permanent relocation site at Nadoiviri. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry continues to work closely with the community in ensuring that wellbeing and safety is protected. I must also place on record and thank our partners - the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), Live and Learn and Habitat for Humanity, just to name a few, for their unwavering support towards the rehabilitating the Nabavatu community at the current temporary relocation site. The Government continues to engage with our partners for the wellbeing and safety of the Nabavatu villagers.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>389 MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We have several Members on the Opposition standing up. Can I just ask honourable Members to, please, keep your questions concise. I know I have been letting you meander around a little bit this morning. I am also getting murmurings from the other side asking, “what’s the question? But I thank you, honourable Members, for the spirit in which you are asking questions today. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker,. a very pertinent question with respect to the site that the village has actually been moved to - the permanent site. My question to the honourable Minister is, was there a thorough geotechnical assessment done of that particular site that they are moving to? Is it contained in the SOP for future use with respect to that because we all know the geo surrounding of that area? Was it an independent institution that did the geotech or was it our own Ministry of Lands that did out the geotech assessment? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Yes, there was a very detailed Geo-Tech Survey that was carried out. It was a very thorough one as well. It took much longer than we thought it would take but that is how thorough our Department of Lands had done the work. I believe we only accept work that is done through the Department of Lands as far as our work is concerned. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- We truly sympathise with the community at Nabavatu for what they had to endure during this couple of years. We thank the honourable Minister for his answer. Initially after TC Yasa and TC Ana, a few members of the Nabuavatu community were reluctant to relocate and land negotiations and other things were going on. I would like to ask the honourable Minister, has that stance changed? Is this relocation going to take the 100 percent relocation of the affected community? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question. That was one of the reasons why it took so long. There is quite a bit of disagreement in the community. I think there are only 37 households that are at the present relocation site and those are the 37 households that we are focussing on and that we are intending or planning to move to the new relocation site. But the village site will be prepared for 100 percent of the people when they decide to move over. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Just one final question, Madam Deputy Speaker. I did hear from the honourable Minister that Gold Hold Pte Limited will be involved, so it is just the community contribution that I want to ask of the honourable Minister. Is it cash in kind? To what extend is the contribution from the community when it comes to this relocation? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what they provided was just the timber which Gold Hold Pte. Limited logged and in return, they would pay for all of the houses that were going to be built. I think there are only about five houses that are involved. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Before I ask honourable Tuinaceva to ask Question No. 15/2024, I would like to acknowledge Professor Jon Fraenkel from the Victoria University, a professor in politics, who is sitting in the public gallery this morning. He is a former university lecturer here at the University of the South Pacific. Welcome, Sir. Road Upgrade - Valewaqa Settlement, Vunilagi, Cakaudrove (Question No. 15/2024) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>390</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management inform Parliament on when will the upgrade on the road to Valewaqa Settlement in Vunilagi, Cakaudrove, commence so that buses and other light PSVs can start providing services to the residents? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Madam Deputy Speaker, please, allow me to provide an update on the Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF)Development Programme under the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. Madam Deputy Speaker, the CARFF is part of the programmes that we carry out in the rural areas. It improves community access to the main transportation network, markets and essential services. For road access, these access roads are not the rural roads used by public transport that are being upgraded by the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA). They are smaller access roads, connecting rural communities including farmers, to Fiji’s main centres. Footpaths and footbridges connect communities for better accessibility and in improving the standard of living. Approximately, $2 million allocated to the Ministry in the financial year 2023- 2024 was for this. Madam Deputy Speaker, the breakdown of the released funds and the number of projects for this financial year per Division are as follows: 1. Commissioner Western Division with 42 projects - $816,578. 2. Commissioner Northern Division with 23 projects - $607,164. 3. Commissioner Central Division with 37 projects - $684,365; and 4. Commissioner Eastern Division with 28 projects - $498,221. Madam Deputy Speaker, the funds that are mentioned for the Rural Development Programme is limited to only $50,000 per project. For the question, the Valewaqa Settlement at Vunilagi, Cakaudrove, has a total population of 75 with 12 households, a 1.3 kilometre road with iTaukei land ownership. Part of the community that reside at Valewaqa are members of the Melanesian community. The last road upgrade at Valewaqa Settlement was done by FRA through the Community Access Fund in 2015. The Programme allows FRA to work with the Divisional Commissioner on the community access priority for repair and maintenance. In 2017 the programme was shelved. Madam Deputy Speaker, the road access is serviceable by RSL and school pick up carriers continue to service the settlement. The road access is earmarked to be upgraded through the Office of the Commissioner Northern under the Community Access Road Programme that I had just described in the next financial year - 2024 – 2025. The Ministry will continue to engage with the community and Fiji Roads Authority through the Community Access Road Programme to enable better access to the community. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.– Madam Deputy Speaker, through you. I just want to thank the honourable Minister for his response. The latest update I received from the Valewaqa community which was last night, even four-wheel drives cannot access the road because of poor road condition. I know the programme the honourable Minister is talking about; it will happen and that takes a bit of</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>391 time. People still must walk 1.3 kilometres or 2 kilometres including students to reach the main road to obtain the services. The question to the honourable Minister is, can your Ministry provide some quick fix to enable the movement of vehicles to provide services to the people? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it is already done. I have already called the Commissioner last night and he is organizing it. Office of the ICAO Pacific Liaison Officer (Question No. 16/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the establishment of the Office of the International Civil Aviation Organisation Pacific Liaison Officer for the Pacific Small Island Developing States. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, since forming the Coalition Government, one of our goals is to bring our Pacific Island communities together which we had witnessed on many occasions including the Pacific Islands Forum Special Leaders Retreat in 2023 by our honourable Prime Minister. Madam Deputy Speaker, another initiative of strengthening and improving Fiji’s relationship with its Pacific Island brothers and sisters in the area of aviation is establishing an office of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) in Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, the PSIDS are a group of unique islands which share distinct sustainable development challenges characterized by many factors including limited resources, remoteness in terms of distance, poor connectivity, high cost of travel, vulnerability to natural disasters, public health emergencies of international concern and excessive dependence on international support. Most PSIDS do not have the capability to fully discharge their ICAO membership obligations or engage constructively with ICAO on programmes and activities and gain the best possible benefit from their membership. Therefore, an ICAO presence in the Pacific is an essential component of strengthening the relationship between the PSIDS and ICAO. Madam Deputy Speaker, Cabinet in its meeting held on 9 th May, 2023, approved the establishment of the office of ICAO, Pacific Small Island Developing States Liaison Office and the ICAO Pacific Liaison Officer. This is the first ever office of the International Civil Aviation Organization in the Pacific region. Madam Deputy Speaker, more than 65 percent to 70 percent of all arrivals into Fiji are carried by Fiji Airways. Therefore, our tourism relies on aviation to bring in visitors and aviation relies on tourism to generation demand and fill seats. Given the importance of the role of civil aviation in the Pacific region in supporting the tourism industry as our nation’s lifeline, the physical presence of ICAO in Fiji only provides the added benefit to Fiji but also the Pacific region. The ICAO office is set to enhance our status in the global aviation community, creating opportunities for capacity building, skills development and knowledge transfer contributing of the ICAO initiative of no country left behind. Madam Deputy Speaker, at this juncture, I would like to introduce the ICAO appointed Pacific Liaison Officer, Mr. Shane Sumner, was formally assigned this current position in August 2023 by ICAO. His professional background in aviation is in Air Traffic Management, serving</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>392</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 various roles in Australia as an Air Traffic Controller and in Air Traffic Management. Prio to taking up his role in Fiji, he served as Regional Officer Air Traffic Management in the ICAO Asia Pacific Regional Office in Bangkok. The ICAO Office in Fiji is located at the CAAF compound in Nadi. Madam Deputy Speaker, since taking up office in Nadi, Shane has physically visited a number of Pacific Island States. Currently, he is coordinating with ICAO and PSIDS for the conduct of Critical Safety Oversight Officer Training to be held in Fiji later this year. The role of Pacific Liaison Officer will be more focussed on supporting improvements in addressing regulatory and technical outcomes and assist PSIDS in addressing their resource and capacity challenge and to enhance communication and coordination with the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, UN organisations, Multinational Development Banks and other relevant international regional stakeholders and facilitate technical assistance as required. Madam Deputy Speaker, the co-ordination and facilitation of ICAO support for the 39th- ICAO member PSIDS which are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu remain paramount for ICAO Pacific Office. Madam Deputy Speaker, by establishing a physical presence in Nadi, ICAO aims to facilitate closer collaborations with the PSIDS, providing targeted assistance and expertise to address the unique aviation requirements and the Fiji Government is very proud to be able to have had an active participation in making these facilities. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We have a follow-up question first of all from the original questioner. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my supplementary question is, when was Fiji aviation last audited by ICAO and what were the results? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for the supplementary question. The last ICAO audit of Fiji was carried out in 2019 and we expect the next one in 2025. On the results, Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji scored 76.3 percent. This sits above the Asia Pacific average of 65.5 percent and global average of 69.4 percent, so Fiji is doing well. The lower score, Madam Deputy Speaker, was in areas of accident investigation, we need to strengthen that and also the primary and secondary legislations are relating to aviation. The Act to have, Madam Deputy Speaker, goes back to 1976, almost 50 years ago so we need to bring that today and is part of a legislative programme for this year. Also, the technical qualifications, personal numbers and technical training, we find it very difficult to keep our trained and experienced people in aviation. They are poached. Once they become competent, once they have an added profile, they are poached by our neighbours. It is a huge challenge and is something that will continue to challenge us. Luckily for last year, we managed to get the full budget required by the aviation, thanks to our honourable Minister of Finance. That was welcomed and will go a long way in strengthening the Civil Aviation Authority in Fiji. At one time, we needed a full complement of 76 staff, we are only sitting at about 65 or so. The audit picks on that, that we are not fully staffed in the right areas. In terms of global rating, Fiji is 11 th in the Asia Pacific Region. That is quite significant for our small country and what we do for our neighbours.</p><h4>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my question is related to our representation at</h4><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>393 ICAO, and ICAO Conferences has not just been helpful to Fiji, but also to our Pacific Island neighbours and the SIDS that honourable Minister talks about. In terms of the future of civil aviation, at the last Civil Aviation Conference that honourable Gavoka and I attended, one of the key topics was Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). My question relates to the fact that by setting up this particular office and having a Liaison Officer, because that was very high on the agenda with respect to civil aviation fuels, and if I may just digress a little bit, Europe has totally gotten behind Africa in terms of sustainable aviation fuels, and the Pacific has been left behind; left behind to the extent that even Australia and New Zealand have been left by the wayside. Will this Liaison Officer have at the top of their agenda our charge with respect to the development of sustainable aviation fuels in Fiji and for the purposes of Pacific and Australia and New Zealand? Is that going to be part of their work? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, SAF is very much part of the requirements of the work of our Liaison Officer and to help develop SAF. I will be making a Ministerial Statement on this on Thursday. Suffice to say that I was happy that honourable Koya accompanied me to Dubai, where I chaired the Conference on Civil Aviation Alternative Fuel. Maintenance of Cane Access Roads – Ministry of Sugar Industry (Question No. 17/2024) HON. J. N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on how the Ministry is ensuring cane access roads are maintained well before harvesting season. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, unfortunately, honourable Pillay is not here, but, I will give him a copy of my answer as well for his reference. Honourable Pillay has a wide knowledge of the sugar industry given his background as a cane farmer, and I express my gratitude for his insightful question. (Laughter) We recognise the critical role of the Ministry is ensuring that the cane access roads needs to be well maintained. These roads, Madam Deputy Speaker, not only transport sugarcane from farms to mills but serves other agricultural farmers and the public as well who are not farmers including linkages through the villages and many informal settlements in the deep interiors of our rural sectors. These roads serve as a vital outreach of our nation’s sugar industry enabling timely harvesting and delivery of sugarcane while minimising logistical challenges for our hardworking farmers. It is important to note, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the maintenance of cane access roads is basically avoided during the rainy season which spans from November to April. This precaution is taken largely to prevent the road upgrades being damaged and washed away by heavy rains and floods which we have just witnessed in January. This strategic decision explains, Madam Deputy Speaker, while repairs of cane access roads have yet to commence too. To ensure the best value for money, maintenance activities usually begin in May and extend into the early stages of the crushing season. As we prepare for the 2024 harvesting season, Madam Deputy Speaker, preparations are already in the final stages to upgrade 3,000 kilometres of roads and supply of culverts and repair costings with an allocated budget of $2 million. Since 2012, a total of $39.4 million has already been expanded for this purpose. On average, my Ministry allocates</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>394</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 approximately $500 per kilometre of the road each year and is often insufficient for the comprehensive maintenance given the impacts of climate change that we are experiencing now. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have progressed very well as my Ministry’s workplan, the road contractors for the 2024 maintenance season have been selected through a tender process and every month our accounts are being signed. Maintenance work is scheduled to commence in the first week of May aiming for the completion by the mid harvesting season to minimise stand over cane. As the contractors undertake the essential repairs on the ground, our field staff from the Sugar Cane Growers Council, my Ministry and FSC will actively monitor their progress. Their presence ensures that the quality of work is continuously maintained throughout the duration of the project and as we have clearly defined, specification for the scope of work detailing the right type of material, et cetera to be used. The continued effort between the contractors, farmers and the field staff underscores our commitment to upholding higher standards and delivering effective results in the maintenance of cane access roads. Madam Deputy Speaker, to add on, I must also inform Parliament that we have successfully completed the In-Field Drainage Project after years of neglect and deterioration which forms part of the foundation of many roads across these farm areas. In tandem with overseeing of the repairs of the cane access roads, this Government is also actively pursuing the restoration of extension of our rail system. Following the extensive discussion during my recent visit to India, we are exploring pathways forward and revitalizing our extensive rail network that holds promise for significant elevation and maintenance workloads. Moreover, I extend to reduce transportation cost for our farmers in enhancing the sugar industry. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in a matter of relevance and accountability, I need to quote this, FBC stated on 31st March, 2023 on cane access road and I quote, “A Minister said, we are focused on bringing in the Ministry of Public Works Department to work on rural infrastructure as said by the Minister for Finance.” We noticed the poor and sluggish efforts under the Ministry of Sugar because there were complaints of cane access roads not being attended to. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Question! HON. R. R. SHARMA.- I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Sugar, were the promises of the honourable Minister for Finance fulfilled and his instructions obeyed to on how the Public Works Department assisted in the maintenance of cane roads to assist our farmers? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think the honourable Member should direct that question directly to the honourable Minister for Finance because he had said it, not me. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- It is an irrelevant question:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, this is to the honourable Minister, I just heard it from him, improvement of the rail system. You have visited India which is good but when will this improvement take place? I had brought this issue already after visiting Labasa last year, particularly for the farmers from Wainikoro because this is good for the farmers in terms of minimising costs and at the same time, in terms of climate change, reducing our carbon footprints, we need this rail system. When will this rail system be fixed and improved?</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>395 HON. C. J.

BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, last year we had a real issue in regards to the upgrading of cane access roads, for instance, where the estimate cost to upgrade a cane access road was $1,000 but few loads of gravel were delivered. I want to ask the honourable Minister whether that trend will continue or the full amount that is allocated is given for upgrade? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think we have made a point that there is a $2 million allocation for cane access roads and we will make sure that we take care of all the farmers and the roads. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Only one month left, when will you make sure? HON. C. J. SINGH.- You stand up and talk! (Laughter) HON. P. D.

TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on the reason(s) why the PALM registration is being suspended? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, just for the record, our workers were engaged in short-term seasonal work in both, Australia and New Zealand, since 2015. Reforms of the Australian Labor Mobility Programme took place in 2022, resulting in the merging of both the short- term visa of up to nine months and the long-term visa of up to four years. Both Australian programmes are now known as the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme. Madam Deputy Speaker, since the inception of foreign employment opportunities, both Australia’s Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) and New Zealand’s Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Work Scheme registrations are done manually by the National Employment Centre (NEC), together with the records of the workers and assessments that are manually recorded and filled with workers passing the assessment criteria, placed into work ready pool – ready for the recruitment and selection process. Madam Deputy Speaker, the inception of the long-term visa in 2019 opened up more opportunities for Fijians to register their interest for the Scheme and the industry preference that they wish to work for.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>397 With the influx of interest in this PALM Programme, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, through NEC, has been overwhelmed with the number of registrations in all our seven District Offices around the country. Madam Deputy Speaker, it has been noted that registrations increased multiple fold in 2019 to 2023 and is an indication that registered clients are eagerly waiting for the opportunity to be considered to work in Australia. Madam Deputy Speaker, this long wait has occasionally caused a lot of frustrations amongst clients, resulting in complaints that are escalating to higher authorities even and the Ministry staff had been trying to manage this. Madam Deputy Speaker, just for the record, the numbers registered under the In-Country Recruitment Database is as follows: Year 2019 Number Registered 2,922 2020 2,893 2021 6,215 2022 2023 15,091 8,041 Total 35,162 Madam Deputy Speaker, the temporary suspension of Client Registration under the PALM Scheme is for seven months, which commenced from 1 st January, 2024, and will conclude on 31 st July, 2024. The updating of the backlog manual registration work is progressing well. The process includes the sorting and cleansing transfer of manual registration into the In-Country Recruitment Database, as well as the process improvement to enhance the efficiency of NEC services. Madam Deputy Speaker, recognising the magnitude of this task, we have engaged volunteers to assist in that critical work. In addition to our volunteers, all our NEC staff in the District Offices have been actively participating in this initiative. Their expertise and understanding had been invaluable in ensuring that the data is accurate and reflective of the current demographics. We are committed to completing this task efficiently and effectively, and we appreciate the patience and understanding of all during this period. We will continue to provide updates as we move closer to the completion of this project. As of now, we are processing applications from the year 2021 for all work sectors. The only exception is the aged care where we are currently processing applications from 2022. So, that is the kind of backlog we are faced with, Madam Deputy Speaker, and the Ministry will resume registration from 1 st August, 2024. HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- My supplementary question to the honourable Minister, how many workers are currently in Australia and New Zealand at the moment? HON. A. D. SINGH.- I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs for his supplementary question. As I speak, we have a total of 6,669 Fijians deployed in Australia since 2021. Currently, we have 5,000 who are in Australia. The numbers include the short term and long term employees. Some 700 are currently working in New Zealand and we are expecting another 47 to leave our shores next month. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I thank the honourable Minister for his response. The teething issues that we faced are particularly on worker’s rights, labour laws, because there are reports that some of our workers appreciate the scheme, but some of our workers are ill-treated, and that is a</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>398</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 major concern for us. They are seen as, sort of, lower- or second-class workers, as compared to the countries that do receive our labourers. My simple question to the honourable Minister is, what are we doing to address these issues and are our workers fairly represented while they are there in Australia or New Zealand? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his supplementary question. I have alluded to this matter in Parliament in the past. When we came into office, we were criticised for visiting our workers in Australia and New Zealand. Some honourable Members from the Opposition said that we were going on excursion trips. However, Madam Deputy Speaker, sometimes we have to deal with the elements as well. When we visited both, Australia and New Zealand, we realised that we did not have any representative of ours who could look after our workers there. (Chorus of interjections) MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! HON. A. D. SINGH.- We appointed three Country Liaison Officers, who are now looking after our workers’ interests in Australia. I must repeat that in 2021, the Australian Government had already allocated funds for us to appoint a Country Liaison Officer, but we never appointed the officer. But now, we have appointed three of them and the fourth one will be appointed soon. The workers have a direct link to them, they are able to call them any time and they make sure that the minimum standards are observed, equal to those how Australian workers are treated. Madam Deputy Speaker, I have also met with my Australian counterpart and New Zealand counterpart, and we have discussed the minimum standards. The Labour Ministries in both countries have assured us that they are going to make sure that inspections are done, our workers are treated well and that all minimum standards are observed. Similarly, we have met with the unions in Australia and New Zealand and the respective workers unions have also assured that they will organise them and they will make sure that the minimum standards are met. Our communities in both Australia and in New Zealand are also assisting us in this matter, Madam Deputy Speaker. So, we have network, we have made sure that our people out there are getting what they rightly deserve as far as treatment by the employers is concerned, and we will continue to do that. HON. P. K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think it is a great insult to the staff of NEC because they did very well without these Liaison Officers… HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash! HON. P. K. BALA.-... and it is unfortunate that the honourable Minister had to make that comment. Going back to the question, Madam Deputy Speaker, there were some talks that the family members can join the workers. I just want to know how far this has progressed. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank the former Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations. The records speaks for itself.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>399 Madam Deputy Speaker, this initiative begun last year by the Australian Government whereby some workers’ families can join them for the period that they are working out there and the benefit that would be accorded them would be that the spouse would also be allowed to work, and the children would be allowed to receive that education that they deserve. The pilot project begun with Timor-Leste and one other country (Vanuatu, I think) last year and now, it is our turn. We are working closely with the Australian authorities to progress this. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in all his answers, not once has he mentioned that we have a fully-fledged Embassy and a Mission in Australia to take care of a whole lot of stuff that they ought to. It is their job. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- No! HON. F. S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in light of the fact that the Pacific Labour Mobility Scheme brings in, if my memory serves me correctly, I think it is about $39 million a month into Fiji. I am not sure if you have actually answered your question yourself, but the reasons given for suspension really are technical things that you need to do with respect to getting data, et cetera, all those things that you have actually mentioned. Because of the fact that we earned about $39 million a month, do you not think it was rather a hasty decision to suspend it and the fact that there are a lot of families that are benefiting out of this? HON. A. D. SINGH- Madam Deputy Speaker, if I understand correctly, I think there is some confusion I would like to clarify. While the registration has been suspended, the sending of the workers has not been suspended, that is continuing. As I have said earlier, Madam Deputy Speaker, there are 35,000 pending applications that we are processing, so the processing is ongoing. As I have stated earlier in my contribution, 47 are leaving in two weeks’ time for New Zealand. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan 2023-2028 (Question No. 13/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: The honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection informed Parliament on 29 th March, 2023 that the Ministry would be rolling out the Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan (2023-2028). Can the honourable Minister update Parliament on how and when the Plan was developed and how well it has been implemented thus far? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank the honourable Member for the interest in the Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan. Women’s Economic Empowerment is essential for sustainable development and inclusive growth. The former President, Barrack Obama stated, “The best judge of whether or not a country is going to develop is how it treats its women.” Global evidence demonstrates that by dismantling social, institutional and structural barriers and challenging gender discriminatory stereotypes and norms, and by fostering women’s leadership across all facets of women’s lives, we can unlock tremendous economic potential. This includes ensuring women’s access to markets, control over productive resources, opportunities for decent work, bodily autonomy and meaningful participation in economic decision-making at all levels. The upcoming Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment National Action Plan (WEENAP), represents the Coalition Government’s commitment to unlocking the economic potential of Fijian</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>400</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 women and girls, ensuring their full participation and leadership in our economy. On that note, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to give a brief context and update on the WEENAP. To effectively spearhead the development of this WEENAP, the Ministry took proactive steps since early 2023. On 13 th and 14 th April, 2023, we organised a high level technical advisory workshop. This event was more than just a meeting. It represented a convergence of minds and efforts, uniting 50 leaders and experts from Civil Society, Government agencies, the private sector, informal sector and Women’s Rights Organisations. This workshop is to foster a collective dialogue through a thorough examination of the economic growth that Fijian women hold within our society, and the barriers they encounter. We identified a significant burden of unpaid work on Fijian women and girls – • • • • • • • Their over representation in the informal economy; issues of bodily autonomy, with high prevalence of gender-based violence, as well as reproductive cancers; limited access to sexual and reproductive health rights; daily impacts of the climate crisis; limited knowledge access and productive use of digital technology and e-commerce; limited access to financial resources; and the presence of gender blind policies and discriminatory norms. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fiji Country Gender Assessment confirms that Fijian women are predominantly employed in low paying jobs, within the precarious informal sector. Only 35.2 percent of women are in formal employment, on a count of less than three interns engaged in paid informal work. This disparity is underscored by the labour force participation rate of 45.5 percent of all women, compared to 82.6 percent of men, revealing a significant gender gap of 38 percent. Moreover, the challenges extend beyond employment, Madam Deputy Speaker. Nearly two- thirds of Fijian women experience intimate partner violence, with an associated economic cost to our nation of approximately $400 million annually, that is about 7 percent of our GDP. In our academic institutions, despite women representing 65 percent of students, as it is evidenced by our students who sit in the gallery today, over half of the graduates face disproportionately high unemployment, particularly among young women aged 15 years to 24 years, where 30 percent are neither in education, neither in employment nor in training. That is, three times the rate of young men. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the MSME sector, which contributes 18 percent of Fiji’s GDP, about half the businesses are owned by women. Yet only 19 percent of these enterprises are registered under women’s names, and they often operate in low productivity sectors. In our homes, Fijian girls and women spend two times to three times, the amount of time on unpaid domestic and care work, compared with boys and men. A significant proportion of Fijian women lack the autonomy to make their own healthcare decisions. Notably, cancers of the reproductive organs, such as cervical and breast cancer, are the leading diseases causing death amongst women of all ages in Fiji, with these cancers being among the top five causes of cancer deaths.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>401 A key point from the workshop I mentioned earlier, Madam Deputy Speaker, was that women’s control over their bodies is crucial, not just for health, but also for economic empowerment. A healthy woman is a productive woman. Bodily autonomy lets women make important decisions that affect both their personal and work lives. It helps them fully participate in the workforce, start or grow their businesses and reach their economic goals. Therefore, supporting and promoting women’s bodily autonomy is vital for them to succeed in all areas of their lives. I highlight this key data because it powerfully demonstrates the Coalition Government’s commitment in taking decisive action in steering a new course. In this context, the Ministry has acted on the outcomes document from the workshop I mentioned earlier, because it underscores the importance of the WEENAP. The Ministry has prioritised its development by mobilising necessary technical resources for further consultation and development.</p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministerial statement!</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> You asked for a statement and answer, I have 20 minutes to respond. Thank you, honourable Kumar. I would hope you would be supportive of what I am talking about.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- We extend our deep appreciation to the Government of Australia for their generous support in moving forward. The Cabinet has endorsed the implementation of the WEENAP:</span> Following this endorsement in February this year, we assembled the team of experts to drive this initiative forward. The Department of Women is expanded to include a National Coordinator for the WEENAP, a consultant for the WEENAP, who collaborates closely with our WEE Desk at the Ministry and also our Gender Advisor. Chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, the secretariat includes key society organisations, like the Fiji Women’s Rights Movement (FWRM), DIVA for Equality, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Business Council (WEBC) and the Fiji Women’s Fund (FWF). We also have representatives from the private sector, like Asian Development Bank (ADB). The secretariat is mandated to provide technical oversight for the consultation and development process of the WEENAP. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am also pleased to announce that we have developed a robust consultation framework for the WEENAP. This consultation phase is set to commence in May, next month, and will run until the end of July. This consultation aims to alleviate awareness of the importance of women’s economic empowerment, spotlighting the significant contributions of women and addressing the challenges that hinder their full participation. Madam Deputy Speaker, there are approximately 104 stakeholders in this process, who are directly or indirectly contributing to the consultation of the WEENAP, and these stakeholders are categorised into nine categories.</p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministerial Statement!</h4><p><span class="speaker">MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- What was the question, honourable Kumar? The question was to give an update on the development of the WEENAP.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>402</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Vinaka! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- These stakeholders from the nine categories include: 1. educational institutions; 2. WEE programmes and projects; 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Government agencies; 10. development agencies; private sector; financial institutions; networks and associations; civil society; faith-based and women’s rights organisations; informal sector; etc. I shall highlight to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in the consultation process, we continue to lean on the expertise of women-led civil society organisations and the engagement of NGOs - something that the former Government failed many times, to engage civil society organisations in the development of any Government policy. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is bullying:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, a final report will be scheduled for August this year (2024), and also upon completion of this consultation, we will be drafting the Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan. This document is expected to undergo validation by the taskforce in September this year and, of course, will be submitted to Cabinet for approval, with the launch planned, hopefully, at the end of this year or early next year. On that note also, I wish to report to this Parliament that the Ministry is working with the Ministry of Finance and commencing the design of the second phase of the Gender Transformative Capacity Development and Gender Responsive Budgeting. Why is this important to highlight? Because for the first time ever in the history of Fiji under the Coalition Government, we have achieved Gender Responsive Budgeting. We may have little representation in Parliament, but we certainly are results oriented. For the first time in last year’s budget, there were actual budget allocations in Ministries committed to gender. So, for the three Ministries with the National Action Plan to prevent Gender- Based Violence - the Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Education and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs have budget lines committed to the National Action Plan on Gender Based Violence (NAP-GBV). Yes, honourable Premila Kumar we are spending the money. Yes, we are. In fact, honourable Vasu and I have just returned from a workshop that gathered our traditional leaders, so they are consulted on the way forward in order to implement the NAP-GBV.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the question was in two parts: 1. Update how this Plan was developed; and 2. the implementation. From the very comprehensive Ministerial Statement received, I see that it is all about development and workshops. Is this another no action talk only activity of this Coalition Government? It is only talk. It has taken them one year to develop the activity plan. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question? HON. S. NAND.- When will they start implementing? After they finish their four-year term in Parliament? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I really thank the enthusiasm of the honourable Member. I do not think he was listening to my response when I stated that in the meantime, we have to undertake extensive consultations and then come up with a plan to implement which is at consultations, something they never did during their time. They just came out with plans without consultations. We are conducting proper consultations with the stakeholders including the women’s organisations. We need talk to the women in order to come up with a plan. I mentioned the entire timeline, honourable Member, by late this year or early next year we will be able to have that fully consulted National Action Plan before we can then implement which is what is happening to the National Action Plan to prevent Gender Based Violence. We started it last year, it is now being implemented from the 1 st March this year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> Thank you, honourable Minister for the very comprehensive speech.</p><p><span class="speaker">MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Sharma, please, be concise with your question. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Sure, I will be, Madam Deputy Speaker. To curb the graph of gender imbalance when it comes to landownership and cultivation for Fijian women, I was looking and trying to hear where it is covered in your statement about the Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan? Where is it going to address the ability for women to acquire land and increase participation in agriculture with the sole purpose of them being agri-entrepreneurs. As you have highlighted, participation at all levels, so I was looking for this important aspect because the way to improve this country is through agriculture. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it is not often that I agree with honourable Sharma, but this point that he has made, yes, we do need to engage our women in agriculture and the Ministry for Agriculture is committed to women in agriculture in terms of their programmes. But, yes, they are being consulted also in this process that I mentioned and then when we do have the plan in place, then we will be able to implement but we are engaging by the end of this year (I mentioned) or early next year will be the implementation of the plan. We are heavily consulting our women including our women in the agriculture space. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, we ratified Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), now you are coming up with another terminology Women’s Economic Empowerment National Action Plan (WEENAP). I</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>404</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 have stated so many times in Parliament, the action must match the rhetoric - data, consultation, data, consultation. There is a difference between action and consultation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> You did nothing, you never did consultation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> We have so much data in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) Report that talks about poverty throughout gender, sector, geographic regions; data is already in existence. What the women of this country want to ask, and they need answers on is, what is there now?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRAN.:</span> That is data, not consultation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Leader of the Opposition:</span> In terms of the timeline, yes, we start off with the data, but we do need to consult and that is what we are doing now to consult our women. (Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- It is going to take some time to consult because we are looking at several key settings which includes traditional leaders, our faith-based organisations but most importantly is talking to our women. Did you talk to our women during your time? No, even the data does not reflect that. We are now talking to our women, we need to listen to our women to inform our decisions and we are putting money where our mouth is, we are putting money through our budget and that is what is happening in this Government; something that has never been done before especially by the previous government. So, we are very happy to actually commit financially and also the political will to do so, and that is what we are committed to. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank you. Our Oral Question time is over, I see 12.38 p.m. on the clock.

Welcome to your Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and I hope you will learn a few good lessons from us and from how Parliament works. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, can I raise a Point of Order? MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, Standing Order 74(1)(a) and I quote: “Any member may only raise a point of order if – (a) there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.” Earlier this morning, the honourable Leader of the Opposition in raising a question around infrastructure, I think with shipping, he mentioned that the demise of the shipbuilding industry was caused by the SVT Government. I think he has myopia. The Qarase Government created the shipbuilding industry and then the FijiFirst Government actually killed it. Madam Deputy Speaker, on public record, can the honourable Leader of the Opposition correct his statement. HON. F. S. KOYA.- That’s not a Point of Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> It’s a practice, you need to be accurate in Parliament.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Can I please have the advice of the Madam Secretary- General? Thank you for your patience, honourable Members. The Madam Secretary-General has clarified that it is a clarification perhaps that Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica raised a Point of Order on. Written Question Professional Workforce – Overseas Workers and Skilled Professional Fijians (Question No. 19/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament on – (a) (b) the number of overseas workers who have entered the workforce from January 2023 until 31st January, 2024, by country and trade/skill sectors; and the number of skilled and professional Fijians who left our shores for work, education or immigration in 2023 to date by sector and professional categories.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>406 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 HON.
