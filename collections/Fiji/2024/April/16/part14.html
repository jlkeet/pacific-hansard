<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Local Government Annual Report 2018-2019 which was tabled on 21st November, 2020.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Local Government is designed to deliver across two areas: 1. 2. Local Government; and Town and Country Planning. The Department of Local Government monitors legislative compliance of municipal councils and oversees the delivery of effective and efficient services and quality infrastructure for the Fijian people at the Local Government level. The Department of Town and Country Planning on the other hand is responsible for the overall administration, planning and regulating of land use through the Town Planning Act Cap. 139 and the Subdivision of Land Act Cap. 140. Its focus is on strategic planning of urban and rural areas, the formulation of related regulations and compliance with development laws. The Department also offers physical planning and land use development advice to the whole of Government as well as to the private sector. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry during the year under review undertook major capital projects which includes the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The improvement of ventilation and lighting of the Lautoka Market; The continuation of construction works at Laqere Municipal Market and Lautoka Botanical Garden; The swimming pool in Lautoka; The completion of Namaka Market; and The redevelopment of Govind Park in Ba. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry also continues to improve on rezoning applications, building approvals and service goals. The Committee as part of its findings and recommendations identified the following: 1. 2. 3. That the Ministry produce timely submission of its Annual Reports; The Committee notes the delay in completion of capital projects and recommends that the Ministry works in consultation with relevant municipal councils in ensuring that products are monitored to ensure timely completion of these capital projects; and The Committee noted that late submission of proposals for Government funded capital projects by the municipal councils and recommends that the Ministry work together with the municipal councils on trainings and learning development plans as this will contribute</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 407 to the capacity building of municipal staff. Madam Deputy Speaker, on that note, I support the motion before Parliament. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list of speakers as follows: 1. Honourable R. R. Sharma; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 3. Honourable P. D. Kumar; and 4. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to contribute to the debate on the Review of the Ministry of Local Government Annual Report 2018-2019. If I highlight one of the recommendations, the Committee is asking for timely submissions of the Ministry’s Annual Report and this is imperative as it calls for the Ministry of Local Government to place priority in getting the accounts of all the municipalities audited and up to-date. This will provide accurate and up to-date financial information that is necessary for effective decision making. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the things highlighted was one of the projects that has been on the lips of every Fijian in the past few years, the Lautoka Swimming Pool Project. It was the vision under the Lautoka City Council to build a swimming pool of international standards. Just as we witnessed the success of the Churchill Park being able to host international games, inspire the younger generation for a career in sports, boost income generation and also boost the confidence of our Fijian enterprises and consumers. Madam Deputy Speaker, for a pool to meet international standards and comply with Federation Internationale de Natation or International Swimming Federation (FINA) requirements, this was the reason for the construction cost to increase to $12.6 million. The Lautoka Swimming Pool concept was approved in January 2017, with construction beginning in 2018. Despite the delays, and with Fiji witnessing a global pandemic, countries fell, economies fell, about 90 percent of the construction is done. What has been done is the kids pool, a training pool and an Olympic- size pool. Madam Deputy Speaker, in fact, some of these esteemed politicians harped about the financial mismanagement and waste of taxpayer’s money behind the Lautoka Swimming Pool project, it was part of most people’s election campaign and their social media. However, in the 2023-2024 National Budget, the Coalition Government sets aside $4.5 million for the completion of the pool.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Because it was a mess:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I am coming to your mess:</span></p><p>Madam Deputy Speaker, in a matter of accountability and transparency, I would like to refer to this media article because I need to provide evidence with everything we say here. Thank you, honourable Manoa. Madam Deputy Speaker, on 12 th April, 2024, it says, “One pool may be demolished and the Olympic size pool will be downsized.” This is an article in the Fiji Sun. With reference to this article, who gives a staggering amount of $4.5 million to demolish and downsize a swimming pool that was 90 percent complete - this Coalition Government. From this article, it can be referred that</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>408 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 if there is a change of scope, then there is a need for a project manager. It would be obvious that a project manager will be required to lead this and the people of Lautoka are talking, “I wonder which one of the Coalition candidates or supporters will get this job.” Who knows, we hope to see an Expression of Interest for the job opportunity, if there is one. With reference to this article, if I generalise this, instead of completing and filling water into the swimming pool, it seems that the Coalition Government has allocated $4.5 million to put soil in the pool by downsizing it for domestic use only. Madam Deputy Speaker, this is disastrous for our economy and the youths of the country who seem to have a career in sports. In the last 16 months, after the $122 million turbine deal blunder, this is another rumoured disaster, one of the many. This is the level of wastage of taxpayers’ money under the Coalition Government just within 16 months. God forbid, can imagine 16 years of running a country. I urge the honourable Minister for Local Government to ask serious questions to the Lautoka City Council. With reference to this media article, with $4.5 million to downsize a pool shows the lack of vision of the Coalition Government, the lack of understanding for the need of such an infrastructure to boost the career in sports for our youths. This is the level of wastage and is of no surprise under the honourable Minister for Finance. Madam Deputy Speaker, to conclude, poor accountability and poor transparency seems to be a continued practice under the Coalition Government. As the responsible honourable Minister for Finance, in fact, I have grown up watching Parliament sessions, he was a person who stood in Parliament and spoke about economic policies. He preached and lectured about economic policies, but I urge the honourable Minister for Finance to get out of his economic books and deal with the practicality of running Fiji’s economy. Again, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to conduct a surprise reshuffle very soon. This is disastrous under this Government. I fully support the recommendations made by the Committee and I call upon the Ministry of Local Government to take necessary steps to implement that. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before Parliament. After listening to the presentation by honourable Sharma this afternoon, he raised a point that he was trying to justify some of the wrongdoings and mismanagement of only one capital project which is the Lautoka Swimming Pool. But the report itself talks about four key findings of the report and he should have focused more on those findings rather than focusing on a project that was disastrous in terms of the former Government. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Very poor! HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Local Government acknowledges the key findings and recommendations of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs and I thank them for their thorough review and practical recommendations. There were key issues that were identified by the Committee and if you analyse all these key findings, these are all legacy issues and all governance-related issues. Firstly, Madam Deputy Speaker, is the timely submission of the Ministry’s Annual Report. This issue has been a recurring matter, not only in the Ministry but also with all Municipal Councils in Fiji, but we have managed to address this legacy issue. As of now, the Office of the Auditor- General has completed audits of the Ministry’s financials for four financial years, that is, 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023. The Ministry is finalising the narrative of the Annual Reports, and we shall complete and table all these Reports in Cabinet and Parliament before the end of 2024. Secondly, Madam Deputy Speaker, is for the Ministry to review relevant legislations as this will impact the work of the Ministry. The Ministry has commenced groundwork on the review of</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 409 relevant legislation that govern the whole Ministry. These are the: • • • Town and Country Planning Act 1946; Subdivision of Land Act 1937; and Local Government Act 1972. Recently, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have reviewed the Local Government Act in terms of reducing the default interest rates on the accrued general rates from 11 percent to 5 percent. It also changed the methodology from compound interest rate to simple interest rate. This is, indeed, a great relief for defaulting ratepayers who have difficulty in repaying their current dues, as well as their arrears. In addition, the said Act has been amended to include the necessary changes for the upcoming Local Government elections. Madam Deputy Speaker, work is also underway for the review and amendment of the Town Planning Act to reflect the proposed changes that have been undertaken. Furthermore, there will be further amendments that will be done to reflect the digitalisation of the building permit applications and approvals. A very important issue that was highlighted by the Committee is the timely monitoring and completion of capital projects for all Municipal Councils. Madam Deputy Speaker, weak project monitoring policies and supervision in the that past years have contributed to poor supervision and monitoring of some key Municipal Council projects, like the Lautoka Swimming Pool, the Govind Park in Ba and we have one in Suva, the Ratu Sukuna Park. That is why there is a need to bring back the Local Government elections. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- We need to have Local Government elections. We need councillors, we need people who are going to take full responsibility and accountability in managing the affairs of respective councils. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has also provided a Project Management Policy, with monitoring and reporting templates to guide the Municipal Councils. The Councils, as of this financial year, have been providing detailed project management templates for the release of grants. The Councils manage capital projects in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972, the Procurement Regulation 2010 and other enabling legislations. In addition, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry monitors projects through regular site visits, project meetings and respective project teams. A very important issue that was identified is for the Ministry to work with Municipal Councils on training and learning development plans as this will contribute to the capacity building of Municipal staff. This is something that we take very seriously and the Ministry, in collaboration with the Office of the Auditor-General, recently conducted training on audit processes, financial reporting, internal controls and key accounting areas for all Special Administrators, Chief Executive Officers, Finance Managers, as well as Accountants. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has provided training on both, Finance and Human Resource Manuals to CEOs and Finance and Human Resources Teams. Furthermore, the Councils further underwent training by the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) on Masterplan for Solid Waste Management for 30 Municipalities as part of the Japanese Technical Cooperation Project for promotion of regional initiative on solid waste management. In addition to the above, the Ministry</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>410 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 will work with Councils collectively to look at the standard training and development policy. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee has also highlighted the need for Municipal Councils to complete the two major capital projects - the Lautoka Swimming Pool and Govind Park in Ba. The Coalition Government is committed to complete these capital projects. The Lautoka City Council has recalled the tender to engage the lead consultant who will oversee the project management and construction works. Upon finalisation of this process, the tender for the contractor will be published. There was also a comment by honourable Sharma regarding the demolition of the swimming pool. I do not know where he got his information from and that needs to be verified…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- The Fiji Sun:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> … but it is something that the Council is going to review. There will be a change in the scoping of the whole project. We are going to rescope the project before we finalise all the details about the Lautoka Swimming Pool. Also, for the Govind Park Project, honourable Bala is very keen about this because he started the project and has completed the first phase. The tender for the contractor to undertake civil works of phase two of the project was advertised last December by the Fiji Procurement Office. So, currently, evaluation is in the process and hopefully, tender should be finalised soon. We also expected the construction work to begin before the end of this financial year. Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you, once again, for this opportunity to speak on this motion in Parliament and I fully support the motion. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before Parliament, and I take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for the comprehensive Review Report on the Ministry of Local Government for the fiscal year 2018-2019. I also would like to thank speakers who have contributed to the debate before me, particularly our Minister for Local Government. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Local Government plays a pivotal role in delivering range of vital services or essential services for individuals and businesses, and it is done through 13 Municipal Councils, as well as the National Fire Authority. The Ministry of Local Government’s importance in the economy is well understood. That is where the business takes place. It is a centre where people play, they live, they shop and they conduct their business. And if anything, Local Government is the hub where people come together to conduct various activities. Madam Deputy Speaker, in 2018-2019 fiscal year, it was marked as notable achievements for the Ministry of Local Government. Highlights include the completion of Namaka Market, the opening of new National Fire Authority building in Rakiraki, the completion of Rakiraki and Laqere Markets, the construction of a new modern toilet facility in Korovou Town and, of course, the iconic playground that we have just before our Parliament which is the Albert Park. All these work was completed during that year. During that year, the work on the construction of the Lautoka Swimming Pool and Govind Park continued. It signified that FijiFirst Government’s commitment to enhancing community</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 411 infrastructure was always there, and it continued with the development projects. Madam Deputy Speaker, I mentioned so many projects that this Government completed and my list can go on, like Levuka Market, Savusavu Market is under construction, Ratu Sukuna Park Project which is also under construction. Madam Deputy Speaker, out of all these projects, we have problems with only two projects which is Lautoka Swimming Pool and the Govind Park. Actually, there is no problem there, but the key problem was with the Lautoka Swimming Pool. Now, we hear, like the honourable Minister has said, there is mismanagement and wrongdoing. If there is mismanagement and wrongdoing, I challenge the Government - you conduct your investigation, you produce the report, you file the complaints with FICAC. Just do not come and say things here. You need to understand the root cause of the problem. Madam Deputy Speaker, when we build our own house, we go through so many difficulties with the contractor. Sometimes, the contractors run away with our money and sometimes the builders do not pay the contractor. Now, similar situation was faced with the Lautoka Swimming Pool where there was a dispute between the contractors and the Lautoka City Council. The dispute was there, and the dispute had to be solved. I must say, there was a vision for Lautoka Swimming Pool. The vision was to fit into Lautoka City Council’s vision which was to make Lautoka City a sports city. At that time, there were students from Australia and New Zealand who were used to come and play sports in Lautoka and for that reason, the mission, vision and the thinking was to develop Lautoka City as a sports city. Everything was working in that direction. Initially, the plan was to build a community swimming pool and then it was changed to an aquatic centre – Olympic international standard. Of course, the cost will go up. Madam Deputy Speaker, the cost did go up so now, when the dispute did arise, it was decided that the Ministry of Local Government and Lautoka City Council should not be involved because it was Government funding and, therefore, Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) stepped in and they conducted a peer review, in consultation with the stakeholders, and a report came out. The idea of that report was to solve the issue that was before us. But then the Election took place and, of course, it is history now and we expect the Government side to complete the project. So, that is the story on the Lautoka Swimming Pool, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is very important that we complete that project in the way it was designed because we can already see the benefits accruing from Churchill Park when rugby games are held there. Madam Deputy Speaker, why should we deny the people of Lautoka from having this competition in Lautoka? Whenever there is a competition, why should everyone come to Suva? It is decentralising the activities in two cities. That was the whole plan, so we had that vision. Madam Deputy Speaker, I also want to highlight that if they are really going to downsize the project, then obviously it is not going to fit into the vision of Lautoka City Council. Therefore, I urge the ratepayers to step in and they should ensure that this project is completed. But Madam Deputy Speaker, it appears that this Government is actually anti-development. That is why only 20 percent of the National Budget went to its capital works and 80 percent for operational, so that they can travel overseas more frequently, for excursion trips, et cetera.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>412 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 With FijiFirst Government, Madam Deputy Speaker, we had 60 percent of our budget that was used for operational, whereas 40 percent went towards capital works. That is why today when you go to Rakiraki, you see this nice market. HON. P. K. BALA.- Hear, hear! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- You go to Levuka, you will see a nice market there and that is how we grow the economy. We provide a place for small businesses to come to this place and they conduct their business. Along with that, we also provided accommodation for women. Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Minister can speak about the problems that Municipal Councils had previously and I can assure you after your four year term, you will find that the problems still persist. I can guarantee you that because there are lot of challenges when it comes to planning, execution and monitoring of projects. With the FijiFirst Government, we had established CIU. The work of the CIU was to be responsible for public projects funded by the Government and it was actually to centralise all the expertise in one place for better standards, better designs and for the better outcome. Unfortunately, the Government has disbanded CIU. What does that mean? It simply means that each and every Ministry, like the Ministry of Local Government, need to have that expertise, so additional cost to the Ministry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was a complete disaster:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- All that is now required:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! Honourable Members, we are also eating into honourable Kumar’s speaking time. Thank you for your respect. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the future vision of consolidating Government funded projects under CIU’s purview, from inception to handover, mirrors well with international best practices observed in countries like UK, Australia and many other countries. For example, in the UK, they have Infrastructure and Projects Authority. In Australia, they have Infrastructure Australia. So, what do we see in Fiji? We are just going backwards with our projects. For example, we can see the Government’s reluctance to embrace forward thinking strategies and that hampers progress and undermines the potential for impactful change. This Government is stuck in the past, it lacks innovation in service delivering across Government and now we will see it in Local Government as well. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Can I just, please, remind honourable Members that my title is “Deputy Speaker”. Mr. Speaker, is actually watching this, I do not want to get demoted this afternoon. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the Review of the Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 413 Firstly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am intrigued with the preoccupation of the other side of Parliament with the swimming pool because the fact of the matter is, they have made a mess of that project. This is the real fact. When they selected the contractor to do that project, that person was not qualified to build that swimming pool. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You are lying. You are misleading Parliament:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- There is only one contractor in Fiji that is actually qualified to do it. I heard that from the person who is actually the qualified contractor:</span> So, from the word ‘go’…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You are misleading. You should be ashamed:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> …they actually selected the wrong contractor. They are talking about this and that but, in fact, I heard that the swimming pool was not even to the correct measurement. It was short by about 10 centimetres or something. It was short, and that is why the rectification is taking place. So, stop meandering around and saying this and that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You are misleading:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> The real story is, you mucked up. And it reminds me of my analogy, Madam Deputy Speaker, about the Nabukalou Creek. The tide goes out, what do you see? HON. P. K. BALA.- Shame on you! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The mess, that is, the people on the other side of Parliament have created. Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to contribute in terms of the spirit of the Report. The first thing that caught my attention was the second paragraph in the background that states, and I quote: “The Department of Local Government monitors legislative compliance of the the delivery or efficient services, quality Municipal Councils and oversees construction….” This morning, the honourable Assistant of Finance talked about the lack of governance in the Local Municipalities, Madam Deputy Speaker. What he actually said troubled me, and I quote: “In fact, what was clear that the Municipal Council and the Ministry of Local Government were not serious with the PAC recommendations after it was raised numerous occasions in Parliament for them to address those recurring audit issues.” Madam Deputy Speaker, the other side of Parliament are standing on a broken ship. They had actually been mismanaging Local Government for so many years. It has gone into a stage where they are actually using Government funds to subsidise Local Municipalities. In the last four years, for the record year, the Budget was about $85 million and I can bet my last dollar on this, Madam Deputy Speaker, had they been running local Councils that were actually elected Councils and had proper governance and procedures, we probably would not be spending this kind of money on Local Government.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>414 Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sad to say to the other side of Parliament when you look at Local Government, remember Nabukalou Creek. (Laughter) Madam Deputy Speaker, just to round off, I thought I just talk a bit about some of the positive things that this side of Parliament is doing. One of the areas of oversight by the honourable Minister is the Department of Town and Country Planning. I would like to address specifically the Ease of Doing Business. We know for a fact that investment in this country has been held back significantly because of the inefficiencies in the Department of Town and Country Planning. Over the last few years, started by the previous government, but we are going to finish it, we are embarking on an actual process of automation that will transform the approval process in the Ministry of Local Government. Right now, you actually have to make three copies of all your project documentations, hand it over to the Local Government and it gets distributed amongst all the agencies of Government, and lots of the time the excuse is, it is lost, we cannot find it. By next year, we will actually have an automated system in place.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We started bizFIJI:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- A document gets submitted once and it actually gets sorted out:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, contrary to what honourable Premila Kumar is saying, we are forward looking. We are committed to actually bring about genuine Ease of Doing Business in this country and we are working very closely with the honourable Minister for Local Government to ensure that what is normally in some cases, a three-year process… (Laughter) … is contracted to about 12 months to 18 months. If we can achieve that, there will be a ripple effect on the economic growth in this country. Finally, if the country wants to ask, “Why is the Ministry for Local Government in such shambles?” It is very simple, they decided to remove the election of the Councils. They removed a fundamental aspect of democracy.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are learning democracy now:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- This is a learning for them:</span> When you empower your people, they will deliver for you. In this case, if you will look at what the honourable Assistant Minister had said, I will read this out so that the people of Fiji can hear it. This is about delayed financial statements: Nadi - 2017; Sigatoka - 2020; Tavua - 2016; Rakiraki -2020 and 2021; Levuka - 2014 and 2015; Labasa - 2018; Lami - 2015; Nausori - 2015; Savusavu - 2011 and Nasinu - 2011 and 2012. It is a mess. Nabukalou Creek. This is what they have given to the people of Fiji, and this side of Parliament will fix it. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament. I have no further comments. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.
