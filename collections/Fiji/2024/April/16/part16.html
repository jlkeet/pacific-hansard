BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report which was tabled on 22 nd November, 2023.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the Public Rental Board (PRB) was established on 16 th May, 1989 under the Housing (Amendment) Decree No. 12 of 1989. For the past 33 years, the PRB has provided affordable rental accommodation to low-income earners on transitional basis, and is committed to achieving its organisational roles, together with its social obligations, such as to reduce squatter settlements and promote healthy living. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Year 2020 reported the following highlights, the: 1. 2. PRB recorded an operating profit of $1.5 million for the year ending 31 st July, 2020, which was a great achievement during the year. PRB carried out maintenance work for Kia Street flats with a total number of 24 units with an expenditure of $48,254. 3. Kalabu Housing fencing and drainage works was completed at a total expenditure of $74,614. 4. Low Cost Housing Project at Simla, Lautoka, consisting of 36 rental units of one bedroom, the project was anticipated to be completed by the end of 2021.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>422 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee also highlighted a few findings and recommendations, as follows: 1. 2. The PRB facilities are accessibility to persons with disabilities and recommends that it develops more rental facilities that are accessible to people living with disabilities. The PRB’s lack of funding to finance proposed housing estates. The Committee recommends that it considers partnership with investors and stakeholders in financing proposed housing estates. On that note, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before Parliament. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate We will start from the Opposition, as follows: 1. Hon. J. N. Nand; 2. Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 3. Hon. A. N. Tuicolo; and 4. Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources. HON. J. N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report that is before Parliament. First of all, I would like to acknowledge the Public Rental Board (PRB) for their commendable work as detailed in the 2020 Annual Report. This Report sets light on both the achievements in providing affordable housing for low-income Fijians and the ongoing challenges they face. Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB’s mission is clear and critical and, that is, ensuring Fijians have access to safe and affordable housing. Their success is undeniable. Over 1,600 families, translating to thousands of Fijians, can build their lives with the security of a decent roof over their heads. The dedication extends purely in the construction evidenced by upgrades made to existing estates in places, like Kalabu and Kia Street. These improvements demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of the comfortable living conditions for tenants. Madam Deputy Speaker, the recently completed flats in Lautoka, though delayed by unforeseen COVID-19 challenges, signifies the PRB’s commitment in expanding services in the Western Division. This has provided the much needed housing options promised in Lautoka. Madam Deputy Speaker, finance responsibility is crucial for any organisation and PRB’s commitment to this is evident in their extending and consistent operational profits. This financial strength ensures the organisation can manage resources effectively and maintain long sustainability. Furthermore, the PRB prioritises accessibility by ensuring all their flats are constructed to be accessible for persons with disabilities, fostering a truly inclusive living environment. Madam Deputy Speaker, the demand for affordable housing continues to what we supply. We must acknowledge and address these key challenges head-on. Facilitating home ownership for tenants is a key concern. While affordable rent is crucial, we also want to empower tenants to achieve their dream of owning a home.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 423 The Report acknowledges the low-average of only five tenants transitioning to home ownership per year. We need to explore ways to improve this further. Madam Deputy Speaker, securing funding for new projects remains a significant obstacle. The PRB requires a steady stream of resources to keep up with Fiji’s growing housing needs. The Report mentions a lack of available land as a major hindrance, especially in urban centres. Creative solutions are needed to maximise land usage while maintaining affordability. Rising construction cost due to material and labour further complicate things. Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB is also exploring the development of residential housing and even commercial ventures. This diversification could generate a sustainable source of income to support future affordable housing projects. However, the Report rightly emphasises the need to balance affordability for tenants with any diversification effects. The 2020 PRB Annual Report showcases a remarkable organisation. The achievements in providing affordable housing are commendable, and a commitment to innovative solution paves way for a brighter future. Madam Deputy Speaker, by acknowledging the challenges and working together, the Government, private sector and the Fijian people as a whole, we can ensure every Fijian family have access to secure and affordable home. We must seek further details on PRB’s plans for a long term financial sustainability on the rent to own specific schemes and the impact on affordability. Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the PRB in their mission. Together, we can create a future where affordable housing is not just a dream but a reality for all. With those words, I fully support the motion before Parliament. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion and commend the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on the review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report. Madam Deputy Speaker, the review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report commended PRB with achievements in providing affordable housing and outlined recommendations to enhance its operations, promote inclusivity and address challenges in the housing sector. The Report underscores the importance of sustainable development, financial prudence and social responsibility and PRB’s mandate to serve the community effectively. Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB plays a crucial role in providing affordable, quality and appropriate housing flats to low income earning customers since its establishment. The PRB provides options for those who may otherwise struggle to find affordable housing. The key contribution not only addresses an immediate need for shelter but also alleviate poverty and inequality in our society. Madam Deputy Speaker, PRB provides a total of 1,673 rental flats throughout its 21 estates across Fiji. With 11 estates, it has a total of 1,037 rental flats in the Central Division, six estates with a total of 432 rental flats in the Western Division, and four estates with the Northern Division with a total of 204 rental flats. It is very interesting to note, Madam Deputy Speaker, that from the above data, a total of 257 tenants out of 1,673 tenants, or equivalent to 15 percent, have been renting for more than 20 years.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>424 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, graduating from public rental to home ownership is a significant milestone for individuals and families. It requires careful planning, financial discipline and perseverance. In the past five years, a total of only 42 families have graduated from public rental and have achieved their dream of owning a home. The rate of people graduating from renting to home ownership is really low and it is a big challenge for the Board to address this issue. Madam Deputy Speaker, graduation to home ownership will now be complemented with the formulation of a rent to own scheme that will transition tenants from renting to owning their homes. This scheme will provide an opportunity for tenants who may not have the financial means to purchase a home outright. The Ministry together with the Public Rental Board (PRB) are currently working on this policy and hopefully it should be completed before the end of this financial year. Additionally, Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB tenants have been offered financial literacy and home ownership programme to provide them a pathway in understanding the process of owning a home. It is imperative that PRB estates are inclusive of people living with disability, therefore the Board will ensure that accessibility audits be carried out on the existing estates to identify areas that may require retrofitting to improve access for tenants living with disabilities. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Board will also ensure that any future development projects will have disability friendly features such as ramps, handles and accessible bathrooms to allow people living with disability easy access within and around their units. Madam Deputy Speaker, while we promote inclusivity in rental housing, demands for rental unit also increases. It is very interesting to note that the Board’s waiting list as of the year 2020 was 152. The Board has been receiving applications to-date, the number of waiting applicants has increased to 200. It indicates the demand that exist, hence the need to provide more affordable housing units. To address this issue, the PRB will be completing the Lagilagi Low Cost Housing Project that will produce 36 units. This will be internally funded by the Board and have also pursued development sites at Namelimeli in Navua, Matavolivoli in Nadi and Waitovu in Levuka, which is estimated to provide a total of 157 units. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government provides grants to PRB for rental subsidies allocated by the Board to tenants based on the tenant’s weekly gross income. To receive rental subsidy, a household should earn an annual income of less than $13,000 or a weekly gross income of $250 or less. For the year under review, the Board’s recent allocation of $1.36 million for rental subsidy for a total of more than 1,000 families. Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you once again for allowing me to contribute to the Review of the Public Rental Board and I also wish to thank the staff and management of PRB for all their hard work and contributions to-date. I fully support the motion before Parliament. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to make a short contribution to the motion moved by the honourable Bainivalu, the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairperson and honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in formulating this review. I commend the Public Rental Board for the work they do in ensuring Sustainable Development Goal 11 targets are being met in ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing units and basic services which also contributes to reducing population in informal or squatter settlements. Madam Deputy Speaker, I noted that the Committee through its deliberation, formulated three key findings and one of the findings was the slow graduating of rental tenants to owning homes which</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 425 is an average of five every year. Promoting migration to home ownership is one of the Public Rental Board’s missions which ensures that it achieves its vision which is to be the leading provider of affordable, quality and appropriate rental housing for its tenants. Madam Deputy Speaker, many have their own reasons when applying for rental flats from the Public Rental Board. I was one of the pioneer tenants at the new Raiwai PRB Flats. Most of us were residing out of Suva and our only need was finding a dwelling that was decent, convenient, safe and affordable and that it would accommodate us whilst working or attending a high education institution in Suva. For five years, the rented flat was home to our family and the option of migrating to home ownership was not a priority. Our priority was securing a decent and affordable accommodation to house our family whilst working and studying in Suva. Madam Deputy Speaker, most of the current PRB tenants at the Raiwai PRB Flats would have similar reasons for renting in this particular property, which I believe could be a contributing factor to the slow movement of graduating tenants from rental to home ownership. The second key finding was that the PRB’s facilities are accessible to persons living with disabilities. I understand that the new Raiwai PRB property accommodates a few elderly tenants and tenants currently living with disabilities. With the existing building plan, PRB should consider modifying the access to these bottom flats so that it can be disability friendly. With the Committee’s recommendation, PRB should consider when developing housing that will enhance community living and is disability friendly in future projects. Madam Deputy Speaker, I also noted that the Committee recommends a partnership with investors and stakeholders in financing proposed PRB Housing Estates. Securing the funding will not only provide additional rented flats but it will also fulfil its social and economic obligations and that is to reduce squatter settlements, promote healthy living and house urban workforce. Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to highlight a few ongoing issues raised by tenants in some of the RPB Estates which is the low water pressure experienced by tenants residing on the top flats, noise becoming a major concern to tenants due to children left unsupervised, kava and liquor consumption within the premises and inconsiderate attitudes of individuals who indulge in such activities and the delay in maintenance of flats that are currently occupied by tenants. These problems have been brought to my attention which I believe PRB must look into these issues and must rectify the problem. Madam Deputy Speaker, in conclusion the growing demand and high number of wait list clearly shows that there is a market and that PRB and the Government must seriously consider ways to address the shortage of rented flats that would generate more income. I support the motion before Parliament. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to keep us here until before 4.30 p.m. May I just, perhaps add to the contributions in Parliament this afternoon that from 2018 to 2024 the figures from the Ministry of Finance would suggest that in throughout all those years, just below $7.5 million had been allocated in terms of operating and capital grant by Government to PRB to sustain the operations of providing accessible and affordable housing to Fijians where the 20 estates are allocated all throughout Fiji. I would also like to commend the work that had been put thus far by the management and the staff of PRB, in addition to their Report that we have this afternoon. There is also to be noted, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the management of PRB has gone to great lengths to strengthen mechanisms of governance and to ensure that their Annual Reports are updated and tabled before us, before the</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>426 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 completion date that is required. The Annual Report for 2021 have also been completed while the 2022 Annual Report have been approved by the Board in preparation for publishing. So, this organisation you will see has a very good measure of efficacy in their operation. Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to commend the work that has been put into the operations of PRB thus far by the CEO or the Head of PRB, Mr. Timoci Naleba and his management staff, and in the thought of diversifying the products from PRB, from just rental housing to actual ownership of residential housing, as well as some commercial development which is in line with the Ministry of Housing’s proposal to provide for the rent to own housing opportunities. So far, the Ministry of Lands has issued a total of 79 leases for the development of affordable housing for low- and middle- income earners: Public Rental Board - 14 • Northern Division – 2; • Central/Eastern Division – 10; and • Western Division – 2. The People’s Community Network (PCN) of course, we all know of the story in the Central Division, commonly known as the Lagilagi Housing; Housing Authority - 57 • Northern Division - 4; • Central/Eastern Division – 35; and • Western Division – 18. Housing Assistance and Relief Trust – 7 • Northern Division – 1; • Central/Eastern Division – 5; and • Western Division – 1. These various sites where Housing and PRB are situated includes the Narere Barracks in Nasinu; Lagilagi Housing in Jittu Flats in Raiwai; Edenville in Turaki and Vesida/Kinoya, just to name are few. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, as the need arises, is also able to identify idle and expired leases in cities and around towns which can now be reserved for the provision of expansion of affordable housing for the low- and middle-income earners to housing institutions such as, PRB and Housing Authority. Of course, there are some challenges as we all know. There is a common challenge and issue which is the identification of low-income earners who are genuinely in need of this Government initiative in the provision of affordable and accessible housing. There are tenants living in these PRB flats or other flats built for low-income earners who have rented their flats, while others are offering them up for sale. There have been scenarios in which tenants are selling the flats at a very high cost. With its vision, the Ministry is always willing to assist the PRB in addressing common challenges that may contribute to social issues. Madam Deputy Speaker, another issue is the issuance of development lease for housing purposes. Some of the long-term leases issued are sometimes being left undeveloped. When land are left undeveloped, they attract illegal squatting on that land. Therefore, it is always advisable for agencies, such as PRB to always comply with the conditions of the lease. Quickly develop, otherwise there will be a lot of challenges years later when you will try to do relocation of illegal occupants.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 427 Madam Deputy Speaker, the current reality of our citizens needing affordable housing is evident in the increasing existence of informal settlements near our cities and towns. Majority of these prime State lands and if partnership with investors and stakeholders, as proposed in the Report are established to finance proposed housing estates. Residents of these informal settlements can have improved living conditions with the proposed housing estate developed to its maximum potential. With the aim of providing affordable and accessible housing to our low-income earning bracket, with recreational spaces to curb crimes that are committed by our youths and children, providing security and wellbeing and backyard gardening spaces, it would be great to witness PRB meet its objective of being the leading provider of affordable, quality and appropriate rental properties for all of its customers. I support the motion that is before Parliament this afternoon. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank all honourable Members who have contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament. The Committee had the opportunity to visit the various housing estates last year to examine the capital works that was carried out in this reporting year, and similarly the Committee’s recommendations were derived from what the Committee had seen firsthand from this site visit. I have no further comments, Madam Deputy Speaker. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I just wish to stand and raise a Point of Order, Standing Order 74 and of course consistent with Standing Order 81 as well on clarification and for the purposes of Standing Order 32 on the record of the Daily Hansard. I need that to be corrected based on the Point of Order that was raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister concerning the shipbuilding industry. It was not FijiFirst that caused the demise of the shipbuilding industry. It is very mischievous of the honourable Minister to state that, but of course, it is a known fact that during the SVT days the shipyard or the shipbuilding industry, what was created then because it was sold off and that needs to be corrected. Madam Deputy Speaker, I want that to go on record in the Daily Hansard before it comes out tomorrow morning and that is the Point of Order that I want to raise to clarify that statement of fact. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. I thank you all for your contributions. Afternoon tea or early dinner is served, and I hope that you will have a good afternoon. I see some perplexed looks, in that case we adjourn, honourable Members. See you tomorrow morning at 9.30. The Parliament adjourned at 4.23 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57</p></body>
