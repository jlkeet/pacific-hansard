<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Review Report – OAG Report on Municipal Councils 2021-2022 Audit Report HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, this Report provides the review fundings of the Committee on the Report of the Auditor-General for 2021-2022 Audit Report on Municipal</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>374</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 Councils. The Report covers the audit of 13 Financial Statements for 10 Municipalities that include: Sigatoka; Tavua; 1. Nadi; 2. 3. 4. Rakiraki; 5. Levuka; 6. Labasa; 7. Lami; 8. Nausori; 9. 10. Nasinu. Savusavu; and In the Audit Report, the Committee noted that there are common audit issues raised across the 10 Town Councils, recurring over the years from 2011 to 2021 financial years. The common significant matters which were found within these Councils, include: • • • • • • • • • Significant delays in submission of Draft Financial Statements; Non-Compliance with the accounting standards; Limitation of scope due to insufficient supporting documents; Poor records management; Poor asset management; Lack of documentation; Policies and procedures not updated or non-existent; Poor collection and recording of municipal rates; and Absence of proper reconciliation of cash, debtors, VAT, rates and payroll expenses. In addition to the above, the Committee also noted some common internal control weaknesses that were identified within these Municipalities, and these are related to: • • • • • Cash and revenue management; Journal voucher documentation and reconciliations; Procurement of goods and services; Payroll control; and Management of assets. In fact, what was clear was that Municipal Councils and the Ministry of Local Government were not serious with the Public Accounts Committee recommendations after it was raised on numerous occasions in Parliament for them to address those recurring audit issues. One can look at the latest three Reports (apart from the one we are presenting today) that were tabled in Parliament and debated, and those are the: • • • Review of the Audit Report of Municipal Councils for 2013 tabled in May 2019; Review of the Audit Report of Municipal Councils for 2014-2019 tabled in May 2020; and Review of the Audit Report of Municipal Councils for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 tabled in August 2022. On today’s Report, madam Deputy Speaker, it is important to highlight that modified audit opinions were issued on six Financial Statements and Disclaimer of Opinion on seven Financial Statements that were audited, which reflected negatively on Municipal Councils’ senior staff, the Councils’ respective governing bodies (Councils and Administrators), as well as the Ministry of</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>375 Local Government staff and Ministers. I am not sure who were the Ministers from that period - 2013 to 2020. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, when one talks about modified opinion or qualified opinion, it means that the auditors were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base their opinion. When a Disclaimer of Opinion is issued, it means that there is insufficient appropriate audit evidence provided or obtained and there are undetected misstatements which could be both, material and pervasive, on the Financial Statements. Apart from the poor quality of the Financial Statements, timeliness of financial reporting is a major concern that needs to be addressed by those in charge of the governance of Municipal Councils. Overall, the Committee is not satisfied with the actions taken by Municipal Councils and the Ministry of Local Government. These reflected badly on the Councils’ leadership and the Ministry’s monitoring responsibilities. Madam Deputy Speaker, these bad reports must stop and apart from the recurring recommendations put forward in this Report, the Committee is making some practical recommendations which we wish to put in place now. We have briefly shared our intentions with the honourable Minister responsible and the senior staff of the Ministry and all the Councils on the way forward as per our Recommendations No. 12, 13,14, and possibly 15, on the audit issues that were continuously raised by the Office of the Auditor- General as well as the Public Accounts Committee over the years. Those are: Recommendation No. 12 All the Councils, with the help of the Ministry of Local Government, within the next three months to submit an Action Plan to the Committee and Parliament on the updating of all Financial Accounts and clearance of all unsubstantiated balances, as well as identifying and resolving all audit issues raised from 2013 to 2018. The Action Plan should include recommendations and implementations of verifications and finally, any recommendation for write-off. Recommendation No. 13 Subsequently within the next 6 months, we hope can be done by January 2025, after the submission of the Action Plan, as stated in our recommendation 12, all actions must be implemented in the 2025 financial period. Hence, the 2024 accounts should be the last that face a delay and/or contain an audit issue that may deem the account modified or qualified. Recommendation No. 14 As with our Recommendations 12 and 13, any write-off and/or adjustment to the account balances should follow the approved laws and guidelines and those are: 14.1 pursuant to section 34(1)(a) of the Financial Management Act 2004, which provides for the provision for writing off public money, the authority is with the Minister of Finance to inter alia write off losses in respect of public money and that is after scrutiny and further checking whether we can verify some of those long unsubstantiated credit balances. 14.2 Pursuant to subsection 2, the power to write off losses includes the power to abandon or discontinue the recovery of amounts of revenues, debts and overpayments.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>376</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 14.3 The Ministry of Local Government with the councils after making their last attempt to clear the outstanding matters, should write to the Ministry of Finance in line with our recommendations 14.1 and 14.2. 14.4 The Ministry to ensure that the uniform internal controls and measures supposedly to be in place with the councils from 2017-2018 be monitored strictly so that the same timely and quality issues will not be repeated and that is reflected through unqualified audits. Recommendation No. 15 Adequate additional Budget must be set aside for the Office of the Auditor-General to bring the audited accounts up to date, especially up to 2024 and also 2025 financial year. Madam Deputy Speaker, with the above specific recommendations as highlighted, we anticipate that all issues will be cleared in the 2025 account. At this juncture, I wish to extend my sincere appreciation to the Committee Members, who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report, namely, honourable Sakiusa Tubuna (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand. I also extend my appreciation to honourable Isikeli Tuiwailevu, honourable Aseri Radrodro, honourable Virendra Lal, honourable Taito Matasawalevu and honourable Vijay Nath, who stood in as Alternate Members, pursuant to Standing Order 115(5). Most importantly, Madam Deputy Speaker, in view of the Committee’s findings, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts recommends that Parliament takes note of the recommendations in this Report. Madam Deputy Speaker, with those few words, I now commend this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion without notice: That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

Review Report – Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption 2017-2018 Annual Report HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Madam Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 38(2) of the Standing Orders of Parliament, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was referred the Fiji Independent Commission against Corruption Annual Report 2017-2018 on 27 th March, 2023. Madam Deputy Speaker, this Report captures the review findings and recommendations of the Committee with respect to the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) Annual Report.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>377 Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee noted seven key findings from its review, and these are on the: 1. 2. 3. 4. Rationale on filing a nolle prosequi on the matter of certain disposed cases. Involvement of Ministry of Health Officials in corruption-related offences. Selection of communities by FICAC to conduct training sessions on corruption prevention. Effectiveness of the awareness programme undertaken by the FICAC on selected communities. Education level of the National Anti-Corruption Curriculum taught in Schools. 5. 6. Monitoring and Reporting mechanism of FICAC in achieving targets set out in the Sustainable Development Goals. 7. Unclear terms derived on certain expenditures by the Commission as listed under the Financial Statements of its Report. Madam Deputy Speaker, those were some of the key findings that the Committee had noted from its review and I, therefore, would like to highlight some of the recommendations that the Committee agreed upon, and they are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The Committee recommended that the Commission provides timely submission of its annual reports to Parliament. The Committee recommends that the Commission ensures there is a formal SDG compliant component in all future reports. Furthermore, that the annual peer review report be also in the schedule of all future reports. The Committee recommends that communities such as Rotuma, Rabi, Kioa and Melanesian communities be also visited annually to conduct such trainings, given that these communities are confirmed recipients of project development funds from the Office of the Prime Minister. The Committee recommends that the training information be translated into all vernacular languages in Fiji, and it not be limited to any. The Committee recommends that the anti-corruption education be emphasised at all educational levels, from primary to tertiary, and it to be part of the compulsory curriculum. Madam Deputy Speaker, those were some of the recommendations that the Committee had sought following its review of the FICAC Annual Report. In that respect, Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Committee’s Report on the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Annual Report from 1 st August, 2017 to 31 st July, 2018 to this august Parliament and seek the support of all the honourable Members to take note of the recommendations by the Committee.
