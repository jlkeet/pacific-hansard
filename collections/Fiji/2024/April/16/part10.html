<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery and those watching proceedings on television and online. Thank you for taking an interest in the workings of your Parliament. PL100 Students – University of the South Pacific Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming another cohort of PL100 students sitting in the public gallery. Welcome, it is good to see you. They are Government and Politics Law students from the University of the South Pacific. Welcome to your Parliament and I hope the proceedings this morning will give you a better idea of how your Parliament works. Kabara Cricket Team You might have also noticed some gentlemen in the purple jerseys. I walked in and I thought they were from the Melbourne Storm. They are, in fact, members of the Kabara Cricket Team who are with us in the gallery this morning. Ni sa bula vinaka saka, malo, welcome to your Parliament. It is a pleasure to have you join us today.</p></body>
