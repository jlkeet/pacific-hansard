<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h4><p><span class="speaker">MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs has given notice to make a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40. He may speak up to 20 minutes and after that, I will invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate following that. I now call upon on the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to deliver his statement. Constitutional Offices Commission HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and I also wish to greet those who are listening in or watching via television, livestream or listening to the radio or Walesi App. I also acknowledge the presence of Law students from the University of the South Pacific and also the newly crowned cricket champion - the Kabara Team. They are very proud to be sitting in the gallery and their self-appointed Manager is the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. (Laughter) Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement on the Constitutional Offices Commission (COC) which I Chair and is mandated by the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. The COC is established under Section 132(1) of the Constitution of Fiji. The Commission comprises the Prime Minister as the Chairperson, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the honourable Attorney-General, two persons appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, and one person appointed by the President on the advice of the honourable Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister’s current nominees are Ms. Cema Bolabola and Mr. John Apted. The honourable Leader of the Opposition’s nominee is Roko Tupou Draunidalo. The Secretary of the Commission is the Solicitor-General, who is assisted by the Secretariat Team of designated Senior Legal Officers in the Office of the Solicitor-General. Madam Deputy Speaker, under Section 133 of the Constitution of Fiji, the COC is responsible for providing advice to the President on the appointment of the following Officers, the: • • • • • • • Chairperson and members of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission; Chairperson and the members of the Electoral Commission; Supervisor of Elections; Secretary-General to Parliament; Chairperson and members of the Public Service Commission; Commissioner of Police; Commissioner of the Fiji Corrections Service;</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>379 • • • Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces; Auditor-General; and Governor of the Reserve Bank. Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Section 138(4) of the Constitution of Fiji, the COC establishes and maintains its own rules and regulations, governing its internal procedures and functions. As such, the COC, for the first time, resolved to consider formulating its own Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with respect to the conduct of its procedures and functions. Following that decision, the first draft of the COC’s SOPs were circulated among the members. Madam Deputy Speaker, for the information of Parliament, COC was allocated $20,000 for this financial year. At present, the SOPs are being reviewed by the COC members, to ensure that it is comprehensive, it is coherent and compliant with the constitutional provisions and the objectives of COC. The SOPs will serve as a starting point for COC to implement and enforce its functions and responsibilities in alignment with the stipulated sections of the Constitution. The draft SOPs contain procedures with respect to the quorum for COC meetings, appointment and tenure of COC members, responsibilities of the secretary to the COC, the appointment process for constitutional office holders, dealing with urgent COC matters, decision making processes of COC, the independence of COC and provisions regarding regular updates and advice to Parliament. Once finalised, these SOPs will not only streamline the internal operations of the COC, but it will also provide clarity and guidance to its members regarding their roles and responsibilities. Additionally, Madam Deputy Speaker, transparency and accountability within the COC, fostering trusts amongst stakeholders and the public of Fiji. It is expected that the finalised SOPs will be officially adopted by the COC following thorough deliberations and consensus building amongst its members. For the benefit of Parliament, under the COC, we have seen the appointment of Mr. Luke Rokovada as the Chairman of the Public Service Commission and Ms. Barbara Malimali as Chairperson of the Electoral Commission. The following substantive offices are currently vacant: the SOPs will enhance Supervisor of Elections; 1. 2. Auditor-General; and 3. Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service. However, there are existing acting appointments in those offices namely, Ms. Ana Mataiciwa as the Acting Supervisor of Elections; Mr. Sairusi Dukuno as the Acting Auditor-General and Ms. Salote Panapasa as the Acting Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service, all of whom were appointed by His Excellency the President on the advice under my tenure. The recruitment process for these substantive officers is underway and the COC intends to deliberate on the suitable candidates for the appointment in its next meeting later this month. Madam Deputy Speaker, for the first time ever, the COC established an Independent Committee to advice the COC on the appropriate remunerations and allowances that should be payable to all constitutional officers under its responsibility as referred to earlier. The Independent Committee consists of Mr. Cama Raimuria as Chairperson, Ms. Salote Uluinaceva and Ms. Elenoa Biukoto. The remuneration and allowances for future appointments, including those for Supervisor of Elections, Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service and Auditor-General will be based on the recommendation of the Independent Committee as mandated by Section 136(2) of the Constitution.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>380</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 Unfortunately, Madam Deputy Speaker, the previous COC did not adhere to that constitutional requirement, and some of the previous office holder’s remunerations or allowances are subject to certain investigations by the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption. During its meetings on 18 th and 26 th January of last year, the COC considered serious complaints of abuse of office made against certain former constitutional officers, namely the: 1. 2. 3. Supervisor of Elections - Mr. Mohammed Saneem; Commissioner for Fiji Corrections Service - Mr. Francis Kean; and currently suspended Police Commissioner - Mr. Sitiveni Qiliho. Those individuals were provided an opportunity to respond to the allegations, following which the COC deliberated on whether, based on the allegations made, the question of their removal ought to be investigated, in which case the COC was required to appoint a tribunal in accordance with Section 137(3)(a) of the Constitution. A tribunal appointed will be required to inquire into the matter and provide its written report to His Excellency the President. In the case of Mr. Saneem as Supervisor of Elections, the COC received a complaint against Mr. Saneem which had not been dealt with by the former COC members. On 6 th January, 2023, this complaint was forwarded to Mr. Saneem to provide any necessary responses before the COC decided on whether to appoint a tribunal to investigate the complaints in accordance with Section 137(4) of the Constitution. Mr. Saneem responded on 9 th January, 2023 to those complaints and his responses were brought before the COC. On 26 th January, 2023, the COC after considering the complaints and responses provided by Mr. Saneem agreed to refer the allegations to a tribunal composed of the honourable Justice Filimoni Jitoko as Chairperson, the honourable Justice William Calanchini and the former honourable Judge Jiten Singh. On the advice of the COC, the President suspended Mr. Saneem, pending the referral and appointment of the tribunal. However before the tribunal could conduct its work, Mr. Saneem resigned as Supervisor of Elections, bringing that matter to an end. In the case of Mr. Kean as Commissioner of Corrections Service, the COC received five complaints against him. On 18 th January, 2023, these complaints were forwarded to Mr. Kean to provide the necessary responses before the COC decided on whether to appoint a tribunal to investigate the complaints in accordance with Section 137(4) of the Constitution. Mr. Kean responded on 23 rd January, 2023 to those complaints and his responses were brought before the COC. On 26 th January, 2023, the COC agreed to refer the complaints of misbehaviour to a tribunal to enquire into the complaints and provide a report to the President. However, Mr. Kean tendered his resignation letter on 14 th February, 2023, and therefore there was no need to proceed with the tribunal proceedings. In the case of Mr. Qiliho, the Commissioner of Police, three separate complaints of misbehaviour were lodged against him. On 26 th January, 2023 the COC agreed to refer those complaints of misbehaviour to a tribunal to enquire into the complaints and provide a report to the President. The COC also agreed to recommend the suspension of Mr. Qiliho to the President which is still in place. Overall, ensuring the smooth operations of constitutional offices has been the cornerstone of the COC’s work in recent years reflecting its ongoing commitment to efficiency and functionality within this vital institution. Building on these initiatives on 3 rd November, 2023, the COC embarked on laying the ground work for establishing an independent secretariat. The start is pivotal in enhancing the COC’s capacity to facilitate its functions effectively, ensuring streamlined processes and better support its functions.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>381 Madam Deputy Speaker, in recent weeks complaints against constitutional office holders have been highlighted in various media reports. In accordance with due processes and the rules of natural justice, all complaints against constitutional officers will be dealt with by the Commission. The officers in question will be given the opportunity to respond before the Commission makes any further decision in accordance with the Constitution. I expect an update on these at the upcoming meeting of the COC of the week beginning 29th April, 2024 and thereafter will update Parliament and the people of Fiji on the work of the Commission. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me take this opportunity to say ‘thank you’ to the honourable Prime Minister for delivering this Ministerial Statement on the Constitutional Offices Commission. As we all know, Madam Deputy Speaker, the COC forms a very critical component as provided for in our Constitution. In the actual Constitution, as spelt out by the honourable Prime Minister, the performance and functions of each of those commissions and tribunals is looked after within Section 138 of the Constitution and it applies to the: Electoral Commission; Judicial Services Commission; Legal Aid Commission; 1. Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission; 2. 3. 4. 5. Mercy Commission; 6. 7. Accountability and Transparency Commission; 8. 9. Constitutional Offices Commission; and 10. any tribunal or medical board established or appointed under this Constitution to Public Service Disciplinary Tribunal; Public Service Commission; consider the question of removal from office of any person. So, that particular section applies to those bodies and the performance or functions of commissions and tribunals and those particular performances and functions of those tribunals. What I am referring to honourable Prime Minister, within that particular section, there is a sub-section 3 which reads, and I quote: “A decision of a commission, tribunal or board to which this section applies requires the concurrence of a majority of its members and the commission, tribunal or board to which this section applies may act despite the absence of a member but, if, in a particular case, a vote is taken to decide a question and the votes cast are equally divided, the person presiding must exercise a casting vote.” Why I read this, I think this is very applicable to something that you have before you and something that had been floated about in our social media with respect to issues that have been raised by a particular Chairman from them. It is not for us to adjudicate upon it, Sir, it is for the COC to do so. That is a very important provision especially regarding the concurrence of a majority of its members. So, when in receipt of something from one of these chairpersons, we must always ensure that, that letter has come by virtue of concurrence from the actual Commission. On an overview perspective, obviously, the functions and responsibilities like has been covered, the COC oversees the appointment of quite a number of people and there is a constitutional mandate. Madam Deputy Speaker, most of all, the COC’s mandate is to uphold the Constitution by ensuring that a fair and transparent process is there for appointments for Constitutional Office,</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>382</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>16 th April, 2024 something which the honourable Prime Minister has actually spelt out. We are happy to see that as an SOP currently being worked out with respect to all of those being at the forefront of that particular SOP. The independence of the COC is critically important to a country like ours because this body encompasses important institutions within Fiji. The independence of the COC and what we must also remember is the transparency issue is critically important also. The transparency and accountability of the Commission itself is important. When you actually sit there whether it be as Chairman or whether it be as a normal member, you actually put a very different hat on because these bodies that you are actually looking after are critical components in the efficient running of a nation. Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have said, the mandate is to uphold the Constitution. There is one issue, what we really want to know is in terms of the development of the SOP, honourable Prime Minister, what is actually being followed or who are we looking at? What are the guidelines that have been given regarding this SOP? Who was it been given by? Is it being a transparent process where we are looking at, even with a SOP, although it is a self-governing issue, you are allowed to within the constitution, it is important that the public actually knows, apart from the people who are involved in the development of the SOP, is it the independent institutions that have been allowed to be a party to and privy to the development of that SOP? We commend the Government with respect to its strong commitment to the COC, as I have said, it forms a critical component for all of us and we believe that by addressing head-on the recent concerns as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister, we are actually fostering a culture of transparency. I commend the honourable Prime Minister’s move to actually ensure that all of that is done. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I see the time is around 10.26 a.m. and I will be adjourning Parliament for morning tea. I trust that the speakers in the morning tea room in the Big Committee Room have been fixed so at least the volume turned up so we do not miss the bell like most of us did yesterday morning. Thank you, honourable Members, enjoy your morning tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.26 a.m.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>16 th April, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>383 The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming another group of law students from the University of the South Pacific. Welcome to your Parliament, ladies and gentlemen. I hope that you will learn a few aspects this morning of how your Parliament works.</p></body>
