<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT- MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, NATIONAL SECURITYAND POLICING 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT- MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY AND POLICING 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing Annual Report 2018-2019 which was tabled on 21 st November, 2023. HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report has five recommendations. You are well versed of this Report yourself and before I gloss through the recommendations, if I may just take this opportunity to wish our peacekeepers all the best especially those serving in the Middle- East given what is happening over there, the attack from Iran to Israel, those in the Golan would be somewhere in the middle, those serving in Iraq much more closer to Iran; our prayers are with them and their families. Madam Deputy Speaker, the five recommendations in this Report, we feel that if the Ministry implements will help them in achieving the outcomes that they have. The fifth recommendation is on the War Memorial, and we are recommending that attempts be made to finish the National War Memorial, I think almost all the names that are there at the War Memorial has some connections to most of the Fijians. We hope that some money can be allocated in the next financial year to finish off that project. The recommendation on the Search and Rescue Bill is a good one, we are recommending that it be fast-tracked so that we can have this umbrella where the Search and Rescue Manual comes under. It will establish the Fiji Rescue and Coordination Centre. Also, there is a recommendation on human trafficking. We found that there was very little information on human trafficking, both from the Ministry and also from the Fiji Police. We called both the staff from the Ministry and the Police during our talanoa session. We find that very little information is provided in that report on human trafficking, but I think the Ministry and the Police are the two responsible agencies for dealing with human trafficking. We get reported on by the US and we are given a rating on human trafficking, we are currently on tier 2. We are asking that human trafficking be part of the Report so that it remains at the forefront of policymakers thinking because the people that do it, they go underground. There is a recommendation on the Security Industry Act 2010 and the need for it to be reviewed as and when required and perhaps put in place the measures to collect the fees. There is a much outstanding fee, we understand that those outstanding fees had to do with COVID-19 also. They were allowed to just operate and collect the fees afterwards and perhaps that can be done. I will leave it there, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I think there are some who would like to speak on those topics. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and the list of speakers is as follows: 1. Honourable Aliki Bia; 2. Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration;</p><p>416 Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 3. Honourable Ioane Naivalurua; and 4. Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; HON. A. BIA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to make my contribution on the Report before Parliament which is the Review of the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing Annual Report 2018 - 2019. At this juncture, I would like to thank the Committee Chairman and the members of the Committee for their thorough deliberation and findings on the Report being reviewed. I wish to dwell on one of the important findings of the Committee and that is the call for a Review of the Security Industry Act. The Committee clearly highlighted in the Report that there is no mechanism in place to establish the total number of security companies in Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Review Report by the Committee noted that they were informed by the Ministry that a draft Cabinet Paper has been prepared to advise Cabinet of the review of the Security Industry Act. It is very critical and important to fast track this review of the Security Industry Act given the role they play in our communities and neighbourhood. Given the increase of social issues and continuous change of the behavioural pattern of our young generation, this also increases the threat our local security officers face on a daily basis. Madam Deputy Speaker, proper scrutiny of security companies is vital to ensure that they recruit the best people for the job. If you look at the context of the work of our security officers, they are very close to our homes more than the police officers. So, families in the communities do entrust their safety and protection of their wealth and assets to the security officers when they are at any job site given on the day. Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the Committee in the call for a review of the Security Industry Act to ensure that security personnel and various security companies are well resourced and equipped with the necessary tools of maintaining the safety and peace of all Fijians. With that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion and the Report before Parliament. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all I thank you for the opportunity to share a few thoughts on the Report of the Committee that is before Parliament right now and a Committee of which you are a member. As your Chairman had alluded to earlier that you are quite familiar with the recommendations that are here, the five main ones are noted. Today I would like to stick to the five recommendations and inform Parliament and the nation in terms of what the Ministry is doing, particularly about these recommendations that you have put to Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Chairman and the Members of the Standing Committee for a very comprehensive Report. I know that the Report was for 2018 and 2019, but I note that some of the recommendations that you have made are quite pertinent to now and the experiences that we are facing and the needs that we have. The first thing that I would like to assure Parliament today is that the Ministry is cognisant of this Report and the recommendations that are within because it is actually quite elaborate, and I thank the Committee for that. The Chairman of the Committee has actually shared much of the information that I would like to inform Parliament, particularly some of the Bills and the legislations that the Committee is proposing because these are really ongoing, particularly about the search and rescue that the Chairman had referred to earlier. This is very important. In the last Cabinet, we discussed about the</p><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 417 Disaster Management Policy of Government going forward. It has not come to Parliament yet but it is kind of trying to integrate all of the national effects, allow for all of us to work together and part of that also is search and rescue on how Government deals with the agencies, particularly the Republic of Fiji Navy that does a lot of this work at sea, also and those that have to go out into inland to do search and rescue. The legislation is surely supposed to complement that search and rescue. We will continue to push for these legislations, particularly the Bill to come before Parliament. I know that the Search and Rescue Manual was launched in 2019 so the Bill is yet to be tabled. Secondly, I want to talk about human trafficking. The mention of the National Action Plan and the National Referral Mechanism, which is what they are calling now, we have a National Committee that is looking at that chaired by the Ministry. Obviously, this is a very complex area as the Chairman has mentioned and the lack of data is something we recognise, but that has been a persistent issue, we recognise that and we want to improve on it. It is the safety of our people, we hear all these sorts of ridiculous stories about people trying to steal our nationals so to speak and take them overseas for reasons of their own. We are very mindful of that, and we would like to make sure that we do not continue to repeat the same mistakes but that can only be done by good data. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like talk about the Security Industry Act. This is also under review at the moment and the honourable Member is quite right in that a lot of people, companies in particular, homes depend on security officers, but we have got to make sure that they are properly legislated and certain laws allow them to be able to do their work properly and secure their own homes and businesses. We are understanding of that need, and we would like to respond to it. The Security Industry Act obviously is something that we are reviewing because it requires the stringent measures that we need to put in place to be able to ensure the companies that we register, and they are coming by the dozens are effective and value for money for Fiji. They are actually there for the purpose of which people have sought their services. The fourth recommendation refers to vacancies within the Ministry. A lot of that has been filled for the benefit of the Committee. We are experiencing a very high turnover especially at the Department of Immigration and it is very hard to keep these people here because they are very attractive on the market, so we need to continually look at this as well, especially now that we have the Department of Immigration in our care, subject to a lot of debate right now as well as the Ministry too. We are commencing the National Security and Defence Review, so we are reviewing the whole Ministry. Really this is the central of the work that we want to do. Once the head is fixed then I am sure, the three major functions under Ministry; the RFMF, Fiji Police Force and the Immigration that have their own legislations and laws should be able to align with the national policies that the values that we want to uphold. That really is the essence of a lot of the work that we do, and this report is about that. I would like to assure Parliament and the Committee for bringing this Report that we are trying as much as we can to, not only fill these vacancies, but make sure that we are staffed and equipped properly to do the work that we are mandated to do. Last but not least, on the matter of the War Memorial that is in the work that we want to do next year, we are doing some of the maintenance work right now but those additions that the Committee has alluded to, one particular one is the National War Museum. I think the building is there and that is one of the major recommendations. We are allocating money for that. I know there is a lot of RFMF and military historians that want to capture the stories of our experiences in the past. Unfortunately, there is no place where this is stored and we would like to make that available to the</p><p>418 Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 public to understand the sacrifices that our ancestors made for us to be able to be here today, particularly technically providing for us the peace that we enjoy. It is also very important to remember the past, so part of this work that we are doing and hopefully something that we are putting up to Ministry of Finance in this next year’s budget is to help us build the National War Museum. So former Commanding Officers of the First Battalion and Second Battalion, I know the First Commanding Officer of the Second Battalion is very eager to capture the lessons from Sinai from when it started. We are working hard plus all of the other requirements in trying to make the National War Memorial a place that we can all go to and honour the memory of those that had served their lives for our future and also for our today. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my contribution to the motion on the floor will be very short, especially after the presentation by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs. His made my work much easier and shorter. Let me take this time to simply say that human trafficking is here. It is happening here at home not only locally but also abroad. That is the reality of the situation. If it is not addressed, confronted, or effectively taken care of, it can be the same as what we are confronted with right now with drugs. We had talked about many substantives and very important issues relating to our economy, prosperity and the future, but you know and I know that all these things can only come about when we have a safe, stable home and prosperity; economic growth will come. Madam Deputy Speaker, the issue at hand therefore to me and I am sure to all of us is absolutely critical at this point in time. Not many of us understand what human trafficking in person is all about. Let me relate very shortly my experience with this. When I was in China as a representative of Fiji, we received an urgent report relating to three females who were stranded in Hong Kong. It took us some time to intervene. To cut the story short, when we sent a team to Hong Kong, we found out that they were lured into Hong Kong for a job opportunity. When we traced and investigated further, they were basically reported here at home as missing from home. Madam Deputy Speaker, that is exactly how many of us understand what human trafficking in person is about. I thank the honourable Minister for his assurances of the things that needs to be done and addressed to this particular issue. We have noted there is progress at work under the National Action Plan and I hope that there will be closer supervision and oversight of the work to get all those outstanding issues done. Perhaps in conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the benefit of Parliament let me read out to you the definition of human trafficking in person under the Palermo Protocol and I quote: “Trafficking in person shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person, having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.” That is an accepted definition of human trafficking in persons. Madam Deputy Speaker, let me end by urging the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, to make sure that all those outstanding Action Plans are dealt with. Secondly, I also appeal to the</p><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 419 honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for the support of this Human Trafficking Unit. We have a small element of it at the Home Affairs Headquarters but has a budget of only $10,000. I hope given the nature and the substantive issue of this, that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister may consider, and likewise, at the Police operational level, a full support on handling of these issues. Madam Deputy Speaker, I support this fully. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the motion that is before Parliament this afternoon on the Review of the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing Annual Report of 2018-2019. Perhaps, if you would just allow me to first wish our strong 80 RFMF and 20 Police Officers or 100 security personnel from Fiji, who flew out of Fiji on Saturday to join the Solomon Islands International Assistance Force in the country’s preparation towards their General Election which will happen tomorrow. I am sure that like the Solomon Islands population, would rely on security forces during the Elections prior and after, we, and our population here in Fiji, rely on our strong RFMF and our Police Force to provide us with the necessary security along our EEZ, our land and our local policing scenarios. They were farewelled in Nadi by the Commander of the Joint Task Force Command (JTFC), Brigadier-General Manoa Gadai, on Saturday past. Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend the Report that have been shared and commented on today. I must say it is a very hard task to speak after three decorated soldiers who had taken the floor today, one a former Commander, a former Police Commissioner, Deputy Commander of the RFMF and, of course, the present Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration. They have, of course, set a very high bar for me this afternoon, beginning with a very funny joke. Of course, we note, Madam Deputy Speaker, the need to strengthen the policies on human trafficking, to address the issue of human trafficking, nationally and transnationally, that has been shared on the floor of Parliament this afternoon. We have a very tough legislation, tough in its definition, tough in its sentencing as well. I guess the problem is in detection, investigation and in prosecution, and those might be areas that, of course, some source of Government assistance and funding will also have to be directed towards, so that we can make our contribution to this rather larger than all of us international human trafficking problem. Fiji also has recently signed the Palermo Protocol which is the only global binding international instrument that contains agreed upon definition that has been shared in Parliament today by honourable Naivalurua on the trafficking of persons. Of course, Fiji is still considered a tier two in terms of effort by Government on anti-trafficking capacity as published in the US 2023 Report. Although, we know that we are probably not fully compliant at this stage, we all would agree that as a country and as a bipartisan Parliament, we are making every significant effort to be compliant with the required standard. Madam Deputy Speaker, in contribution today from my Ministry, we are delighted to say that from our part, we have secured land for the construction of the Maritime Essential Services Centre, which is up in construction in Lami. Of course, that is going to be monitored and mastered by the Fiji Navy. Over the years, we have worked hard to secure Government Stations for Police Posts, Military Bases and camps, and this also includes the Vuda Ex-Serviceman Battery Site up in the hills</p><p>420 Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 16 th April, 2024 of Lomolomo. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry anticipates working with the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing; Ministry of Youth and Sports; Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection; and the Ministry of Local Government and Housing in securing viable land that would provide for recreational and sporting spaces that would be used by our youth and children, so that it brings out a positive impact in their wellbeing and security, thus taking them away from the urges of urban crime and its incentives. We have recently visited some sites here along the Suva-Nausori corridor, where, in the next financial year, we will be putting across to the Ministry of Finance some funding requests so that we can build proper parks, volleyball courts, basketball courts, as well as spaces where our children will be able to play in their spare time, thus, achieving what we all want them to achieve, that is, to take them out from the invitation to depart from crimes in their communities. Madam Deputy Speaker, through the capital projects of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources this year, we have been able to upgrade the Geodetic Datum, that has allowed, over the years, a systemic and incremental improvement to the accuracy and position of our global positioning system for our Fiji Navigation System. Also, this is significant in assisting search and rescue for our Fiji Navy, and it includes also the monitoring of our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, in 2022, had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Fiji Police Force in the monitoring of the illegal river gravel and sand activities, and also to assist in the protection of these development resources, working in collaboration in information sharing through community policing and also would be paramount for our Ministry and also in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence. I support the motion before Parliament, Madam Deputy Speaker. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, if I can just use this few minutes, just to put a bit of emphasis on the first recommendation on search and rescue and the need for the Bill to be hurried through, if you like. Search and rescue is quite complex. You have maritime search and rescue, land search and rescue, aeronautical search and rescue – sometimes it starts in the air and ends up as land rescue or as a maritime rescue. So, there is a lot of moving parts and a lot of agencies that are involved in search and rescue. Madam Deputy Speaker, just three weeks ago, I was getting into my car at Cost-U-Less when this lady came up to me with a painting and said, “This is for you.” I took the painting and was looking at her, not too sure. I was trying to remember her name, but I could not put a name to the face. Then she said, “Liliana from Vanuavatu. Do you remember me?” Then I remembered that this this lady who would be 44 years now, we had rescued her 29 years ago when she was 15 years old. She and her elder sister who was 18 years. A successful search and rescue in the most atrocious weather conditions and she introduced me to her husband and children - two girls. I was looking at them and said, “Man, had we failed that day, those two girls will not be standing there.” But search and rescue is a lifesaving mission and when we do it well, with the organisation flows, we are able to save lives, like this lady, Liliana. That was way back in 1995 and the honourable Prime Minister was the Prime Minister then at that time. It involved a lot of agencies. We had called the Ministry, it was the Ministry of Home Affairs</p><p>16 th April, 2024 Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 421 then, for some money to charter an aircraft to fly, it was nearly dark, which was Fiji Airways. They flew, we could not see them, then we had to ask for the search and rescue plane that was in New Caledonia. We had to involve the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that they can get diplomatic clearance, et cetera. They flew, they located, and we managed to save these two girls who are now adults. I think both of them are grandmothers, these two ladies. So, I would like to say that the Search and Rescue Bill is really needed as the umbrella so that all these little pieces can be put in a way in the manual and all the agencies that are involved in trying to save lives are included in there. It is smooth and the result would be like that lady. We can save lives if it is done well. With those few words, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish the honourable Minister and staff well in the big job that they do in keeping our country safe. I certainly commend the motion to Parliament for noting. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
