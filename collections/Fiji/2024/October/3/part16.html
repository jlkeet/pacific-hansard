Vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- I think, through that question, the honourable Minister has really challenged the Fijian diaspora to see how best it can retain this very much important part of our identity, and that is our language. Whilst we were seeking the official language to be part of our language to confirm what is in the Constitution and what we practice, we took a leaf out of India. They have 20 official languages and about 7,000 languages, and yet still speak their languages in their very own Parliament. Some prefer to speak in English, some begin with their own vernacular, and then they suddenly change to English. But for us, it is a whole new challenge, and with respect to what the Ministry is undertaking. For me, my tribe originated from Vanualevu, we still have our links there. We still have our yavu there. But in Taveuni, the dialect sounds funny now because we are speaking most of our communication in the Bauan dialect and that is unbecoming. When we say tomorrow in the real Cakaudrove dialect, we say se bogi caca ni sou bogi, in the Bauan dialect it is just ni mataka and our young children are speaking that. Road is wa’olo, in the Bauan dialect it is gaunisala. So, there is a big mix there. Since we were relocated to Taveuni, we confronted the Lauan, upper Lauan and the Laucala dialect and that gives us a very difficult time, especially when we try and reintroduce our own genuine dialect. It is quite difficult, but I think we will push ahead with that and that remains a challenge for us to undertake.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>2164</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 Participation of Women and Youth in Co-operatives (Question No. 251/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.R:</span> VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament how the Ministry is working towards increasing participation of women and youth in Co- operatives? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vocea for his question. Of course, I had spoken about co-operatives in terms of overall registration and the positive impact it has been having in terms of rural livelihoods. As we all know, the co-operatives are ideal as well for women and youth participation in economic activities and is actually quite a valuable tool when it comes to empowering women and youth by creating income generating activities. Of course, the Ministry of Trade is very committed, Sir, to fostering inclusive economic growth and specifically focusing on expanding the role of women and youth in co-operatives. Just by way of some data, Sir, in the West alone, we witnessed in terms of membership, an increase of about 148 percent for women, female membership, raising the proportion of women cooperatives in total from 12 percent to 24 percent over the last year. This growth has been the result of some comprehensive outreach campaigns, tailored training programmes and financial support systems that have started encouraging more women participation, and I refer particularly to the Ministry of Women, who have been advocating strongly for women in business and of course, other multilateral organisation as well. Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that Fiji's youth represent a tremendous opportunity as well for cooperative growth. I would like to specifically call out the honourable Minister for Youth who has communicated a message to all our young men and women and where they want to set up business initiatives, that they do them through cooperatives. And so similarly, we are seeing encouraging signs in terms of the growth of cooperatives, youth-based cooperatives, and we will continue to focus on that. As we know, young people bring fresh ideas and entrepreneurial spirit that comes with youth, Sir, that can propel cooperatives going forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just sighting some examples of where we have collaborated, in terms of women, and also youth. I will just pick two examples, Sir. I think we all have heard of Rise Beyond the Reef. This is a very innovative and excellent women empowerment programme. They have just opened their first shop in Denarau, I think. Before they used to supply through Amazon and supply on an order basis. I believe they are also in Tappoos in terms of selling their products. Recently they have opened their shop, and we have been assisting them on and off for some time, including during honourable Koya’s time. The models, Sir, and the way it is setup, the ladies are sewing in their various homes and then they bring their product together to a central location, and then it is delivered to the distribution centre. One of the team came up with the idea of actually helping fund the sewing machines for these ladies. So, right now, we have just recently funded up to 14 members of the Rise Beyond the Reef women to the amount of $11,988 and the bulk of that money has been used to buy sewing machines and you could say, producing more in terms of income.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2165 In terms of the Ministry for Youth, we are moving around with the Ministry for Youth in terms of some of the programmes that they are doing. One of the ones that comes to mind is the recent Yasayasa Moala Youth Festival in Lau, where we conducted cooperative awareness and registration for participating youth groups. Later this month as well, Sir, we will be visiting Kadavu to conduct awareness sessions and registration to enable them to effectively participate in economic activities. Of course, Sir, with the challenges of drugs that we are facing, these initiatives are ways of addressing the challenge with drugs and trying to encourage our youth to be productive members of our society and move away from the vagaries of drugs Sir. Of course, the Ministry also works very closely with the Ministry of Women, as I have mentioned, and currently we are also working with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through a programme called Markets for Change to empower and formalise successful women groups into co-operatives. Through some of these targeted approaches we have been able to register about 60 successful women led co-operatives. Formalisation of these women groups as co-operatives has opened up new opportunities such as, easier access to grants, particularly The Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRDP) which is very popular, which is facilitated by the Ministry. There is a later discussion about access to finance Bill later today, and that again will increase the opportunity for our co-operatives and MSME’s to actually access capital which is one of the biggest challenges when it comes to Micro, Small to Medium Enterprises and Co-operatives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, the Ministry is committed to both, Women and Youth in co- operatives, through more gender and youth sensitive policies. Over the last 3 years, a total of 398 women and youth have been appointed to Board positions in respective co-operatives, so that is an interesting and positive development as well. In terms of other initiatives, we are partnering with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations to continue to align our initiatives to global best practices on gender equality and youth empowerment. This will certainly allow us to implement new programmes, enhance existing ones, ensuring that the Fiji co-operative sector is not only inclusive but sustainable as well. The success that we have seen so far, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a testament, of course, the effectiveness of the prior Government initiatives and all we are doing is continuing to fine tune them. As I have mentioned in my previous speech, we do have a grant now that is specifically targeted to co-operatives, and we shall be utilising that. We are about to advertise that programme soon and this of course, will ensure that the co-operative movement continues to grow and hopefully directly address issues such as poverty alleviation in Fiji. Vinaka saka. HON. P. D. KUMAR. –Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister spoke at length about what women co-operatives, I would like to hear a little bit more about the youth co-operatives. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thought I had covered both adequately, I guess just some statistics that I did not read out. In the last couple of months, we have launched about 10 youth-based co-operatives from the awareness programmes that we are doing. What we are trying to do is encourage more youth to actually look at things such as farming opportunities within their respective areas because there are some successful youth co-operatives from the Tailevu area that came from the previous administration and that is working well. There are good co-operatives both in women and the youth currently in play and I am happy to provide more information if you need it.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>2166</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I do understand that some of the most successful co-operatives are women co-operatives currently on the books at the Ministry, but in terms of the youth, will the Co-operative Department, if it has not already, tried to see if we can tap into our school leavers and get into the education system to educate them regarding the co-operatives and how beneficial it can be? I say this, not lightly, honourable Minister, but because you build very good bonds whilst you were at school and those bonds can be taken through into business, et cetera, especially targeting the rural areas where the education system can incorporate maybe sessions with our cooperative people so the school leavers can see that there is an avenue to make some decent dole out of cooperatives. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Koya for that question. There is a move afoot to move down the awareness and education for co-operatives and MSMEs into education. You will recall that I think the TELS actually is launching an entrepreneurial university level entrepreneurial programme in this Budget. The allocation is about half a million, so that is a start. We are really keen to move the education of entrepreneurship into the education curriculum and we have been talking to the Ministry of Education. There are some service providers that are talking to the Ministry of Education at the moment in terms of moving the entrepreneurship down to education level. Generally, at the moment, entrepreneurship seems to be a vocation when we hit our forties and fifties like a pre-retirement vocation, but we believe from what we are seeing, there is massive entrepreneurial spirit with our youth and with our young and with the right encouragement and the right policy settings, we will create a more vibrant sort of entrepreneurial movement at that age level. It is a work in progress, education system, the curriculums being developed right now, and I certainly have had meetings with the service providers who are keen to provide education and training in that space. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question to the honourable Minister is more related to youth unemployment, and from your presentation we hear that there are not many youth co-operatives as compared to women and women cooperatives are there because it is out of necessity. They have to run their families, et cetera. How do you intend to really engage the youth so they can go into co- operatives and make things better for themselves and for their families? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- One of the things that we are doing right now is actually engaging a lot with the Ministry of Youth, particularly when they do festivals, we have a massive youth converging on a location. We are using that as the main opportunity to try and encourage youth, to sort of get involved in co-operatives. That is the main principal way that we are dealing with the co-operatives for youth at the moment. We are finding some success, and we will continue with that and then look at other modalities. I think, certainly the education will probably encourage more young men and women to get involved. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Supplementary question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. My question will be very specific due to the women co-operatives that used to work with Ministry of Fisheries for Mother Pearls Project. One is in Somosomo in Taveuni, one is in Raviravi in Macuata (next to Nakalou Village) and one is in Yaroi in Savusavu. They make pearls out of mother pearls after the pearl has been actually taken out. I want to know because these ladies had been established by NGOs and the Ministry of Fisheries went and built extra buildings for them to create. I just wanted to know about the project and how it is going especially with Justin Hunter having containers of mother pearls that have never been used and are just stored in containers.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> To be honest, I do not have the data with me at the moment.</p><p>I will get that information and provide that to honourable Koroilavesau, but it is a good question. I</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2167 will check on that particular co-operative group. MR. SPEAKER.- The one in Somosomo is running very well, run by women. They do not operate under a co-operative system, it is just loosely established by an NGO and then with the support of the Government. They have been provided with machines in how to make earrings, et cetera, but nothing beyond that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> That would be a good opportunity, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, Sir. We will take a break now, honourable Members for tea and when we resume, we will continue with the tenth Oral Question. The Parliament adjourned at 4.17 p.m.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>2168</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 4.57 p.m. Managing Village and Community Affairs (Question No. 254/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T:</span> KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>With the role of the Great Council of Chiefs being pivotal to the iTaukei people, especially in the rural village and tikina communities, can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts inform Parliament on how will the Government be able to manage village and community affairs with the universal individual freedoms espoused to by the international bodies, like the United Nations? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, balancing traditional village and community governance with the principle of universal individual freedom in Fiji is a delicate and sensitive task. We are navigating our way between protecting groups rights through customary law and upholding the Constitution, but generally there is a friction, and we want to set the tone of changing the laws, regulations and by-laws. When the GCC was reinstated in 2023, it was entrapped between the evolving iTaukei community moving with the wind of change versus protecting the fabric of iTaukei society that is rooted in communal living. With guidance from the research that the Ministry is doing, we are looking at are few options. Please, allow me to highlight a few possible areas that could be adopted by Government in order to manage the issue raised by the honourable Koroilavesau. (1) The customary law within Constitutional limits, where the Government can allow customary law and village governance system to operate as long as they do not infringe the Constitutional rights. (2) Clear guidelines could be established to ensure that traditional practice align with the national law. (3) Education and awareness - promoting awareness and educational programme can be rolled out to emphasise the importance of respecting individual rights while maintaining the value of community cohesion to reduce potential conflicts. (4) Consultative dialogue - continuous dialogue between the Government, chiefs and their community members can ensure that issues are resolved amicably. (5) Cultural sensitivity in policy implementation - when introducing new laws or reforms that promote individual freedoms, the Government should consult with local communities to make sure they understand the rationale and can adapt this reform without feeling that their traditional are under threat. (6) The legal mechanism for conflict resolution - establish a clear legal framework and special court that can help resolve conflict between individual rights and customary practice. (7) The gradual reform where village laws or tradition appears to infringe on individual freedom. Gradual reform might be preferable to allow for adaptation and reduce the risk of resistance.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2169 (8) Empowering of local leaders - traditional leaders can be empowered through training programmes that highlights both human rights and leadership in traditional context, to ensure that they become advocates for both cultural preservation and individual freedom. This is already proven through the sausauvou and sauvaki ni vanua training programme. (9) Clear guideline on autonomy - the Government could outline areas where village council and customary law have jurisdictions and where the rights guaranteed by the Constitution must prevail. For instance, matter like land tenure or traditional ceremony might remain under village control while issues concerning individual rights, movement, education or political expression are managed by national law. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole machinery of Government must respond to managing iTaukei community affairs. The reports of the review of GCC and the iTaukei Administrations have moved into these issues in more detail. In summary, the areas I have mentioned above will set the foundational limits of Government’s effort to managing the issue raised by the honourable Member. MR. SPEAKER.- There being no further questions and my apologies to the honourable Members that have already registered their questions, that is, from Question 252/2024 to Question No. 253/2024. I will now revert back to that, and I hope you will accept my apologies. Engagement of Learning at School - Students and Teachers (Question No. 252/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on how the Ministry ensures that Early Childhood, Primary and Secondary students and teachers are engaged in learning at school for the minimum required number of hours in a term? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I think the question is intended to be provided answers in two prongs. One is relating to resources and the other is probably related to processes within the Ministry of Education. I will just provide some indications on the monitoring of teachers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, close to 900 schools are located around Fiji, given their geographical location and advantages and disadvantages of their location, reachability and connectivity. How we monitor the schools, one is through the Head of School. They are qualified and also, they know the basic teachings and learning plans that they should set out in terms of preparing for their respective classes in their respective schools, despite how far they are from the main centres and main headquarters, they are expected to perform; a very crucial role in the monitoring and assisting the teachers and students in their respective schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the teaching hours of the respective schools for early childhood, a minimum of 20 hours is required per week, primary school 36 hours per week and secondary school is 37.5 hours per week as expected too with all the teachers. Every school has its own unique ethos and programmes in place and their programmes revolve around learning and teaching. We place a lot of emphasis on the trust that we give to the respective Heads of School and the teachers given the very crucial role that they play in nurturing the students in their respective schools. At the early childhood level, the Ministry has taken pro-active measures to provide early</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2170</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 childhood children with a stimulating learning environment and encourages exploration, creativity and social interaction. Also, by promoting play-based learning and personalised attention, the Ministry aims to keep our youngest learners engaged and excited about coming to school each day. For primary and secondary levels, the Ministry recognises the importance of maintaining a conducive learning environment that fosters academic growth and personal development. The curriculum is designed to be inclusive, engaging and relevant to catering the diverse needs and the interest of our students. Sir, the Ministry understands the very crucial role that the teachers play in shaping the education of our students and we are committed to give the necessary support also. Some of these include cluster organised professional development sessions, collaborating with teacher training institutions in the specific areas of STEM subjects through the provision of resources and training to keep them motivated and engaged in their profession. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the honourable Minister remains very positive, I and the parents feel that there is some sort of disconnect with his Permanent Secretary and his staff because in the issue of appointment of new teachers, the students are suffering. The question to the honourable Minister is, parents have raised their issue of teachers resigning by the day and re- appointments are not happening. How is the honourable Minister going to mitigate this to ensure that teachers are there, our children get their education they deserve because this is about the future of this country. What are you going to do about it, honourable Minister? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure what is the question that has been raised by the honourable Member, but as I said, there are challenges in terms of resources, maybe that is the intention of the question. The Ministry of Education is working towards mitigating those challenges in providing the necessary teachers. Some of the changes that were made in the previous government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is first they change the classification of schools from small, to medium to large, therefore, they allocated teaching resources accordingly which till to-date the teachers in their respective schools are still complaining because of the lack of teaching resources. For example, Dogotuki Primary School, it is a boarding school right in the interior of Macuata. They only have four teachers. Boarding accommodates from ECE level. This is an ongoing issue that we are wanting to resolve. Without executive teachers and this is something that we wanted to address, by appointing executive teachers in these respective schools to address these teacher shortages and the minimum hours required to operate in a school environment. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there may be certain fields or subject areas where there are shortage of teachers and due to which the students are not taught for the minimum required number of hours. How is the Ministry addressing this? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- These are inherited issues which he was responsible for when he was in charge of Human Resources. The honourable Member is fully aware of the situation. Do not worry, we are working towards improving that by providing the necessary teachers as per needed by the respective school. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- You are asking a question, you want the reply and then all are talking. So, who is going to listen? We will continue to the next question.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2171 Actions Taken to Alleviate Water Supply Shortage (Question No. 253/2024) HON. K. V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on what actions were taken to alleviate shortage of water supply to consumers during dry conditions and in which areas? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, water is a serious issue and I do understand how frustrating it can be. As I have already explained, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy considers an outcome of sustainability moving forward. But, of course, we face the ravages of climate change, and the Coalition Government is committed to addressing water issues, not only in terms of infrastructure but, of course, given the various challenges faced by climate change and the recent dry weather. Some of the affected areas included the Tamavua System which impacted on Princess Road, Tovata, Deuba, Navua, Korovou and Vunidawa. In the Western Division, 15 water sources have been impacted and six critical levels. The 15 water sources include - Narara Dam, Nakasia, Nalau, Nasici, Balevuto, Waiwai, Varaciva, Vareqe, Vaturu and Sigatoka. Some critical ones in terms of the dry weather include - Narara, Nakasia, Balevuto, Babau and Varaqe. In the Northern Division, areas impacted are Taganikula, Vunika, Nabouwalu, Bulileka, Dreketi and Seaqaqa. Some of the mitigation measures taken and immediate actions, the water rationing and scheduling have been introduced. This included structure water rationing and scheduling programmes to assist communities in managing water shortages in the areas I had mentioned. Of course, we have the free Water Tank Scheme. These have been distributed to various rural areas and also the affected areas and that scheme is still open. This Scheme enables residents, of course, to store water during water shortages and another temporary measure was the construction of temporary cofferdams. In the Western Division this was done at Varaciva, Nadrou and Qalau, and in in the Waimanu intake in the Central Division. We continue with public awareness and advisories in these various areas and the need to conserve water in terms of the dry weather. Of course, there have been close consultation with the Ministry of Rural Development and Maritime. I thank the Commissioners in the various Divisions, given their close monitoring of the situation and close consultation with the Water Authority of Fiji, which enabled us to quickly move in terms of alleviating these issues. Some of the areas include Yanuca, Vatulele and Yasawa. In terms of moving forward, of course, I had mentioned the leak detection. That is an ongoing work and long-term actions, which I will not repeat in terms of the investment of the water infrastructure I had mentioned yesterday. This is ongoing in terms of addressing the nation’s water issues, and of course moving forward with the upcoming cyclone season, we will continue to monitor and work closely with the Ministry of Rural Development and Disaster Management to ensure that our citizens are adequately catered for, whatever the situation may arise. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. With respect to the closure of Water Authority of Fiji’s water supply, certain times we have received complaints from citizens that WAF needs to think about the people, think about the children, the hospital workers and even</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>2172</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 Parliament and do these maintenance works during the night when everyone is sleeping. Just like today, we are notified that tomorrow our Parliament will be closed due to Water Authority of Fiji doing its maintenance work. Similarly, we have called the honourable Minister for Education to close the schools tomorrow, there could be situations where parents will be affected, and I thank the honourable Minister for listening to me. But he did not close the schools yet he is still contemplating but I urge the Government …. MR. SPEAKER.- There are certain areas only that we have been advised that there will be closure.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> I hope in future….</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> No, you listen when I am talking, honourable Member. I think they caught on to the sickness coming from this side. They are firing questions and all the explanations going on, it is so difficult. We have been advised that there will be closure and that is where it ends on the precincts of Parliament. We have taken the liberty to do all that we can to ensure that you are comfortable, honourable Members. The closure for the education, that is none of our business in Parliament. That is the honourable Minister’s and the Government of the day. You have been talking for quite long, what is your question, or you forgot your question now? (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I think in terms of the water disruption, the actual work itself, the 900mm Viria to Waila connection, the work which will be done is part of the servicing strategy plan for the Viria Water Supply System to build the resiliency of the Suva-Nausori Water Supply System. The Waila System currently operates four major lift pumps to provide flow into the Wainibuku Reservoir which in turn supplies Tovata, Kalabu, Flagstaff, Nasinu, Nagatugatu, Dokainaisavu and Colo-i-Suva Reservoirs. The service delivery risk that currently exist for the Waila System is the lack of backup for the existing pumping system, should a major failure of assets such as the switchboard transformer et cetera, occur reducing the pumping capacity. The risk has the potential to impact supply to approximately 40 percent of the Suva, Nausori population. The 900-millimetre connection to be connected this weekend is an important resiliency work as it provides the opportunity to provide additional supplementary flow to maintain service delivery, as much as possible, should any major fault occur in Waila. Furthermore, once the Viria Treatment Plant capacity is expanded to 80 million litres per Day (MLD) from the existing 40 MLD, more flow will be available to be pushed into the Suva System via Waila through this connection which will be done through this weekend, ensuring capacity to meet current and future depends. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have a question for the honourable Minister, we seem to be promoting rainwater harvesting many in the rural areas. What is the plan for urban areas, rainwater harvesting system? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- We are encouraging that too in terms of backup and we have allocated funding in the Water Authority of Fiji. Anyone who wishes to apply can apply for that. They will need to have a base and the piping system or the connection to the guttering. For me, it is</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2173 always good for you to have your backup at home because we never know what will happen, climate change and the extremes in the weather systems. If the water flow improves, anything can happen. During the cyclones, there can be a landslide which disrupts the waterpipe infrastructure or flood or anything. We have seen what happened in Northern Carolina, USA in last weekend, that is the most developed and richest nation, I suppose, but close to a million people are affected. My message to the nation, always have a backup in terms of rainwater harvesting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> No, Sir.</p><p>Review of the Trade Policy Framework (Question No. 255/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.N:</span> TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on what the Ministry’s plans are on the Trade Policy Framework that is due for review next year? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Trade Policy Framework is approaching its expiry. The last one was prepared by the former government from 2015 to 2025. Obviously, the plans are afoot to review it for its effectiveness, its impact, provide recommendations for future trade policies that will ensure that we continue to drive Fiji’s economy, its development and also encourage more trading relations or healthy trading relations, Sir. The Ministry of Trade, Sir, will be working with the Australian Government to develop the new trade policy. I guess, given what we are seeing in the economy and the myriad of significant opportunities that are approaching Fiji and underpinned by the global dynamics that continue to happen, technological advancements and, of course, climate change. The next Trade Policy will be quite critical. When I say exciting things coming at us, Sir, for example, the Google investment will create a massive surge in ICT development in Fiji. We are seeing some of it already, I had a meeting at 8.30 last night with someone from United Kingdom, that is the type of interest that has been generated in the last few months. Commercial agriculture, Sir, you have got Fiji Water in the country looking at serious commercial agriculture, there are few others that are coming through. These are the types of exciting opportunities that are coming, starting to emerge some serious interest in commercial aquaculture, Sir, and these are the things that the trade policy needs to address. Some of the things that will be key with the new Trade Policy Framework will be the newly launched National Development Plan and the Foreign Policy White Paper launched by the honourable Prime Minister recently. Of course, we will ensure that the private sector is comprehensively consulted, we feel that the private sector needs to be at the centre of any of these initiatives. Looking at, not only the current economic architecture, Sir, but also when those industries that are very successful for us at the moment but also looking at new industries. There is a question on medicinal cannabis coming up so soon, probably answer it in the next session, but these are the types of things that are happening and, of course, as expected need to account for the relevant laws and regulations and particularly international agreements that we need to look at. Also, Sir, for example, we have had a bit of a brief discussion on PACER, so hopefully that</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>2174</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 will come through in the next trade policy. There is the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) which we have just initialled for execution, so how does that translate into the trade policy, and also looking at some of the other trading destinations? I think we all agree that we have not really looked at Southeast Asia in any close detail. Southeast Asia, Sir, has 750 million humans or souls. It is a large market there, and of course, we would have all noticed that the UAE and Saudi are starting to look at the Pacific. These are some of the things that we will probably have to look at in terms of the policy. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, this Parliament is now aware of, that will continue to be part of the policy and how do we use that to maximise our opportunities. It is always important that in these policies we ensure that inclusivity is factored in - to the youth, women, civil society, and ensuring that resourcing requirements are identified as well to ensure that the policy is well articulated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plan is to table the policy next year at some point once it is ready for tabulation. We have a whole year next year, but it should be in my view, quite an exciting document given the type of things we are seeing emerge in our economy and it certainly augurs well for how we try and continue to ensure that we diversify the Fijian economy and also attract investment as well to our shores. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, a question to the honourable Minister; in light of the fact that this is going to be our guiding document, with respect to any trade agreements and all the ones that you have spelt out now, what kind of assistance are we actually getting with respect to the diagnostic work that needs to be done in order to get us to where we want to in terms of a new trade policy framework? The last time we had engaged with Hub and Spokes (H&amp;S) out of the Commonwealth, there were some other people that were engaged to do the diagnostic works. Are we going to engage, or do we have our own people doing our own diagnostic work on it? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA. - Thank you, honourable Koya, for the question. As I had mentioned in the answer, we are leveraging off Australia. As you know, there is a certain expert out of New Zealand that we use quite regularly as well, and he is probably going to be part of that exercise. One of the good things about our trade team is that we are quite experienced, there has not really been any significant movement in that team for the last, probably eight years, I think, for those that have left Fiji. There is a lot of knowledge retention, at the moment, within the trade team, and so that will come to the fore when we develop the policy and we overlay that with the assistance that we generally get from some of our consultants that we use quite regularly; and together with Australia, I am sure we will have that adequately covered. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have a question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister on South East Asia. This is something that probably has fallen off the rail. I asked with your investment team when we came to touch on the budget. There has been some discussions with China about agriculture and fisheries products, apart from what we are going into China, and you will know the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and we are a middle-income country, we are no longer a Least Developed Country (LDC) but huge opportunity, we have already sent dalo to China. They love our dalo and they use it for so many things. The problem is when it lands. We are pleading with China as a big brother, give us something,</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2175 apart from the WTO regulations. Is that something that we are going to pick up again and please check with the team? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition, he does make a good point. There are some non-tariff barriers that we have to contend with when we deal with China. So, it is a work in progress, we actually have a team in China at the Trade Consulate, that specifically tries to handhold when companies come through to get approvals. It is something that we continue to work on. That rule applies to everyone. You will notice that the honourable Prime Minister had signed an MOU with China recently. That will hopefully create some positive movement in our direction and certainly the level of engagement that the honourable Prime Minister had, he met the top three in China when he was there. These things will hopefully translate into some more favourable disposition when it comes to China. I agree China is a major market potential for us, we only need to get 1 percent of their population, and we will be very happy. I know the honourable Minister for Agriculture is doing quite a bit of work with a few Chinese farmers already in the country. One, his doing noni; that we feel is quite a big opportunity and there are some other opportunities that the honourable Minister for Agriculture is working on, more vegetable production for export to China. So, these are some of the things that are being worked on. Kava, we feel, is an opportunity as well. At the moment, there is kava sent to China for production as well, so these are some of the things. Then, of course, you have got cosmetic care products, even Fiji Bitter, Fiji Rum, these are some products that have some traction in China, and we are continuing to work on those but, yes, I agree. Regarding China, it is a big opportunity so when I talk about Southeast Asia, that involves China as well. Establishment of a Cancer Treatment Hospital (Question No. 256/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable the Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament if the Government has any plans to establish a cancer treatment hospital in Fiji to address the surge in cancer patients? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, yes, he is correct that there is a surge in cancer diagnosis. It is being increasingly noted here in Fiji and it spares not any particular section within the population, it affects both adults/children, male/female, high/low socio-economic status. Cancer is also amongst the leading cause of NCDs causing illness and mortality as well. In terms of the current management we have at the moment, it extends from prevention right up to the avoidance of the risk factors - vaccination, early diagnosis treatment, medicine, surgical procedures and radiation therapy, rehabilitation, and that includes chronic pain management. Most treatment modalities that I have mentioned are available at our primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities around the country. However, radiotherapy treatment is still not available in the country, and for that, someone to be seeking radiotherapy treatment will have to be referred overseas. As per your question, are there any plans to establish a specific cancer treatment hospital per se? At the moment, no, because most of the treatment modalities are incorporated in the various settings that I have mentioned. But nevertheless, our Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with Aspen under Government and Health Care Fiji Limited for Lautoka and Ba Hospitals, they were supposed</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>2176</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 to provide radiotherapy services at the tertiary hospitals in Lautoka Hospital in the future. Again, establishing a radiotherapy centre is a fairly costly exercise, that is why through the PPP arrangements that I mentioned that Lautoka and Ba Hospitals were supposed to establish a radiotherapy centre, but it does not move away with what the current treatment modalities are. Nevertheless, not only cancer therapy, but we are also anticipating construction soon of a heart and kidney treatment that will be coming under the Super Speciality Hospital. For now, in addition to the treatment modalities, the Ministry is working with Lautoka Hospital and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) towards a Radiotherapy Treatment Centre project at Lautoka Hospital that I have mentioned. Also, work is currently undertaken for the multisectoral team to review the Radiation Health Act 2009 to be able to allow the introduction of radiotherapy services in Fiji. That is the pre-requisite in order to have the radiotherapy services in Fiji that our legislation has to align with international standards before. We are doing that as we speak. Before I sit, I wish to remind everyone, as honourable Ketan Lal has mentioned, this month is breast cancer awareness month. As Members of this august Parliament, I wish everyone if they can take the opportunity to advocate for cancer awareness in terms of advocating for screening and treatment and asking people to come on board and have a screening to be identified for treatment, if need be. HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, honourable Minister for the answer to the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of radiotherapy, I believe they all have to go abroad to get it. There are some with insurance or are financially capable of going there. What about people who cannot afford insurance or are not financially stable? What kind of assistance are there for these kind of patients to go up and get treated? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has a budgeted allocation on overseas referral. Should a patient be referred by their doctor or specialist for radiotherapy treatment and they cannot afford, then they can always contact the Ministry, and if they are eligible for the overseas referral abroad. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest costs when it comes to cancer treatment is chemotherapy. Recently, Solomon Islands has actually signed an MOU with Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) from India. If people travel from Fiji to India, they are given IP standard medication and if we compare the cost of IP medication – cytotoxic, that are actually available in Australia and New Zealand, it might be ten-folds more. What you can obtain for $20 in India, would be $200 out of Australia. Are there any plans to have selective categories of medications such as cytotoxic, antiretrovirals to allow IP standard to be brought into Fiji so that we can reduce the cost of chemotherapy and antiretrovirals for viral protection such as AIDS, et cetera? Are there any plans with the Ministry of Health because that will significantly reduce the cost? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of IP, that is something that the Ministry is looking into. I am sure you are aware that when you were in India, our team from the Fiji Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Services (FPBS) was also there. They went and did some research on equipment and medication and had a brief idea of the Indian Pharmacopoeia. You are correct in terms of the Indian Pharmacopoeia and the medications for chemotherapy and ARV. The Ministry, through their return from India, have briefed the Ministry on a way forward on identifying certain groups of medications that you have rightly mentioned. Upon the return of the</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2177 team, they had briefed me and said, “yes, we can look into IP”, ensuring that while we try to maintain our standards, we can still adopt the IP system in India. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that we know that there is a surge in cancer patients, are we currently doing the research to find out why there is a surge? And it is twofold, Sir, if there is a surge and we know the reasons why in terms of getting a new hospital specifically for cancer patients, will it incorporate doing research at the hospital? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, in terms of the research component of why there is a rise or surge in cancer cases within Fiji, that is something, I believe, not only as a Ministry but together with our local tertiary institutions are looking into and which also our development partners are assisting us in. Nevertheless, I can say that most are under Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) and in terms of the cancer that are currently on the rise here in Fiji it has to do with infections and lifestyle. That is a proven fact and also that is why, as the research continues, we are also making sure that we strengthen the primary healthcare space - the preventative part of it. We all know the causes, that has been clearly identified and I suggest putting out the word that prevention is still better than cure, and at the same time, continuing with the research data from our own local tertiary institutions and overseas as well. National Exams - Re-Introduction of Scaling (Question No. 257/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the re- introduction of scaling in the National Examination Process? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to inform Parliament that the process of the re-introduction of scaling has just been given the approval from Cabinet. Public consultation will be undertaken in terms of the re-introduction of scaling of the national examination. However, I would like to share with us this morning the rationale in terms of the reasoning behind the need to re-introduce the scaling system in the national examination system. We tend to raise the scaling system to be introduced subject to Cabinet’s endorsement in the 2025 education year, after the completion of the consultation, policy adjustments and policy preparation at the school level to ensure the transition. Why the introduction of the scaling system? Mr. Speaker, Sir, first is, it makes a fair representation of student performances. As it was introduced, most of us have come through the scaling system before it was disbanded in 2015. It helps normalise examination scores to account for varying degrees of difficulty across subjects and exams. Secondly, it addresses disparities. If you see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the schools that are in the rural and maritime areas, they seen to have lessen in terms of number of schools because they tend to migrate towards the schools in towns and cities, thinking the school system here would provide them better opportunities. That is the reason why we are trying to re-introduce the scaling system. Alignment with international standards, many countries use a form of scaling in their national</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2178 Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 examination system to ensure consistency and fairness. Therefore, by re-introducing the scaling system in Fiji, it is in alignment with international best practices in students’ assessment, ensuring that students results are credible and comparable at the global level. As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have just been given the approval to conduct the public consultation exercise and hopefully we will capture all the information that is shared in the consultation process to be taken into consideration once it is re-introduced. Written Question Data on School Dropouts – 2019-2023 (Question No. 258/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: There are circumstances due to which some children are compelled to drop out of school. Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the following: (a) what is the Ministry doing to identify these students and how is the Ministry planning to assist these children; (b) how many students dropped out in the last 5 years (2019 to 2023) before completing primary education; and (c) how many students dropped out in the last 5 years (2019 to 2023) before completing Year 10? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I table my response in accordance with the 1 Standing Order. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, take note that there will be four Bills today. One will be moved under Standing Orders 51, two will be for debate, vote and enactment and one for first reading.</p></body>
