<body><h3>ACCESS TO BUSINESS FUNDING BILL 2024</h3><h4>ACCESS TO BUSINESS FUNDING BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 (Bill No. 18/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the next sitting of Parliament upon</p><h4>presentation of the Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee; and</h4><p>(e) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament at the next sitting of Parliament, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p>1 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 258/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister Education under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure I.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 2179 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would have heard me in this House talks about developing comprehensive ecosystem for micro, small and medium enterprises in Fiji. This Bill is another step in that direction. Be assured, Sir, and honourable Members of this august House that we are not taking the use of Standing Order 51 lightly. We are recommending its use in this exceptional case due to the following reasons. We have had several nationwide consultations which was conducted from 5 th February, 2024 to 16th February, 2024, and we have received overwhelming support from the public and the MSMEs to expedite this Bill. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are addressing something that your government never addressed - access to finance. You should be ashamed. We all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that access to finance remains the biggest challenge for businesses, particularly MSMEs and as I have said, that side of the House did nothing. They were sleeping on the job.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Microwaving:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The Bill aims to bridge the gap and unlock private sector investment into businesses in a systematic and secure manner:</span> The Bill has been drafted by legal experts from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and vetted by the Office of the Solicitor-General. This is also a joint reform output of the ADB and the World Bank Policy action items that unlocks budgetary support, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am told this important Bill (wait for it) has been stalling the last seven years. We have brought this into the august House in August after a year of its inception. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the nation, particularly the MSMEs of our country and aspiring entrepreneurs, are eagerly awaiting this Bill and I have to say, deserve this Bill. We are not saying for us to expedite and pass the Bill within the same week, or the same day but like that side of the House, Sir, we are saying, bring it at the next Parliament session for debate. That gives the Committee approximately six to eight weeks to conduct their work and review the Bill. As usual, Sir, the Ministry offers any support required to the Committee to help them in their work, analysing the Bill and, of course, should they require to conduct their own consultations. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover. This is to do with Standing Order 51. You have to try and catch my attention, make me look towards you and then understand that you want to ask a question, you want to stand up and speak, otherwise I will just concentrate like this and when I look back, no one is standing so that is it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, ..</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- He should be given some coaching from the front bench. HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> I thank you for the opportunity and apologise for not catching your eye earlier, Sir, I was looking at the Deputy Prime Minister.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>2180 Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 (Laughter) I appreciate the purpose of the Bill to do something about financing for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). I think it is critical, it is a move in the same direction. The point I wanted to make, Sir, when you talked about the consultations; extensive consultations have been done by bureaucrats with people in Fiji, consultation in this House is by the representative of people. That is why we always need adequate time, that is the point. We do not have any argument with the purpose of the Bill. So, when you say, “oh, we have already done this consultation.” Me cava, is that enough? Consultation here is by the representatives of people. You need to make sure of that - consult well, give us enough time so we can deliberate. That is the main purpose of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is all I want to say. I am glad that they are doing Standing Order 51. They are finally beginning to see the light, they are beginning to change because before, when they were on this side of the House, they were so anti-Standing Order 51 and now they are doing it. People used to say, “you are a hypocrite.” No, we were not hypocrites, we never argued against it. The people sitting next to them were the ones who argued, and the people sitting in front of them. That is the point I wanted to make, Sir. Consultation is required by the representatives of people and that is who we are in this Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I think we have been given ample time here. It is not like the straight Standing Order 51 that we used to encounter. But now it is Standing Order 51, and it is being referred to the Committee. HON. F. S. KOYA.- My contribution is probably about 60 seconds, Sir. I am very happy that this is now on the floor of Parliament, and it is actually going to the Committee to get done. I just wanted to correct, the honourable Minister, Sir. He said it was seven years in the making, but guess what? Seven years in the making started by us. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I really do not have much to say other than the MSMEs and the young men and women entrepreneurs of this country deserve this. We have tried to be both, pragmatic but also expedient, and that is why we approached it the way we have approached it. As you have correctly pointed out, Sir, we are not using Standing Order 51, like the other side of the House used to, like instant coffee making legislation - tabled in one day and legislate law the next day. As we have said, this side of the House is doing things differently and actually elevating the standards of law making in our country. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 (Bill No. 18/2024) moved under Standing Order 51 is committed to the Standing Committee for Economic Affairs and to report back to Parliament at its next sitting.]</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 2181 MR. SPEAKER.- Before we proceed to the next two Bills, I remind honourable Members, that pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20 th May, 2024 and Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024, the debate on the next two Bills will be limited to one hour only.</p></body>
