<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given a notice to make</p><h4>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:</h4><p>(1) Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics; (2) Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (3) Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management; (4) Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; and (5) Minister for Justice.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2129 Honourable Members, the Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the Leader of G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to also speak for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. Honourable Members, the only thing I was trying to seek your indulgence on is, please, when it is five minutes, the light goes on and that is where it ends. Some go beyond for another one or two minutes. The Secretariat is trying to get you to understand that because when you go abroad and participate in international meetings, it is this similar kind of House rules that we adhere to. When you are given five minutes, it is five minutes. Try and teach yourself on how best you can speak by sticking to the time. If it is three minutes, it is three minutes, if it is 10 minutes, then it is 10 minutes. Yesterday, I was asked by some of the honourable Government Members that the 10 minutes is too long, we should cut it down to five minutes. But I said, “No, we have heard a lot from the honourable Members on the Opposition side and the Government side, that the time to speak is being clipped off all the time. Every now and again, it is 10 minutes, now it is five.” You would like to speak for long, but if you start repeating yourself, then that long speech becomes just a sounding board. That is all. I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to deliver his Statement. National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2023-2024 National Budget, the Coalition Government announced the formulation of a new National Development Plan (NDP). The preparatory works on the NDP began in November 2023 with consultations amongst respective Ministries and Government agencies. On 16th January, 2024, Cabinet approved the Framework and approach for the formulation of the new NDP. Following a very consultative and inclusive process, the National Development Plan 2025–2029 and Vision 2050 was prepared and launched on 17th September, 2024 by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 is an outcome of an inclusive and participatory approach. It was developed through inputs and feedback received from meetings of 11 thematic working groups based on key themes in relation to the economy and our people, a nationwide public consultation, consultation with civil society organisations, political parties and faith-based organisations, as well as written submissions received from the general public. Recommendations from the 2023 National Economic Summit, Fiscal Review Committee Report and the National Education Summit also provided valuable inputs into the formulation of the NDP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDP was prepared under the overall guidance of the Strategic Planning Office of the Ministry of Finance, and I take this opportunity to thank each and every one for their contributions to this major national document. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 is founded on the vision of “Empowering the People of Fiji through Unity”. The honourable Prime Minister has talked about this since we came into Government. To lay the groundwork for achieving the vision, the NDP contains policies and strategies across three pillars - Economic Resilience, People Empowerment and Good Governance.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>2130</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 The goal of the NDP is to bring greater prosperity to the nation, reduce poverty and improve the social and economic wellbeing of our people. Our people will be at the centre of development and the NDP, therefore, is a plan for the people. The NDP is also aligned with our global and regional commitments such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDP puts in focus a new plan that has been translated into goals, policies and strategies with a clear set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each identified sector. The five-year plan and the long term 25-year vision sits on the three broad pillars. The overall focus of the new plan is on – • • • • • • • building microeconomic confidence; sustainable management of natural resources; categorising economic growth and diversifying the economy; uplifting the socio-economic wellbeing of our people, including our indigenous people; developing public infrastructure; protection of the environment; and a commitment to good governance and institutional reforms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDP also presents Fiji’s vision 2050 which offers an opportunity to charge our own destiny, to determine what we want as a nation, how we see ourselves and where we want to be in 25 years - a prosperous, inclusive and sustainable nation. The vision outlines the long- term development goals based on the aspirations of the people and will guide the short and medium term plans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji and our people aspire to be a high-income country by 2050, bringing a better quality of life for all. Achieving this vision will require ambitious reforms and tackling longstanding issues that have held us back from economic and social progress. A business-as-usual approach will not achieve this vision. Some of the key issues the NDP identifies that we need to address include labour productivity, infrastructure deficit in transportation and health sectors, female and youth labour force participation rate, investor and business confidence, ongoing skills mismatch and political stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we call for commitment to prudent and effective planning in the implementation of the NDP in achieving the KPIs identified in the plan. There is a need to ensure that this Plan is based on availability of resources (aligning resources with revenue forecasts to maintain financial stability) and guarding against the pitfall of over-ambitious projections and underfunded priorities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is focusing on developing a detailed implementation plan with clear resource allocations. We urge all for effective coordination and collaboration between Government and development partners to maximise resource allocation and utilisation. We believe that the silo approach towards service delivery has persisted and limited the intended purpose of the programme approach to planning and implementation in the Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of implementation is anchored on a result-oriented, transparent and accountable Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation (IME) mechanism. Monitoring will involve regular gathering of data to assess progress towards the desired outputs and outcomes, reporting of the progress based on set timelines, and timely intervention to undertake corrective measures, where necessary. Therefore, Sir, Chapter 9 of the NDP lays out the IME Framework and processes.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2131 Mr. Speaker, Sir, State capacity and coordination are also crucial in ensuring an effective implementation and achieving the outcomes of the NDP. The Government is committed to building and expanding capacity in the Civil Service towards policy planning and execution for the effective implementation and achieving of NDP outcomes. The annual National Budgets, Sir, will be based on the development priorities set out in the NDP and will provide the financial resources to support the implementation. I am happy to note that a number of strategies outlined in the NDP have already been factored in the 2024-2025 National Budget. For example, an allocation of $5.75million has been provided for in the 2024-2025 budget for Groundwater Assistance Programme, which will increase access to safe and affordable drinking water in large and smaller islands. I am very pleased to inform Parliament that the Taskforce, led by the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, is working very diligently because we want to ensure that we are able to deliver, as much as possible, for our rural people and those in the maritime islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government greatly appreciates inputs received from members of the public who attended the public consultations held around the country. They did it freely without fear and provided excellent inputs, not only on the short-term basic things, but also in the medium and long-term on what the country ought to do. Technical support from the World Bank is greatly and rightfully acknowledged with special recognition to the team that is based here in Fiji and covering Fiji. Special thanks are extended to Permanent Secretaries and senior leadership of the Fiji Government Civil Service for the partnership and guidance in preparing the NDP. I want to, Sir, once again reiterate and thank all the Permanent Secretaries. I think they played a significant, important and critical role in the formulation of the NDP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now commenced on a transformative national journey. In this journey, the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 is going to be a guiding light. We are on the shared journey together. We will remain united and progress together to rebuild this country and realise its potential for all our people. I want to take this opportunity, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister, to thank all the honourable Members of this Parliament for their contribution; my colleagues on this side, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers, towards the formulation of the Plan and I also want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition and all the Opposition Members who attended the launch of the NDP last month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to emphasise this because the attendance from both sides of the House at such an important national event actually sent a very, very strong signal on the bipartisanship that we are building in this House. I can tell you, Sir, that with confidence, it has contributed to building confidence amongst our people, the private sector and the development partners, in particular. It helps bring the nation together, which is critical to our development and prosperity, which is exactly what the vision of the Plan, “Empowering the People of Fiji through Unity” says. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have clearly seen the impact of the bipartisanship and the overwhelming support, including that from the Opposition, towards our recent 2024-2025 Budget on the economy, and we are very pleased with that support. With the strong support for the Budget and the major policy measures, including the pay rise for civil servants, increase in the national minimum wage, Government capital projects and the slightly higher fiscal deficit, had boosted confidence and helped raise economic activity. It has clearly reversed the economic slowdown that we had noted in the months just prior to the Budget, which actually led us to revise the growth forecast from 3 percent to 2.8 percent in the Budget.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>2132</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 However, since then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of Fiji have been closely monitoring the economic developments, and we have noted with a lot of satisfaction some significant positive developments thereafter. All major indicators for aggregate demand, including private sector lending, VAT collections (adjusted for the impact of the rate changes) which is a key indicator for domestic spending), 20 percent increase in Government expenditure in the last seven months, pick up in import of investment goods, higher electricity consumption, increased vehicle sales, and improvement in income indicators like PAYE collections and remittances, have all seen a significant pickup. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the same time, our tourism industry, as has already been outlined by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, has continued to do even better than our earlier expectations, and over and above the record levels of last year. While we were forecasting initially a growth of around 3 percent in visitor arrivals for this year, the arrivals to- date shows that visitor arrivals have actually grown by close to 7 percent in the first eight months. We have, in fact, seen record arrivals month after month, and we are now anticipating that visitor arrivals will be just either below one million, or it could go above a million for 2024, and that will be another year of record tourist arrivals. We have also seen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a turnaround in all major sectors and a pickup in investments which is expected to improve further. In here, Sir, I want to acknowledge the leadership of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications for the reforms and the advocacy that have gone in, in terms of building confidence and attracting investors in all the sectors of the economy. The low interest rate environment has helped investments and compared to Australia and New Zealand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the low interest rate environment has actually helped us in our investments, and we are continuously working across Government agencies to improve service delivery and ease of doing business. There are still some bottlenecks, but as a government, we are very clearly working on unravelling some of those obstacles. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, our resource sectors are still not doing as well as we would want them to and are definitely below their potential. But that is also another area that is clearly enunciated in our NDP, and the Government is working on them. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on all these preliminary data and trends, we are clearly looking at an upgrade to the 2024 growth forecast to around 3.5 percent or even higher now. However, the Macroeconomic Committee is currently reviewing these projections, and an official and independent forecast will be released next month. However, as a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as we envisage in the NDP to become a high- income country by 2050, the economy needs to grow at a consistent rate of 4 percent to 5 percent every year. Therefore, for everyone, including Government, the private sector, development partners, landowners, farmers, entrepreneurs, students, teachers, professionals, religious bodies, civil society organisations, and in fact, every family and every individual including the honourable Leader of the Opposition, who has given very strong support to the NDP, has to help us raise our growth and help realise the vision of our NDP. Only together, Sir, as the honourable Prime Minister has always said, since coming into Government, we can realise our collective vision and aspirations. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to brief this august House on the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050. The NDP is available through the Ministry's website and Facebook platform, and I urge everyone to take time to read through this very important national document and contribute towards its implementation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I adjourn the House for tea, I would like to</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2133 acknowledge once more another group of students who have come in during this time and they are from the same school as before -St. Joseph the Worker, from Nasinu. I also acknowledge the presence of the Administrator from Nasinu Town Council, Mr. Felix Magnus, sitting there with Mr. Orisi Navuso, and ladies and gentlemen who may be parents of these students. (Acclamation) If I may just say a few words in the vernacular: Kivei kemuni ra gone, vinaka vakalevu na lako mai nikua. Oqo na nomuni Vale ni Bose llawa. Keimami tu ‘qo na nomuni Mata.

SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for tea, and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.40 a.m.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>2134</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.22 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make their response. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for his Ministerial Statement. I was listening to him very carefully on what he was trying to tell us. He was trying to sell the National Development Plan (NDP) in a very convincing way that the economy is doing so well, everything is all rosy, but the question here is, whether that is felt by the people on the ground? (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- How do they feel? That is the main question. How do they feel when they go to the supermarkets to buy their groceries? How do they feel when they go to the pharmacy to get their medicine? How do they feel when they go to different service providers - whether they are engaging a lawyer or engaging a doctor? How much fees are they paying? They also feel it when they pay their electricity bill, their water bill, et cetera. Sir, on one hand we can talk about the economy doing so well, but is it felt by the people? How is it trickling down to the people? Everything matters when the people feel the economic growth. Regarding the Plan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a utopia that promises development but does not do anything to address the current challenges which I have just mentioned. None! There is a section that talks about, as a challenge, just a small couple of lines, ‘challenges cost of living’, and that is it. We expected that the current issues faced by our people will be addressed, but people are wanting that solution now. In fact, during consultation, people ask, when are you going to reduce the cost of living? When are you going to reduce the cost of food? Plan is not going to provide that solution right now, plan is long-term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen, not just the high cost of living, there is lack of jobs for graduates, exodus of skills and professional workers, lack of capital projects, deplorable state of health services, terrible road condition, water not in the tap, so tomorrow we would not be having our Parliament, rising drug issues, substance abuse, high rate of sexual violence and robberies, so where is safety? Where is safety? Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has called the Plan ‘the people’s plan.’ Really? People spoke during that consultation, they pleaded, “increase the wages so that we can survive in this difficult situation”. He increases the wages by 50 cents, what does 50 cents do? Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just a small fraction,, it does nothing for the people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue with this Plan is that it is not a reader or user-friendly. It appears that this Plan was written by a novice as an academic exercise. There is a complete mismatch between policies, programmes, and strategies with the KPIs, and we can see that this Plan is going to lead our country into disaster. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Government stick to its plan? That is the main question. Can the Government stick to its plan, its values and principles, when they cannot uphold the rule of law - good governance, transparency and accountability – the key principles which underline and is the bedrock of this particular Plan? If that is not upheld, there is no way we are going to make any</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2135 progress. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics also stated that the vision is to make this country a high-income country. We have delivered. The Bainimarama-led Government has delivered. From low income, we moved to a middle-income country, Sir, in less than 16 years. He wants more than 25 years to take us to high income. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. K. K. LAL.- Hear, hear! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has to up his game, he cannot be relying on the so-called ‘National Development Plan’, which I have said is not even reader or user-friendly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I should share this story with you. When I was doing my Masters, when I wrote my thesis, my professor said to me, “If you want people to pick up your document and read your thesis, make sure it is not black in colour, make sure it is colourful, it is exciting, people can look at the cover and will go for that document”. Look at this cover, what kind of document is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir? MR. SPEAKER.- Your time is up, Madam.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the G:</span> 9 Bloc, or his designate. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise today as an independent Member of Parliament, not bound by any party obligation, but committed to the service to our citizens, to provide a response to the Statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics on the recently published National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Coalition Government for proposing such an ambitious Plan, one that aims to address growth and development across multiple sectors over the next several years. The fact that a detailed roadmap has been laid out for the future will, undoubtedly, bring about some level of confidence and reassurance both, domestically and on an international stage. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a plan is only as good as its execution. While the presentation of such an extensive development plan is commendable, the success lies heavily in its implementation. It is on this point that I wish to focus my response as an independent Member of Parliament. We have a unique position, providing unbiased and constructive criticism, a role we embody for the progress of our beloved nation. My main concern lies with the practical enactment of this Plan. We must consider practical challenges that potentially stand as hurdles in the path of progress. It is crucial that we ensure that no Division or Province is left behind. Our country is beautifully diverse in our culture, our tradition and our religion. This diversity must be reflected in our national development strategies. As we move forward, Mr. Speaker, with this Plan, we must ensure that every initiative is as inclusive as possible, providing for the needs of every citizen. Tangible benefits, as alluded to, must be realised on the ground.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>2136</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 Furthermore, let us not forget that formulating a plan and executing it are two different tasks. A balance needs to be struck between an ambition and its feasibility. It is prudent to be optimistic, but it is absolutely mandatory to be realistic. The current economic climate of our budgetary restriction calls for a need to measure each initiative and positive impact against its cost and prioritise accordingly. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, accountability is central to the success of any plan. It is good to note that Chapter 9 of the National Development Plan is dedicated to a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework that will allow progress and initiatives to be accurately measured and assessed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we stand on the threshold of an exciting and transformative era, let us remember that the road to development is not a race, but a journey. It is not about who we surpass, but who we uplift and bring with us. As we advance towards a prosperous 2050, let us leave no one behind. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the floor to respond to the Statement. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, let me acknowledge the presence of the Special Advisor to the Australian High Commission who is sitting here, Ms. Bale. Welcome, Madam. We will move on. I now call on the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. Trilateral Meeting with Australian and New Zealand Trade Ministers HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Na Turaga Bale Na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; before I begin my Ministerial Statement, I thought it would be appropriate to pay tribute to a great son of the Province of Ra. We probably would say he was a Lion of the Province of Ra – Mr. Tomu Vuetilovoni. He was called to rest a few days ago, Sir. As we know, Mr. Vuetilovoni was firstly a captain of industry in our country. He led the Colonial Bank for so many years profitably. He groomed and mentored so many of our young men and women, one of which is the honourable Assistant Minister for Finance here today. After the 2000 coup, he was asked to become a Minister of that Interim Government and was later a substantive Minister for Commerce, Business Development and Investment, before their untimely removal in 2006. He was also a passionate rugby advocate, Sir. His shadow looms large when it comes to the formation of the Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) in all those formative years. He spent, I am sure, not only a lot of his resource but his own personal resources to support the FRU at that time. Sir, with those few words and on behalf of a grateful nation, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Tom Vuetilovoni for his service to Fiji and may his soul rest in peace. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to share some insights into the high-level visit to New Zealand which was held from 19th September, 2024 to 24th September, 2024, and to inform this august House of some of the positive outcomes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit served as a crucial platform for strengthening and continuing to form stronger trade economic ties with New Zealand and Australia. For the first time, Sir, and probably in the history of Fiji, the first Trilateral Trade Meeting was held in Rotorua between the</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2137 Government Trade Ministers - the honourable Todd McClay of New Zealand, Senator Don Ferrel of Australia and myself, to discuss our trade opportunities which I will delve into a bit further. Because the honourable Senator Ferrel was also the Minister for Tourism, I had the honour of meeting honourable Matt Doocey from New Zealand in a three-way discussion with Fiji on matters regarding tourism and I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation for providing some information for that meeting. The Trilateral Trade Meeting was organised by the Government of New Zealand through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and we had four Government representatives accompanying me from Fiji. The meetings, Sir, included ministerial meetings and networking events in three locations, namely, Auckland, Rotorua and Christchurch. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also had the opportunity to have a very cordial and very fruitful meeting with the new Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, honourable Winston Peters, where we discussed potential opportunities for Fiji and New Zealand and the need to explore more value addition in exports and, particularly, economic diversification of our natural resources. To start the trip, I did have a briefing from the Trade Commission in New Zealand and suffice to say, Sir, that we are doing some very things in New Zealand which is helping the current growth in trade between Fiji and New Zealand. In terms of the Ministerial Meeting, Sir, of course, the meeting initially focussed on PACER Plus where both, New Zealand and Australia, heard Fiji’s position. We did highlight, Sir, that whilst PACER Plus does present opportunities, it does have some potential threats as well. We are currently in discussion, trying to actually establish a further deep dive into these risks to further understand the benefits and the risks of PACER Plus to Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had a discussion on something that is being led by Fiji at the moment, which is a coalition against overcapacity and over-fishing. This is to build on the momentum of the discussions at the WTO’s 13 th Ministerial Conference, to further strengthen disciplines on harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity or overfishing (OCOF). The proposed coalition would simultaneously increase the capacity of the Pacific to be allowed a voice in terms of the preservation of its natural resources and hopefully in time to come, Sir, create an opportunity to, perhaps, create our own tuna industry in the Pacific. Apart from that, Sir, we did talk about some of the ambitions of Fiji, namely the potential to pivot towards Southeast Asia, our ambitions to join APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) at some point, and all parties agreed, Mr. Speaker, that there are opportunities to collaborate further as Fiji embarks on its diversification progress in areas such as commercial agriculture, aquaculture, tourism and ICT. Mr. Speaker, in terms of the site visits, I will talk very briefly about the targeted site visits that we did, in summary, just to give this august House a feel for what we were trying to do on this opportunity in New Zealand. What we did, Sir, is we went and visited the University of Waikato's Aquaculture Research Facility in the University of Waikato. We also visited the New Zealand Research Centre for Forestry called Scion in Christchurch, and we also visited Lincoln University, just to look at their research expertise in terms of trying to improve our horticultural and agricultural sectors. What I can say, Sir, is that there is great potential for collaboration in these areas with Fiji. The advancements that are being made in terms of breeding of seaweed, in terms of horticulture, trying to plant more varieties, for instance, of avocado to make it more resistant to cold weather, so those are the types of things that are happening in New Zealand. We all agreed from those three</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2138</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 meetings that there is quite a significant opportunity to work with these two countries and I will be referring some of the contacts to the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, as well as the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry very soon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also visited Zespri International Limited which is the largest marketer of kiwifruit, and they are a co-operative model. Their revenue, I think, is about NZ$4 billion at the moment and climbing, and they are the most successful model for cooperatives in New Zealand with about 50 percent of ownership of Zespri being owned by the farmers. The reason why we went to visit Zespri was to actually look at how we can maybe replicate some of that in Fiji and I think of the kava industry, ginger industry, turmeric industry, dalo, cassava and, perhaps, over the next few months, we will be exploring some of these opportunities in that regard. We also visited a very interesting Māori village on our way down to Rotorua. We visited the Tuaropaki Trust in Mokai - an indigenous land organisation representing 297 families with a robust asset base of NZ$1billion. The visit focussed on looking at what they were doing and what was interesting in that Trust, Sir, was they focussed on their resources and from their natural resources, they leverage the ecosystem that now sits around the whole area. They discovered that they could supply hydrogen power. They have a hydrogen power plant that is now selling electricity back to the grid in New Zealand. It is also powering up their own milk farm on the same area, it is powering up their vegetable greenhouses and it is just a wonderful way of, perhaps, demonstrating that there is hope with our indigenous. If we can leverage up the resources that they have, they can create other industry wherever they are located. Also, Sir, we visited Rag Stag Timber, which is a largest timber company in the Southern Hemisphere. It is huge. Just to go and look at the technology, what they were doing, and the reason why I went there was to actually look at it in the context of what we are trying to do with mahogany and see what technologies are out there. That was part of the reason I also went to the Research Institute in New Zealand. Again, Sir, there are opportunities for further collaboration in that area. I hope in the not-too-distant future, we can unlock the mahogany opportunity. When we talked to those who know, they said it is a billion-dollar opportunity for Fiji, so I am hoping that very soon, we can unlock that opportunity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also in the final visit we visited some chocolate importers in Christchurch. It is called the She Chocolate. They are actually buying a lot of chocolate from the Pacific right now. They expressed an interest in trying to restart the cocoa industry in Fiji. There are some ongoing discussions by the honourable Minister for Agriculture with two particular Provinces in Fiji, with some input from the GCC as well. If that endeavour takes off, we can start rebuilding our cocoa industry. We are currently producing only about 100 tonnes of cocoa, if I am not wrong, and Samoa is now at 500 tonnes. They have gone through a rehabilitation exercise. The potential also is huge for that, and we are working very closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to try and ensure that, that opportunity grows legs as well. Sir, as you can see from the visit, I hope I have demonstrated that the visit was not a junket just to go and have a holiday in New Zealand, but it was a serious attempt to try and continue this endeavour to diversify the Fijian economy, look at opportunities that are available, and then come back and work on that. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to convey my deepest appreciation to the Government of New Zealand for coordinating this visit and making it a success. Particularly, I would like to thank her Excellency the High Commissioner of New Zealand, Charlotte Darlow, and the First Secretary, Finlay Fraser Milne, for coordinating the visit and making it a resounding success.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2139 Moving forward, as I have mentioned, we will ensure that this visit is just not a visit per se, but that we can target some of the opportunities that we have seen and ensure that we continue to diversify the Fijian economy, so that our people, as mentioned by honourable Kumar, can see some benefits on the ground. I thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications on the high-level visit to New Zealand, and the first, as he says, the Trilateral Trade Meeting between the Ministers from Australia and New Zealand. I think one of the most important things for any country is to ensure that we have the right agreements in place with respect to trade so that there is facilitation that can happen for all our goods and services that need to go overseas. One of the issues that he has raised was with respect to PACER Plus. I think because Fiji is a small island developing State similar to Papua New Guinea, we have difficulties with it, and that is why we were not signatories. All the other Least Developing Countries signed it, so we had to be looked at in a different manner and in a different tone. One of the areas, and I have spoken to the honourable Minister about this, and he agrees with me also, is that we cannot have interference in our policy space when it comes to these agreements. So, it is a slow approach, not to say that it is not going to be done at all, but that kind of approach is needed because we all must remember and we all must think like this, that we are a developing economy. So, there are a lot of things that we need to be able to do ourselves as a sovereign country. Mr. Speaker, part of the agreement also has a lot of positive issues in it regarding capacity- building which is really good for us. I think it is also important at this particular stage of our development because we have had a lot of mass migration of our skilled workers that are leaving, so that is something else that needs to be constantly discussed. Modernising our systems is also a part of it, our customs and processes, less red tape, et cetera, that needs to happen, our sanitary and phytosanitary measures, standards and regulations that help us with respect to market access. Also, supporting our regulatory reform that needs to happen, Mr. Speaker, which is also a glaring issue that needs to be looked at. I know for a fact that the World Bank and International Finance Corporation have given us positive reports on this agreement but, at same time, we must not look at them and say that they are the gospel truth. It is us that need to deal with it and our sovereignty, Sir. The Asian Development Bank has also supported it. What it truly does, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of PACER Plus, if you look at it, Fiji and Papua New Guinea cover about 80 percent of the Pacific’s economic output. So, the major players in this agreement is Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and until they sign, that agreement falls short in a lot of things. So, a lot of work still needs to be done. I have spoken to the honourable Minister about this, and he also agrees with me that we need to move forward and get this done. Also, our private sector here needs to have a huge contribution on it and I know for a fact that he has been consulting with them. Some of them are still a bit wary about actually getting the signatures done with respect to getting PACER Plus off the ground. Mr. Speaker, Sir from a perspective of what actually is good for us and what actually is bad for us, in terms of the disadvantages of PACER Plus, we did not sign because earlier on as I have said, it was very lopsided. To us it was lopsided, and it did not actually meet our development needs.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>2140</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 Everyone needs to understand, Sir, that this agreement is not a normal free trade agreement, it was a trade agreement which had development aspirations in it for countries like Fiji, Papua New Guinea, et cetera, and that needs to be at the forefront of the discussions when we had it. We had difficulties right at the beginning with it, even with the Office of the Chief Trader Advisor, who was actually doing all these stuff for us. But in a nutshell, Sir, I think it is a good opportunity that the honourable Minister has taken up with respect to trying to see what can be done in terms of PACER Plus. We have a lot of potential in our country but at the same time, we must not lose sight and track of what we have and what we can do in other markets. I am also very happy to hear that Fiji has led the negotiations regarding fisheries subsidies at the WTO. So, I know, and he knows also, and I am glad that it has been taken up as a Pacific issue and something is actually being done about it. Mr. Speaker, there are many other things that we can talk about but due to shortage of time, Sir, I support the Minister’s trip, and I think it has been worthwhile to get it done and it is something that needs to continually happen and we certainly should not put our foot off the gas on this particular agreement. Thank you very much, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.– I now call upon the Leader of G-9 Bloc, or their designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.– I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement this morning and certainly, lend support to the sentiments expressed by honourable Koya in his response. In your Statement, Deputy Prime Minister, you mentioned that this problem of overfishing and overcapacity is important, given that we do share the same piece of ocean with Australia and New Zealand, and we are partners in that regard also on maritime security. I just want to echo what was mentioned yesterday on this agreement under the Law of the Sea Conservation and Sustainable use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). I think Fiji was the first country to sign, and the need for Fiji to ratify. It needs to come to Parliament and to come to our committee so that we can go ahead with the ratification process. I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Government for enhancing that relationship that we have with the two countries. They are big partners and big contributors to our tourism economy, as well as big assistance in terms of maritime security. I think they are not only partners, perhaps, they are vuvale (family), and it is the relationship that we want to enhance and I urge the Government to continue to build and enhance this wonderful - very fruitful relationship that we have with these two countries. Fiji Mission to Indonesia Under the Australia and Indonesia Trilateral Agreement HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform Parliament about a critical trilateral initiative that is currently being developed between our Government and the Governments of Australia and Indonesia. First of all, I would like to acknowledge the presence this morning of the Counsellor for Infrastructure and Climate Resilience, Ms. Louise Scott, and Ms. Skye Bale, Counsellor in the Political Division of DFAT in the Australian High Commission. This proposed partnership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be a major step towards advancing regional stability, fostering resilience and promoting shared development across the Pacific in line with our</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2141 common goals for sustainable growth, comprehensive disaster risk management and regional cooperation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2021, the Governments of Indonesia and Australia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), aimed at enhancing trilateral cooperation with Pacific Island Countries, with Fiji chosen to be among the first to participate. The MOU prioritised cooperation in various thematic areas including disaster risk management, humanitarian response, climate change and sustainable economic growth. Given our shared vulnerability to natural disasters and the importance of regional collaboration, Fiji was selected to engage specifically in disaster risk management. On 6 th August, 2024, the Governments of Australia and Indonesia formally extended an invitation to our Government for a peer-to-peer exchange with Indonesia, designed to enhance collaboration in disaster risk management. This exchange, supported by Australia-Indonesia Partnership in Disaster Risk Management (SIAP SIAGA), was critical to our learning from Indonesia’s extensive experience in disaster preparedness and response. As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, between 8 th and 13 th September, 2024, I led a 10-member delegation to Indonesia. This delegation included my Permanent Secretary, the four Divisional Commissioners and Officials from the National Disaster Management Office, as well as two members of the Australian High Commission, including Ms. Louise Scott, who is here with us and Ms. Elizabeth Beard. The mission had several key objectives to engage with Indonesia’s national and provincial governments, to exchange best practices in disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance, and to explore future areas of cooperation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme included engagements at regional, national, subnational and community levels. A key highlight was our visit to the ASEAN Coordination Centre for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA), where discussions focused on the establishment and operation of regional humanitarian mechanisms, an area of significant relevance, given that we are considering establishing a similar mechanism in the Pacific. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I delivered a keynote address at the 2nd Global Forum for Sustainable Resilience and attended the Asian Disaster Management &amp; Civil Protection Expo and Conference (ADEXCO). These platforms allowed us to share our insights and experiences, while also learning from global experts on building sustainable resilience. I also had a bilateral meeting with Her Excellency Retno Marsudi, Indonesia's Foreign Minister, where Minister Marsudi outlined Indonesia's priorities for Pacific cooperation, focusing on climate change, disaster risk reduction and response, and the Blue Economy. I echoed Fiji's support for these efforts, particularly, in advancing peer-to-peer learning and exchange initiatives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the delegation also engaged in productive discussions with Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB). During these discussions, we agreed to re-establish the bilateral MOU on disaster risk management, which had lapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a further show of Indonesia's commitment, BNPB extended an invitation for Fiji to attend the Indian Ocean Tsunami Commemoration in Aceh Province, taking place from 8 th to 10 th October this year. This engagement will further solidify our partnerships and enhance our disaster management capabilities. At the subnational level, the delegation had valuable meetings with the Jakarta Provincial Agency for Disaster Management and the Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) Provincial Agency for Disaster Management. These engagements provided the delegation with an opportunity to observe</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>2142</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 emergency operation centres at different scales and witness firsthand the coordination between national and subnational agencies during disaster events. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit to a local community in Bali, Indonesia, was equally insightful. The delegation observed how disaster resilience is embedded at the grassroots level, through community training and education programmes, supported by the Australian-funded SIAP SIAGA initiative. These local-level efforts align closely with Fiji's vision of building resilient communities that are equipped to manage disaster risks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster risks in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in the face of climate change, are no longer confined to borders, as we all know. Complex riskscapes, as highlighted in the United Nations' 2019 and 2021 Asia-Pacific Disaster Reports, show how biological hazards, climate variability and disasters interact, posing increasing challenges for our region. The proposed trilateral partnership, combining Indonesia's wealth of experience and Australia's strong humanitarian commitment, will allow Fiji to build greater resilience to these risks. Our Government has already benefited from the longstanding cooperation with Australia. Through the Fiji-Australia Vuvale Partnership, Australia has supported disaster preparedness activities in Fiji, such as the AUD1.2 million Disaster Resilience Programme and the Cyclone Recovery Programme, which rehabilitated critical infrastructure damaged during TCYasa. Additionally, regional initiatives, such as the Australian Humanitarian Partnership Disaster Ready 2.0 Programme, Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme and the Women's Resilience to Disasters initiative, continue to bolster Fiji's disaster preparedness and recovery efforts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our cooperation with Indonesia is equally promising. The draft MOU for the Fiji-Indonesia cooperation, initiated in 2022, is now under review to reflect the new strategic objectives emerging from this trilateral initiative. This trilateral cooperation between Fiji, Indonesia and Australia is a forward-looking initiative. It provides a solid foundation for Fiji to strengthen its disaster risk management capabilities, while also contributing to the broader regional resilience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to convey my deepest appreciation to the Governments of Indonesia and Australia, for their continued support and collaboration. The lessons learned from our mission to Indonesia have been invaluable, and we are committed to working hard to implement these learnings for the benefit of the Fijian people. As a government, we will continue refining and prioritising this trilateral initiative over the coming months, ensuring that it delivers meaningful and long-term benefits for our nation and the wider Pacific region. Vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU –Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement. Of course, it is an important commitment from him and his team, and I wish to acknowledge him for that. Again, this proves the point that for us, SDG 17 is important - the partnership, because we do not have the capacity, we do not have the capability, and this is where regionalism and, of course extending beyond the region as well in terms of the regional architecture, where we have issues of common interest. This is what brings us together. I just focus on two areas without repeating what the honourable Minister has stated and this is for Government, particularly from experience for us to raise our level of resilience and particularly in terms of preparedness, not only in its strategies but of course in its application. What is important</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2143 is political will. I will say that again, for us to raise our level of resilience and of course our level of preparedness so that we can deliver when it comes to emergency situations. The political will and commitment is so important. Based on the past experience Fiji has gone through so many disasters, but disasters after disasters we have reports. Reports are filed away. These are not analysed, and the lessons learned from those reports taken. And of course, what is important, is the direction that we will take based on the leadership of Government. In 2011, Mr Speaker Sir, we changed the way things were done at NDMO with just a simple statement. Shifting from a culture of reaction to a culture of prevention. That really changed the dynamics of how we dealt with emergencies and disasters. Because we prepare well now it will be easier for us when it comes to emergency situations and this why I was saying unfortunately in most previous disasters, good reports, but filed away, nothing was done to it. It needs political will and commitment which change the development paradigm with three simple factors; the way we live is changing what we call the new norm, intensity, the frequency, the way we live is changing. Therefore, the way we do development must change. Not just development for the sake of development, but resilient development, that is very, very important. And the third one is the partnership, the way we live is changing therefore, the way we do development must change, therefore, the partnership becomes important as well. And that it means that for continuing with this, because only then we can prepare well for the next disasters. And commitment and application either they be an Australian government either that, New Zealand government we have the MOU that we signed with Indonesia few years back. It is time that these MOUs be revisited. But how are we going to apply what we have learnt from Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand back here in Fiji? We went on taxpayers’ money, what is important is that we must see the results back here. Honourable Minister, I have a word of advice, I know that a lot of your senior staff are leaving. I think now, NDMO has not been tested for quite a while with a serious disaster and probably with the assistance of the Australian Defence Force, let us bring coral reef exercise very quickly. We need to do some tabletop exercises because of the turnover that is happening in the Ministry. We look forward to the discussions on the Bill this afternoon, Sir, but I commend the Ministry, and this is an important subject, and we must all support this because we prepare well now it will save us a lot in the future. Thank you. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement, and we acknowledge the information that he shared with us this morning and we have nothing further to add. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. So, I have already invited the honourable Minister for Lands to take the floor now. My apologies to that Group of 9. Government Freehold Buy-Back Scheme HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, honourable Leaders of the Opposition, Members of Parliament, those who are watching at the gallery and those who are joining us live. I rise this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to speak on the statement of the Government's Buy- Back Scheme from 1989 to-date. The Government's Freehold Buy-Back Scheme was the initiative of the Rabuka SVT Government in 1989, and it was promised on buying back ancestral land that were alienated as freehold land through assisting iTaukei landowners who had little or no land available for agriculture registered under their names in the Register of Native Lands to meet the</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>2144</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 growing members of the mataqali or the LOU or landowning unit. The first freehold buy-back land was approved by Cabinet on 3 rd October, 1989, and they included these parcels of freehold land: Vunia Island in Vanua Balavu; Tuvumaca, Welagi/Yavusa in Taveuni; Matakunea, Navatu in Cakaudrove; Korodogo, Mataqali Naduru, Dogotuki in Macuata and; Mua Estate, Yavusa Wainikeli/Naselesele in Taveuni. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the 20th April 1993, Cabinet further approved $2million in the budget to assist in additional freehold buy-back initiatives to further formalise the purchase of 24 freehold parcels of land to assist the landless resource owners secure arable, cultivatable land interest-free. Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 24 freehold buy-back land, 15 are in the Northern Division, 8in the Central Division and one in the Western Division. The Ministry through its Land Use Division is responsible for the administration and monitoring of this Buy-Back Scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Scheme the Government purchases freehold land for sale in the market on behalf of the iTaukei landowners. The acquisition process was based at the time and continues to be based on a fair and market price determined by Government registered valuers. This will be made possible through Interest-free loans as stipulated in the terms and conditions of the Sales and Purchase Agreement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main features of the Sales and Purchase Agreement between Government and the respective LOUs includes the purchase amount shall be paid over period of 30 years. Upon completion of the payment, the Director of Lands on behalf of Government shall transfer the said land to the Trustees in freehold status, and it shall not be alienated, sold, transferred or exchanged except to the State. If the Trustees default in payment of the monies as scheduled, then the Minister may rescind the agreement and require trustees to hand over the vacant possession of the land to the Director of Lands, and all monies paid shall be forfeited to the Government. Subject to Cabinet approval, the terms and conditions of the agreement may be varied by mutual consent of the parties. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 29(5) of the 2013 Constitution, provides that all land that existed as freehold land immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall remain as freehold land even if it is sold or purchased unless it is sold to the State or acquired by the State for a public purpose under Section 27. Given these new constitutional requirements, the buy-back land shall now revert and have reverted since 2013 to qualified landowning units in its current tenure as freehold land and not as iTaukei reserved land as per initial Sales and Purchases Agreement stated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far out of the 24 freehold buy back lands, nine landowning units have fully paid their dues amounting to a return of $1.7 million to the State. To date, seven landowning units have paid off their debts with parcels of land transferred are: the Yavusa Nasuva in Tuvumaca in Taveuni, Cakaudrove, • • Wairuku Estate, Waivunia Savusavu in Cakaudrove, • Yavusa Waidau, Navuloa Bureta Ovalau in Lomaiviti, • Mataqali Nailagobokola in Nausori, Tailevu, • Mua Estate, Yavusa Wainikeli, Welagi Tavueni, • Namaqumaqua, Mataqali Bitolevu in Serua; and • As of last week, on Friday, Tuwaidra in Nabu, Yavusa Vugalei, Kasavu in Tailevu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, two landowning units have fully paid their land parcels in addition to the seven and their land parcels have yet to be transferred to them and they are:</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2145 • Matakunea, Mataqali Nasavanivonu, Navatu, Savusavu, Cakaudrove; and • Dedena Mataqali Naumisi, Namena in Tailevu. On the other hand, 15 landowning units have partly paid their dues with a total outstanding balance of just over 2 million, which is currently being monitored by the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a way forward, the current measures undertaken by the Ministry to improve loan repayments are: (1) Strengthening collaboration with our landowning units. The Ministry through the Land Use Division, continue to liaise with the Trustees and landowning units and properly to advise them and assist them wherever it is relevant. (2) Joint Venture Initiative – Land Use Division has successfully implemented joint ventures initiatives and resource owner friendly concepts to fast track and assist landowning units in paying back their loans. (3) Leasing of their land. – For unserviced accounts, ongoing consultations and active marketing and leasing land to assist the landowning units in their payments. The Ministry is currently leasing 11 freehold buy back lands to assist the landowning units that have defaulted in their payments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the successful applicants, the Ministry has also rendered assistance to landowning units such as redefinition of their boundaries for buy back lands that have been paid off, land-use visibility reports on potential developments and ongoing consultations and assistance rendered for the transfer titles without any cost. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the success rate sitting at 37.5 (percent) meaning 9 out of the 24 of the buyback land scheme fully paid, the buyback scheme has greatly benefited the traditional landowners. It has brought a sense of belonging, pride, ownership, security and of course empowerment to them. The Ministry, through its Land Use Division for the land bank have always emphasised the right or equal access to land for all including the vulnerable members of indigenous i-Taukei and those desiring to secure affordable parcels for their livelihood. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey that began three decades ago for the recipients of the buyback scheme is a journey that has been characterised by their determination, resilience and unwavering commitment to prosperity. The Government and the Ministry is, therefore, proud to be part of the journey by these landowning units. Over the years the Ministry has been steadfast in its commitment to provide fair, transparent, effective and non-discriminatory administration for all buy back land purchase under the Freehold Buy-Back Scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, landowning units’ land have been handed over are always advised to cultivate their land, maximise its potential for productive purposes and generate significant returns for the landowning units. Furthermore, LOU’s are always encouraged to pursue income generating initiatives to benefit the current and future generations. Added to this, are the intrinsic in heritage attached to land which hovers around reclaiming their culture, their identity, and indeed their future. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still have some time in my present role as the acting Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, I wish to inform Parliament and the people of Fiji that our security personnel, men and women of the RFMF in the deployed units and regions of Lebanon, Syria and Golan Heights, Jerusalem and in Sinai are all well, safe and in high morale. Whilst they are there, they remain compliant with the safety protocols that are required of them in a very hostile region at</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>2146</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 present. I also urge all our citizens to remember our men and women in this region in the Middle East in their prayers, whilst they go through a very turbulent and difficult time. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like thank the honourable Minister of Land for his Ministerial Statement. Mr. Speaker, the tribute must be paid to every government since the initiative of Buy-Back Scheme came into effect. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Buy-Back Scheme was established in 1989 as the Minister has alluded under the Rabuka regime with the intentions or objectives to assist the native landowners who had little or no cultivable agricultural land. Thirty years incentive was given to the Mataqalis to repay loan before regaining absolute ownership. Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, the Buy-Back Schemes must be monitored to see whether the land is utilised and used for that purpose or else it will be of no use. Until 2020, only four Yavusa were paid off fully and gained ownership. In 2021, the FijiFirst Government paid $4.7 million on the land Buy-Back Scheme. It purchased 26 parcels of freehold land on behalf of land-owning units. Mr. Speaker, Sir, most or majority of Fijians in our country do not own land, hence initiatives should be given to those Fijians, and here the honourable Minister for iTaukei wants to transfer all state land to iTaukei land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government of the day must monitor as most of the buyback land has breaches such as non-cultivation and land lying idle. And we all know, how important the agriculture sector is, as what happened during COVID 19. Keeping land idle is of no use for our nation or to our people. In conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, it may be a good initiative, but every Fijian has to be looked after and should own a piece of land for living. In fact, most of iTaukei does not have any land in Fiji. As this initiative was started by the honourable Prime Minister, I would urge the honourable Prime Minister to start an initiative that will look after all Fijians, and all will have a piece of land in Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Kirpal. You are very true in saying that some iTaukei do not have any land, they are landless people. So, this is one way of providing land to them. The honourable Minister for Lands has quoted that specific Section of the Constitution 2013, which when buying back freehold land, it remains freehold land. But I think reservation of those freehold land can be undertaken, because we have a precedent case in Ovalau, where freehold land has been reserved for the landowners. I now call on the leader of the G9-Bloc or their designate. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, let me thank the honourable Minister for Lands for the statement on the buyback scheme and for the update, the assurance that our men and women were serving over and beyond shores, are well and safe. Perhaps, I also take this time to remind the honourable Members of the Parliament that the best way to remember them, not only as we pray, but the best way to remember them is to support them with your poppy. So, if you are not wearing a poppy, I would ask them perhaps, but they should be fine and contribute to the aftercare fund of the servicemen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also stand as the Chairman of the trustees of the Bua Buyback Scheme for the Yavusa Wainikeli in Naselesele, Taveuni. Perhaps, my response to the honourable Minister is really in the form of our journey - in how we acquired the land, what we want to do with it and where we are at this point in time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 30 years ago, through the wise decision of our Chief, Ratu Talemo Ratakele, and the others of the vanua, we decided to commit the vanua to acquire this piece of land. It took us</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2147 30 years to pay it off, until last year when the title was given to us by the honourable Prime Minister. Those years of hard work, but of a commitment by the vanua to see an opportunity to get back the land that belonged to them but is owned by someone else, the opportunity to own it and the challenge to utilise it. This is where are today. The challenge to utilise this piece of land which is ours, Yavusa Wainikeli. I want to share with you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done so far. I sit as a chair with some of us who live in Suva and representation from the mataqali in vanua. We have left out a strategic direction for the utilisation of this land here. It is a five to 10 and beyond, and how are we going to utilise this land. It has not been an easy exercise. The challenges within the vanua with the conflicts of who owns it and who should use it. This is something that we are facing right now, but really the way forward is advocacy and the ability of the committee or the team that is leading the vanua to be able to explain very clearly on what the land is meant for, and what it should be used for. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we saw the opportunity when we acquired this piece of land. It was an investment forward, an investment for the next generation, and above all, the realisation and the confidence that we now own the land, we must now use the land to benefit us now and the generation to come. We have been fortunate that through the consultation with the Government agencies, in this particular case, the honourable Minister for Land, and the honourable Minister for Agriculture who have guided us all along in their support. This 1,184 acres of land in Bua of four blocks, we will be signing an MOU soon with the honourable Minister for Agriculture to improve some of the roads and a demonstration farm. We have also completed a land assessment with the honourable Minister for Lands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the baseline that we should start off. I wish I had more time to tell our story, but at this point in time, we have realised that the key to our success in our venture forward and beyond is based on four key areas. The first one, is really on good leadership, that is given two good plans. Three, duavata, veiwekani vinaka and cakacaka vata brings duavata or unity. Four, a continuous consultation and support from the Government and the other key stakeholders. I once again thank the Government, and this is one of the most useful projects that Government has done that will benefit our people. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, honourable Naivalurua has taken a very huge, in fact, it is a giant step to help his own vanua, his yavusa. At one time, the chiefly family were closely shutting off people to use that particular land that was bought for the whole tribe. I am so glad and happy that honourable Naivalurua has decided to shift his base from Sawani back to his village. He has done very well, and I must applaud him for that. Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.32 p.m.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>2148</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.42 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just before we proceed, please join me in welcoming the Year 6 students and teachers of Ratu Sauvoli Memorial School. (Acclamation) MR. SPEAKER.- Just allow me to say a few words in the vernacular. Vinaka vakalevu na gade toka mai na mai veisiko toka na nomuni Bose Lawa. Ra gone au kila e yawa sara na vanua ni lakova mai. Ratu Sauvoli Memorial School mai Noco qo ka? Vinaka vakalevu, ni bula vinaka. Ni kalougata tiko ra gone. Strategic Vision and Progress Towards Enhancing Access to Justice HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, na gone Turaga na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, kemuni na gone mai Rewa, qasenivuli, and members of this great country who are listening in at this moment, before I begin, Sir, allow me to respond to the issue raised by honourable Kirpal, and I will do so by referring to a speech made by His Excellency at the International Labour Conference in Geneva in June of last year. This what he said, and I quote: “…in line with Fiji Government and Cabinet decision to cede to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNRIP)” and President Katonivere highlighted in this summit, “provides an opportunity to inform the interest of the community, that Fiji's has taken the important step of supporting UNRIP.” He goes further to say, and I quote: “…we join the international community in affirming the fullest expression of Indigenous people’s aspirations. Fiji’s support to UNDP is complementary to its commitment to ILO Convention 169 which ratified in 1998. As a nation we will continue to ensure that the Rights of Indigenous People are safeguards and protected.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, one has to ask a very important question, how did the landowners first lose their land? A good example is none other than Suva City, as I understand there was a case in the Lautoka High Court, they lost out, High Court, Court of Appeal because of time, records. I do understand they were only paid annuity, a small amount and that is what the people of Suvavou are still begging for. The Buy-Back Scheme is a Social Justice Programme for the itaukei. I was in Koro recently, there are freehold land on Koro Island. One has to ask how can there be freehold land on the island? I have a file of Mudu Village, Koro, who are asking for land, 500 acres they only have 200 acres and the numbers keep on growing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this government is committed to the principle of restoration. I did say this in my very first speech here. For my fellow Parliamentarians, I cannot explain how it touches our heart when we talk about land, land lost, dubious means, fraudulent means an outright illegal. Our forefathers did not have any means to reclaim that land, but this scheme is a Buy-Back, it gives a small satisfaction to the members of the iTaukei who have lost land and that does not stop the other ethnic groups from purchasing land through lease, outright freehold, or even if you want to rent. But for the owners of land, as honourable Naivalurua articulated, they have taken steps to be developed,</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2149 and this is the legacy of this very government - a government that cares and a government that delivers. HON. K. K. LAL.- Hogwash! HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Listen! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Yesterday, I was in a funeral, head of my mataqali said, so, when are we going to get this thing back and he said, it takes time. What I am saying is, the government is not going to willy-nilly deal with the rights of the itaukei, it is going to follow the proper channel of law by due process and of course consultation. That is the point Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to stress in relation to honourable Sanjay Kirpal. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- No shortcut! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- No shortcut! James 4:10 and I quote, “ Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.” Honour, get down on your knees before the master, that is the only way out, you will get on your feet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak on the Ministry of Justice’s strategic vision and progress towards enhancing access to justice and public service delivery in Fiji. It is with great honour and responsibility that I address this august Parliament today. The Ministry of Justice remains steadfast in its mission to uphold justice, integrity and accountability, reflecting our unwavering commitment to rule of law. Over the past months our accomplishments have been more than mere milestones. This signifies our relentless pursuit of excellence in the public service. Every initiative we undertake is grounded in our dedication to serving the people of Fiji and fostering a society where justice prevails. The ministry stands as a pillar of democracy and a beacon of hope in public governance guided by strategic visions that aligns the aspirations of our citizens within imperatives of justice. We have made significant strides through carefully planned initiatives that you flag both the commitment to operational excellence and our ability to adapt to the evolving need of our society. Our ongoing reforms in process and systems coupled with the active engagement of our staff, ensure that we continue to meet the demands of the public and uphold the highest standards of services. One of the most pivotal undertaking of the ministry has been the comprehensive socialisation of this 5 Years Strategic Development Plan for 2025-2029. This plan is not a mere document, it is a strategic framework that charters the course of our future endeavours, outlining our aspirations and how we intend to achieve them. Aligned with the National Development Plan for 2025-2029, the Ministry of Justice will continue to promote justice and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The SDP has been meticulously disseminated to all registry centres across Fiji, ensuring that every member of our staff is aligned with the Ministry’s new mission, vision and values. The socialisation process is a transformative journey that seeks to embed the principles of excellence, innovation, and accountability within the very fabric of our Ministry. By engaging our 164 member staff nationwide in this process, including the six additional staff who joined on 31 st July, 2024, we ensure that our strategic objectives are not only understood but are embedded and actively pursued at every level. This alignment is critical as it empowers our</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>2150</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 staff to contribute meaningfully to our overarching goals, thereby enhancing the quality of service we provide to the public. The Strategic Development Plan serves a compass that guides our actions and decisions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and excellence. As stipulated in the Ministry’s Strategic Development Plan–Strategy 3: Customer Empowered Services – The Ministry engages its customers for long-term marketplace success. This engagement strategy includes how the Ministry listens to the voice of our customers, builds customer relationships, and uses customer information to improve and identify opportunities for innovation. The Ministry profoundly values the importance of being a good listener to our customers. The diversity of views, either positive or adverse are considered as a vehicle of change and a direct contributor to business excellence either from customer services standpoint or capacity as an organisation to operate within the excellence mechanisms. The Ministry uses the following customer mechanisms to listen to the voice of the customer: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) email feedback; feedback forms; formal and informal correspondences; telephone; field reports; and customer referral mechanisms. These mechanisms have enabled the Ministry to innovate and creatively enhance our customer support, fostering loyalty and trust. By cultivating a customer-centric mindset within our workforce and deepening our understanding of customer behaviour, we have been able to improve the services we provide while promoting a culture of knowledge-sharing and continuous improvement. The Ministry has shifted its focus to a customer-oriented approach, prioritising the development of strong customer relationships. This shift has empowered our workforce to a better segment and to understand our customer needs. Our commitment to this approach is evident in the outreach programmes, where we actively bring our services to the people, ensuring greater accessibility and engagement. The Ministry has extended its services to the public through the registration of Births, Deaths, Marriages, as well as Registration of Companies, conducted by district staff. Many individuals in remote maritime islands have not been registered, leading to: children attending school without birth certificates; couples living together without being officially married; lack of death certificates for those who have passed away; and (1) (2) (3) (4) other services of the Ministry can facilitate. In doing so, the Ministry has identified its customers through: customer segmentation; (1) product offerings and customer support; (2) (3) building customer relationships; and (4) complaint management.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2151 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with our long-term strategic vision, the Ministry has developed an improvement planning process that transforms our priorities into actionable steps and measurable outcomes. This detailed blueprint guides daily operations, ensuring alignment with our goals by involving input from all levels of the organisation. The process promotes coherence and consistency, driving performance and fostering a results-oriented culture. Through this alignment, staff can focus on achieving clear objectives, enhancing efficiency, ownership, and accountability in their efforts to deliver excellence. Reflecting on a comprehensive record of our achievements, challenges and learnings over the years, it provides a transparent and detailed account of our performance, highlighting key milestones and areas for improvement. This serves as both a testament to our progress and a foundation for future improvement. The progress of the Ministry is very critical for accountability ensuring that we remain transparent and answerable to the people we serve. We have begun our journey capturing the essence of our efforts and the impact of our initiatives. It provides valuable insights and informs our strategies and guides our future endeavours. By reflecting on the past, we can learn from our experience and build on our successes as we continue to improve and evolve as an organisation. A pivotal aspect of our strategic and operational planning is the formulation of the costed Operational Plan. This plans aligns the financial requirements and allocations necessary to achieve our strategic objectives, ensures that our resources are utilised efficiently and effectively, maximising the impact of our initiatives. The costed Operation Plan is an essential tool for physical responsibility and strategic resource management enabling us to deliver our commitments while maintaining financial stability. The formation of the costed Operation Plan was a vigorous process that involves detailed analysis and careful planning. To ensure that every dollar is spent wisely, supporting initiatives that drive our mission forward. This plan not only provides a financial road map but also serves as a tool for monitoring and evaluating our progress, ensuring that we remain on track to achieve our goals. The Ministry of Justice is deeply committed to making justice accessible to all Fijians through our extensive outreach program. These initiatives are a crucial part of our mission, as we strive to bring essential services directly to communities across Fiji. Our outreach includes a range of services such as registry of births, deaths, marriages, register of titles, official receiver and register of companies. From August 13 th to 18 th, 2024, the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice, conducted an outreach programme in Yasayasa Moala. This programme provided the village of Totoya, Matuku and Moala with guidance support on obtaining vital documents. During this period, officials and staff from the births, deaths and marriage registry officiated four court marriages, three in Yaroi, Matuku and on a vessel travelling from Lomati to Yaroi due to the inability of officials being able to travel to Lomati to conduct the court marriage. The outreach efforts in Yasayasa Moala yielded impressive results. 7 late birth registrations, 27 business registrations, 14 new birth registrations and 42 birth certificate renewals. Building on this success, the Ministry of Justice organised a ministerial tour to Koro Island from September 10 th to the 13 th, 2024. The purpose of the tour was to bring our services closer to the people, strengthening their trust and confidence in the justice system. As part of this effort, in partnership with Post Fiji Ltd, we opened the Births, Deaths and Marriage Registry Office at the Post Office in Koro Island. Accompanied by representatives from eight Government Ministries and 13 stakeholders, I visited five villages namely, Nasau, Nabuna, Nakodu, Nacamaki and Navaga, along with key institutions including the Nasau Post office, Koro High School, the District Commissioners Office, the Nasau Agriculture Station and the Nasau Health Centre and various nursing stations. The tour was an astounding success with the people of Koro warmly welcoming the services provided.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>2152</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 In each village, residents eagerly learnt to access services from BDM Officers and FNPF Staff, who printed ID Cards and checked members account balances. Many villagers, especially women, seized the opportunity to register their business and apply for grants offered by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. The engagement and enthusiasm from the community underscored the positive impact of bringing this vital service directly to the people of Fiji. From 25 th September to 29 th September, I, along with senior members of the Justice Ministry visited Ovalau to engage with communities and provide direct assistance. Accompanied by a representative from the Registrar of Companies and the Ministry’s executive team, we visited Tokou, Voma, Nauouo, Waitovu and market vendors along the Levuka corridor. The primary focus was to facilitate registrations of businesses, births, deaths and marriages services. This initiative sparked great interest with many residents registering small businesses including canteens, farms, food services and handicraft centres. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 253 new businesses were successfully registered in Levuka, and as of today, 253 businesses have been approved. The Ministry is extending its outreach to other villages, including Bureta, Lovoni, Taviya, Arovudi and Rukuruku from this Friday into this weekend. Many residents were unaware of the need to register their businesses until they sought Government aid, where registration was required. To assist these new business owners, the team is providing guidance on online business registration and applying for the business grant from the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. In the coming months, additional registry offices will be established in Qarani on Gau, Keiyasi Village in Nadroga/Navosa, Rotuma, Ba and Kadavu. This effort reflects our commitment to embodying the principle of “no one should be left behind”, ensuring that even the most remote communities receive the support they need. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of the celebration of Fiji Day, a team will be also going to Vanua Levu, soon after the official function, we will be engaged in Bua for two days. Our commitment to ensuring that justice is right for all Fijians, not just a privilege for a select few, is unwavering. I would like to recognise the previous Government’s efforts in establishing BDM in Savusavu, Nabouwalu and Korovou, which made these essential services more accessible. Additionally, in partnership with Post Fiji, we have expanded BDM services to 20 post offices across the country, further enhancing access to all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, investing in human capital is essential to the Ministry’s success. Over the past months, we have launched comprehensive Leadership and Customer Service Training programs, aimed at enhancing our staff’s skills and competencies. These initiatives are central to cultivating a culture of leadership, professionalism and excellence within the Ministry. The introduction of improvement systems has significantly streamlined our operations, boosting efficiency and service delivery. In July, we conducted a two-day inhouse training on Leadership Training for our team leaders emphasising the internal procedures and the roles of each officer. This training is part of our ongoing effort to position ourselves as premier ministry. Additionally, several team leaders visited the Fiji Airways Headquarters in Nadi to gain valuable insight into customer service excellence, particularly focusing on benchmarking and the concept of self-reflection to drive internal improvements. I also met with the Acting Permanent Secretary of Justice, the Director of Corporate Services and all heads of Registries to address challenges and discuss necessary improvements to facilitate public service delivery across Fiji. By equipping our staff with the necessary tools and training, we ensure that they are well prepared to meet the demands of their roles and deliver exceptional service to the public.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2153 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight the significant milestone through the collaboration between the Ministry of Justice and iTaukei Affairs, aimed at enhancing the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) system. This partnership underscores our commitment to making Government services more accessible while preserving traditional governance systems. The VKB is crucial for the iTaukei people as it serves as a living document that records ancestral lineages and family roots. However, challenges have arisen, particularly with the timely updating of birth and death records, leading to disputes over land ownership and chief appointments. I am excited to announce that the VKB as a pilot project had commenced, with the officers from VKB based at the Ministry for Justice for one month and to report to the two consultants who are currently undergoing the review of the VKB system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an honour for the opportunity to speak on the Ministry of Justice. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Members of Parliament, fellow citizens. While the honourable Minister’s words attempt to portray a story of success, the reality faced by the people of Fiji tells a very different tale. The Minister boasts about progress and achievements, yet the experiences of ordinary Fijians, those who must navigate a complex and often inaccessible justice system remain plagued by delays, bureaucracy and lack of support. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. K. K. LAL.- The Ministry speaks of enhancing access to justice, but I ask the honourable Minister where is the access when people’s cases are backlogged for many years and victims of injustice are left in the dark without resolution to answers? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the so-called strategic vision is nothing but hollow words when it lacks tangible outcomes. The people of Fiji have had grand promises time and time again even during the 2022 General Election, but promises do not pay for legal fees, nor do they shorten the wait times for hearings and judgements. The Ministry must address the serious challenges of delayed court proceedings, lack of legal aid for vulnerable groups and overwhelming complexities for our judicial purposes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also find it disingenuous for the honourable Minister to speak of the Ministry’s progress and strategic vision when the same honourable Minister remains silent during the recent debate of the reintroduction of the death penalty. When the honourable Minister for Women made a shocking statement calling for the death penalty for drug traffickers, where was the voice of the honourable Minister for Justice? How can the Ministry claim to be a Ministry for Justice, when it fails to speak up on fundamental human rights? Silence on such critical issues speaks volumes. It suggests a lack… HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. Point of Order! I think the honourable Member should stick to the topic. Standing Order 60 and stop meandering. He needs to stop misleading Parliament, there has been no debate in Parliament on this issue, and no introduction of it, and he needs to be factual about it when he is presenting on it. Stick to the relevance of the Ministerial Statement. MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue. HON. K. K. LAL.- Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Sir. Silence on such a critical issues speaks volumes. It suggests a lack of true commitment to justice, fairness and the protection of rights enshrined in the 2013 Constitution. To the honourable Minister for Justice, it is your duty not just to promote policies and strategies, but to ensure that the Government and its independent institutions</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>2154</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 uphold the 2013 Constitution, the very foundation of our democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution guarantees the rights and freedoms of every Fijian, and it is the responsibility of the Ministry to protect these rights without compromise. This is not just a legal obligation, but a moral one. If we are to build a justice system that is truly accessible, efficient and equitable, we need more than words, we need genuine reform, especially your service delivery. Honourable Kirpal was not wrong, he was right! Especially about Fijians who do not own land. You need to improve your service delivery and perform well, honourable Minister. While the honourable Minister for Justice may seek to reassure us with grand statements and statistics, the Opposition will continue to hold this Government to account. We will ensure that the voices of ordinary Fijians are heard, and that the justice system serves them, not just the privileged few. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also attended the launch of the Sexual Orientation Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Handbook, which was funded by the UK Government, and there are various case studies of injustices against fellow Fijians which are shocking. I invite the honourable Minister to read this book to gain more knowledge of the issues facing our vulnerable in our society. At the same time, we have the NDP. If the honourable Minister would go to sub-chapter 8.1, there is more to talk about injustice in the Ministry. Before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must humbly request all honourable Members of Parliament to show our unwavering support for the poppy appeal in honour of our brave Military Forces. Let us not also forget the importance of Pinktober, as we stand in solidarity with our cancer survivors and advocate for the health and well-being of our people. MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the leader of the G9-Bloc or his designate. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Justice for the Ministerial Statement. It was very informative, highlighting the progress that the ministry has done so far in enhancing its service delivery. I think if the honourable Ketan Lal was listening to the last ministerial statement by the Minister for Justice, he had touched about the backlog in court cases. So, the focus on the ministerial statement today was on the birth, deaths and marriages (BDM) and also other services that have been taken to the maritime areas and also in conjunction with the REACH Programme with Ministry of Education where we saw some new couples had their wedding on the government vessel. I thank the honourable minster for the service delivery done so far and we hope to move to other parts, Vanua Levu, I think the honourable Minister should not forget Vanua Levu if not we will have to return all the ‘ kai Vanualevu’ in Viti Levu. There is also a call from the Honourable Naupoto and the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, not to forget Vanua Balavu and other parts of Lau. A very important issue that you have raised, that is for the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) officer that is now attached with the consultant at the Ministry of Justice given that we were moving around with this Child Justice Bill and Child Care and Protection Bill, and that is one of the things that came up. Given that most of our villagers do not register their children in the VKB and they are denied their fair share of lease money too. Given if this service delivery is enhanced because one of the requirements is the birth certificate, and also when you come to elections too, some people do not go to vote because they do not have a voter card because they do not have a birth certificate. In some cases, some school students do not have birth certificates and they find it very hard to go for enrolment to go to schools.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2155 Also, in one of our consultations, we found out, and probably just another suggestion honourable Minister to add on to enhancing the services, that is to have a system that connects the Ministry of Health when a baby is delivered and at that same time it hits that system for registration of birth certificates. That also allows the mother and the child for other grant services that are available for newborn. A system that should allow that particularly child to be registered automatically in the VKB through the system. This could be something that could improve the system as we move on, thank you very much honourable Minister for the service delivery that was done so far to reach out to the maritime areas and to the interior parts of Fiji, where most of the people when they go out, they want these services to come to their doorsteps. Because they have to pay transportation fees and also bus fares to come to areas, even have to by boats to come to Viti Levu, Suva and taking these services to their doorsteps will really help them a lot. We thank the Coalition Government for bringing these services and taking it to another level where the FijiFirst Government had reached, we have taken it to another level. Vinaka, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER. – Interesting, thank you so much for the comments and now we will move on honourable Members. What has been highlighted by the honourable Minister for Justice is something that we should seriously take note of and that is the VKB, reviewing it, and there is a need for the Minister of i-Taukei Affairs to see how best to take into account, those who have blood ties et cetera. Especially with our vasu’s and those that are part European. Vinaka vakalevu.</p></body>
