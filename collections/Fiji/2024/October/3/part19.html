<body><h3>NATIONAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT BILL 2024</h3><h4>NATIONAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Thursday 23 rd May, 2024, I move: That the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; at the outset, I would like to acknowledge the commendable work done by the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Justice Law and Human Rights. The National Disaster Risk Management Bill, as you see today, is a manifestation of the thorough consultation and verification process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part one, of the Bill provides the short title and outlines when the Bill will come into effect. It also includes the interpretation of key terms used throughout the legislation, ensuring clarity and consistency. Additionally, the application section defines the scope of the Bill specifying where and how</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 2191 the provisions apply. Most importantly, this part establishes the objectives of the Bill which aims to enhance Fiji’s preparedness, resilience and response to disasters. It also sets out the guiding principles that will underpin our disaster risk management efforts, ensuring a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable approach. With these foundational elements in place, we are equipped to move forward with a strong and effective Disaster Management Framework. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 2 of the Bill focuses on disaster risk governance. This Bill is designed to build a more resilient Fiji. At the heart of this framework as a National Disaster Risk Management Council, which is all the Permanent Secretaries for Government Ministries and key Government statutory bodies. The Council will serve as a central body responsible for overseeing disaster risk governance across the nation. To complement this effort the establishment of the Disaster Risk Reduction Committee, the merger of the two committees from the previous Act would be pivotal in driving our national agenda on disaster mitigation, prevention and preparedness. This Committee will lead our efforts in raising awareness, training our communities and ensuring the Disaster Risk Reduction becomes an integral part of our development planning. By enhancing our disaster preparedness, we are not just reacting to crisis, but proactively reducing the impacts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, equally important is the role of the emergency committee, which is tasked with coordinating our immediate response when disasters occur. Under the leadership of the Permanent Secretary responsible for Disaster Management, this Committee ensures a swift, efficient, well-coordinated response minimising the damage and loss often caused by disasters. Additionally, the Committee has the authority to convene and make recommendations to Cabinet in the event that National Disaster Risk Management Council is unable to convene. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 2, also defines the roles of the National Controller and National Coordinator who will have broad oversight and operational powers to lead and coordinate disaster management efforts across the country. These roles will ensure that our systems are agile and capable of adapting to any emergency that may arise. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Disaster Risk Management Office (NDRMO) will serve as a cornerstone for our Disaster Governance Framework formally known as the National Disaster Management Office. This rebranded entity reflects a strategic shift towards managing risks before they escalate into disasters. With a dedicated team and strong leadership the NDRMO will oversee the coordination of all aspects of disaster management from preparedness and planning, to response and recovery, ensuring a more proactive and efficient approach to safeguarding our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we proceed with part 2 of the Bill, I would like to highlight several key components that are vital to strengthening our Disaster Risk Management Framework. This Bill retains the Clause regarding the Disaster Service Liaison Officer from the previous legislation. This officer will play a critical role in coordinating disaster management efforts among stakeholders within the respective agencies ensuring effective communication and collaboration during times of crisis. In addition, the establishment of the Single Window International Facilitation Team is a critical step forward. This Team will streamline and manage international assistance during disasters, ensuring that legal and logistical challenges are addressed, and that aid can be received and distributed efficiently. By formalising this process, we guarantee that international support is swiftly mobilised when needed.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2192 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 The establishment of the Fiji Cluster System will further enhance our disaster management capacity by coordinating sector specific responses. This System encourages collaboration across various sectors such as Health and Nutrition, Education and Communications, ensuring a cohesive and integrated approach to disaster response. The Bill also provides for the registration and regulation of humanitarian actors and disaster risk management volunteers. These actors will be recognised through a formal registry and clear standards will be established to ensure accountability and effectiveness roles in their contributions. This structure also allows for the deregistration of actors or volunteer organisations that fail to meet the required standards thereby maintaining the integrity of our disaster response efforts. The Bill introduces a system for eligible actors with a formal registry that ensures all entities contributing to disaster risk management are properly recognised and regulated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we advance to Part 3 of this significant Bill, I would like to highlight the provisions concerning the sub-national administration. This section elevated from the 1995 National Disaster Management Plan, establishes the Divisional Disaster Risk Management Office as a vital entity in our efforts to address disaster risks at the Divisional level. The functions of the Divisional Disaster Risk Management Office are clearly defined, ensuring that each Division is equipped with the necessary leadership to implement effective disaster risk management strategies tailored to the specific needs and circumstances. Furthermore, the establishment of Disaster Risk Management Committees recognises membership at provincial and district levels, municipal level and community level. The National Coordinator, in consultation with the responsible Divisional Commissioner is tasked with establishing these committees at the following levels provincial and state levels, municipal level in consultation with the responsible Special Administrator or Mayor, community level in collaboration the responsible Turaga ni Koro or District Advisory Council. The membership of these sub-national Disaster Risk Management Committees is clearly defined in the respective schedules. Schedule 5 outlines members for Provincial and District Levels. Schedule 6 details members for municipal levels and schedule seven specifies members for community levels. The structured approach, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensures that the Disaster Risk Management is effectively addressed at every level of our society, fostering a coordinated and proactive response to potential disasters. As we proceed to part 4 of the Bill, I would like to emphasise the financial arrangements that are crucial for our disaster disk management efforts, this part outlines the provisions for the budget dedicated to disaster risk management, ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support our initiatives and response strategies. Part 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we establish the Disaster Risk Management Fund. This fund is designed to provide the necessary financial support for disaster preparedness and response activities, including loss and damage. The purpose the fund, along with its application processes, procurement guidelines and the requirements for accounting audits are clearly defined to ensure transparency and accountability. Additionally, the fund will be subject to an annual report, and we have included provisions for income tax exemption to encourage contributions and investments in our disaster risk management efforts.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 2193 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 6, which focuses on disaster risk reduction. This section includes the establishment of a multiple hazard warning system, ensuring that there will be effective mechanisms in place to provide timely warnings to our communities. The responsibilities of the various agencies involved in issuing warnings, arrangement of this warning and the communication systems that will be utilised are all outlined in this part. Furthermore, Sir, we also address the need for evacuation centres, recognising the critical roles in ensuring the safety and well-being of our citizens during emergencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 7 focuses on disaster risk management plans. This section introduces the National Disaster Risk Management Plan detailing its contents and the process for regular reviews to ensure its effectiveness. It also mandates the creation of Divisional Provincial and District Disaster Risk Management Plans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 9 of the Bill, outlines the provisions regarding emergency operations. Details of the process for declaring national state of disaster including public dissemination and duration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 11 focuses on relief and early recovery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 12 addresses international assistance, here we outline the processes for assessing the need for international support, making requests and coordinating efforts. It clarifies the responsibilities of assisting international actors, ensuring effective collaboration with global partners during crisis. In Part 13, it discusses international deployment, establishing a national emergency response team, tasked with mobilising resources and expertise during emergencies. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 14 of the Bill, I would like to outline the miscellaneous provisions is essential for the effective implementation of the National Disaster Risk Management Bill. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill represents a comprehensive approach to disaster risk management, equipping our nation with the tools and frameworks necessary to effectively respond to and recover from disasters. Thank you, vinaka vakalevu and dhanyavaad. MR. SPEAKER.– Honourable Members, the floor is open for debate on the motion. I also have a list with me and like the other Bills that has been passed. This one here will be debated to one hour only. The Secretary-General will pass the timely note and speaking times will be limited to five minutes each. For that we have made some changes as well and the batting will be led by the honourable Leader of the Opposition who will be speaking for 17 minutes. Then the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection will follow, she will be speaking for seven minutes. Then it will be followed by honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, who will be speaking for seven minutes. Followed by the Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services who will also speak for seven minutes, and that will round off the participation on the debate. That comes to one hour. So, the floor is yours, honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first allow me to thank the honourable Members of the Opposition, including the G-9 Bloc, Sir, for allowing me to perhaps just take up the time allocated to us.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>2194 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 Let me congratulate the honourable Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management and his team, past and present, and partners for having worked so hard for the past years to arrive at this point where we now have the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 being tabled in this august Parliament. I must say, that today brings me, personally, a sense of satisfaction considering that I was a part of this journey in the efforts to review the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 and in the initial phases of the review, which has resulted in the Bill now tabled for debate. Having served us, as Divisional Disaster Coordinator, as National Disaster Controller, and as the line minister for National Disaster Management, I can attest to the need for the review of the Act. I also need to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister because the Act was in 1998 and, of course, the National Disaster Management Plan was also of 1995, which had his signature on those documents. But as time progressed, and given the phenomenon’s that we went through, there is a need, because of the so many actors coming into the country, the overlap and the duplication in roles and of course the need for us to align as well. So that we can accommodate and facilitate our partners when they do come into the country. One of the main purposes of the review of the Act, Sir, was to pave the way forward to overcome the overlapping roles in the administrative, boundaries and to create a stronger sense of shared responsibility within government, communities and with partners throughout the disaster management cycle for mitigation to preparedness, response and recovery. I am happy to note from my very quick browse through this Bill that most of the review objectives have been covered in the Bill. Basically, Sir, first was TC Pam of 2015. We deployed, and we just utilised our experience in the Military deployment and of course have to seek Cabinet approval. We learnt a lot from Vanuatu, particularly with the arrangements that they have, together with the team and when we looked at the lessons learned, we then had TC Winston in 2006. We were overwhelmed and we had a lot of support, and that led to the serious discussions, not only here but regionally as well. Together with the Australia’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, honourable Julie Bishop, we talked about the region, and we talked about Fiji as well. One is the Act and then the regional arrangements as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will make a few comments, not that they are there, but probably something that can be looked into as well for consideration. The shift in the focus of the Act from natural disasters to multi-hazard approach marks a significant step forward in terms of development in Fiji as this brings our disaster legislation up to par with current global practices. Before it only covered natural disasters, not man-made phenomenon and that, sort of, restricts us in so many ways. If we talk about oil spill but, of course, does not involve terrorism, that is under a separate Act altogether. But we were only limited to natural disasters. Now, the multi-hazard approach, that has been addressed in the Bill and I wish to thank the honourable Minister. The honourable Minister has talked about the national administration covered in Part 2. I just wish to comment very quickly, honourable Minister, on Division 6 - Humanitarian Actors, on the registration of all the actors and volunteers. This is very, very critical because a lot of times, after a disaster, there is a lot of funding around. And then all of a sudden, there is a group that comes in saying, “We have been in the Western Division for all these while”, and we do not know where they come from. It is usually the Fiji Council of Social Services (FCOSS), but then even some do not come under the umbrella of FCOSS, particularly the Human Rights. This is why we need to have this register, Sir.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 2195 Most importantly too, Sir, on the international assistance, we have found out that with all due respect to the good work that they do and this is why we need to rest and thank you for the de- registration because sometimes when they come for containers, they come up with a list of what is coming in the container, but there is a different thing altogether in the container. If we go now to Walu Bay, there is a Nissan patrol vehicle (SUV). It is rusting there at Walu Bay. That came in a container - outboard motor engines, brush cutters, computers - almost everything, but it was for other purposes. That is why organisations need to be registered and, of course, volunteers as well. So, this is very positive in the Bill. Probably some organisations will not agree, but I think in terms of transparency, accountability and interoperability, we need to put it together, particularly when we are answerable as well to those that do provide us with assistance and donations when it comes to our responses. I am happy to note as well, Sir, the provisions of the Bill in Part 3, that brings clarity to the roles of the different levels of administration, from Minister to National Disaster Controller, and to the Divisional and Provisional Administration, and to the communities, and recognises the critical role that Divisional officers and community members play in disasters. The establishment of Disaster Management Offices to support divisional operations is a positive development. And I have noted in the Bill, Sir, municipal councils are now included. Previously, it is only national government and right to the community, but municipal councils, particularly for those who are living within the town boundaries have an obligation because they collect rates from the ratepayers and they, unfortunately, do not have any emergency response plan at all. If you go to Wellington, they have an emergency response plan. If you go to Auckland, they have an emergency response plan. Here in Fiji, perhaps, honourable Ministers, this is something that we also need, but the municipal council has to be within that. Both, in the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement, I will talk about the role of the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation and the Chamber of Commerce as well later on in the Bill because in the towns and cities, this is where majority of the people live and, particularly, in terms of the economy. This is where our DRR also needs to focus because resilient cities is a top priority under both, the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement. This is why the role of the municipal council is so important and I am glad that they are now part of that. From my first experience in Labasa when there is flood, I asked, “Where is the Lord Mayor?” They said, “He does not come to the meeting.” I asked, why? They said, “No, he is not part of the it.” That should change. We know what Lautoka and Nadi went through in TC Evans and that is why we need their participation. Of course, a lot of people use your civic facilities and your town halls for evacuation purposes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill establishes a single window for the facilitation team, which will coordinate and expedite the legal requirements. The only thing that I noted, honourable Minister, it does not matter, it is now headed by the team from Trade, but usually it is Foreign Affairs and, of course, Procurement Office as well in there, but can be easily coordinated regardless of who is there. However, we need that focal point as well because national coordinator and the rest will be so busy with all other things. If we delegate these responsibilities with clear demarcation, it will really help a lot but because a lot of assistances are coming in, we need to have the single window facilitation, and I have talked about how we monitor as well. I have talked about the experience with containers and so many other things because in the end, we will always be accountable.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>2196 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 Lastly, Sir, past experiences called for some alignment in the work of Government, international partners and donors in the disaster management efforts. This is addressed through a system established under Part 12 of the Bill, which is extremely necessary to ensure better coordination in the disaster management, The honourable Minister has talked about international response. When we have the systems in place, if the ADF comes in, in the planning group, in whatever, everything will gel, Sir. This is why we need this coordination, and I am thankful that that is in place. Just a few observations, honourable Minister, that I wish to raise. On the title of the Bill, I am still concerned about ‘National Disaster Risk Management’. It might take the focus on risk management rather than just the National Disaster Management Act, because risk management is part of the disaster management cycle. So, I just want to make that contribution. Although I have noted in Part 6 of the Bill that it focuses on national disaster reduction. The other point that I wish to raise, honourable Minister, is whilst the Bill has adopted a multi- hazard approach to national disaster management, I am of the view that for purposes of clarity, the role of other agencies responsible for hazards that is put under Schedule 8 and Schedule 9, must be made clear, and should the hazards in their areas of control advance, to become national disasters. I also wish to raise on Schedule 3, if you can consider including the Chamber of Commerce in Suva. The Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation already have their own team, and they have been part of our council, we have been inviting them in previous years. I have talked about the role that they play in disasters because they will help us a lot. When we gave containers to Tonga for the response, most of the containers were provided by them because they were part of the team already. The donations that came were mostly from them, sponsorship, et cetera, and even releasing their employees to come and help us. That is why the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation is so important to the team. Schedule 4 on Divisional, perhaps, if respective Town Council Chamber of Commerce can be part of that Divisional Team. That is an observation, Sir. There has been some mention too about the Climate Change Adaptation Bill. I think when we had the Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 that was passed here a few months ago, I did mention about these overlaps because climate change is also related to disasters, as well as with the Environmental Management Act. What is important, and the Agency should know this that, once an activity or an event becomes a hazard (hazard is defined in the Act), then it falls into the responsibility of the Disaster Management area. May I also say here, Sir, in terms of the multi-hazard approach, I have also mentioned this previously, after COVID that was another experience, probably then we will have to get in all the other emergency frameworks because the Environmental Management Act comes under the honourable Prime Minister. Then we had a spill from a broken sewage pipe in Nabua a few years back. There was a big chaos because they have never been activated to respond. So, everything has to be handled again. That was why we need to probably bring in the emergency responses together later on. I also note that the Bill formalises the establishment of the cluster system. Honourable Minister, the cluster system in Part II, Division 5, only states that we are going to establish the cluster system. I am suggesting if cluster systems already established after TC Evans in 2012 can be put in.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 2197 We already have nine cluster systems in place. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister is saying, “I do not know which cluster system is that”, but I am going to tell you the disaster cluster, the: (1) Safety and Protection Cluster; (2) WASH Cluster (which is on water, sanitation and hygiene); (3) Logistics Cluster; (4) Shelter Cluster; (5) Infrastructure Cluster; (6) Communications Cluster; (7) Health and Nutrition Cluster; (8) Education Cluster; and (9) Food Security and Livelihood Cluster. Clusters are run together by both, government and non-government agencies. So, in terms of ownership because it will also bring commitment, it would be good to include the clusters in there. Lastly, Sir, I think just a small one – minor, but I think it important as well. There appears to be some confusion in the terminology. People are used to our set up that was put by our colonial masters. When you talk ‘sub-national’, people are used to ‘division’ and whatever because most of the boundaries that we have too in the country that the Bureau of Statistics work on is still based on this. You would know this, Sir, as a Valuer. With those observations, I, again, thank the honourable Minister and his team for the efforts. I wish you well in the application of the Bill and, of course, there will be opportunities for us too and we will always offer our assistance and help to contribute and, of course, the cyclone is coming up, Sir, and let us prepare well to minimise the damages and the costs. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill and I wish to congratulate the honourable Minister for such a time as this that this Bill has been really overdue. I want to just shift our focus to the human faces that need to deal with disasters and how this law that is before us is gender and vulnerable groups responsive. Now, we face unique challenges in Fiji and because of this legislation, it does need to address the unique challenges that our vulnerable groups face. Mr. Speaker, this is in line with our commitment in our National Development Plan, in strengthening the policy and legal framework for gender equality and social inclusion. Mr. Speaker, the Act has explicitly incorporated inclusiveness provisions which concerns vulnerable groups - our women, our children, our people living with disabilities and our older persons. Mr. Speaker, in reviewing this Bill, the following are just some provisions that I would like to highlight. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, in Clause 9 of the Bill - Powers of Chairperson of the Council, Subclause (b) has specifically mentioned ‘he’ or ‘she’, whereas in the previous Act, it just mentions ‘he’. So, obviously, Mr. Speaker, this is being gender responsive and inclusive, and we thank the honourable Minister for considering this, the Standing Committee, as well as the consultations that were undertaken.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>2198 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 Secondly, Mr. Speaker, as the Chair for the Safety and Protection Cluster, our Ministry is the Chair, I would like to acknowledge the establishment of the Fiji Cluster System in the Bill. It plays a crucial role in coordinating disaster response efforts across various sectors. Mr. Speaker, by incorporating gender responsive and vulnerable group strategies within the cluster system, we are ensuring that there is better preparedness for response and recovery for our vulnerable groups. Specifically, under Clause 66(2)(a) to (i), it has recognised the need for our evacuation centres to be retrofitted for the ease of access to our vulnerable groups. I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for raising the very important issue of our evacuation centres in our towns and cities where, Mr. Speaker, if do look at our informal settlements, especially with the number of people who live in informal settlements and the sizes of the halls, I do not think they will cater for such a big number as an evacuation centre. So, as we prepare to cope for our vulnerable groups especially, Mr. Speaker, this needs to be looked at. Mr. Speaker, there is also, in reference to Part 7 - Disaster Risk Management Plans, it specifically recognises the representation of vulnerable groups to be part of the consultations in formulating the National Disaster Risk Management Plan. Mr. Speaker, it is also important in upholding an evidence-based approach and intervention with relevant data, Part 8 of the Bill under Clause 82 has provisions in upholding data which is inclusive of vulnerable groups during a disaster. It includes requirements to collect, analyse, monitor and publish such data, to ensure that the response is inclusive and targeted. Probably, just a point of validation, Mr. Speaker, under Clause 99(b), it mentions the Turaga ni Koro from the 14 Provinces, but there are also Marama ni Koro in the Provinces. I am sure this will be validated by the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs in recognition of women's leadership and decision-making in our village settings. Mr. Speaker, the membership in the DRR Committee is impressive, compared to the 1998 Act. It ensures that gender is mainstreamed when it comes to disaster risk management, mainly, the Director responsible for women is included in the Committee, Mr. Speaker, and we acknowledge that. Also, under Schedule 7 (Section 50), it has provided for having representatives of women, youth and vulnerable groups. Also, in Schedule 4 (Section 47), there is specific mention also on representatives of vulnerable groups in the Municipal Disaster Risk Management Committees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, women, children and marginalised groups often bear the brunt of natural disasters. They are usually the most disproportionately affected, facing greater risks and challenges. But I do wish to, again, congratulate the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, and his Ministry Team, as well as to thank the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and honourable Members of the Committee, and the Office of the Solicitor-General, for their hard work in bringing this Bill to the House. The main objective is to ensure that our vulnerable groups are supported and assisted in times of risks and disaster, and to ensure that no one is left behind. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for explaining the Bill in detail and the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. I think this is a very important Bill, in that, it establishes a framework to guide the preparedness and response to disaster risks, including health emergencies.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 2199 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this Bill is timely because more and more, Fiji is becoming vulnerable to the speed, the frequency and the intensity of natural disasters and which, as we saw, has proven catastrophic in terms of livelihoods, damage to infrastructure, impact on public finances, the economy in general and the overall socio-economic landscape. The Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually provides a framework to respond effectively to issues, such as immediate humanitarian support rehabilitation, the construction works and income support to those who get affected in a big way. The honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Minister both pointed out that the Bill actually establishes an institutional and legislative framework to deal with the number of things that are required and are done during a disaster to make it more effective. It ensures that there is a proper decision-making structure that is transparent and accountable, and clearly lays out the powers and responsibilities of respective committees and agencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is similar to other legislative reforms that we had undertaken, and the proposed National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 was also part of the policy reform actions for our Joint Budget Support, like the Bill presented today by the honourable Deputy Prime and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. We want to thank all our partners, Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Australia and New Zealand and European Union, because we have received a lot of support towards the Bill too. The Ministry of Finance’s initiatives in support of Disaster Risk Response is in line with international best practice and the anticipation of some of the key provisions of the Bill. The Ministry of Finance has already undertaken several new initiatives to support Disaster Risk Preparedness and Response. And let me very quickly just talk about the recently negotiated $75 million Disaster Fund Facility with JICA. This will help us with quick disbursement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the finance has already been negotiated and approved, prior to the disaster and will be disbursed upon request from Government, once a State disaster is declared by Cabinet. Apart from the quick disbursement, this is also a very highly concessional financing facility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the JICA Standby Facility, Fiji has also taken up what we call Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CatDDO). These are part of the two World Bank’s financing loan operations. In simple terms, what that means is that in the event of a disaster and a Declaration of State of Natural Disaster by Cabinet, Government will have access to about US40 million in immediate financing. Apart from this, Government has also bought its first signed-off, of what we call, parametric insurance from Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC) and, again, the sum insured, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was around $27 million at a premium cost of about $2.5 million. So, this premium of $2.5 million will get us $27 million, if there is a natural disaster because the insurance will kick in. So, we are also looking at future development partners, to ensure that, that is also increased. We are also setting aside a contingency budget for disaster which is directed to the Disaster Trust Fund with the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO). Apart from that, there are discussions with ADB on other infrastructure related to disasters, like bridges, and the Nadi River Project is the largest Climate Adaptation Project to reduce flood in that area. As I have said in Parliament the other day, we have received the Technical Report and we are on target to actually progress the project by next year, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><h4>I have another two minutes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the Bill itself, the financial arrangement</h4><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>2200 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 aspect of the Fund is clearly provisioned in Part 4 of the Bill, which is also a very good innovation. So, Clause 52, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allows the Permanent Secretary to, and I quote: “…ensure that an allocation is provided within the Ministry’s annual budgetary estimates to finance disaster risk management, including – (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) disaster risk reduction, preparedness, prevention and disaster mitigation; emergency response; rehabilitation long-term recovery; related activities; running costs of NDRMO; and running costs of disaster risk management councils, committees and technical working groups established under this Act.” So, those provisions in the Bill will also allow us to ensure that the finance is available, and the management of finance is provided very clearly in the Act. The last one that I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker Sir, is that in the establishment of the fund under the Act, the annual report on the activities and expenditure of the fund, including financial statements, will be reported to Cabinet and to Parliament thereafter. So, the Bill from the financial point of view, Sir, is quiet an innovation. It will ensure better transparency and accountability during times of disaster, and what we are also ensuring is that the funding is available so that we are not scrambling for funding when we are hit by a major disaster. So, apart from the budgetary allocation, we are also having this provision as a standby loan. Honourable Usamate, Mr. Speaker, is not here, otherwise, I would have told him that we are also dealing with disasters from 2006 to 2022 on a number of fronts as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Bill before us, and I thank the honourable Minister, especially his officers, and the NDMO Office in terms of the formulation of this Bill, the wide consultations done and the input in terms of the formulation of the Bill. Sir, I would like to mention that within the Bill, the term ‘coordination’, as in the “coordination of multiple hazard approach and multiple hazard early warning and early action systems at the national, sub-national levels, et cetera”, is mentioned 36 times, approximately 36 times. Of course, in the Schedules, you will note that the Director Meteorological Services is a member in nearly all the Committees and that phrase is mentioned at the various levels in terms of the administration of the Act from the National Management Council, Disaster Risk Reduction Committee, Emergency Committee, National Controller and Coordinator, right up to the Sub- National Administration and Functions of the Divisional Disaster Risk Management Office. So, it emphasises the role of coordination function, as I have already mentioned, of multi-hazard approach and multi-hazard early warning early action, which is the role of the Fiji Meteorological Services. If you recall, we had formulated and passed the Meteorological and Hydrological Act 2024 in this Parliament, which provided a legal framework which enhances the role of Meteorological Services and which is also a key critical part in terms of National Disaster Risk Management, which is why it is a key role in the Act. Some of the functions in terms of the Fiji Meteorological Services is to establish, maintain, upgrade and overlook the renewable networks for meteorological and hydrological observation and collection of meteorological and hydrological data. Again, which is critical in terms of the functioning of this Committee.</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 2201 Of course, forecasting weather oceans conditions and the state of the atmosphere and routine issue of public weather forecasts. Issue impact-based forecasts that contributes to Fiji's multi-hazard early warning systems and contribute to the safety, regulatory and efficiency of air navigation between the Nadi Flight Information Region and selected airdromes in the Southwest Pacific Region, as Fiji is the regional specialised meteorological centre. In terms of the functions of the Meteorological Services in collaboration with the National Disaster Management infrastructure and offices, some of the areas where there has been close collaboration include the recently installed community-based flood early warning systems and flood gauges in the Central Division through the current funding of the Government of Korea and New Zealand. Also, contribution to the development of Fiji's Early Warning for All (EW4ALL) Concept Note to the Green Climate Fund, strengthening of our collective response to disaster by enabling Fiji Meteorological Service staff in attending District, Divisional and Tikina Council Meetings to create awareness on weather hazards and the importance of disaster preparedness for early action. Through the Fiji Meteorological Services, the Ministry is currently working with the Government of Japan on the construction of a state-of-the-art Meteorological and Disaster Awareness Regional Centre for the Pacific, which also houses the Regional Training Centre and Regional Instrument Centre. As we are about to enter into another tropical cyclone season, the Fiji Meteorological Service is currently retraining and upskilling operational officers to improve its operational performance with regards to the severe weather which will be coming our way. Upskilling of staff involves seconding guest lecturers and training from various Meteorological Centres of the World to work with the Meteorological and Hydrological and immediate support personnel. I would state at this point that we have an issue with high staff turnover, so it is quite a challenge at this moment, and it is something that we will need to continually address as we move forward. Unfortunately, most are moving to regional organisations. There might be a need to relook at that, maybe to have a MOU with regional organisations so that they are given leave, but they can still come back to our national organisation. Sir, the Bill before us will enable the Meteorological Office to work closely with the National Disaster Management Office, in addressing the needs which will evolve in changing weather conditions, which supports the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change by providing a legal framework to protect our communities. Sir, I support the motion on the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024. Vinaka! MR. SPEAKER.- Vina’a valevu! I now call upon the Minister to speak in reply. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have much to say but I just want to, first of all, thank everyone involved in the parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, the honourable Members of the Committee, and all the hard work that you have done, staff of the Office of the Solicitor-General and all members of this august House who have participated in the consultations, as well as members of the public. We thank our team at the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, and I specifically mention the outgoing Director for Disaster Management, Ms. Vasiti Soko, who, at the moment, we are preparing to farewell her once we return to our office. At the moment, they are all watching on TV with bated breath to see how things pens out. But we thank everyone involved, all our international partners, and we thank you for all the commitment that has been shown. Vinaka saka vakalevu.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>2202</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put.
