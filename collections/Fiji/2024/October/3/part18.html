<body><h3>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</h3><h4>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20th May, 2024, I move: That the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 (Bill No. 1/2024) be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Minister's, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public joining in through virtual platform. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to speak on the Anti-Doping Bill 2024, a significant legislative step aimed at safeguarding the integrity of sports in our nation. This Bill, first introduced in May 2024, represents our continued commitment to ensuring clean competition, fairness and the wellbeing of our athletes. Mr. Speaker, the world of sports is ever evolving, and so are the methods used by those who seek to gain an unfair advantage through doping. It is our duty to ensure that our athletes compete on a level playing field, free from the influence of performance-enhancing drugs. The National Anti- Doping Bill seeks to address this issue by aligning our laws with international standards, particularly those set forth by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are aware, this Bill was initially given until August 2024 by WADA to be finalised with clear indication that penalties for non-compliance would follow. However, due to the positive developments that have taken place over the past few months during the review process, we have been granted some grace period to ensure that this Bill is passed. This extension reflects the progress we have made, but also underscores the critical importance of passing this Bill at the soonest to establish Fiji’s compliance at the international doping standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill has gone through a rigorous review process, and we have ensured that it is both comprehensive and practical for our national context. It includes provisions for the establishment of a National Anti-Doping Agency, robust testing protocols, education programmes and strict penalties for violations. It is focused not only on detection and enforcement, but also on prevention and education to foster a culture of clean sport. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I speak on the Bill today, I am confident that it addresses the necessary legal, procedural and operational aspects required for an effective and antidoping framework. The Anti-Doping Bill, which we are proposing is a pivotal step towards strengthening our nation’s anti- doping efforts. This Bill seeks to consolidate and enhance our existing legislative framework to effectively combat doping practices in sports. By aligning with international standards set forth by organisations like WADA, we demonstrate our commitment to being at the forefront of the global fight against doping. This is an unprecedented development not only for Fiji, but for the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, without a central and specialised organisation to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies in Fiji, the sports sector will remain vulnerable to the use of performance enhancing drugs. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee, line</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>2182 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 Ministries, stakeholders, and international partners like WADA and staff of my Ministry who have contributed to the development of this Bill. Their invaluable input and effort has helped shape a piece of legislation that is both progressive and in the best interest of our athletes and the sporting community. As the Minister for Youth and Sports, I am deeply proud of the progress we have made, and I can only praise God for the work carried out over the past months, demonstrating our unwavering commitment to protecting the integrity of Fijian sports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look ahead to the future of sports in Fiji, it is vital that we create an environment where integrity and fair play are at the forefront. This Bill is not just about enforcement, it is about protecting the spirit of sports, promoting the health of athletes, and ensuring that Fiji continues to participate in the global sporting arena with the highest ethical standards. To that end, your support for this Bill is crucial. It not only reflects our commitment to the values of fair play, but also ensures that Fiji remains in good standing with WADA and the global sporting community. Failure to pass this Bill could lead to penalties, which would damage our reputation and the opportunities available to our athletes on the international stage. Mr. Speaker and honourable Members of Parliament, I urge all of you to support this Bill once again, as it represents a critical step in maintaining the dignity and reputation of our athletes and sporting institutions. Let us pull together to pass this legislation and build a future where sports in Fiji continue to thrive in the spirit of fairness and excellence. MR. SPEAKER. – Honourable Members, the vote is now in motion, and I have been given a list of speakers by the honourable Whips, as follows: (1) Honourable P. K. Bala; (2) Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; (3) Honourable F. S. Koya; (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small, Micro and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (5) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (6) Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services; and (7) Honourable V. Naupoto. Honourable Members, the debate will be limited to one hour only, even though there are more than eight speakers here and the Secretary-General will pass the timing note. Speaking times will be limited to five minutes each. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the initiative behind and fully understand the need and reasons for the Anti-Doping Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill in its current form is undeveloped and raw and seems like it has been drafted in some hurry. I do not know why, but the Bill and the proposed body to look after it, does not seem to have a clear pathway to the try line. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addressing the Anti-Doping Bill 2024, it is crucial to highlight the lack of attention given to the wider issues affecting player welfare and sports integrity in Fiji. The Government’s single focus on doping neglects the broader needs of our athletes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the sports systems leaving a significant gap in sports governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Sports Integrity Commission is essential to ensure fairness, transparency and the well-being of athletes across all sports, that is, rugby, soccer, netball, athletics and more.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 2183 Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the player welfare, our athletes are more than just competitors. They are human beings who deserve protection and support. On integrity, corruption, match-fixing and doping are merely symptoms of a broader crises on sports governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current Bill’s focus is too narrow as it only deals with doping while ignoring the other elements of the sports corruption. On the protection of women and girls, one of the most neglected aspects in the current framework is the safeguarding of women and girls in sports. Fiji’s sports eco-system must include measures to prevent harassment and abuse, ensuring that the women can safely report incidents of misconduct through anonymous channels. The absence of any such protection in this Bill is unacceptable. We must empower women and girls to participate in sports with dignity. MR. SPEAKER.- Are we still on anti-doping?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- You have moved onto women and everything:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> No, no, it is related to that.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> No, no!</p><h4>HON. P.K. BALA.- I have got five minutes let me finish, please.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Please, confine your speech to anti-doping. HON. P. K. BALA.- On gender and imbalance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just about</p><h4>safeguarding, it is also about representation. Women are under-represented in coaching in….</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Bala, I will not allow you to continue with that diatribe because you need to confine yourself to the issue here, it is anti-doping. HON. P. K. BALA.- Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is at a pivotal moment in sports governance. We cannot afford to miss the opportunity to create a transparent, accountable and athlete-friendly framework. The Bill, as it stands, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is too narrow, as I have said earlier on, too incomplete and too indifferent to the real needs of our athletes. It is not just … HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- This is Anti-Doping Bill? HON. P. K. BALA.- I am talking about the Bill. What else do you want? You better have a look at the Bill then you will know. It is not just about catching our athletes. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me finish by saying that the Bill must be revised, expanded and refocussed to address the real challenges facing Fijian sports today. The creation of the Sport Integrity Commission is the solution that will not only protect at least but also restore the trust in our sports institution. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker and honourable Members of Parliament, my contribution to the Bill today would be confined to two matters. I am sure that all the others would have a toothpick on the Bill itself. I want to speak on what the Anti-Doping Bill would do apart from it becoming an addition to the laws of our country.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>2184 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 The Anti-Doping Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is part of Fiji’s global commitment to fairplay, good sportsmanship and the promotion of health and equality for all of our athletes. We live in a very era and age today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an example I am sure that most of our older Members of Parliament would have played rugby in an era where they were graded in either the bantam, midgets and senior grades, so that is by weight. And most when they entered into the secondary school would remain a midget or bantam right up until they left high school. They do not grow in size ia sa sui dromo tikoga na tamata. They find that is not really a fair way in which sports is going to be administered. Then the age grouping was seen as a more fairer away of administering sports in our schools. In athletics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example, age groups were even adjusted to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to compete, and everyone also has an opportunity to win the prize at the end of the competition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, beyond the age grouping step, we traditionally know in our schools, and I am contextualising this Bill in the way we understand sports development here in our country. It is all open competition, and this is where the Anti-Doping Bill, I suppose, fits into the picture. This is where athletes in an open environment may consider taking advanced enhancing drugs so that it gives them an advantage over and above their peers in the competition. Who would forget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the famous race, the 100 metres in Seoul in 1988 where the champion Carl Lewis was beaten on the tracks by the Canadian, Ben Johnson. We all know the story, Sir. Ben Johnson lost his medal, stripped off his medal and was also banned for some time. In fact, Mr. Speaker, it was said in that race alone in Seoul that six out of the eight finalists all tested positive for banned substance. It was highlighted, it was said to be the most dirtiest race in the history of the Olympics. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the reason why these laws are important in today's context, and I do not understand why honourable Bala was going on about that this was not a complete law, it needs some more time to be to be rehashed. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we probably need some anti-doping laws amongst ourselves here in this House.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> I was the one who started that, I know everything.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- The Anti:</span> Doping Bill, if we do not pass it in the House today, (I thought this was going to be a bi-partisan Bill for both sides of the House) we are going to lose a lot as a country in an era and in a region where there is increasing competition for venues where these competitions were going to be held, Fiji stands to lose quite a lot if we do not pass this Bill. We are making a bid for the SPG. We are making a bid for other international meets and without operationalising these laws and ensuring that these regulations are in place to provide for the operationalising of these laws, we will lose these competitions. If we lose these competitions, we are going to lose our recognition, we are also going to lose our standing as a central place in the Pacific where we can get all of these competitions into. I support the Bill. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a Bill that both sides of the House realised that it needs to be done, especially because we have sporting bodies that take part in international activities, talking about rugby, athletics, football and weightlifting, et cetera. The importance of it is recognised, but what must happen (and I will point something out shortly) is we cannot do this if there are something deficient in the current Bill in its form. I raised this whilst I was sitting on the Committee, it is something that obviously needs to be looked at or maybe even thought about or quickly re-drafted and I specifically talk about.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 2185 First of all, let me just say, Sir, this entire thing depends on three things. There is a code, convention and WADA. These are the things that we have made commitments to, and it is important that we get this Bill done so that we are compliant in terms of all our activities locally, and also in order to protect our local sportsmen and women, because using sports enhancing drugs has become big business. I just hope one day that they do not decide to list warusi on it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important parts of the Bill is with respect to the functions of the Drug Free Sport Fiji which is the institution that has been established in this particular Bill that will take of our drug testing activities, et cetera. The worrying part for me and I still have some reservations on it is section 5(f), and I quote: “The functions of DFSF are to coordinate with the Fiji Police Force, Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS), local sports entities and other anti-doping organisations to investigate complaints on doping sports in Fiji.” The Police Force has very wide powers. If you fall foul of doping, it is not a criminal offence. And revenue and customs, so how far do they go in terms of their investigative work? Do we need to curtail it, or do we seriously need to have the Police Force and FRCS on board with respect to investigative work that is going to be done, if you have taken drugs to enhance your sporting needs. As I have said, it is not a criminal activity, it is not something that you will be criminally charged with. You will be banned for life or whatever but there are things in there that are very positive, and I think by looking at this particular provision, and if the Office of the Attorney-General wants to quickly see whether it can be amended, or do we really need to engage the police because they have very vast powers within their laws. You cannot have someone who has tested positive for a particular drug and the police comes traipsing through his house on a search warrant, et cetera. The powers are different, this is not an offence that has been created under the criminal law act. It is actually something that is dealt with by DFSF within the powers that is given to him. Otherwise, as I have said earlier, DFSF is actually to permitted out to carry out anti-doping testing of athletes. It is something also that we need to seriously look at into how it will operate with respect to our Coca-Cola Games, et cetera that has happened, whether that has been used at that particular level too, and this will facilitate all of that. It is a good thing, Sir, it is a great thing to keep us compliant with respect to everything we do in our sports in Fiji and worldwide, and it keeps us, and I know for a fact, I heard the honourable Minister for Sports has spoken about this too, Sir, that if we do not do this, we may get told that we cannot partake in a particular activity offshore. So, it is important that we get it done, I know the Committee has done some tremendous work on it. The only reservation is the one that I have actually pointed out, Mr. Speaker. I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to contribute. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the Anti-Doping Bill which in some respect is a historic Bill in terms of sports in Fiji. I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister for Youth for initiating this Bill very quickly and bringing it to Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Former Minister had initiated it:</span></p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>2186 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Just that I would respond very quickly to the previous speakers from the other side, Sir, and there was a suggestion that it was a bad Bill. Sir, WADA actually assisted in the drafting of the Bill. They are the foremost experts, Sir, when it comes to anti- doping so any suggestion that it is a bad bill is questionable. The second one was, I did have a conversation with the honourable Koya regarding the concern about the police and I had a think and I was reading the clause again. It talks about this coordination with the Fiji Police, FRCS, sporting entities and other anti-doping organisations. So it is fairly, what is the word for it, not a a must report to police immediately kind of thing. It is at the discretion of the anti-doping authority, should they wish to consult the police. There can be possibly criminal action involved, like for example, someone is deliberately manufacturing anti-doping illegal substances and providing it knowingly and making money or something, so there may be some criminal element and may require the police, but I saw it as more distant option there available to the anti-doping agency, Sir. With regard to the Bill itself, firstly I think Fiji has become a victim of its own success. Successive golds in the Olympics followed by the silver this year has created a bit more focus on Fiji. And of course, the need to actually do something to ensure that as we compete and as we continue to dominate the Seven’s that we appear to be doing the right thing in terms of ethical behaviour when it comes to sports. However, I thought I just attack this from more an economic angle. You will recall, Sir, that when I talk about my priorities in terms of trade, the last one is about raising the standard of Fiji because if we are concerted in our effort to raising standards in our country, we will start being perceived at a different level. It is not just a little backwater in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it is a serious player when it comes to things like sports. And if we listen to people like Ben Ryan when he was leaving, Fiji, he said that the Fijians, some of them are super athletes in terms of what they can do. So, there is an opportunity with this Bill, Sir, to really validate some of the perceptions that we have about our athletes, we can actually then benefit more in terms of tourism. Right now, we are doing a billion plus in remittances. With these type of validations that have international connotations, it really elevates sporting, people look at sports through the athletes’ eyes, look at the athletes from an international perspective and this will no doubt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have a ripple effect into the economy as well. Finally, Sir, the Bill is a good one. It covers, in my view, all that is required in terms of a body that needs to safeguard standards in the country regarding drug free sports. The fact that it is aligned very closely to WADA, simply means that we will be complying with the highest authority when it comes to anti-doping globally and we will ensure that sports is a profession for our young men and women, it continues to be protected, the temptation to delve into drugs will become more and more apparent as they compete more, they start earning millions, start earning $10 million a year, some of our athletes will end up in that vein. So, I think the Bill in its current form is a satisfactory, Sir. It addresses the concerns of WADA, which is most important, as alluded to by all speakers. Of course, it sets us on sail on an economic path in terms of sports tourism. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I want to say that this Bill is definitely needed, but not in the current form. There are too many flaws in the Bill, and I am going to highlight section by section which needs to be plugged before we pass this Bill. I will start off with Clause 6 where it says that s that DFSF will approve any purchase, sale or lease of property and borrowing of money above a prescribed value. I understand that this body comes under a Ministry, and it is funded by the Government. Why is the Minister’s consent not taken? Normally, any statutory body who wants to raise any money, the consent of the Minister is</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 2187 taken. So, I can see there is a problem there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 7, it says that the Minister will appoint the Chairperson and the Vice Chairperson. Normally, in any situation, it is the Minister who appoints the Chairperson and then the Board decides the Vice Chair. Another problem that I see is Clause 8, the language. Language says, “The Office of a member of the Board becomes vacant.” The language itself needs to be fixed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move on to Clause 11, and the honourable Prime Minister will agree with me and the rest of you will agree me, that when it comes to the remuneration of a CEO of a statutory body, it is decided by the Higher Salaries Commission and not the Board. Here, it says it will be decided by the Board. No, it needs to be stated by Higher Salaries Commission. Go and look at all other legislations. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It does not mention Higher Salaries Commission at all:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, another problem that this Bill has is to do with Clause 17, where it says, “annual reports”. Submit the annual audited financial accounts to the Minister. My question is, when? Every other legislation like the Audit Bill, which we have just gone through, clearly state that within nine months, you must submit your Annual Reports and every other Bill. This Bill does not talk about it. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It has no meaning. What it says is what it says:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> No, no, no, it is not an interpretation.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, another problem in the law that I can see is it talks about audit - Audit Act 1969. It states Audit Act 1969, and we know that the Audit Act 1969 is going to be reviewed. Then it states, and I quote: “…DSFS is exempted from audit under the Act…” How can this organisation be exempted from audit? It says that the money is appropriated annually by Parliament, it is a statutory body, and any statutory body must be audited. You cannot say, ‘unless’. What is ‘unless’? (Laughter) It is known! It is stated! It is clear, that any statutory organisation must be audited, full stop! Mr. Speaker, Sir, another flaw in the legislation or the Bill I see is, the Minister may, following consultation with DFFS, make regulation. It should be the other way around. The other way around is that DFFS, with the approval of the Minister, will make the regulation. That means, they will consult the Minister, the Minister will take it to Cabinet, but it is about operationalising the Act. That is what it is all about. But the biggest challenge that I find, is the way the structure is created. You have a Board; the Board can co-opt members and the Board can appoint the Advisory Committee. The advisory committee is basically doing the work of the CEO - carrying out research, and all that work. What</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2188 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 will the CEO do? The CEO is clearly stated here that he or she can decide not to attend the Board meeting, can nominate his or her nominee. Normally, it does not work like that. A Board must have a CEO, and the CEO attends the meeting. Otherwise, if there is a dispute between the two, the CEO will always send a nominee. That is not how a system works, and that is my comment, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Kumar. I now offer the floor to honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on the Bill. As a former member of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament, our Committee members, two are still here - honourable Tuicolo and honourable Pillay, when we received submission from the Fiji Sports Council and the various sporting bodies that do report to this Standing Committee, one of the topics that usually comes up is the anti-doping issue, and the need for the Bill was very much needed back then, the last four years. In our recommendation, we always support the calling for the Bill to be established. So, I am very grateful that today, I have a chance to speak on this, as a former member of the Standing Committee and we are finally here to say that the Bill is before us, for the adoption of the Bill and I fully agree with the motion. I thank the honourable Minister for bringing it to Parliament and the Standing Committee members for their work on the Bill. As it is, Mr. Speaker Sir, there are a few key components of the Bill, and I will just touch on a few. First and foremost, the Bill prioritises rigorous testing protocols. Through random testing and the use of advanced technology, we will ensure that our athletes are held accountable for their actions. Secondly, the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 places strong emphasis on education and awareness. Sir, this Bill will not work without a strong emphasis on education and awareness, and I believe that it is incorporated into the Bill. For the Ministry of Education, through the Ministry of Health, we can ensure that this Bill goes to the wider scope of our community. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Anti-doping Bill 2024 also underscores the significance of mental health support for athletes. The pressure to perform at elite level can lead some athletes down to the path of substance abuse and we are very grateful that the legislation proposes the establishment of mental health resources that athletes can access confidentially. By addressing the underlying issue contributing to doping, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we pave the way for a healthier and more supportive athletic environment. As it is, I support the Bill and, again, I thank the Standing Committee, and I thank the honourable Minister for bringing the Bill on board. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is a step in the right direction, in fact, I will say it is a leap in the right direction for sports in Fiji. The Bill is the precursor to establish our own Anti-Doping Agency, DFSF it will be called. All sporting nations have their own Anti-Doping agencies, and it is good for Fiji that sends high end athletes, that go right up to the Olympics, and just imagine for a while when our athletes go to the Olympics, they get a gold medal for example, our flag is raised, our anthem is sung and then later</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 2189 on, they get disqualified. Their medal is taken away from them because they failed their doping tests. This agency that will be established, will protect our athletes to make sure that when they go up there to represent Fiji at the highest level, that they are clean, and they play fairly. I support the Bill; this is good and the right step at this time in Fiji. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my comments on the Bill that is before Parliament, the Anti-Doping Bill 2024. The Bill in its current form is perfect and it has gone through the whole process of Standing Committee deliberation. The points raised now by the honourable Opposition Members should have been raised by the Standing Committee member which is from the G16-Bloc, and also the report for this particular Bill has been signed too by the honourable Usamate, we are members of the Standing Committee together. We went through the deliberations of the Bill and what the honourable Praveen Bala had mentioned when he was Minister for Sports, he had initiated, that particular Bill. That was draft one, after a few executive consultations, the Bill was developed to draft two. After consultation with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), it was developed to draft three, and it went back to the Ministry for draft four. After draft four, it was then taken to Cabinet, and was passed by Cabinet and the honourable Minister for Sports then tabled it to the Parliament back when the was Bill was first tabled through Standing Orders. That was draft number four. Draft number four is what the Standing Committee had worked with, calling public consultations through media and moving around all areas in Fiji. We also called upon the Members of Parliament to present their views. It was unfortunate that none of the Members that have shared their views now, did not appear before the Standing Committee or made use of that call, even not making a written submission. Even the online platform was available there. That is the process. So, when we sat after the consultation with the comments, we sent it back to the Ministry. We called the Ministry in a roundtable meeting with all sporting bodies around Fiji and they all supported the current form of the Bill then. Then after taking on board their comments, we sent it back to WADA for their comments when the Standing Committee was developing the form of the Bill after the consultation. Then WADA gave their comments and also it provide justification, after that then we send it back to the drafters at the Solicitor-General’s Office, who then made the final drafting of the Bill, which is before us, considering WADA’s requirements, international standards plus the views of the people throughout the consultation and other views that came in presented to the Standing Committee. That is the process that was followed and the drafting that was made, and I will agree with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications on Clause 5(f). When honourable Koya was in the Standing Committee he had raised it, we had taken that on board, and we had sent his comments to WADA. On the interpretation he has shared in the Parliament and WADA gave their interpretation and justification, they were satisfied, the interpretations is what you have alluded to. It is more towards trying to cut down on those that are manufacturing drugs and the sources of drugs that will be used by athletes. These are some of the interpretations that the Standing Committee took on board.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2190 National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 3 rd October, 2024 Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill that is before the Parliament, and it has gone through extensive consultations and deliberations with WADA. WADA wanted some of the clauses to be consistent with their standards and their codes, so we had to take that on board to be compliant with international standards. I have no further things to say, but for us to support the Bill. I also call upon the G16-Bloc to support the Bill, given a Member of their group is also in the Standing Committee that had already endorsed this particular Bill. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as already mentioned, today is very historical and the Bill itself is historical. On that note, I thank all those who have contributed to the formulation of the Bill. I thank the Chairman, all the honourable Members of the Standing Committee, Members of Parliament who have participated in the formulation of the Bill, and our sporting bodies in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a small island nation in the Pacific, Fiji has been promoted to Tier 2 level. Thus, the need that we have the Anti-Doping Bill in place. The Bill may not be perfect to our context, but it is a requirement when we want to compete at the international level. I have nothing further to add, but to thank everyone who have contributed. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast - 32 Ayes Noes - 2 Not Voted - 10 Motion agreed to. [Anti-Doping Bill 2024 (Bill No. 1 of 2024), passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. …… of 2024)]]</p></body>
