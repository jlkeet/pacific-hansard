SPEAKER.:</span> No, we have not heard you yet. I will give you the clearance, then you will elaborate. You are standing on a Point of Order - Standing Order 80. I am giving you the leeway to do that. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to apologies to this august House for any language that I have made or used in this Parliament which may have offended individual Members of this House. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- It really gets on to my nerves, honourable Members. He is seeking a personal explanation on something he has stated which is not clear because he mumbles his words most of the time when he gets angry. The only thing I heard, honourable Members, was another explanation given by honourable Bala and referring to what he said. And that made him wrong for him to say, I can also say this. That is the only part that I heard, but it is great that you have taken it upon yourself, honourable Minister, on the personal explanation to give your apology here. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, likewise under Standing Order 80, I would like to apologise if I have hurt any individual using unparliamentary words. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I would like to implore on you honourable Members of this august House, let us always keep the decorum. You may notice that school children are here not only to watch us, but also hear us and see you, honourable Members, participate heavily in debates. As such, I only seek your indulgence, please, continue to uphold the dignity of the House. That is all I ask. Vinaka vakalevu. Thank you very much, honourable Bala. Honourable Minister, you seem to take off on a very speedy pace when you are cool to when you blow up your position. Maybe, you have been counting your money a lot, that is why, anyway, thank you for that.</p></body>
