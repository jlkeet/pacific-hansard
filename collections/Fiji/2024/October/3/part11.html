<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Review Report - Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I hereby present the Committee’s Review Report on the Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report. The Committee has undertaken its scrutiny of the Ministry’s Annual Report for the period under review and noted the Ministry’s achievements. The reporting period was transformative and a challenging one for the Ministry. The existence of outdated or backdated reports reflects the challenges posed by staff turnover and the need for accurate record-keeping. The Committee noted the lack of direction for the Ministry in its engagement with the Divisions in terms of its programmes and projects. The Ministry of Waterways encountered several significant challenges that impacted its operations and programme deliveries. Addressing these challenges required sound executive directives, innovative solutions, robust planning and collaborative efforts. In addition to the above, the Committee noted that there was a lack of collaboration with other Government Ministries and other relevant partners. Working in isolation affected their programme delivery. Mr. Speaker, the Committee noted the Ministry’s inability to utilise the budgeted funds which considerably affected the work carried out during the year 2017-2018. The Committee noted a significant number of unfilled positions within the Ministry and identified inconsistencies in the reporting of staff numbers. I wish to extend my appreciation to the executives and staff of the Ministry of Waterways for their effort and dedication. At this juncture, I take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members who were involved in the production of this bipartisan Report, namely, honourable T. R. Matasawalevu (Deputy Chairperson), honourable I. Tuiwailevu, honourable K. V. Ravu and honourable S. Nand.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2125 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Report to Parliament.

Consolidated Review Report - Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 2019-2021 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. The Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) was established by the Fijian Government through the introduction of the Accident Compensation Act 2017, to pay no-fault compensation to Fijians who suffer personal injury or death as a result of an accident in Fiji as of 1 st January, 2018. From 1 st January, 2019, the ACCF has been providing compensation for injuries and deaths as a result of accidents arising in the course of employment as well as in school premises during working hours. The Act provides for a scheme through which victims of accidents can be compensated without having to prove fault or negligence, subject to meeting the Act’s requirements. Coverage of the no-fault scheme is broader than the previous law, as it extends beyond third parties. The Committee noted that ACCF collaborates well with key organisations, like the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Employment, Land Transport Authority, Fiji Police Force and Legal Aid Commission, to deliver their services effectively. Furthermore, the Committee noted that there are two sources of funding - the Motor Vehicle Accident Levy and 40 percent of the 1 percent Fiji National University (FNU) Levy. Both these levies are deposited in the Accident Compensation Fund Account and are used solely for the purpose of paying compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2017. The Board informed the Committee that the Act excludes the following: • • • • • • driving under the influence of liquor; failing or refusing to permit a breath test or a specimen of blood to be taken; not holding a valid driving license and failure to comply with all the conditions of the driving licence; any injury or death that did not directly arise from the accident; being convicted for any act or omission that directly caused accidents; and personal injury or death as a result of an accident arising out of/and in the course of</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>2126</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 employment where the injured or deceased person is not a worker.

Review Report:</span> Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs submits to Parliament the Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report. The Sugar Cane Growers Fund (SCGF) is a lending institution established under the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act 1984 (Act No. 9/1984), enacted by the Parliament of Fiji on 26 th July, 1984. Its core business is to provide loans to registered sugarcane growers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, SCGF also has a subsidiary company, namely South Pacific Fertilizers Limited which is primarily engaged in the sale and distribution of fertilizer and weedicides. The SCGF aims to build sustainable value for stakeholders and for the sugarcane farmers and other industry players. The principal activity of the Fund as outlined under section 4 of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act 1984 is to: • • • provide loans to sugarcane growers to increase the production of sugarcane; improve efficiency in the planting, growing and transportation of sugarcane; and rehabilitation of farms, farm buildings and other installations that were damaged, destroyed or affected by floods or other natural disasters.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024 Personal Explanation 2127 The Committee was made aware of the various challenges that SCGF has been facing which include the need to review the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act, the need to diversify sugar production to agriculture and non-agriculture, lack of subsidiary diversification, Government dependency and loan defaults. The Committee noted that the Annual Reports presented by the SCGF lacked essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Sir, SCGF did not have any set targets during the period under review which could have enabled the Committee to make more informed recommendations. The Committee noted some of the challenges faced by SCGF under the review period which are as follows: • • • Uncertainty of lease renewal, ageing farmers, rising prices of fertilizers, damage to farm infrastructure due to flooding and rural to urban drift. The Russia-Ukraine war has had a significant impact on the availability and prices of raw materials, particularly fertilizers. At the same time, TC Yasa and TC Ana caused devastating impacts to the farming community, especially in the Northern Division, causing massive structural damages to crops, dwellings and roads, Seaqaqa and Labasa districts being the worst impacted. Therefore, TC Yasa loan was developed to provide instant relief to affected cane farmers through priority and specialised loan assistance. At this juncture, I would wish to extend our appreciation to all the stakeholders for their valuable input. Finally, I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced this Report - the Deputy Chairperson, honourable S. Kiran; honourable P. D. Kumar, honourable T. N. Tunabuna, and honourable A. Bia. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Review Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby, move: A motion, without notice, that the debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
