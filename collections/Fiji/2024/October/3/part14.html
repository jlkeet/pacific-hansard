<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>MOU - NZYWAM and Ministry of Health (Question No. 215/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Youth with a Mission (YWAM) New Zealand and the Ministry? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member, for his question. In terms of the MOU between the Ministry of Health and Youth With A Mission (YWAM). The signing of the two parties was endorsed by Cabinet on 7 th of August and Friday 4 th of August consecutively. In terms of the MOU itself, the MOU allows for the partnership between YWAM and the Ministry of Health to assist the Ministry in terms of service delivery and in reaching universal health coverage to our hard-to-reach populations within Fiji, mostly in the rural and maritime areas. The MOU is a 10-year MOU in which the agreement allows for volunteers under the YWAM to come over to Fiji and work in this space of primary healthcare settings within our maritime and rural areas which is accessible by boat. They come in their ship and assist the Ministry in those areas as it is in terms of work that they are doing, not only in terms of primary healthcare but also in terms</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>2156</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 of awareness, screening, dental, which I am sure the honourable Member is well aware of. As I have said, this partnership is for 10 years and what we have noticed that even though they are cutting on yearly basis. This partnership moving forward, we will have to come up with ideas on how to streamline some of the processes that are involved in registration, in issues such as procurement and customs as well. So, we are grateful for the ongoing partnership. It started from the previous government until now, and the Ministry is ensuring that we will continue with this because they are assisting us in a very critical space, the primary healthcare especially in the maritime island areas.</p><h4>In a nutshell it is a 10-year MOU and I will be willing to answer any more questions based</h4><p>particular things. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, last month, the shippers in the Yasawa Group saw over 2,400 patients who needed dental, general health checkup, nutrition, health education and optometry, on the boat and they gave out reading glasses. Because it is a boat, it only serve the maritime island. Over the last three years they have seen over 11,000 Fijians in the maritime zone. The supplementary question to the honourable Minister, would he consider the waiver of the temporary registration licence that the doctors, nurses, dentists that are on this boat need to pay with the Fiji Medical and Dental Council, since they are providing free service benefitting our people? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank, honourable Ravunawa for his supplementary question. Yes, that is something we will consider, seeing that it is a 10 year agreement and an agreement of understanding. Also, most of the visiting teams are the same ones that are coming in and out on the same year. So, yes, we will take that into consideration and see how best we can assist them as they are assisting us. St. Giles Psychiatric Hospital Facelift and Upgrade (Question No. 228/2024) HON. A. N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the St. Giles Psychiatric Hospital facelift and upgrade?. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tuicolo for his question. In terms of the update to Parliament on St. Giles Psychiatric Hospital facelift and upgrade. Just by way of context, St. Giles hospital is one of the oldest hospitals in Fiji and has been in service since 1884. Again, it has lived through many climatic and operational challenges and the current infrastructure has undergone significant wear and tear over the years. With the increasing service demands, increasing number of patients of all ages are seen, treated, admitted and followed up at the hospital, it places a considerable demand on the infrastructure. Patients seen at that hospital range from acute, chronic psychiatric illness, substance abuse and forensic psychiatric cases. Any infrastructural works that have been done over the years was to cater for changing demand in patient demographics, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It has also been a tertiary care training hospital for many years through Fiji Medical School and now FNU. In the last two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while working with our development partners and</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2157 through budgetary allocation, our health partners and development partners have come on board to assist us with the Women's Ward and the Moala Ward and the admin building which was renovated and now occupied. Another significant work that was completed involved the tarsealing of the roads and carpark inside the hospital premises which cost over $235,000. The road had not been repaired for a number of years causing not only discomfort to passengers and damages to the vehicles, but also to staff who work and live within the vicinity of St. Giles Hospital. Earlier this year, the Ministry constructed a new fence behind the Men's Ward costing around $13,000 to improve the security of the admission facility as was highlighted in the media, and in this financial year, the ministry has also allocated funding to the minor works allocation for further repair and renovation works at the hospital. In addition, constant development and advancement of medicine worldwide, the ministry is approaching partner and donor organisation for the possibility of assisting towards the establishment of a new facility that will allow the hospital to venture into the latest treatment modalities, elevating mental health services in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a new facility will allow the hospital to branch out into the fields of addiction, psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry and to deliver speciality services such as group therapy, psychodrama, lithium level testing, recurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as it commonly known, and geropsychiatry. Again, government remains committed to addressing mental health in the country and improving the mental health services to our people. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, are we sufficiently equipped at St. Giles to take care of, at the moment whilst the upgrades are being done and post building later on building a new facility, are we sufficiently equipped at St. Giles to take care of the substance abuse patients? I am talking about those that came out of prison or currently in and who are incarcerated and those that doctors find that are suffering from mental trauma and are substance abuse patients. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when asked the same question to our technical people at St. Giles, the answer I got was yes, in terms of the capacity, yes, and they are currently doing it right now. But in terms of the treatment afterwards on substance abuse, and how you deal with it afterwards, that is where the gaps still lies and that is where the government through the partnerships that I had mentioned, that we are approaching other development partners to assist us in this area on substance abuse and its treatment in the long term. Again, it is something that the ministry with our development partners are looking into, but in terms of your question, the capacity right now as it is, yes, to look after it in the acute phase and treat them accordingly. And also, available in our other hospitals in CWM and for areas which other NGO’s assist us in this space, which receive grant through the Ministry of Health for some of their operational work they are also helping us in this area. In a nutshell, yes, we have the capacity to deal with it now, but it is the long-term aspect of the treatment that is where they still get.</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.– Vinaka. Let me know for the supplementary questions, we will move on</h4><p>to the third Oral Question for today. I now call on honourable Ketan Lal to ask his question. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.– Then that question lapses now, so we will move to the fourth Oral Question</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2158 for today.</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 Dental Prosthetic Services - Nakasi Health Centre (Question No. 248/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government upon notice:</span></p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the status of the Dental Prosthetic Services at Nakasi Health Centre? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honorable Ravunawa for his question. In terms of the Dental Prosthetic Unit that is currently under the CWM Hospital but is operational in Nakasi Health Centre, that was an arrangement made by the previous Administration, due to the fact that there was an issue with the space within the Dental Department here at CWM. It was just for a temporary measure until space can be identified and then move back into CWM Hospital. As it is, there are a few options that are available that the Ministry is looking into on how to bring back the prosthetic services back to CWM. Option one right now is the School of Dentistry and Oral Health, under FNU for the JB Savou Dental Clinic adjacent the CWM Dental waiting room is currently being used by clinical studies and to be used by the prosthetic team, that is one option. And the other option is for the occupation of the former FNBC office, as dental officers and dental staff interim with current office and staff, to be refurbished as a prosthetic clinic and prosthetic lab. As it is, the ministry is also looking into the decentralising this service into the subdivisional hospitals, Savusavu in particular, we have talked with the dental officers there, and they are very skilled in doing dental prosthetic services, but it is just the space that they need to be working into. It should be made conducive to the environment in which they work in. Nevertheless, as I have mentioned the move from CWM to Nakasi was a temporary measure, and they are still there, and the ministry is trying its best to relocate them back to CWM because it is Central. It is the only one available, I believe for the central and eastern division. And yes, in terms of plans for the future we will relocate them because it was a temporary measure in the initial stages. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 2 nd Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation (Question No. 249/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I:</span> VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the outcomes of the recent Second Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation and the Delhi Declaration? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vanawalu for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I led the Fiji delegation to the recent 2 nd Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation held in New Delhi, India on the 11 th and 12 th September, 2024. The Conference was hosted by the Government of India, as always, the arrangements were for the Fiji team was superb. I say always, as from experience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when a Fijian is hosted by the Indian Government, hospitality goes up, another notch, I have experienced this Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2159 I also wish to thank our High Commissioner to India, His Excellency Mr. Jagnnath Sami, and his dear wife, Kancha, for supporting the Fiji delegation and likewise, Counsellor Nilesh Kumar. The Conference was a pivotal event for the region, addressing the evolving challenges in civil aviation and setting a collective vision for the future through the adoption of the Delhi Declaration. The Conference was chaired by honourable Ram Mohan Naidu, Minister for Civil Aviation for India. I was privileged and honored to be elected as a Deputy Chairperson. This position not only highlights Fiji’s leadership and commitment to the civil aviation sector, but also ensures that we have a direct influence in shaping the region's aviation policies moving forward. The 1 st Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation took place in Beijing, China in 2018. The Conference resulted in the Beijing Declaration, it has laid the framework, groundwork for states to collaborate to achieve shared commitments and take the necessary actions to address these challenges confronting the aviation sector. Since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration, Fiji has made significant strides in advancing aviation safety and security oversight. Our effective implementation score stands above the global average, a testament to a commitment to maintain rigorous safety standards. Following the Inaugural Conference, 2018, the International Civil Aviation Organization co- hosted the 2 nd Asia-Pacific Conference with the Government of India, gathering over 200 delegates to discuss commitments and reflect on the aviation industry, while addressing sustainability. Those in attendance included 12 Ministers, eight Deputy Ministers and 24 Director Generals of civil aviation. The Prime Minister of India, the honourable Narendra Modi made the closing address, demonstrated great ideas and its critical component of India's economic development. While some commitments since 2018 have made satisfactory progress. The majority of safety and annual targets have failed to meet expectations. The shortfall is primarily due to the pandemic which has plunged the global civil aviation sector into a deep crisis. A significant outcome of the Conference resulted in 29 Asia Pacific nations committing to landmark shift towards sustainable aviation, enhance safety and technological innovation. Accelerating efforts to reduce the region's environmental impact was one of the key outcomes of the Conference. This is in line with the global framework that International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Member States agreed upon at the ICAO’s 3 rd Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) that I had chaired in Dubai last November. This aviation industry is committed to achieving a collective global aspiration vision to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5 percent by 2030. This, through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, low carbon aviation fuels and other aviation cleaner energies. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is undertaking a feasibility study into the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Fiji involving both Fiji Airways and Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC). Emphasis was put on the critical role of accelerating progress towards gender equality in the sector, and further efforts was needed to ensure gender equity in aviation across the region to meet the human resource demands of aviation sectors rapid expansion. A significant commitment by the Aviation Ministers of the Asia and Pacific region was the adoption of the Delhi Declaration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this declaration reaffirms support and continuous efforts towards realising the commitments of the prior Beijing Declaration. These commitments come at a crucial time for the aviation industry which is rebounding from COVID-19. The Declaration outlines several key commitments including:</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>2160</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd October, 2024 (1) Supporting the implementation of ICAO’s global plans for safety, air navigation and aviation security. (2) Accelerating the adoption of new technologies to enhance safety and efficiency. (3) Investing in infrastructure to support sustainable growth and emerging aviation consumptions. (4) Promoting gender equality across all levels of the aviation sector. (5) Reducing emissions and other environmental impacts of aviation. (6) Enhancing regional cooperation in air traffic management, search and rescue and aviation security. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker Sir, Fiji fully supports the Delhi Declaration and stands committed to implementing its principles of safety, security and innovation. This Declaration marks a significant step forward for civil aviation in the Asia Pacific region and Fiji is ready to collaborate with our regional partners to meet the aviation challenges of today and tomorrow. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.– I just have a small supplementary question. Honourable Minister, I congratulate you on your attendance at the Delhi Conference and in terms of the Delhi Declaration that has actually transpired, my question is relating to implementation. Whether it is Fiji or whether it is regional, how are we going to ensure that we actually implement those things that have come up within the Declaration, and my question, you may know, probably leads towards sustainable aviation, fuels et cetera that particular aspect of it. HON. V. R. GAVOKA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Beijing and Delhi Declaration came out of this huge growth in travel by air in the Asia Pacific region and our concern is that we need to make travel seamless. There are about 29 Flight Information Regions (FIR) within the Asia Pacific and these FIR need to be talking to each other and seamless when you pass through from one to the next. Our concern is that not everyone is on board in terms of safety, in terms of security, and other requirements by ICAO. We need to be singing from the same page, across the Asia Pacific region. As I had mentioned the other day, Fiji’s score in the last audit was sitting higher than the average regional and global score, so Fiji is doing well. The challenge is our Pacific neighbours, so we need to help them grow their aviation industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what came out of this, is that Governments needs to commit. We know that travel by air is critical, but you cannot have a State not doing its part because we are all connected in travel. If you could just allow me, Sir, there was North Korea in the meeting and you know when North and South Korea are in a meeting one stands up and one speaks. These people normally, if you test your missiles into the atmosphere, you will notify the commercial, you know, airlines and all that, that I will be testing my missiles over these. But the North Koreans have been known to be firing the missiles into parts that are taken by airlines. That is the kind of stuff we want to discipline. It is called Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). Interestingly over the last two days, Iran was firing into Israel. They did not notify the commercial aviation people that they were firing missiles over the area. So, that is the kind of discipline that we need in aviation, because we are all too good in this. The underlying principle is that it must be seamless, it must be safe, and it must all subscribe to the sense of safety when you are flying. Mr. Speaker, Sir, anyway, in terms of the government you need to commit, and I am happy that every time I present my budget to the honourable Minister for Finance in aviation, he does not compromise. Thank you.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>3 rd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2161 HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to hear that the Minister for Finance consistently assists you, but will he be assisted by ICAO also with respect to the original issue that you are talking about? We know the value of everyone working off the same page. By the way, I have flown to South Korea whilst the ICBM has been flown across by North Korea. I know, it is a very scary thing. Will we be getting assistance from ICAO in terms of the regional issue so that everyone can sing off the same page, because aviation security, as you rightfully pointed out, it needs to be everyone singing from the same tune sheet. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we opened the Pacific Liaison Office (PLO) in Nadi two months or three months ago. This is the Pacific Liaison Office for ICAO. Fiji is hosting this. The salary is paid for by Singapore, but we provide the premises in Nadi for the PLO. That is our contribution to the region, and this office is going to provide training and support for our island SIDS. So, ICAO is helping in that area. MR. SPEAKER.- Just before we continue with the questions, bit of housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders, with respect to the sitting time, now I call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament, to move his suspension motion.</p></body>
