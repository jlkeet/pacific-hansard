<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to give</p><h4>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:</h4><p>(1) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Climate Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; and (3) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. The Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes. After the Minister, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to speak for five minutes. There will be no other debate. Development of the Foreign Policy White Paper (FPWP)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.:</span> Ni sa bula vina’a and a very good morning to you all.</p><p>Mr, Speaker, Sir, may I also greet those who are watching us on livestream and those listening in on the radio. I, together with you, Sir, also acknowledge the presence in the gallery of the Honourable Leone Bignall, Member of Parliament and Speaker of the House of Assembly and Member for Mawson in the Parliament of South Australia; the Deputy High Commissioner of the Australian High Commission, Ms. Clair McNamara; and Ms. Rebecca Brown, First Secretary in the Australian High Commission. I also apologise to honourable Tunabuna for cutting in on his question on this subject. I believe, Sir, that the Ministerial Statement would answer his question better, so I have asked that this Ministerial Statement be made instead of his question.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1996</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 One of the important steps that the Coalition Government took since coming into office is to put in place important rebuilding blocks that provide clarity, direction and certainty for Fiji and its people. Foreign policy is one of them. Earlier in the year, I mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to produce Fiji’s Foreign Policy White Paper, to develop a document that will articulate Fiji’s Foreign Policy priorities and guide its international engagements in the next decade. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the formulation, a whole-of-Government process was activated and the views of the Ministries and agencies and entities outside of the public sector were also incorporated. A reference group was also engaged, comprising renowned persons who are current and former diplomats, former Permanent Secretaries, former Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministers and diplomats, leaders and scholars in foreign relations with longstanding experience at national, regional and international levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Steering Committee, also led by the Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs, was established with the support of a technical advisor who was engaged to provide expert support. The expert, Professor Peter Varghese, is the Chancellor of the Queensland University, a former diplomat and a former Secretary of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and External Trade. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated six months for this project. I am pleased to inform the House that the project was completed on time that culminated on Monday, 23 rd September, 2024, when I launched Fiji’s Foreign Policy White Paper at the Grand Pacific Hotel, with invitations extended to all Members of this august House. This is a first for Fiji and the launch was a landmark occasion in Fiji’s history, and I thank all honourable Members who came to that launch. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I elaborate on the White Paper, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the honourable Assistant Minister for Finance, the honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc, on their return after representing Fiji to the 79 th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). I know that having returned from their respective engagements at the high level forums of UNGA, they would be pleased with Fiji’s first ever Foreign Policy White Paper. Very soon, Fiji’s Permanent Representative to the UN (PRUN) will be visiting the country and will be available for briefing for all Members of Parliament who are interested in the functioning of the various organisations under the United Nations for our general education and information. As I had mentioned during the launch, the White Paper outlines the path that Fiji will follow to meet the complex foreign policy landscape and its challenges that we face as a nation. It is a definitive statement of the Government’s foreign policy and Fiji’s place in the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the White Paper explains how Fiji sees itself and how we wish to present ourselves to the world. It also outlines Government’s foreign policy initiatives, including the promotion of the Pacific as an Ocean of Peace, which is the single most significant contribution that Fiji has made to peace and security in our neighbourhood and the broader Indo-Pacific region. The policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also reaffirms the central position of the Pacific region in our foreign policy calculations and that in all we do, we will put the Pacific family first. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the foundation of this White Paper is a whole-of-nation approach that integrates all elements of policy, domestic and external, and recognises that our security and</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1997 prosperity ultimately depend on a clear-eyed view of our national interests and values and how best to advance them. The White Paper is also reflected on Chapter 3 of Fiji’s National Development Plan and is the proposed response to the current National Security and Defence Review. Together, these forms the foundation of the Government’s strategy to advance Fiji’s strategic and economic interests and strengthen its social cohesion. What follows builds on the three interconnecting themes of Fiji’s foreign policy - sovereignty, security and prosperity. These are the traditional pillars of foreign policy, but the context in which we must pursue them has profoundly changed. The White Paper states Fiji’s identity and values. It states where we stand on issues. While some areas may not be popular to some, I had remarked in an earlier speech in this House that the Government stands for what is right for Fiji, not necessarily what is popular. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the White Paper is made up of three complementary elements, namely, analysis, policy positioning and the machinery of delivery. The White Paper comprises eight chapters. I will expound each of the chapters briefly. I ask that we peruse the document, to enable us to understand its contents and draw informed conclusions through the following lenses - the White Paper: • • • • • is different from all others; is a headline document; comprises of high level statements; is not a checklist of all we are doing in our foreign policy; and is not a catalogue of all our bilateral and multilateral relationships and activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the White Paper: • • • • • sets out the underlying principles of Fiji’s foreign policy, our overarching objectives and our broad priorities. captures the way in which domestic and foreign policies are intertwined. allows flexibility to work on issues without being constrained by specificity. allows for context and nuance to be made for circumstances that Fiji might find itself in. is further unpacked into the 2024-2027 Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that guide its operationalisation through its operational and business plans. The White Paper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also the basis for Ministries to connect and coordinate across the Government system and in areas touching external interactions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Chapter 1 of the White Paper examines sovereignty, with a focus on identity and values. It defines who we are and what we believe in. It presents Fiji the world and emphasises the characteristics that define our society, that define our values. This is central to how we engage with the world. to Further, the Chapter delineates our interests, our international relationships, the ideas we bring to building a stronger region and the bilateral and multilateral investments to be undertaken to protect the Fijian society. Chapter 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, focuses on security with the preamble on Fiji’s physical security and border protection, economic security, environmental sustainability and the capacity to address non-traditional threats and challenges to social cohesion. It highlights Fiji’s leadership and</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1998</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 stewardship roles in the Pacific - the leverage we have as a regional hub, the influence on regionalism, broader multilateral cooperation and the Ocean of Peace. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Chapter 3 examines transnational security issues and poses strategic remedies to the transnational challenges which have the potential to erode social stability, wreak havoc on livelihoods, threaten the health of our community and sustainability of our environment. Chapter 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, addresses Fiji’s vulnerability to climate change. The Chapter proposes the need for national policy setting and unremitting advocacy for action at regional and global level. This is in addition to the grounds set on the importance of comprehensive climate governance, the green economy, SDGs, the National Oceans Policy and investments in sustainability. Mr. Speaker, Chapter 5 examines Fiji’s approach to bilateral relations, bearing in mind that there are no neat distinctions between bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, and that the success in one helps build success in the other. It singles out that the texture and priorities of our relationships are inevitably shaped by Fiji’s geography, history and values. The ‘family first’ approach for the region and the links with key strategic and traditional partners beyond the region are important to foster familial bonds and shared prosperity. Chapter 6 on prosperity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, stresses the importance of centrally advancing Fiji’s economic interests for all Fijians. It highlights the importance and quality of our domestic economic policy settings, the enterprise of Fijian businesses, the hard work of Fijian labour and our ability to effectively navigate the regional and global economies and their underpinning institutions. It states what the backbone of Fiji’s economy is, and the need to empower enterprises is fundamental for fostering inclusive growth and reducing income inequality. The Chapter further expounds the importance of an open economy, trade and investment liberalization, the growth of the Fijian diaspora around the world and their economic importance to our country. The Foreign Policy and Developmental Assistance in Chapter 7, Mr. Speaker, Sir, highlights the important support of our international partners and the need to manage these relations across Government. It places importance on the work of diplomatic missions, honorary consuls and trade commissions, to promote Fiji’s economic interests and attract foreign investment. There is emphasis on the need for robust systems for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating development support and outcomes. Chapter 8, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sets out the Government’s approach to implementing Fiji’s foreign policy and the systems and resources required to drive the whole of Government machinery. The Chapter also looks at policy stewardship, coordination and management, and the governance structure to churn out professional cohorts with appropriate skillsets. In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I conclude with thanks to all the officials and expertise under the leadership of the Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs, in the formulation of this document. I acknowledge the wise counsel of the Reference Group, which helped guide its preparation. I sincerely thank the White Paper’s principal author, Mr. Peter Varghese, Officer of the Australian Order (AO). I acknowledge the honourable Ministers and their Permanent Secretaries, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, former Ministers, Senior Officials and Fijian diplomats, Academia, industry representatives, regional organisations and members of our community, who came forward and shared their knowledge and skills during the formulation of our policy paper.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1999 Once again, I acknowledge with appreciation the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and its High Commissioner in particular, His Excellency Ewen McDonald, for the technical and financial support provided through our renewed and elevated Vuvale Partnership. Vina’a va’alevu and God Bless Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn the House now for tea break and resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 11.00 a.m.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2000</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.50 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make their response. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I stand to provide a response to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister on Fiji’s Foreign Policy White Paper. Honourable Prime Minister, thank you for the invitation to support His Excellency and our Permanent Representative in the United Nations (PRUN) in the most recent United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). As you are well aware, UNGA is hectic, but we have to shoulder the responsibility, its national duties and a lot of learnings as well. It is interesting to see how the world is developing and trying to cope and adapt to the challenges. I know that there will be more opportunities later to discuss on this. On Fiji’s Foreign Policy White Paper, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, congratulations to Government. I know that all these while, we have always been guided by a Foreign Policy Statement rather than a Foreign Policy White Paper. I think I have that small document with me. This was what was guiding us. But, of course, our principles and national interests remain important, and I would like to speak on it as well during the course of my response. Honourable Prime Minister, honestly, I have not read the Foreign Policy White Paper in detail. I contributed, and most of what I had raised during my discussions with Mr. Varghese is what I will share today. It is not criticising, but it is more of constructive dialogue on some of the issues because we discussed the Foreign Policy White Paper, honourable Prime Minister, without the National Development Plan and, of course, that has been launched. I took a copy with me, but I did not read it as well. Of course, the Defence Policy is pending because of the National Defence Review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the limited time this morning, I want to go quickly into Chapter 5 of the Foreign Policy White Paper which is on bilateral relations, including the major powers. For Fiji, multilateralism and the region are, of course, foreign policy force multipliers. I had a bit of interest in the subsequent paragraph, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, particularly, on our start point. The Foreign Policy White Paper says that there is no neat distinction between bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, but geography, history and values, inevitably, shape texture and priorities of our bilateral relationships. On relationships with fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), for example, are of a different order to our relationships with countries outside the Pacific Region. I do agree with that but with the word of caution, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you are well aware of the incidents of 1987 - we went North, because our traditional partners had issues with us, and the same in 2000. That led the current relationships that led to the Vuvale Partnership and the Pacific Reset. Hopefully, we will anchor on respect for sovereignty, equality, independence and, of course, common interests. These are very, very important because we know for a fact from previous, and I hope that this will not restrict us, honourable Prime Minister, Sir. I know that you very well understand what I am talking about because of how we were treated when we had our own internal issues. However, on sovereignty, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, how does this align with not having sovereign capabilities to manage our nation as a sovereign State? It is not only about our defence set-up, but we are looking about the brain-drain, issues of governance and our industrial, economic logistical research and educational capabilities. These are requirements for us in order to achieve our</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2001 strategic sovereignty and, of course, includes safety and health, defence wellbeing, food security, energy, key material supplies, infrastructure security and environmental sustainability, which are all dependant on development partners and foreigners. That is why SDG 17 is very, very critical, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On security, of course, the Ocean of Peace or the zone of peace has prominence but, of course, I did raise then, Mr. Speaker Sir, how it aligns, and I have been listening. I attended the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), I attended the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) Meeting, and how these aligns with the 2050 Strategy as you are well aware of but, again, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, for us, we cannot give something that we do not have and that is why sorting out the issues in Fiji is so important. There are governance issues and honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I hope that you will take responsibility for the issues that are arising in the papers, to sort out these issues because these all contribute to this Ocean of Peace and, particularly, for the long-term security of the region. I hope that there will not be interference in the way things are dealt with but, of course, we must make sure that good governance, institutional integrity as raised by honourable Naupoto, are part of all these, so that we can have that peace first within Fiji before we take it into the region. On prosperity, I am thankful that the National Development Plan is out, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, that we, of course, have to address. This is not only Government, but we take equal responsibility on the issues that we have, such as inflation, cost of living, unemployment, brain drain, housing, government debt, all these things, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Of course, let me assure you, honourable Prime Minister, and all Fijians that we, the G-16 Bloc in the Opposition, will always work together in the common interest for Fiji. This document is going to contribute and, of course, with the Defence Policy that we are waiting for and the National Development Plan, they will all be important for Fiji in terms of the way forward. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- The Leader of the G-9 Bloc? HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, ni bula vinaka. I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for the presentation of the Foreign Policy White Paper, and I think it articulates very clearly the areas that we should focus on, given the huge challenges ahead of us. At this point, I just wanted to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world is changing, and changing very, very fast. There are things that you and I can control and there are things that we cannot control. It is our ability to identify our area of influence, the areas of responsibility, and above all, the areas of our operations. Our area of operations is basically the whole wide world, our ability to influence what particular areas in our engagements and our greatest area of responsibility is really here, in the Pacific and, of course, our home here in Fiji. For me, I have not really studied the document itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said in one of my earlier contributions on the floor, our ability to thread together key guiding documents for our nation, one of it which is this one here, the other one was launched - the National Development Plan, and the Security and Defence Review are critical documents which will help to give us a better understanding on how we relate with the world and how things that we engage with, and the ability to identify what we should do first and what comes second in order of priorities, given the limited resources that we have. I always view the foreign policy work as our ability to fight the forward battles effectively, and that is the key, in my view. How we do it, given the amount of work that needs to be done here? And this is why I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our ability to see the security defence issues, national</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2002</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 development plans, et cetera, and how we thread all these together to be able to relate to the outside world and tell them, through our networking, through our relationship and through our engagement, what we really need to do here in Fiji to take us forward. I draw the attention of the floor this morning to the National Development Plan (NDP), our vision on Chapter 10, it is an honourable and a noble articulated 2050 vision on how we can prosper, how our nation can be inclusive and, above all, sustainable. And I think that is a very important part in how we engage the whole wide world out there through our networks with them. Also, I would like to take note, at this point, of the importance of the role of the military, our police and correctional officers, and how, at the earlier stages of shaping our engagement with the whole wide world and how their books shaped our foreign policy. They are basically our foreign policy tool. There is some importance too, at this point, of sports tool which is also a very important part of how we are going to shape our foreign policy tool. And this is very well articulated in Chapter 2 of our Foreign Policy White Paper - the foreign or soft face of our engagement with the whole wide world. Sports and our cultural identity, those are important aspects of how we can engage with the whole wide world. From the G-9 Bloc, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will study the document, but I stand this morning to assure the honourable Prime Minister and the Government that we look forward to the implementation of the Foreign Policy White Paper to achieve the noble objectives that have been set by Government. Update on the National Taskforce to Address Pornography HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Na Turaga na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and the honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members of Parliament; I stand before you today to provide an update on the efforts undertaken by the National Taskforce to Address Pornography, and the complementary efforts by the Coalition Government in actioning the commitment made in this very august Parliament when I took the floor late last year. This important National Taskforce was approved by Cabinet earlier this year to better understand the societal risks of pornography in Fiji and to provide recommendations to effectively address these risks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, keeping our people safe, both in offline and online spaces, is of paramount importance to the Coalition Government. Therefore, to demonstrate this and to ensure we are effectively understanding and addressing the societal and technical aspects of this issue, this Taskforce is jointly chaired by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection and myself. I am pleased to inform you that the Taskforce held an introductory meeting earlier this year at its first official meeting in August, with active participation and contributions from the Opposition represented by honourable Ketan Lal, various Government Ministries and agencies, telecommunication companies, NGOs, civil society organisations, academia, as well as religious and community organisations, each of them providing a unique and important perspective during these discussions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all aware, the internet, which is a tool of immense potential for progress, has, unfortunately, furthered the reach of cyber criminals and has become a breeding ground for predators who exploit the innocence of our children, and online sexual abuse is an extension of the existing threat of child sexual abuse. As we delve into the stark realities of these issues, we are confronted with alarming statistics that highlight its pervasive nature and the profound impact it has</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2003 on our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last time I took the floor when we discussed this issue, I had shared that when we talk about the web traffic to pornographic sites, for one network provider in Fiji, over a period of three months, the download of about 626TB of data consumed ranking in one of the top 10 most used data traffic by that operator in Fiji. To put this into context, 626TB is approximately equal to a 100 million books. Imagine, having a collection of movies that would take over 150 years to watch non-stop, even if you watched one movie every single day. This shows how large this traffic data is. For a period of one month, another network provider found that the total adult content was 92TB or 1.6 percent of their total data volume for one month. We can see that the adult content and pornography have carved out a significant presence, consuming a substantial portion of network traffic. The numbers do not lie. Although it is impossible to put any realistic numbers on how much of the internet is made up of adult content, we can be assured that the industry is huge. It is a silent epidemic, shaping our digital world and impacting countless lives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, this is a global and regional issue. Last year, 245 electronic service providers made over 35 million reports of suspected Child Sexual Abuse Material or commonly known as CSAM, on their platform. According to the Association of Internet Hotline Providers (INHOPE), in 2023, 83 percent of child abuse victims reported to it were between the age of 3 and 13 years old. Sir, INTERPOL’s Child Sexual Exploitation Database showed that in 2018, 65 percent of unidentified victims were girls and 93 percent of visible offenders were male. The establishment of this National Taskforce, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not merely a symbolic gesture, but a powerful demonstration of the Coalition Government’s commitment to action. It is a tangible step towards safeguarding our communities and protecting our most vulnerable citizens. Which is why the Taskforce has agreed that the first work stream of the Taskforce should be to combat child pornography, now being referred to as Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (OCSEA). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CyberTipline of the United States National Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) serves as United States national clearinghouse for leads on child exploitation crimes as electronic service providers in America are mandated by law to report. These reports are then referred to law enforcement for prosecution. Sir, 99 percent of the cyber tips are received from electronic service providers such as Meta, Google and TikTok. A small number are also received from the public. In 2023 alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCMEC received 3,638 suspected CSEM reports from Fiji. One key action item is for our law enforcement to investigate the CyberTip reports which we are already in discussions with NCMEC and the Fiji Police Force on, with the support of the United States Government to provide the needed training to our law enforcement. This is an addition to the earlier training sessions that have been held. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also urge parents, guardians and communities to be vigilant about the images and videos of our children that we share online. It is critical to avoid uploading pictures or videos of our children when they are not appropriately clothed. Once these images and videos are online, they can be exploited by perpetrators in unimaginable and harmful ways. Let us work together to safeguard our children in both, the physical and digital worlds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had spoken about the complementary efforts that we are progressing to ensure our people, in particular, our children and vulnerable groups are protected, and I would like</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2004</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 to share these as well. In June, we deposited our Instruments of Accession to the Budapest Convention. The Budapest Convention also has a dedicated article for offences related to child pornography and to modernise criminal laws to more effectively address the use of computer systems in the commission of sexual offences against children. This is also captured in our Cybercrime Act 2021, and we have also commenced capacity building sessions for our criminal justice authorities. In August, as a member of the UN Ad Hoc Committee and after three years of negotiations that we were actively participating in, the UN concluded a landmark treaty against cybercrime, which also included provisions for the protection of our children in online spaces. We are also having discussions with the Council of Europe on the Lanzarote Convention, which is the Convention on the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. These strategic partnerships ensure that we holistically address this evolving threat, build capacity and foster international cooperation with stakeholders. The Online Safety Commission also collaborates with NCMEC on the Take it Down online reporting service and with the Australian E-Safety Commission and the Cyber Safety Pasifika initiative, through our law enforcement, to distribute information on options for reporting abuse, protecting accounts and personal information, including blocking people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in the process of finalising a Cabinet paper for the Fiji Government, through the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications and also jointly with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection, to join the WeProtect Global Alliance - the Global Taskforce on Child Sexual Abuse Online. The Global Taskforce is a governmental grouping which focuses on creating a coordinated global approach to online sexual abuse, promoting collaboration among governments, and addressing critical issues such as child exploitation, online grooming, sextortion and harmful content on digital platforms. The Online Safety Commission is already a member of the WeProtect Global Alliance and important work is already being done with digital safety initiatives in schools and communities. The two Ministries joining the Global Taskforce of governments will further enhance Fiji's capacity to address the issue of online child sexual abuse effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the work of the National Taskforce, during the inaugural meeting, the Taskforce explored the importance of international collaboration and strengthening legal frameworks to protect children from online sexual exploitation. The members discussed existing child protection laws and the need for more comprehensive policies to address the evolving challenges in the digital landscape. A significant part of the first meeting involved the validation of the Terms of Reference for the National Taskforce and the Terms of Reference of the Working Groups. There are three working groups, Mr. Speaker, Sir, established with specific objectives related to the overall goals of the Taskforce. Their mandates are clearly defined in the Terms of Reference - to develop concrete strategies and implement tangible solutions that align with our overarching mission. Each working group will focus on a thematic area and operate under the guidance of a designated working group Chair. This ensures that we have an action-oriented approach (not a top first) in the work we are doing. The first Working Group will focus on Policy, Legislation, Governance and Criminal Justice, and is chaired by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. The second Working Group, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is chaired by the Online Safety Commission which focusses on Survivor Support, Empowerment, Society and Culture. The third Working Group will be the Industry and Technology Response and is chaired by the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji. Each Working</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2005 Group consists of different stakeholders who have their main expertise to actively participate in these Working Groups. The Working Groups have started to convene meetings with their stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the effectiveness of our initiatives, the Taskforce will implement robust mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. We will establish feedback channels for the community to provide input on our efforts, ensuring that we remain responsive to the needs of our citizens. The next meeting of the National Taskforce will be conducted this month, where the Working Groups will present their findings, and we will continue to engage in discussions to address the issue of pornography use in Fiji comprehensively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been saying in this august Parliament that we are very serious in what we are doing, to the extent that we are actually looking at even banning some sites, if necessary. On that note, I would like to personally thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection as we are standing shoulder to shoulder together as part of this Taskforce and to address this issue comprehensively; all the stakeholders who are part of the workforce; and the Working Groups, for their contributions. I also invited more members of the Opposition to come and be part of this Working Group, given the importance of the work that we are doing. In closing, the fight against online child sexual abuse and pornography requires a collective responsibility from all sectors of society. We urge each stakeholder to take an active role in this national effort. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we remain committed in our resolve, and I am more than happy to provide further updates as we move along. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. HON. K. K. LAL. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today as a member of the National Taskforce on pornography and as a voice for the many victims who have suffered in silence due to the proliferation of explicit content on social media platforms. While I appreciate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister’s update on the work undertaken by the Taskforce, I must emphasise that the Government’s efforts to-date have been largely bureaucratic. The establishment of the Taskforce was, indeed, a step in the right direction. However, we must acknowledge the realities that our people, especially our young, and women continue to face everyday. Victims of online sexual harassment, cyberbullying and non-consensual sharing of nude images have been long calling for stronger legislative measures and more robust enforcement to protect them. Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Taskforce has far produced more discussions and reviews than actual results. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative that we do more than just talk. Our people are losing trust in processes and commissions that make grand promises but deliver little to no outcomes. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that this Taskforce aims to better understand the societal risk of pornography in Fiji, but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do we need another review to tell us what we already know? We are aware of the devastating impact that unregulated access to pornography is heavy on our society, contributing to increase cases of online harassment and violence against women and children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to prioritise the implementation of practical solutions that are already within our reach. Strengthening our cybercrime laws, improving reporting mechanisms and increasing resources for our law enforcement to track and prosecute offenders are essential first steps.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2006</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also need to work closely with social media companies to ensure that they have robust policies for removing harmful content swiftly and efficiently. Furthermore, we must stand united as a Parliament in condemning the perpetrators who use these platforms to exploit and humiliate others. There are too many instances where victims, especially young women, have had their dignity stripped away online while authorities have remained either powerless or too slow to act. The taskforce should not only be focussed on preventative measures, but also on providing support systems for victims, psychological, legal and emotional. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government is very fond of establishing taskforces, conducting research and forming committees. But the real test is whether these initiatives can bring about meaningful change. The real change that they promised. It is easy to announce yet another review or report, but it is far more challenging to implement real reforms that can safeguard our people. I sincerely hope that the recommendations of this taskforce will not gather dust on the shelves of their cabinet, but rather be translated into concrete actions that will make our online spaces safer and more secure. We, on this side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the G-16 Bloc, stand ready to work together to ensure that our children, our sisters, our mothers and all Fijians are protected from the behaviours that thrive on these platforms. We need less bureaucracy and more action! Less talk and more decisive moves! Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is high time this Government moves beyond taskforce and research and start showing us results. I call the taskforce to expedite its work and to focus on outcomes that will restore faith and the Government’s ability to tackle these pressing issues. Our people deserve no less. On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you and I also want to congratulate my friend on the other side, the honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services, for becoming the new Deputy Leader for the People’s Alliance Party. I hope that he will do his work very well and also fix the potholes on our streets. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- You started off well, honourable Ketan Lal, but you ended up with the potholes again. I now call on the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or their designate. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me the space to</p><h4>respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister.</h4><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, as an independent Member of Parliament, I am tasked with the privilege of offering a distinctive view to this conversation, one that is shaped by my Christian faith and rich depository of the faith-based community I am part of. The establishment of the National Taskforce to tackle the societal risks associated with pornography is a reaffirming parallel to the views and the values, I and thousands across Fiji resonate with, rooted in respect of human person and a sanctity of relationship. These challenges are more than a societal issue, it is about the preservation of our moral fabric, the essence of human dignity and a concern that is central to our people and our faith. As a Fijian citizen, deriving our strength from faith, we understand the harms of pornography, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only in terms of societal risk, but also as a moral concern that negatively impacts relationships, our family values and individual growth. We acknowledge that pornography is harmful</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2007 of the materials that objectifies individuals, distorts the healthy understanding of human sexuality and the impacts on mental and spiritual wellbeing. Whilst we applaud the Taskforce’s effort, the Christian faith and the faith-based community would like to ensure that our actions are holistic, not only centred merely on punitive measures, but develop a regulation that will play a role, so does the education of our community. The teaching of Christ moves us towards understanding empathy and rehabilitation over punishment and judgment, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We should strive to foster an environment where the inherent dignity and word of each person are respected, human sexuality are not degraded. This involves an open conversation and a comprehensive education about the impact and the explicit content with digital safety consent and healthier relationships. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this discussion, it is crucial to remember the Bible verse, Matthew 18:6, reminding us that leading children astray brings great moral responsibility. We must ensure that our children and vulnerable population are offered the utmost protection with wisdom to make sound morale upright and instil decisions in the cyberspace. Moreover, as protectors of individual freedom, we must find a balance between safeguarding morale standards and protecting privacy rights. This delicate balance necessitates the inclusion of legal, ethical and spiritual consideration in our decision-making process, aligning the State’s affairs and resources with our moral compass as a guiding light. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our pursuit to curtail the adverse effect of pornography, we must be reminded to uphold the principle of compassion, understanding and forgiveness that our faith teaches us. The pathway we propose in this Parliament should inspire transformation and healing, rather than stigmatisation and shame. I trust that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the Taskforce and each one of us in this room uphold this principle close to our hearts. I stand with them in their fight against the societal risk of pornography, echoing our faith, call, dignity, respect, responsible freedom and a holistic approach in addressing this issue. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, it is almost 12.30 p.m., so I would like to adjourn Parliament now. We will resume at 2.30 p.m., and we will continue with the Statement made by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. Thank you. The Parliament adjourned at 12.28 p.m.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2008</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.42 p.m. Causes of Fish Poisoning in Fiji and the Pacific Islands HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and all those tuning in live on Parliament’s Facebook page – ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I am pleased to deliver a Statement on the Ministry of Fisheries work on managing fish poisoning in Fiji and the research undertakings on ciguatera fish poisoning, one of the common causes of fish poisoning in Fiji and the Pacific Islands. Mr. Speaker, fish is an important protein rich food source which contributes significantly to the health and economic livelihood of our people. Fish consumption in Fiji is estimated at between 15 and 113 kilogrammes per capita and there is a higher per capita consumption in rural coastal communities. The presence of toxins in fish will significantly impact the economy and public health of Fijians, especially when it involves our export market and the hospitality industry. In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, fish poisoning affects health, trade and livelihood. Fish poisoning can be caused by: (1) (2) (3) improper fish handling; fish not chilled and refrigerated properly; and eating reef fish that have accumulated naturally occurring toxins called ciguatoxin. The ciguatoxin is produced from small sea plants called dinoflagellates and as it enters through the food chain, it becomes progressively more concentrated affecting humans. Mr. Speaker, to address improper fish handling and the maintenance of fish quality, the Ministry of Fisheries has established 24 Fisheries Centres across the country. These Centres supply ice to fishers to preserve fish, maintain freshness and prevent the release of enzymes from fish which speeds up the fish’s spoilage rate and causes fish poisoning. Mr. Speaker, our Extension and Advisory Division serves in the four Divisions and provides post-harvest training to licensed fishers on how to maintain seafood freshness and quality. The training includes the proper use of ice and adequate hygiene during harvesting, processing, distribution and marketing of the fish product. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry commends the tremendous support the Government of Japan provides through the Overseas Fisheries Cooperation Foundation in installing and monitoring ice machines in the 24 stations, including ongoing training and capacity building of our technical services staff in operating and servicing the ice machines. Mr. Speaker, ciguatera fish poisoning is primarily prevalent during the warmer months or cyclone seasons from November to April. However, with the frequent changes in weather patterns, increased natural disturbances and climate change impact, the occurrence is frequent and varies. In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, the management of ciguatera fish poisoning depends mainly on Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) which is not adequately documented. Mr. Speaker, since 2002, the Ministry of Fisheries has conducted a baseline questionnaire survey to identify major hotspots, seasons and fish species implicated in ciguatoxin, including</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2009 treatment and traditional remedies. This work documented the effort to manage, prevent and reduce the incidence of fish poisoning, especially given the impact of climate change that may contribute to the spread of ciguatoxin. Mr. Speaker, the work on ciguatera fish poisoning is included in the Ministry workplan with the following objectives: (1) Improve the reporting mechanism for ciguatera incidence in coastal and maritime communities; and (2) Assess the environmental and ecological presence of marine biotoxin-identified hotspot areas in Fiji and provide recommended adaptations strategies. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has created awareness through community outreach, talkback shows, trade shows, journal publications and public awareness materials. News alerts and awareness are published through the Ministry of Fisheries Facebook page and other media outlets during the cyclone season. In 2016, Mr. Speaker, and with the support of our local institutions, the University of the South Pacific and the Fiji National University, the Ministry undertook a validation research approach to investigating the hotspots identified through traditional ecological knowledge and the scientific process to determine the occurrence and accumulation in seafood. The study discovered some unknown knowledge and confirmed some of Fiji’s fish poisoning traditional science. The sampling was conducted in Kadavu, Nadroga, Navosa and Tailevu. Mr. Speaker, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Fiji National University, the village nurses, village headmen and community workers were trained to collect data on ciguatera fish poisoning incidents using a specifically designed fish poisoning notification book. The pilot project was conducted in Tailevu and Kadavu. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry appreciates and acknowledges the support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) for assisting in setting up a mini laboratory in the Ministry by donating laboratory equipment and providing capacity building for staff to enhance their field sample collection, identification and preservation skills. Because of the need to undertake a comprehensive research approach to manage, prevent and reduce the incidence of ciguatera fish poisoning in Fiji, the Ministry is in the process of entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Fiji National University. The focus is to undertake a complete research approach based on the impact of health, environment, socio-cultural, food security, livelihood and trade. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry would like to acknowledge and appreciate the Government of Japan’s instrumental roles in developing Fiji fisheries sector. Last Wednesday, as Minister for Fisheries, I signed a MOU with the Ambassador of Japan for funding projects for our provisional fisheries research vessel and ice making machines. These infrastructures will continue to support managing and preventing fish poisoning in Fiji by enabling research and ecological assessment in remote maritime areas and assisting maritime communities with access to ice, proper fish handling and better markets. Mr. Speaker, the work on managing, reducing and preventing fish poisoning needs a multi- local disciplinary collaboration between Government agencies, research communities. As we approach the cyclone season, the Ministry will intensify public outreach and release awareness materials on ciguatera fish poisoning. I urge the public to remain vigilant especially in identifying and avoiding fish associated with ciguatoxin. institutions and</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2010</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for her Ministerial Statement. Of course, we are all concerned about the safety, health and well-being of our people and providing them information in advance, our taking pro-active measures is a good initiative to ensure that our people, of course, do take heed particularly when it is in season. As alluded to by the honourable Minister, I will not go into detail on it but perhaps an advice to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for Trade, “if you want to avoid fish poisoning, why not go for kaikoso? Perhaps a better alternative. It is safe and of course you will enjoy your long life as well. That is perhaps a recommendation to the other side of the House, there is an alternative to fish for those of you who do eat fish. The honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and I, we abstain from eating fish. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is important, perhaps to what the honourable Minister has stated is how people can realize or identify the symptoms when they are affected. This is particularly relevant for those in the outer islands where they do not have easy access to health facilities. I remembered my days as an officer in the RFMF, we had exercise in Nabukavesi and the late Dr. Ifereimi Buaserau shared to us his experience in Lau. Because of the implications, they usually lie to the doctors about what they ate and when it gets worse, then that is where they revealed things, especially, Sir, in the first three hours and, of course, in the first 72 hours as well. This is very important, particularly, for our people to know the symptoms and differentiate between the symptoms as they go through the pain or whatever we may call it during the first three hours and the first 72 hours as well. Of course, prevention is better than cure. The season, we need to also avoid particularly those that do feed on coral reefs and organisms that live on our reefs because this is a common problem in sub-tropical and, of course, tropical countries as well. Apart from the season, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a means of prevention as well, one is avoiding reef fish particularly the recommended sizes according to science is fishes over 2.7 kilogrammes because of probably, it is related to their eating patterns. The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is apart from the fillet, the flesh itself, people need to avoid eating the liver, intestines, head and the roe of small reef fish. Roe is another name for fish eggs. Those are the things that are also recommended for us to avoid if we do happen to choose. I commend the Ministry for the work that they do in terms of awareness. We need to have these aggressive campaign on awareness, so that we can also ensure that the message reaches out. I am particularly pleading for those in the rural areas and the outer island communities, if we can use all the arms of Government, not only Ministry of Fisheries, to reach out to our people and, of course, the involvement of academia, is important. That is my contribution but once again there is an alternative, go for kaikoso. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, you have tonnes of knowledge about fish. The G-9 Bloc, or their designate? HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you honourable Minister for the Statement this afternoon. Very important on fish poisoning; ciguatera poisoning is something that I am very well versed with; not as a scientist but for someone who suffers from it a lot. From my island, Sir, years ago all the fish were poisoned with ciguatera. We know very much the symptoms when you get it, one of them is temperature reversals, so the hot things get cold</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2011 and cold things feel hot. So, if you put your hand under the tap, you think it is hot, so you put it away. The problem with ciguatera poisoning is that you cannot test the fish beforehand, you will only know it after you eat it. One of the preventative measures, I think, is for people to understand which fish and the season when fish are usually the prevalence of ciguatera is there which is coming up now - October ( Vula i Balolo Lailai ) and November ( Vula i Balolo Levu ) is when fish poisoning occurs. Generally, we know the fish species that are easily poisonous at this time. I think the Ministry puts out some awareness material on fish. The problem is not so much for those who live in the islands, they know the season, they know the fish that they should avoid. The problem is with us in the urban areas where our fish identification is very bad. Generally, you will not be able to differentiate between the two-spot red snapper and the normal mangrove jack which is a nice eating fish. The two spot ones are poisonous one in Fiji. I think the Fijian name for it is bati. They look very familiar but the bati is the one that usually is poisonous. I know in Natewa Bay, Udu Point, no fish is poisonous that side. They think they are all good. Fish identification, this is something that is almost disappearing now. Our children do not know the Fijian name of our fish and even trees. I think that area is also the same. If the Ministry can put out public awareness during seasons like now, when ciguatera poisoning would be high, the risk for it is high, the types of fish to avoid, I think that will help a lot because in some cases, people die from fish poisoning. I have on a few occasions, when lining up to buy fish and there is someone who is picking up one of these species that I know that are usually poisonous, I will lean across to them and tell them, “Do you know what that fish is?” And no, so at this time, Bati is not a safe fish to buy, oh okay and they will change. But that comes from the experience of getting fish poisoning a lot of the time and I was on the island, but it is an important aspect of fisheries work. Again, perhaps if the enforcement officers could go around and look at the fish that has been sold and if you see those that we should be avoiding during this time where the ciguatera poisoning where the chances of it is high. We should tell them that you should not be selling these types of fish. But it is a good initiative from the Ministry, and I think awareness is the key, because you do not see it, you will learn only after you eat it. And perhaps, some education on the symptoms that you get so that you know that when you get fish poisoning, you can go to the hospital and get the right treatment.</p></body>
