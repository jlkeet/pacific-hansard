<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts 2018-2021 Annual Report HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am privileged to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs concerning the consolidated review of the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts for years 2018 to 2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), our Committee is tasked with scrutinising issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media. Through our comprehensive review, we have identified several key concerns and challenges affecting the education sector and, we have put forward a series of recommendations to address these issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise and commend the Ministry of Education’s ongoing efforts to enhance the education sector through its current policies and procedures. Nevertheless, we believe that a thorough review of the Education Act 1966 is essential for further advancement. Additionally, appointing the Education Commissioners is crucial to ensure the continued improvement and effectiveness of the Ministry’s services.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1989 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our duties under Standing Order 110, the Committee conducted site visits to schools across the Western and Central Divisions. These visits highlighted several concerns which we subsequently raised with the Ministry Officials during their public submissions to the Committee. Our Report details these concerns and offers actionable recommendations to address them. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Permanent Secretary and her team for their valuable contributions to this review process. I also wish to acknowledge the outstanding leadership and guidance of the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Alitia Bainivalu. My gratitude also goes to the former Committee Members - honourable P. K. Bala; honourable K. K. Lal (Alternate Member); and honourable P. K. Ravunawa (Alternate Member); and the current Committee Members, for their dedicated efforts in finalising this Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and encourage all Members of this august House to review its findings and recommendations. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Women and Poverty Alleviation 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 Annual Reports. As mandated under Standing Order 109 (2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to health, education, social service, labour, aviation, culture and media. The period under review was during the time that Fiji and the world were hit by a global pandemic, COVID-19, which resulted in changes to the normal standard operating procedures. In light of this development, the Ministry continued to provide service to its clients through the deployment of staff in areas that were on lockdown. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through its mandatory role stipulated under Standing Order 110, conducted a visit to the Golden Age Home and the St. Tabitha Orphanage Home in Lautoka. The Committee noted concerns from the visit, which were also raised with the Ministry Officials during their public submission to the Committee. Moreover, the Committee highlighted concerns raised during the visit and identified possible recommendations.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1990</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 I wish to convey my gratitude and sincere appreciation to the Permanent Secretary and her team for their valuable contribution to this review process. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Alitia Bainivalu, for her leadership and guidance; to the former Committee Members for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork - honourable P. K. Bala, honourable K. K. Lal (Alternate Member) and honourable P. K. Ravunawa (Alternate Member); and the current Committee Members for the finalisation of the Committee Report.

A. A. MAHARAJ. - Mr:</span> Speaker Sir, I second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Review Report on the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, I stand before this august House as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to report back on the Committee’s work that had been entrusted to us by this august House. Sir, I would like to begin by giving a brief background of the Bill. Mr. Speaker, the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 was formulated to provide the legal framework for the establishment of the Drug-Free Sport Fiji (DFSF) as a National Anti-Doping Organisation. The Bill also establishes and mandates the DFSF to formulate, draft and implement proper frameworks, rules and educational curriculum on anti-doping in sports. Sir, the main objective of DFSF is to ensure the proper implementation of, and compliance with, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code on creating a more accountable framework, which will provide strategic direction, guide and monitor the development of clean sports in Fiji. Given Fiji’s geographical size, the sudden influx of doping in sports has increased significantly amongst athletes. Unless a National Anti-Doping Organisation is established, it is certain that Fiji will remain vulnerable to doping in sports. The DFSF will be the overarching body established through the legislative frameworks of the UNESCO Convention against Doping in Sport and the WADA Code, which converges on all efforts to promote clean sports. The DFSF, Sir, will be an independent body, free from the influence and interference of government and sports federations. It will provide a clear and national regulatory, law enforcement,</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1991 policy and programme delivery response to doping in sports. The setup of the organisation will ensure Fiji is in compliance with the world anti-doping standards and frameworks. It will also allow Fiji to participate in future internationally world- sanctioned sports events. The organisation will work in close collaboration with international anti- doping agencies, sporting bodies, and relevant stakeholders to ensure that our anti-doping efforts align with global practices and uphold the principles of fair play. Mr. Speaker, the Committee also notes that failure to comply with the Convention may result in the ineligibility of Fiji to bid for and host international events, forfeiture of offices and positions within the WADA and any other consequences pursuant to the Olympic Charter. Mr. Speaker, this is something we learnt during the review. The South African Rugby Team faced a similar consequence, whereby team they were almost sanctioned from WADA due to non- compliance with the latest World Anti-Doping Code. Two days before the match, the South African Team was advised by WADA that their rugby team will not be allowed to raise their national flag or sing the national anthem during a rugby world cup match. Fortunately, Sir, South Africa managed to appeal and had their penalties reverted. As for Fiji, the Committee is adamant that the Bill, in its current amendment form, is compliant with international standards and does not pose any risk, especially, to our athletes. Mr. Speaker, I will now go into the actual work of the Committee, beginning by covering the process followed by the Committee for the review. The Committee, firstly, examined the Bill Clause by Clause and a briefing was conducted with the Drafters and the Ministry of Youth and Sports, on the technicalities of the Bill. At the outset, Sir, there were miscommunications along the way that led to the delay of the review, and this was, we were having two separate legislations that were proposed for adoption. However, the Committee conducted its own deliberation on the Bill and noted the following issues. With respect to Clause 2 on the definitions of “local sports entities”, the Committee was of the view that there has to be some degree of inclusivity, and clarification was sought on the definition of ‘local sports entities’ and how other sporting bodies in Fiji are included or involved. The rationale was that the non-inclusion of other sports would pose risks of breach of anti-doping conditions. The Committee further noted in Clause 2 that there was no definition classified for the term “athlete” in the Bill. The Committee understands that leaving the term undefined would pose an open field of recruitment for a person with any sporting background to be an eligible member to the DFSF Board. The Committee suggested that the person with limited sporting background with experience would be an eligible member of the DFSF Board. In relation to Clause 21(2)(e), the Committee observed that an individual committing an offence could face a fine of $10,000 or a two-year prison term. Additionally, it was noted by the Committee that there is no existing legislation that permits the Minister to criminalise an athlete for offences committed. The Committee believes that an athlete should not be criminalised for such offences but should, instead, face fines or a lifetime ban if they violate anti-doping regulations. In Clause 23, the Committee was of the view that there should not be further inclusion of personal officers as suggested by the public, given that the more people involved, the more risk it poses on the tampering of evidence. Additionally, there were other matters noted from this initial deliberation, which included the:</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1992</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) issue concerning the player welfare within the Bill; issue whether there are sufficient facilities available to conduct anti-doping testing in Fiji; issue whether there is an association of players established in Fiji; absence of appeal process to cater for athletes that have tested positive, and the Committee noted in the current drafting of the Bill that the DFSF stands as a judge, jury and the executioner; and rationale of the Fiji Police Force’s involvement in the investigation process when the DFSF already has the mandate to investigate on matters relating to anti-doping. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was fortunate to be invited to the Annual National Sporting Organisation Conference that was held at the Grand Pacific Hotel in June this year. The Committee capitalised on the opportunity and reserved a session for public consultation on the Bill. There were a total of 43 sporting bodies present at this meeting whereby various suggestions and opinions were raised, and the Committee gave due consideration to these, by having extensive deliberation and seeking legal clarification on all issues, so as to ensure that these were properly considered. At the final stage of the review, the Committee resolved to make changes to the Bill, which could contribute to the achievement of its objectives and also comply with the World Anti-Doping Standards. I will not take much time, but will just highlight a few key changes that the Committee recommended to be made to the Bill, and these include: (1) providing a broad definition of sports entities that includes a broader spectrum of sports (2) (3) federation; a provision to mitigate the risk of abuse of office for any person intending to assume the membership of the advisory council; and including a provision that provides responsibility to the Minister in ensuring that proper funding is appropriated to the functions of this Bill. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, we would like to thank the members of the public and the sporting bodies that participated in the public consultation, the Permanent Secretary for Youth and Sports and his Team, and that provided their input on the Bill, which greatly assisted the Committee in its review. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to the honourable Members of the Committee for their thoughtful deliberations and contributions. I also acknowledge the former members of the Committee who started off with the consideration of the Bill, namely, honourable Koya and honourable Niudamu, and thank them for their insightful contributions in the initial stages of the Committee deliberations; and the honourable Naupoto and honourable Matasawalevu, who stepped in when the Substantive Members were unavailable. We thank you, Sirs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20 th May, 2024, the Standing Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly. The Bill will be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 3 rd October, 2024. I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to table his second Report.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1993 Review Report on the National Disaster Management Bill 2024 HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, I stand before this august House as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to report back on the Committees’ work that had been entrusted to us by this august House. Sir, similar to my speech I made earlier this morning, I would like to begin with giving a brief background of the Bill. The Natural Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 seeks to repeal the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 and to make provisions for disaster risk management governance arrangements to ensure clarity and efficiency in response to new hazards and disasters. Amongst the key changes to the Act is the expanded mandate for the disaster legislation to not only cover natural hazards, but now focus on all hazards that have the potential to cause disasters, with the exception of civil unrest and terrorism. This is in line with all the hazards approach for disaster and disaster risk management that is the global best practice, and which is promoted under Fiji’s National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the global framework guiding Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) across the world. The Bill also places emphasis on disaster risk reduction and its practical application in the form of disaster risk management measures, due to the growing recognition of the role that early mitigation and prevention of risk plays in the alleviation and avoidance of disasters. In that regard, the Bill will now be known as the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 as opposed to its former title of Natural Disaster Management Act 2024, reflecting its expanded scope on all hazards rather than just natural phenomena and its focus on disaster risk management. In the same vein, Mr. Speaker, the Act amalgamates the functions of the current Preparedness and Mitigation Sub-Committees to form the Disaster Risk Reduction Sub-Committee, which will now be responsible for all disaster risk management activities, except those for disaster and emergency response, which remains the mandate of the Emergency Sub-Committee. The Bill also formalises and legislates the Fiji Cluster System for better coordination of humanitarian actors in the country. The Fiji Cluster System will foster collaboration and partnership across mechanisms and institutions for the implementation of instruments relevant to disaster risk. In terms of the subnational disaster risk management arrangements, the Bill allows for the establishment of the Disaster Risk Management Committees at Divisional, Provincial, District and Community levels. This will strengthen coordination for preparedness, response, disaster management, and climate change adaptation at all levels. It also provides for the establishment of subnational offices of the NDMO to be headed by Divisional Disaster Risk Management Officers, which will ensure the mainstreaming and the coordination of activities and provision of advice to Divisional Commissioners on subnational activities related to disaster risk management, disaster risk reduction and disaster management. The Bill also strengthens the role of Disaster Service Liaison Officers (DSLO), who are government agency focal points for disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management across all Government Ministries. The DSLOs’ role was provided for under a single provision in the Act. However, past experience and the feedback from consultations, have demonstrated the critical role that DSLOs play for the implementation of disaster risk management through all Government Ministries.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1994</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 The Bill also encompasses the regulation of international aid, featuring provisions designed to mitigate any adverse consequences stemming from unsolicited bilateral donations to oversee assistance that could potentially contribute to the issue of disaster-generated waste. Additionally, it includes the establishment of Single Window International facilitation teams. The Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (IMEWS) is developed and functional across all levels. There are provisions in the draft Bill that establishes an Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System at the national level by linking the existing various early warning systems that exist in various sectors and institutions. The technical capacity for hazard monitoring and early warning is proposed to be housed in the National Emergency Operations Center and be linked to all key institutions issuing early warning in real time. With regards to Disaster Risk Management Volunteers, this provision requires volunteer organisations to formally register their intentions to engage disaster volunteers. The aim is to provide a protective framework for volunteers, safeguarding them from any potential violations during their participation in disaster response efforts. Mr. Speaker, I will now go into the actual work of the Committee, beginning by covering the process followed by the Committee for the review. The Committee, firstly, examined the Bill Clause by Clause and a briefing was conducted with the Drafter and the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development on the technicalities of the Bill. At the outset, the Committee conducted its own deliberation on the Bill and noted the following issues: (1) With respect to Clause 28, the Committee noted that the Ministry of Health, the Fiji Police Force and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in coordination with NDMO, have specifically confined their roles to facilitate international assistance for the purpose of providing assistance to victim identification and mortuary services. With regard to international assistance to other needed services required in disaster recovery, clarification was sought in removing certain words from the Clause that could possibly address this issue. (2) With regards to Clause 30, the Committee noted that the Disaster Service Liaison Officer established in the Bill has significant roles and functions, and clarification was sought on the due process in situations whereby the person holding the position is absent from the office. Who, in this case, does take up the role as per the establishment of this particular provision? (3) In relation to Clause 33, the Committee noted there were two actions specified in the Clause which provides for international assistance to waive quarantine requirements, specifically with regards to rescue dogs. Thus, in the same provision, it states that this assistance should comply with quarantine requirements, which led to the Committee to seek clarification from the Ministry, particularly regarding the intent to bypass the 14-day quarantine period. Additionally, there were other matters noted from this initial deliberation, which included the undefined terminology that are listed in the Bill and the issue of drafting on certain Clauses of the Bill that were not clear. At the final stage of the review, the Committee resolved to make changes to the Bill, which could contribute to the achievement of its objectives. Some of these recommendations, Sir, have been reflected in the amendment to the Bill.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1995 At this juncture, Sir, we would like to thank the members of the public in the public consultation, the Permanent Secretary and Director of NDMO who provided their input on the Bill, which greatly assisted the Committee in its review. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to the honourable Members of the Committee for their thoughtful deliberations and contributions. I also acknowledge the former Members of the Committee, namely, honourable F. S. Koya and honourable Ratu J. B. Niudamu, for their insightful contribution during their tenure as Members of the Committee; the Alternate Members - honourable V. Naupoto and honourable T. R. Matasawalevu, who stepped in when the Substantive Members were unavailable. Thank you to you both. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20 th May, 2024, and the Communications from the Speaker on Monday, 5 th August, 2024, the Standing Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly. The Bill will be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 3 rd October, 2024.</p></body>
