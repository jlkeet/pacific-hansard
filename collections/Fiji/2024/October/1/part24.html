238</p><p>Apart from these 38 applicants, there are 28 applications still pending due to missing support 

documents required for further processing. One application was found to have an adverse criminal 

record  spanning  over  10  years,  and  the  individual  has  been  advised  to  obtain  a  rehabilitation 

certificate. Additionally, nine applications are currently awaiting police reports to proceed further.</p><p>As more applications are received, the Ministry will facilitate the induction process to ensure 

that these services are enhanced and made readily available to the public. Our goal is to continuously 

improve access to these vital services for the community.</p><p>In  conclusion,  the  Ministry  of  Justice  is  making  significant  strides  in  modernizing  its 

operations and enhancing service delivery for the people of Fiji, particularly in the appointment and 

support of JPs. These individuals play an essential role in upholding justice and ensuring access to 

legal  services  across  the  country.  The  Ministry's  ongoing  efforts  reflect  a  strong  commitment  to 

integrity, efficiency, and fairness in the appointment process, ensuring that JPs are well-prepared and 

fully equipped to serve their communities with professionalism and dedication.</p><p>Page:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70</p></body>
