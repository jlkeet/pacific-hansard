<body><h3>ANNEXURE I</h3><h4>ANNEXURE I</h4><p>Reply to Written Question No. 236/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Justice (Ref. Page 2025) MINISTER FOR JUSTICE (Hon. S. D. Turaga) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reply to Question No. 236/2024 is as follows: Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to acknowledge honourable Qereqeretabua for raising the question on the number of Justices of Peace (JPs) appointed in the last six months, their names and addresses and the number of applications received and processed from January to June of this year. The Fiji Coalition Government has made significant strides in increasing the number of JPs across the country. Sir, JPs play a vital role in both, our legal system and broader community. Their primary functions include: • • witnessing the signing of important documents, such as affidavits of service and statutory declarations; and certifying copies of documents. These services are crucial for various legal proceedings, ensuring that individuals can fulfil their legal obligations and access necessary benefits. Some documents verified by JPs may be required for court cases, while others are needed for everyday legal and administrative processes. The appointment of an individual as a Justice of the Peace carries with it a profound trust in their honesty, diligence, and caution in performing their duties. Mr. Speaker, Sir, JPs are entrusted with a duty of care, particularly when handling the documents they witness or certify. This responsibility requires them to follow correct procedures at all times, to prevent any potential harm. For instance, if a JP fails to properly witness the signing of a document, and this oversight results in someone suffering a financial loss, the affected individual may have legal recourse against the JP. Therefore, the role demands a strong commitment to accuracy and adherence to legal protocols to uphold the trust placed in them by the community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, JPs are bound by a strict code of conduct, which is thoroughly explained during their induction process. They are appointed for a three-year term, during which they must uphold the standards outlined in this code. The code of conduct sets clear expectations for their behaviours and responsibilities. Upon appointment, each JP is assigned a unique registration number, which they are encouraged to include in their official stamp when providing services to the public. Before assuming their duties, JPs are made aware of the following key points: • • • • TERM OF APPOINTMENT: Justices of Peace serve a three-year term. CODE OF CONDUCT: They must adhere to the established standards of behaviour. JP REGISTRATION NUMBERS: Each JP is issued a unique number for identification. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES: JPs are required to notify the Ministry of Justice if there are changes in their name, address, or contact details. • MOVING OVERSEAS: JPS must inform the Ministry if they plan to move abroad. • DEATH OF A JP: The Ministry must be notified in the event of a JP's passing.</p><p>ii. • • • TRAINING: JPs are expected to participate in any training offered by the Ministry of Justice. CHANGE OF ADDRESS: JPS must promptly inform the Ministry if their address or contact information changes. DISPLAY OF CERTIFICATE: A JP must display their certificate of appointment at the location where they provide services, as registered with the Ministry of Justice. These guidelines ensure that JPs maintain the highest standards of professionalism and accountability throughout their term. As part of their responsibilities, JPs are required to submit reports detailing the services they provide to the public. These reports are due in March and September each year during their term of appointment. Maintaining these reports is crucial for the following reasons: • OFFICIAL REQUIREMENT: Submitting these reports is a formal obligation set by the Ministry. • RECORD OF SERVICES: It helps JPs track the type of services they have provided and to whom. • SERVICE TRANSPARENCY: The reports offer a clear reflection of the services rendered to the public. • FRAUD PREVENTION: They protect JPs from potential fraudulent claims or issues. • RENEWAL CONSIDERATION: The Minister uses these reports to assess whether a JP's appointment should be renewed at the end of their term. • MINISTRY OVERSIGHT: The reports enable the Ministry to monitor the quality and integrity of the services provided, especially if a complaint is lodged against a JP. These reports ensure accountability, transparency, and professionalism, supporting both the JPs and the Ministry in their shared mission of upholding justice. Currently, the number of JPs in Fiji stands at 625. In the last six months, the total number of Justices of the Peace (JP) appointed is 84. The breakdown as per province is as follows: Province Lomaiviti Kadavu Rewa Naitasiri Tailevu Ra Ba Nadroga Serua Namosi Lau Macuata Bua Cakaudrove Total Total No. of JPs 1 0 8 24 7 1 22 3 0 3 0 8 3 4 84 The breakdown of the total number of JPs as per Division in the last six months is as follows: Division Central Eastern Total No. of JPs 39 1</p><p>iii.
