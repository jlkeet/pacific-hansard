<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your interest in the workings of your Parliament. Honourable Speaker - South Australian Parliament Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the Speaker of the South Australian Parliament, the honourable Leon Bignell; accompanied by the Deputy Australian High Commissioner, Ms Clair McNamara; and the First Secretary, Ms. Rebecca Brown. (Acclamation) Thank you for joining us today. You are most welcome to the Fijian Parliament, and I hope that you are enjoying your visit to our beautiful shores. Establishment of Sub-Committee Honourable Members, having discussed the audit issue which was tabled by the Public Accounts Committee in the last sitting period with the Business Committee, please, take note of the unresolved issues reported by the honourable Chairperson. You have done a wonderful job, honourable Chairperson, by fully reporting all that you are supposed to be reporting, even the missing files and those that have disappeared, to be interviewed. We are grateful that the honourable Speaker</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Communications from the Speaker</h4><p>1987 from Adelaide, the Deputy High Commissioner, together with the First Secretary – Ms. Rebecca Brown, are here to witness this. I am invoking Standing Order 20 for the purposes of ensuring oversight and scrutiny in this serious matter. I hope you are all listening. In that regard, pursuant to Standing Orders 20, I am now calling for the establishment of a Sub-Committee, under Standing Order 122, and that Sub- Committee will further investigate the unresolved issues and report back to my Office. My Office will determine the membership of the Sub-Committee, as well as issue a Terms of Reference, and the Sub-Committee will report back to my Office as per the deadline that will be issued to them. That is all, honourable Members, vinaka. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a point of clarification, this is with regards to your ruling this morning. For the information of honourable Members in this august House, quite interestingly, this Report was initiated by a former Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Housing Authority was always audited by KPMG. This special investigation was done as per the official request coming from the Minister to the Board, and then a special investigation was carried out. Just because the Office of the Auditor-General was involved in carrying out this special investigation, this particular Report ended up in Parliament as per Audit Act 1965. Had the Minister back then used any other audit agency, for example, BDO, that Report would not have ended up in Parliament. Sir, can we first identify as to how this Report ended up in Parliament in the first place? If it was BDO, that Report would not have come here because after that Report itself, KPMG did another report and a special investigation into Housing Authority on the same case and that Report was never tabled in Parliament. So, there are certain clarifications, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that need to be made well before we can go into what you have recommended. There is no issue in forming a Sub-Committee, Sir, but for the sake of clarification, I thought of bringing this to the floor of Parliament, that there was another report which was not tabled in Parliament. This was initiated by a Minister, and it should have been reported back to the Minister because the Minister initiated that particular investigation. It was not something that was done or initiated by the Office of the Auditor-General. Although the law says that any audit carried out by the Office of the Auditor-General should be tabled in Parliament, however, this was a very special case, Mr. Speaker. That Report should have been dealt with by the Board and the Minister, rather than it coming to Parliament and then referred to the Public Accounts Committee. The honourable Attorney-General is here and he can provide clarification at a later stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, it is not for the honourable Attorney-General to rule on this.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> No, the ruling is definitely from you.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I am ruling on this based on the content of the Report that was elaborated upon by the honourable Chairperson of the Committee, and based on his Report, things should have ended there. But, again, there are very serious issues highlighted by the Chairperson based on the Performance Audit Report that we need to look into; one is the disappearance of files, secondly, those who were supposed to be interviewed are no longer there. Taxpayers’ money, honourable Member, has been used. We need to go through this with a thorough investigation.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1988</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 Since we have the powers that we have taken on board after the trip down to Melbourne and Canberra, it is only proper, honourable Member, that we kick in the powers to scrutinise and do oversight on these particular areas, so we dig more into that. That is why we had discussed this thoroughly in the Business Committee. The powers are with me, and I am invoking those powers to the establishment of the Sub-Committee and a Terms of Reference be provided also, and then we will take it from there. That is all. If that second report is still there with you, then we will see because we are working on a Performance Audit done by the Auditor-General. Again, the honourable Attorney-General has provided the audit review which we will be conducting sometimes this week and maybe you can bring that in. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ. - That was exactly my point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we are going to debate a Bill that is supposed to amend the Audit Act, in future, if any Minister or anyone conducts a special investigation which is not done by the Office of Auditor-General, that Report also needs to be presented in Parliament. That is all I am saying. MR. SPEAKER.- Well, it was not presented by the honourable Chairperson. We are just working on the report that was tabled here by the honourable Chairperson, and that is all we are doing. If you want to bring that in, then you can bring that in through the Sub-Committee. Am I clear? We need to be moving forward, honourable Member, and we need to try and utilise these powers that we have - the powers of scrutiny and oversight, so that not only are we at par with our counterparts in Australia and New Zealand, but at the same time, we are gearing towards something that will bring out the best in whatever we do. People can have faith and continue to trust in what our Parliament is doing. Thank you.</p><h4>There will be no further questions on that. I have made my ruling, honourable Members, and</h4><p>let us abide by that.</p></body>
