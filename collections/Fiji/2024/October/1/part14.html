S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I am honoured to present the overview of Assets Fiji Pte Limited 2016 to 2019 Annual Report. The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on Assets Fiji Pte Limited on 3 rd September, 2024. The Committee commends Assets Fiji Pte Limited (AFL) for the handling of its assets during the period under review. The Committee acknowledges the successful vesting of 35 land titles, which are strategically located near Lautoka, Levuka and Suva Port areas. The independent valuation of assets underscores AFL’s ability to manage its real estate portfolio. While reviewing AFL’s Reports, the Committee identified some pertinent issues which were as follows: (1) The Committee expressed concern on the low rental yield generated from the asset portfolio valued at over $57 million. (2) While some were compensated by higher dividend provided by Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, the Government Printery and Stationery Department has been a non-performing entity. (3) The Committee noted that an independent external valuer conducted a valuation of all land vested into the company on 10 th February, 2017. The valuation was based on market value, however, land title spending was not included in the fair value assessment. (4) The Committee noted that Government grants were continuously issued to AFL from 2016 to 2019 to support its operations. (5) The Committee strongly suggests that AFL should work closely with relevant authorities to expedite the vesting of 10 pending land titles from Fiji Ports Limited and Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited. Finalising these transactions will enable AFL to fully integrate these assets into its portfolio to increase the company’s overall value. I would like to thank the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, honourable P. D. Kumar, the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, honourable A. Bia, and the Secretariat staff for their invaluable support in preparing this Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I have a list with me that has been supplied by the honourable Whips. Before I go straight to that, I would like to just allow this time for the undertaking of housekeeping matters. For the purpose of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
