<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT ON FIJI MEAT INDUSTRY BOARD 2018-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT ON FIJI MEAT INDUSTRY BOARD 2018-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. KIRAN. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That the Parliament debates the review report for the Fiji Meat Industry Board Annual Reports 2018 to 2022 which was tabled on 4 th September, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr:</span> Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Members of Parliament, I am honoured to present the review report of Fiji Meat Industry Board 2018 to 2022 Annual Reports. The Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB) was established under the Fiji Meat Industry Act 237 of 1970. In 1976, Suva Abattoir was established at Nasinu 9 miles to provide slaughtering services in the Central Division. The Suva property sits on 35.4 hectares of State land, the land has a 75-year Crown lease granted on 1st July, 1976. The Vuda Abattoir was established later at Vuda Point in 1983, it caters for the Western Division and sits on 7.35 hectares of Native land with a land tenure of 75 acres Native lease granted on 1st January, 1982. Pertinent issues identified by the Committee are as follows: • The Fiji Meat Industry Board incurred losses from 2018 to 2021 except in 2022 when it recorded a small profit of $108,134 This profit is largely attributed to a reduction in the number of employees. • The ongoing losses have been driven by low throughput and the rising cost of operation. • Currently the Abattoir is not working at full capacity due to decline in livestock numbers resulting in low number of livestock going to the abattoir. • The livestock numbers have steadily declined over the years. The decline poses a broader threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry. There are several challenges affecting FMIB, I will just mention a couple: • An urgent need for investment to modernise facilities to meet new requirements for food handling hygiene and security; and • A review of the Meat Act is urgently needed to address the current issues facing the meat industry. • The Board has $31.9 million worth of investment property, primarily consisting of land which is yielding no returns for the company. I would like to extend my appreciation to the Chairperson of the Fiji Meat Industry Board, Dr. Kenneth Cokanasiga, and his staff for the timely assistance in this inquiry. I would also like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced this Report: (1) Honourable Assistant Minister, Office of the Prime Minister – Chairperson; (2) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (3) Honourable Assistant Minister, Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways; and (4) Honourable A. Bia. I also thank the Secretariat for their invaluable support.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>2034 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I have just been given the list of speakers, four have been identified by both the Whips, and the batting will be led off by: (1) Honourable S. Nand; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprise and Veteran Affairs; (3) Honourable N. T. Tuinaceva; and (4) Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before the House. I thank the Members of the Standing Committee for their work on the Report. As the mover of the motion had already said, the Fiji Meat Industry Board was established in 1976 via under the Fiji Meat Industry Act 1970. In the Report, there are three main issues that has been identified: (1) Aging equipment and set up. (2) Lower throughput. The Abattoir, at the moment, is operating below 50 percent capacity. (3) Economic viability of the Abattoir. They have always recorded a loss, except 2022, and this was attributed to staff reduction. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that all three issues can be solved by vertical integration. Vertical integration refers to FMIB’s strategy of controlling multiple stages of sourcing, processing, marketing and distribution within the meat industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see any reason why Yaqara Pastoral Company and Fiji Meat Industry Board needs to operate under two separate entities, two different boards, two separate CEOs and two separate fully functional offices. This can be integrated to bring about efficiency in the system and there is no reason why both the entities cannot operate under one board and one CEO. For Fiji Meat Industry Board, vertical integration is possible in the following ways: (1) Supply Chain control – Fiji Meat Industry Board merges with Yaqara Pastoral Company to ensure consistent supply of animals. This helps in managing the cost, ensuring the quality and ensuring availability of animals for slaughter. This can be supplemented by the Government’s beef schemes which I understand should be a multiplication centres and distributed around the country. (2) Processing and Packaging – FMIB already has two abattoirs that can be upgraded with Government’s assistance and the money is saved by removing one set of overheads. The second is FMIB can get into value adding products, expanding production into sausages, cured meats and ready-to-cook cuts. This can diversify the income streams and enhance profitability of the organisation. FMIB already has an established distribution mechanism and this can be further enhanced to increase efficiency; and (3) Retail operations – I believe the last part of vertical integration is ensuring you meet your customers from farm to fork. FMIB can operate a retail butcher and operate their own butchers, allowing them to sell directly to the consumers and enhance profitability. (4) Waste management - FMIB already has a rendering plant. I am sure that with little</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2035 more investment, its efficiency can be enhanced. This can generate more income by selling the by-products of the rendering plant to the other industries. However, I have heard a lot of complaints from residents around that area of the foul smell. Probably they should start working on the foul smell coming out of the rendering plant and be eliminated somehow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits from the vertical integration or merging the three elements would be: (1) Cost control - we will be able to reduce the cost of all the various stages, ensuring profitability. (2) Better price to suppliers – the supplier farms can get a better price for the animal supplied to the abattoirs. (3) Market stability – by merging with Yaqara Pastoral Company, FMIB can stabilise operations against market fluctuations. (4) Customer trust - direct involvement in all stages of production, FMIB can build the consumer-supplier trust. (5) Ensure quality - greater quality control in the supply chain can improve the quality and safety of the meat products. Currently most of the animals going through the abattoirs are mostly culled animals from the cane belt areas or culled animals from the dairy farms. Because of that, FMIB fails to supply quality that the consumers frequently look for or demand. In the tourism sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a huge demand of premium cuts and most of it is supplied through imported meat. If you are not able to maintain that quality and supply, we will be able to hit the hotel industry. This industry wants two things: quality and consistency, and that is where we fail. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, doing this needs commitment from the industry, and more specifically from the Government. It requires capital investment and expanding operation requires significant investment of resources. It also requires investment in training so that you can cross-train staff in all aspects, from rearing, processing and selling. It will also require a significant investment in enterprise and management software, so that it is easier to maintain all stages of the process. The most important one, it requires amendments to the legislation to ensure that both the entities can operate under one umbrella. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe vertical integration will be able to solve most of the issues identified in this Report. If this Government is interested in ensuring sustainability of FMIB and the meat industry in Fiji, I am sure it will act sooner than later. With those words, I support the motion before the House. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Chairperson for presenting the Report and honourable Sachida Nand for his contribution. I also thank all the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for the work they have put in, in compiling this Report. As I have done with the various reports dealt with previously, as line Minister for Public Enterprises, I will go straight into the recommendations. I agree with what the honourable Sachida Nand had said. He is sure and I am committed that the recommendations will be carried out by the FMIB. Recommendation 1 The Committee commends FMIB for developing its 5-year Strategic Plan.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>2036 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 The preparation of the five-year strategic plan from 2024 to 2028 was launched in 2021. While the pandemic delayed the progress on the development of the plan, FMIB’s five-year strategic plan was successfully completed in 2023. Various stakeholders had also been consulted throughout the drafting process including the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, private sector and farmers involved in the livestock industry for their feedback on the plan. Mr. Speaker, as the honourable Nand had alluded to, consistent and quality supply of animals will continue to be a problem with FMIB when we rely on hobby livestock farmers. The strategic plan focuses on four important things including business model and commercial sustainability, legal framework and governance, aged facilities and suitability of location and quality standards of people and processes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have right now a group of young men and women who have gone to New Zealand and Australia and many of them work in meat industries. I am sure that when they come back, if there are opportunity available for them to be employed in the Fiji Meat Industry, they would perform very well and would raise the quality of workmanship in those facilities. Recommendation 2 That, Fiji Meat Industry Board include a performance matrix aligned with the KPIs in all future annual reports to justify budgetary allocations, demonstrate accountability and ensure a thorough and transparent assessment of its performance. The Committee’s recommendation is noted. It should also be noted that while FMIB is collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture in terms of increasing supply of animals to its abattoirs, it does not have direct control over the said supply. In view of these external factors hindering FMIB’s performance may not be accurately reflected in the performance matrix. That being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should also be noted that FMIB’s recent annual reports particularly the 2021 – 2022 Report comprise of not only the background and financial statements of the entirety of the entity, but also has specific sections on its finances, its operations, quality assurance, its achievements and its challenges, human resources and future plans. The finance section of the Annual Report includes a high level comparative financial analysis between the current and prior financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FMIB will take into consideration the Committee’s recommendation and determine the best method to enhance accountable and transparent reporting of its performance in its future annual reports. Recommendation 3 That, Fiji Meat Industry Board should report on relevant SDGs in its annual reports as required by the Parliament, to align with Fiji’s commitment to the international goals. The Committee’s recommendation is noted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Meat Industry Board recognizes the importance of environmental sustainability and adopts values that promote responsible resource-use waste reduction, energy efficiency and eco-friendly practices. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Meat Industry Board quality assurance team monitors environmental related issues and assist in addressing the same, so that Fiji Meat Industry Board is operating in a more environmentally friendly manner. Fiji Meats Industry Board had also</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2037 concentrated its efforts in modernizing its abattoirs to move towards more cost efficient and environmentally friendly operations. Recommendation 4 The Committee recommends the Review of the FMIB pricing strategy that is needed to mitigate ongoing losses. Additionally operational efficiency should be explored to reduce costs without compromising service quality. That recommendation is noted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with the Fiji Meat Industry Act of 1969, the Minister for Agriculture may prescribe levies or charges in respect of the slaughtering of animals. Therefore, FMIB slaughter fees are regulated, and the entity does not have arbitrary control over its fees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FMIB slaughter fees were last reviewed and increased in November 2023, after 18 years. Therefore, FMIB pricing has increased but the impact will be seen in the 2024 financial year. Recommendation 5 The Committee recommends addressing the underutilisation of the Abattoir as mentioned by the honourable Nand. It is recommended that FMIB, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, particularly with the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, implement strategies to increase livestock numbers. This includes providing targeted support to farmers to boost livestock production to not only break even, but to make profits and to make FMIB self-sufficient. That recommendation is also noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Ministry of Agriculture and FMIB are jointly working to identify solutions for the decrease in supply of livestock. In regard to current initiatives employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry is providing assistance to farmers around Fiji in terms of breed research, pasture management and providing grants for fencing kit support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that many, many years ago, we copra producers used to have assistance. But mostly from our lavo musu ni iTaukei, where we would put our deduction or the funds into the iTaukei Affairs. I do not know whether they can continue to do that, but many of the coconut growers we have in the islands can easily be developed with pasture grown to produce quality animals for the abattoirs. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the Review Report for the Fiji Meat Industry Board 2018-2022 Annual Reports. I want to begin by thanking the Committee for putting the Report together and their ability to critically analyse and identify the issues at the Fiji Meat Industry Board, is commendable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noted that, honourable Nand and the honourable Prime Minister has covered most of the items highlighted in the recommendations and in the findings. I will therefore touch on one or two parts of the investigation and some recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost we must acknowledge that FMIB has faced significant financial difficulties, incurring losses from 2018 to 2021 with only a small profit recorded in 2022 due to what the Report stated as workforce reductions. The core issues of low through put and high operating costs remain consistent challenges that we must confront head on. Secondly, the underutilisation of our abattoir is alarming. This decline is largely driven by</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>2038 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 decreasing livestock numbers compounded by an increase in diseases like tuberculosis and brucellosis, as well as the decline in the sugarcane farmers engaging in livestock rearing. The poor pasture management and rising feed costs further complicates this issue. The truth is, if we do not act swiftly, we risk undermining our meat industries viability. Additionally, the facilities require urgent modernisation to meet contemporary food handling and hygiene and security standards. It is unacceptable that our infrastructure lags behind current requirements and we must prioritise upgrading these facilities to ensure safe and efficient operations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, we cannot look or overlook the need for comprehensive review of the Meat Industry Act. The legislation must be updated to address the ‘my right’ challenges facing the industry today. So, without this critical step, we will continue to hinder progress and innovation. Cooperation is essential, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Currently, the partnership between FMIB and the Ministry of Agriculture, according to the Report is not functioning effectively. We must foster better cooperation, not just with the Ministry but also with stakeholders like Yaqara Pastoral to announce livestock production and maximise the abattoirs operational capacity. To that end Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly support the Committee’s recommendations which include: (1) FMIB must review rising strategies and explore operational efficiencies to ensure financial stability. FMIB must get back to its feet and explore ways and means to grow in its financial capacity. (2) Collaboration with stakeholders is crucial to increase livestock supplies to the abattoir which is not operating to its full capacity at the moment. The equation is simple, no livestock, no abattoir work. (3) The relocating and modernisation facilities will enable FMIB to meet food hygiene and safety standards. The market flavour and attraction depends on standards offered by FMIB. (4) A thorough review of the Meat Act is essential to address the current challenges we face. The principle is clear, if products and its quality are to be enhanced, then processes and systems demands a review. Obviously, in this case, the Act must go back on the table for review. (5) We must put to an end bush slaughter practices which compromise meat safety and quality. It is a sensitive issue to some level but if we are serious about standards and quality, we must take immediate and prompt action on this. (6) Revising the farmers payment process to include offer way is a necessary step towards fairness and transparency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, merging the operations of FMIB and Yaqara Pastoral and make them report to the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways can create a more cohesive strategy for livestock production. FMIB will lead to reliable and consistent livestock supply, something they can manage and control and that is only possible on the involvement of the Ministry of Agriculture. Lastly, introducing a meat grading system will enhance the quality and marketability of meat products in Fiji. To conclude Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FMIB is at a crossroad. The decisions we make today will shape the future of our meat industry and livelihoods of countless farmers. I urge each of you honourable Members to prioritise these recommendations and work collaboratively to revitalise the FMIB and secure a prosperous future for Fiji Meats Industry. With all that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. The floor is yours.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2039 HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Standing Committee for the analysis of those reports from 2018 to 2022. All in all, the major challenge across our livestock numbers, formerly slaughtered was the COVID-19 pandemic. Cattle numbers decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions of movement, however this had gradually improved, and it is better than pre-COVID-19 days. For pigs, the numbers drastically reduced due to the closure of hotels, high-end restaurant and outlets during COVID-19. The breeding stock in commercial farms also reduced and some farms ceased their operations. Breeding stock takes time, we expect high numbers now. For goats, it increased in number, having been the impact of government assistance where farmers were also encouraged to supply formerly to the abattoir. Sheep hazard made challenges during COVID-19 due to restrictions of movement where farmers held on to their stock however, the average rate of animals supplied has increased. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through government consistent support, farmers have recovered and bounced back stronger, contributing to high production levels. Programmes planned in the 2023- 2024 financial year and now in the 2024-2025 financial year has targeted to boost the livestock sector and ensure that we utilise the capacity of our abattoirs. There is a list of programmes that is currently being implemented by the Ministry, notable is the Beef Breeding Programme which is $1.04 million; the Beef Revitalisation Programme of $1.5 million; and the upgrade of the Nasinu and Vuda abattoir with an allocation of $400,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, large scale intensive technology is a proposed solution that enables farmers to raise up by numbers and quality to the abattoirs. The rapid multiplication that is currently underway by the Ministry through artificial insemination and embryo transfer will contribute to the improvement in the throughput to the abattoir over the next few years. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the experiences that we have gone through is the failure of farmers to re-invest into their operations locally. This has been a long-standing issue where we have tried to encourage our local livestock, even dairy farmers to re-invest into their operations, but very little has been done. I think the offer of assistance year in, year out by the Ministry, farmers are sort of getting used to being assisted all the time. But then the commitment must come from the farmers themselves, from the industry themselves to see that they re-invest into their farming operations before government comes in with its assistance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are upgrading the abattoir facilities, plans and consultations are also underway between government and stakeholders on the relocation of the Nakasi abattoir given the expanding residential and business lots in the area. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament, and I thank you for the opportunity. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that the Fiji Meats Industry Board (FMIB) is a crucial entity for the value chain of livestock and availability of quality meat for our consumers. I thank the honourable Minister for sharing in-depth, the processes in place for improving the work of FMIB, and I would like to thank all honourable Members who have contributed. We hope that the Board will take this into consideration, and we look forward to the implementation of the recommendations. With that, I thank you, Mr. speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>2040 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 Report.
