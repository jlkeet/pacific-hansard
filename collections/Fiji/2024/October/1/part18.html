<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –INVESTMENT FIJI 2019-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – INVESTMENT FIJI 2019-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Investment Fiji Annual Report 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 which was tabled on 5 th September 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I am honoured to present the overview of the Review Report for Investment Fiji Annual Reports 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Investment Fiji was established in 1980 under the Economic Development Board Act Number 11. It serves as Fiji’s Trade and Investment Promotion Agency, with the primary goal of promoting, stimulating and facilitating economic development in the country. The Committee acknowledges positive developments in the Reports and identified areas that require improvement. The Committee commends Investment Fiji for successfully developing a 3-Year Strategic Plan, that aligns with its new role, as outlined in the new Investment Fiji Act 2022 passed on 7 th April, 2022. The Committee expressed its concern that the Annual Reports did not contain any performance matrix alignment with the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), making it difficult to thoroughly assess the performance of Investment Fiji. However, when requested, Investment Fiji did provide the performance matrix which could have been included in the Report from the outset. The Committee also noted that Investment Fiji did not report on the relevant Sustainable Development Goals, which is a mandatory requirement for all Annual Reports presented to Parliament. While the Committee recognizes the progress made in specific activities, such as the number of trade missions and investment promotions conducted, the Report lacks detailed information on the level of interest these activities generated and how these interests, if any, translated into actual investment. The Committee noted the importance of tangible data and reliable statistics relating to the operations of Investment Fiji, which hinders comprehensive evaluation. The Committee expresses concern about the failure to report on the expected targets verses actual achievements, which is necessary to justify the budget reallocations provided to Investment Fiji.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>The Committee observed that Recommendation 6 of the previous Committee Report on full disclosure of data and key information is not fully implemented. I wish to extend my appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer of Investment Fiji, Mr. Kamal Chetty, and his staff for their timely assistance in this inquiry on answering various questions raised by the Committee through face to face public hearing. I would also like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Members who were part of the team that produced this Report – • Hon. S. Tubuna - Chairperson; • Hon. P. D. Kumar; • Hon. T. N. Tunabuna; • Hon. A. Bia; and • Hon. P. Ravunawa. I also thank the Secretariat for their invaluable support in the preparation of this Report. Mr. Speaker, I thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list with me provided by the Whips. (1) Honourable F. S. Koya; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of External Trade, Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (3) Honourable V. Naupoto; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, because it is fairly late in the day, I will try and be short. In any event, Sir, I want to thank the Committee on the Report that has been tabled. In terms of the recommendations, at first glance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is fairly innocuous in terms of the recommendations that have been given, but there are a couple of things that stand out and need to be vented so as that we actually make it better in the next time that we are reporting. The Committee has actually reported on implementation and outcomes of the three-year strategic plan that Investment Fiji has, and it has to come through the Annual Report. I think we must also come to a realisation that this particular Report comes on the back of COVID-19. So very little activity and a lot may have gone on some things may have been missed. I take my hat off also to the team led by Mr. Chetty at Investment Fiji; very young team, they have done extremely well. We must always look at Investment Fiji as one of our premier most institution, Sir, because it is at the forefront of what we are trying to do in terms of Fiji being a premier investment destination. The minute it had turned into an investment promotion agency, there are certain things that we need to make sure that we keep a check on, and these reports are vital in terms of getting that done. I am grateful that the performance matrix was actually handed in and now they have learnt a lesson. It ought to have been given in the first place. In terms of SDGs, I think it is also every other institution has actually put in, whether they are compliant with SDGs and that is important to Government also as a whole and in Fiji we do that. I think Investment Fiji should ensure that actually that gets done in all the reports that we do. One of the most important things that we need to realise, Sir, is that one of the only tools that Investment Fiji has, is actually trade missions and investment promotions, et cetera that they do.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>2042 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 When they do that, because this is a taxpayers’ money, we need to ensure that we report back. There is the back to office report to find out how good it is, what has actually transpired, have we been able to ensure that it was effective, and all these activities need to be evaluated. With the information that is provided, it allows us to closely monitor what actually is good for us and what is not. When we do these missions, the data and the level of interest generated, et cetera needs to be quantified somewhere so that the Committees that look at it say, “well this is worthwhile, that is not worthwhile” and it can be openly discussed in Parliament. Having said all that, Sir, because it was post-COVID, I think they may have been a lot of budgetary restrictions that Investment Fiji had. I know the honourable Minister for Finance is not but I will plead with the Minister responsible that in order for Fiji to be promoting itself as a premier destination for investment purposes, I think the Minister may need to also see if we can actually get Investment Fiji more money to be able to do their activities that is designed to do. I know that previously it was a bit difficult because of COVID-19 but I think we are in a better and healthier position to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an investment promotion agency also, we need to be making sure that we are accountable for everything that we do, the trade missions are going overseas. Most recently, I think the honourable Minister took a mission up to North America which I understand was fairly successfully, but we would love to see the data on that at a later stage obviously. These are things that need to be included in the Report. Glaring amiss, as I said earlier was the misnomer one in terms of SDGs, it is an important tool. Mr. Speaker is always ensuring that we actually do that but in short, I think it is a fairly good report that actually come out, but I would urge the Government to see if we can give Investment Fiji a whole lot more dollars for it to be able to succeed and do what it does. It stands at the forefront, and I have been on these trade missions myself, just post-COVID especially with Expo 2020 and also out in Portugal with respect to the outsourcing industry. In terms of Government doing all that it can, in terms of diversification, this is the agency that needs to be empowered to be able to sell Fiji in terms of all that we need to do to become bigger and better. With those few words, I totally agree with the Report, and I wish the Investment Fiji team well. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide comments in terms of the debate on the Investment Fiji Annual Reports for 2019 to 2020 and 2021 to 2022. Firstly, Sir, as the Minister responsible, it is obvious that there was one year that was missed from the tabling which is the 2020 to 2021 reports. So, I will take that on myself to ensure that that is tabled in-house as quickly as possible, to ensure that we keep in train with the tabling of reports in a timely manner but also make sure in a complete sense as well. I thank the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for providing the consolidated report after conducting a review of the relevant Annual Reports. I think stepping back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just in terms of the economic climate that we are currently facing, you would have heard the remarks of the honourable Gavoka about the revision upwards of the economic growth in the country. It is now at 3.4 percent which is very positive. I suspect if we keep on doing what we are doing, we probably might go to 4 percent, but certainly into next year, all going well, I am expecting a much stronger economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also on the back of a very strong investment pipeline, and it is a credit to Investment Fiji in terms of following up on investments. As has been mentioned in the House, the Fijian pipeline is now at $6 billion, and there are more opportunities coming at us. It is about 185 projects in total and what the other side of the House will start seeing is a roll out of these projects.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 2043 The Sofitel Vatutalei Project has started already, they are now starting to build up, so that will create a lot of momentum. There is also another hotel that is going to be announced shortly Sir, in the West. These are the types of projects that are coming at us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and augurs well for the economy, augurs well for the country and of course, I do not need to talk about the Google entry, I do not need to talk about commercial agriculture ventures of Fiji Water. These are type of diversification initiatives that are coming through Investment Fiji. In terms of the Reports themselves, I think it is fair to say that over this period there was a transition in Investment Fiji and that probably explains why there was a bit of a paucity of information apart from COVID-19 as eloquently articulated by the honourable Koya. There was also the fact that they were, credit to FijiFirst, we were transitioning Investment Fiji from being a regulatory agency, in other words, more policing focussed, to an investment promotion agency. That happened on 1 st August, 2022, and I am certain that going forward, the reports that will come from Investment Fiji will be a lot more comprehensive and detailed in terms of the information that was lacking from the Reports that were mentioned. Mr. Speaker, in terms of what the Committee alluded to regarding trade missions, understanding what interest was there in terms of investments, you would have heard me updating the House about the hundreds of millions that have been generating through the trade missions. That will actually find its way into the reports hopefully, Mr. Speaker so that we get a bit more granularity in terms of what we actually see in terms of the reporting from Investment Fiji. I also concur with the reporting on SDGs and that was a fair comment. I know that the Chief Executive and his team will actually ensure that the future reports actually do have SDGs mentioned. One of the things that I thought I would just share with the House as well, some of the positive changes that we brought into being. When we started, there was something called the Investment Facilitation Committee that was in existence, but perhaps not operating fully fledged and this, Sir, is a conglomeration of all the agencies that are important for investment. We are now meeting at least at the minimum once every two months, it is chaired by either myself or the Permanent Secretary. What we are doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is actually drilling down on key investment opportunities and try to unlock bottlenecks. We are doing this, Sir, because right now as we know, we are still in the process of trying to improve the ease of doing business in Fiji. So, this is being done and we are starting to see a lot of good results from it, a lot of positive comments. Everyone is on the same page, from the FRA, to EFL, to FRCS. We are all in the same room together, so there is the ability to resolve a lot of issues regarding investment. I have given the Investment Facilitation Committee a challenge, Sir, we will get to a stage and I am hoping that the Committee will no longer have to meet because we will have a fully digitised systems and so the need to actually have committee meetings to try and fix things will ultimately go away. That is kind of where we headed, Sir, in terms of Investment Fiji and its performance. Right now, there is a lot of work going on with Tourism Fiji. As we know tourism in our country is very hot at the moment and there is a lot of hotel projects that are on the cusp of going to breaking ground. You will see the honourable Prime Minister getting very busy with some of the openings; one in Nadi very shortly. These are the types of opportunities that are there. Google is on its way to Fiji, Sir, and there will be some exciting announcements later this year. These are the types of opportunities that we are starting to unlock through Investment Fiji and the future, Sir, for the country from an economic perspective, if I do say so myself is rather bright and with the right disciplines, we continue with the focus that we are focusing on, there are some very good times ahead.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>2044 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 Finally, Sir, for the first time in the country, the Prime Minister’s Business Awards that will be done annually, we will have a category for the iTaukei Provincial Councils; first time. What does that mean, Sir? There is a pivot to ensure that over the next few years, the iTaukei economy starts to grow. If we unlock that potential, Sir, our country will grow in leaps and bounds. We own the resources; we just need to match that up with the right capital mix and we will be on our way. There is a lot of positive things happening, Sir, I congratulate Investment Fiji for their reports, we do note that there are some things that they need to do better, which I will ensure as their line Minister that are done, but I thank the Committee once again for the Report and I fully support the motion before the House. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I very briefly contribute to the debate, I think few minutes ago our baby Flying Fijians, our Under 18 have won their second game against the Australian Under 18. Certainly, congratulations to them. I thank the Committee for the Report, and I certainly concur with the sentiments that has been expressed already. Yes, Investment Fiji is an important institution for Fiji. I had the honour to Chair it for two years when it was the Fiji Trade and Investment Bureau, I think it was called then. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just would like to look at the issue of the labour force and the correlation connection that the labour force has with, trying to get companies and people to come and invest into the country. Reading through the review Report, trying to find that connection, we have been talking about brain drain in this Camber in past sittings, and it is a reality that the fluidity and movement of our mobile labour force is really on the go. It is important for Investment Fiji as they go out and try and attract investors to come to Fiji, to ensure that they coordinate with all the other agencies that are watching this movement of the labour force, to ensure that when they come to Fiji to invest, they are not faced with the shortage of labour where they do not have the exact skill sets that they would love to employ in order to set up their business in Fiji. It is just a minor point or perhaps a major point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I would like to add to this debate. I thank the Committee for the Report and certainly some very worthwhile recommendations for the Ministry in the Report. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my contribution to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report of Investment Fiji Annual Report 2019-2020 and 2021-2022. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to acknowledge the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for its deliberation on the Annual Reports. As an investment arm of Government, Investment Fiji plays an extremely critical role in the health of our economy. No matter what sector we stand to represent in this august House, we recognise the imperative of having a driving body that not only attracts interests from potential investors but ensures that they are realised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the weekend at the Fiji Tourism Convention, the CEO of Investment Fiji highlighted that Investment Fiji is supporting 185 projects at the moment; 83 are in construction, 35 in trade development and 67 in conceptual stages. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications noted, because they are at a very young stage, their realisation on the ground too varies. I ask everyone for their support and ensure the completion of all these projects.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 2045 Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may, let me highlight some of the opportunities and issues in tourism, relative to investments. We all know that tourism is one of the leading sectors, and although driven by accommodation, it is a mix with other tourism-related offerings - retirement villages, medical tourism, sports tourism and glamping. These are excellent opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 45 projects that once realised, will bring in 3,500 rooms. Some of these are already under construction. With Fiji Airways now expanding rapidly, this is very much welcomed. As you know, Mr. Speaker, there is a mismatch between the Airline inventory in terms of number of seats and the ground inventory in terms of rooms - hotel beds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Fiji Tourism Convention, we noted that, firstly, for domestic investors, one of the hardest things is to get approvals on investment. However, Investment Fiji’s role now as an investment promotion agency and the establishment of the Investment Facilitation Committee, I know has helped a lot in navigating bottlenecks. Also, the Sub-Committee is doing exceptionally well in these areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the Convention, there was the usual concern about immigration, and the RESET Sub-Committee is doing quite a great job on this. And the numbers that was shared by the Chairman of the RESET Sub-Committee, kind of, blown us away. I do not remember the exact number, but it was something like 800 applicants or work permits almost every month. When you look at figures like that and the backlog that we have which has improved now, you just begin to wonder, something must be happening in this country that is attracting all these applications. As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has indicated, the economy is growing very, very well, Mr. Speaker, and the 3.4 could actually become much higher come the end of the year. So, when you see all those applicants for work permits, it is a good sign - it is positive for the country. Secondly, land and resource owners want to play a great role, calling for equity partnerships and the Coalition Government has a range of facilities to encourage this. This came out very strongly during the Convention, Mr. Speaker, the resource owners want to play a part in equity’s involvement in tourism. Bodies such as the Fiji Indigenous Business Council (FIBC) and the Resource Owners Council, play a big role in facilitating meaningful partnerships. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this body is being revived under the Coalition Government. You may recall the FIBC used to be a very robust body back in those days and it was badly impacted over the last couple of years, reducing the membership quite drastically. Advocacy is critical to resource owners who really want to invest in the tourism industry, and they need to be industry ready. We will be preparing them, as many have the aspiration but not the know-how. There is a lot of interest from resource-owners. It was quite welcomed to see the number of resource owners who participated in the Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The need for investment in supporting infrastructure. As we build more rooms, the pressure on other sectors - infrastructure and utilities, increases. Stakeholders raise the supply chain issue and cost remains a challenge for outer islands and remote areas. In agriculture, I have asked my colleague, the honourable Minister for Agriculture, for more intense involvement in tourism. We have about a million visitors forecasted to arrive this year, and in the future years, so we need to feed these million visitors, and we can do that from local producers.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>2046 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 Limitation in investment was another matter. Concerns were raised on whether we should allow for 300 room hotels in the outer islands. I think some people are concerned about building resorts in the outer islands, but to combat such questions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the ability of tourism to reverse the migration from the outer islands to the urban areas. As we know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been publicly noted that some islanders are now street dwellers and most live as squatters in informal settlements, creating all sorts of social challenges. Tourism is largely rural based, and those idyllic islands can be home to some well-planned exotic resorts. Such developments can provide economic opportunities for islanders who will visit the cities only to shop and the likes, instead of relocating wholesale as we currently see today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had an international guest speaker from SCAF Advisory, a Canadian company, who shared, based on their research, tourism and hotel investors having a great deal of choice in which destination they will risk their capital. But Fiji, is doing well, attracting investors as we see today. A phenomenon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he shared with us was the Saudi Arabia phenomena. Saudi Tourism is investing up to trillions in the tourism industry, effectively pulling many investors away from other parts of the world into Saudi Arabia. This Canadian gentleman said even in Canada, they feel this. Such is the impact of the trillions that the Saudis are spending on their tourism. For those who play golf will know that now Saudi Golf, has virtually taken over from other established golfing fraternity worldwide. If you watch boxing, most of the big bouts now are staged in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Such is the pull of Saudi Arabia in developing its tourism and sports. So, it is a phenomenon that we need to understand. It could play a big role. It could impact on the way investors move around the region also. ` I concur with the Committee’s findings on ensuring we set concrete KPIs and continuously report on our performance. Every statutory body should, but you should also recognise the fast-paced environment we are in, and the rigid matrix may not capture all forms of success. So, the road ahead is quite long. Now, I would like to conclude by thanking the Investment Fiji’s Chairperson, Ms. Jenny Seeto, and CEO, Mr. Kamal Chetty, for their continued efforts in positioning us as an investment destination of choice. Thank you, once again, to the Committee for your deliberations. I am certain under my colleague, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications’ guidance, that Investment Fiji will continue to progress as an agency so critical for Fiji. Thank you and vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been well expressed how important Investment Fiji is to the economic growth. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his commitment to improving, not only the Annual Report, but ensuring that Investment Fiji is robust. I would also like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation also for sharing the different opportunities that lay out there and specifically in tourism. I would like to thank other honourable Members for their contributions, and I hope that</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024 C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports 2047 Investment Fiji will take this into account, and we look forward to Investment Fiji taking these recommendations on board. With that, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the items listed in today’s Sitting. I thank you all for your contributions.
