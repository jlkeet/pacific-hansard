<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER:</span> – Honourable members, this is the first oral question for today and I have approved the request from the Government Whip for Oral Question No. 228/2024 to be asked on Thursday. (Question No. 228/2024 deferred) On the second Oral Question for today, honourable Members, please, take note that Oral Question No. 229/2024 has been adequately addressed through Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister earlier today, even though the honourable Prime Minister has insisted that the question continue.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2012</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 At the same time, I would like to bring to your notice, honourable Members, that I will be very strict next time around. Once the author of the question is not present, then that question lapses. So, we are kind of going back to the old ways when we deal with those who are not present, and they have questions under their name to be asked. So, for this one here, the honourable Prime Minister has stated or has alluded in his Statement that he would like to see that this question is raised. So, that is your question, honourable Tunabuna.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker Sir, I would like to withdraw my question.</p><p>(Question No. 229/2024 withdrawn) Grants for Persons with Disabilities (Question No. 230/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU J.B:</span> NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform Parliament as to the types of grants provided to organisations for persons with disability? HON. L. D. TABUYA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to wish all Members a Happy Pinktober Month. As we raise awareness on the issue of breast cancer, I would like to invite all honourable Ministers and ministerial departments and Opposition Chambers as well to host their morning tea to raise funds for the Fiji Cancer Society, as is usual practice during the month of October. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question regarding the types of grants provided to organisations for persons with disability. I give credit to the former FijiFirst Government for initiating the grants to organisations for persons with disabilities in 2017, during a face-to-face budget consultation organised by the then Ministry of Economy that was done in Lautoka and Suva and where the organisations requested for grants to help with operations and capital purchases from the Government. That request was approved in the same financial year and $1.1 million was allocated for the grant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government continues to fund organisations for persons with disabilities, but over the years, due to the low utilisation as a result of various things including lack of audited reports and acquittals, as well as deregistration issues, the fund has been reduced to $300,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of this grant, Government tries to provide capacity building on the financial requirements of the grant, and at the same time, ensuring that these organisations are assisted, and we have had good technical assistance from the Pacific Disability Forum, as well as our donor and development partners. So, this is provided to these organisations who are the recipients of the grant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, we conduct an analysis on those that need this grant and so recipients are chosen through the usual process. We do want to acknowledge our core partners, such as DFAT, UNFPA, AUSFACILITY, MFAT, UNICEF and others, to name a few. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this measure is a priority area for the Ministry. Now, while we look after the human resources and operating costs for these organisations, the development partners help to fund their other various activities.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2013 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had alluded earlier about the need for a continued capacity building for these organisations to account back and to acquit on what they use, as well as the need to generally have more activities by these organisations for our people with disabilities and more engagement in the community, we encourage the SMEs in the hope that this will improve, which would mean more funding requests and more funding allocated in the budget for these organisations. But we are committed, Sir, as a Ministry to attend to the needs of our disability service providers, as well as our persons with disabilities, to improve social inclusion and access to these services. Thank you, Sir. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a very simple question to the honourable Minister for Women; for future developments, how is your Ministry promoting and ensuring disability inclusive infrastructure? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question. As we look across the Ministries and their programmes, there is certainly a need for disability mainstreaming in other Ministries. I am happy to share in this Parliament that even programmes are now moving towards disability inclusion, including the Ministry of Housing, where they currently have a budgetary allocation for disability retrofitting. So, retrofitting of housing for people with disabilities. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what they are committing to in moving forward as we are looking at the affordable housing scheme for low-income earners, is also to have allocation for people living with disabilities, especially accessibility on the bottom floor, to ensure that across development of projects, that there are disability inclusive access. As far as working with the Town Councils and City Councils, there is also an opportunity in terms of disability parking, as well as making our restaurants and buildings to conform to a building code which needs disability access as well, and that is something that we are also working on with the line Ministry. We hope that that will be realised. Of course, it takes budget allocations, but there is a commitment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Coalition Government to ensure that there is disability inclusion and mainstreaming across the Ministries. Our Ministry is committed also. As we deal with people with disabilities, hopefully, there is a department under the Ministry dedicated towards people living with disabilities which is also our commitment under the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, so we hope to move towards that as well. MR. SPEAKER. – Thank you. I have a question, is it already part of the building code?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> There should be provisions made for people that are suffering from some kind of disability, for example, wheelchairs and all that. HON. L. D. TABUYA - Yes, as I understand it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is part of the building code. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for what has already been mentioned about the allowances that people with disabilities are receiving. My question is, are people with disabilities receiving the same allowance or it depends on the type of disability that they have? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe the question is related. This is about our people with disabilities receiving the disability allowance under Social Protection. Yes, there are certain disabilities that are certified by doctors, that are accepted by the Ministry. It is not all disabilities, but certainly the ones where we receive from a doctor a certificate, that qualifies them to</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2014</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 to receive disability allowance. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her responses. We want to ensure that no one is left behind and, particularly, the physically challenged are not deprived of such assistance. My question is on data. Do we have data that captures those who come under your list? And if so, how current is it? The other part to the question is, what would you expect from us and stakeholders in order to assist in this regard? I ask this question because as a former Commissioner, we would go around and they would ask for wheelchairs, crutches, et cetera. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition. Yes, data is always important, as we formulate policies, for our people living with disabilities. I want to acknowledge the support of DFAT in assisting the National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) in collecting data, so that is what they are currently undertaking. The difficulty they are facing is, of course, accessing data from Ministries and Departments, as well as the Fiji Bureau of Statistics. We have constantly been reminded by our honourable Prime Minister that we should be able to access data across Ministries, that we do not necessarily need an MOU to be receiving data from each other. I think that this is something that we trying to improve on in terms of sharing data across Ministries. But, as far as going outside to a stakeholder, like NCPD, there is still that process they need to follow in order to access the data, but DFAT in assisting NCPD has been very helpful. Now, we are also using this data to formulate our National Disability Policy, which is in draft form at the moment, so it is informing that Policy which is yet to come to Cabinet. We are finalising that as well because there were some issues that we had as a Ministry towards reviewing the Policy. I thank Dr. Helen Tavola, who is the consultant from DFAT and has been spearheading that, working with NCPD, but the collection of data is crucial to formulating the Policy, so that certainly helps us in our work. As far as the data within the Ministry’s database, as you know, we are digitising our database but, yes, there is still the need to be able to have proper data when it comes to informing our policies. We hope that with this National Disability Policy, which will be evidence-based data inform, then we will be able to have that data. We also hope that across the Ministries, things like village profiling, now we are doing informal settlement profiling, that there will also be a collection of that data in the process. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Honourable Minister, it is really hard to believe that the budget allocated for the disability-related NGOs has reduced from $1.1 million to $300,000, when you take into consideration the population of disabled people have increased due to NCDs. My question is, what are you doing about that? People do need help, the number is going up, funding has come down, so how are we providing this assistance? Are we creating enough awareness to the disability organisations that this is where the fund is, this is what the criteria is, and this is how you can access? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Yes, the allocation has come down, as I explained. It is dependent on the utilisation as well as reporting back, so that is something we need to build capacity on. One of the issues we face with our disability recipients is the increasing demand for assistive devices and retrofitting of their homes to enable them to move around in their homes. It is usually bathroom fittings which is very susceptible to slipping and you can have injuries, as well as ramps and walkways to access their homes back and forth.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2015 In villages, it is difficult to get around in a wheelchair, so the need for more footpaths, so disability access is certainly something that can be done across the Ministries. The allocation for disability housing for the need to retrofit that does not sit within our Ministry. It sits within the Ministry of Local Government and Housing. Yes, I believe they could certainly do with more funds because of the increasing demand for the need to retrofit housing. I thank Public Rental Board who have now allocated their bottom flats for disability access, and they have actually put on Ramps, as well as easy access, and this is from your Government taking these initiatives. This is really important as we move forward for our people with disabilities. Of course, the issue with transport - moving around in buses, we still have buses that are not disability friendly, even if they make the choice, it is difficult for them. Again, we need to keep talking to our bus operators to bring in disability friendly buses, it is a cost for them. We are still trying to sort the e-ticketing system, but I believe it is work in progress and it is for the Ministry to continue to advocate and speak to our line Ministries and stakeholders to assist our people with disability. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we move on to the fourth Oral Question for today. I understand that the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, I do not know whether he forgot or got stuck during his visit to the United States. So, that question has now lapsed because he is not present. (Question No. 231/2024 terminated) Budget Utilisation - Coastal Erosion Protection (Question No. 232/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B:</span> SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament on the work that has been undertaken to utilise the $1.5 million allocation for Coastal Erosion Protection in the 2023–2024 financial year? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question regarding the utilisation of the $1.5 million allocation for Coastal Erosion Protection in the 2023-2024 financial year. Several key project locations were identified under this allocation to mitigate the impacts of coastal erosion and protect vulnerable communities from the threats posed by rising sea levels and erosion. Coastal erosion protection works are essential for ensuring the safety and resilience of our coastal communities. The allocation and budget for these initiatives in the 2023-2024 financial year were as follows: (1) Salevukoso Village in Macuata- $200,000; (2) Tubou Hospital in Lakeba, Lau - $240,000; (3) Ovea Village, Bau, Tailevu - $750,000; (4) Nawaisomo Village, Beqa - $200,000; and (5) In-house Nature Based Projects - $110,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all projects were mandated to follow a transparent and competitive tender process in compliance with Government’s financial regulations, thereby, ensuring accountability and</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2016</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 effective governance. Evaluation for tenders were carried out for coastal erosion protection works that was required to safeguard the Tubou Hospital in Lakeba with 150 metres of coastal protection works. In Nawaisomo Village in Beqa, it was 310 metres. Unfortunately, the tender for Salevukoso Village in Macuata that requires 200 metres of work was withdrawn as the bid substantially surpassed the engineer’s financial estimate as to the cost of the lowest bid which was 20 percent more. Plans are in place to re-tender that project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ovea Village project in Tailevu was advertised for a tender, the contract was awarded in the third quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year, following a contract duration of six months. Construction commenced in 2023 and is expected to extend into the 2024-2025 dinancial year. This involves 470 metres of erosion protection works for Ovea Village. This should be completed by the end of this month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of $110,000 for the in-house nature-based projects was designated specifically for the procurement of construction materials intended for nature-based seawalls located in Navunievu Village in Bua, where 450 metres of coastal erosion protection works have been completed and in Namatakula Village, Nadroga, where 100 metres out of the 400 metres of coastal protection works have been completed. These initiatives are designed to offer sustainable low impact coastal protection by utilising local materials and environmentally friendly technologies, thereby, strengthening the resilience of these communities against coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an additional support and funding of $1.7 million from the Kiwa Initiative through the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways which has identified six sites for nature-based solution seawalls, and they are as follows: • Navolau in Ra - 400 metres of seawall; • Navola Village, Nadroga – 450 metres of seawall; • Somosomo Village, Taveuni - 425 metres of seawall; • Nakawaga Village, Mali Island, Macuata - 420 metres of seawall; • Ligaulevu Village - 200 metres of seawall; and • Vesi Village – 150 metres. The nature-based seawalls in Navolau, Navola in Nadroga and Somosomo in Taveuni are anticipated to begin this month. The support of the Kiwa Initiative through IUCN is much appreciated, and it takes a shorter process before the work can start on the ground. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite our diligent efforts, the delays encountered in the tender approval processes resulted in the Ministry’s inability to execute all the coastal protection works for the 2023- 2024 financial year. This will be completed in the current financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the delays, the Ministry was compelled to re-evaluate its intervention plans and redeployed a portion of the budget to improve the utilization of funds for the coastal erosion protection works for the 2023-2024 financial year. As a result of this redeployment of funds, $329,000 was allocated for the reinstatement of the Drainage Boards for the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. The funds were allocated to set up office space, recruit staff, equipment purchase, vehicle and selected machinery, as well as for the maintenance of approved drainage schemes. Some of these activities will commence in this financial year.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2017 Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the coastal erosion protection project experienced setbacks, the redeployment of funds effectively addressed other critical needs for the Waterways Division during the last financial year. In conclusion, the Ministry is steadfast in its dedication to advancing the coastal erosion protection activities and is working closely with the Government Tender Board and the Ministry of Finance to accelerate the approval processes in this financial year. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for the response and the work undertaken as well. This is very critical for us in terms of our adaptation and resilience programmes. The honourable Prime Minister, this morning, talked about our Foreign Policy White Paper and one of the key elements within that is our bilateral and multilateral connections. I am interested honourable Minister in the costings that you may, I hope, already have for the other projects. Sir, COP29 is a finance COP, and it is expected of, particularly, small island countries to come up with their plans. Has there been scoping done on how many or all the projects that you have? Unfortunately, I did not include riverbank protection. If you can highlight to the House because this is very important for the protection of our people and, particularly, linking up to COP29 - the finance COP? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for raising that point. For coastal protection works, we have done scoping for 156 sites, that is, 80 sites in the Central Division, 29 sites in the Western Division, 30 sites in the Northern Division and 58 sites in the Eastern Division. The total cost comes to around $100 million. For watershed management, we have identified eight sites; seven in Ba and one in Nadi. Those eight sites, the scoping we have come up with amounts to $24 million. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also the dredging of our major rivers, drainage and the flood protection which we have already done. All in all, the total cost would be about $464.5 million. Sustainable Water Management Practices (Question No. 233/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.S:</span> QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament on the measures being undertaken by the Ministry to ensure the implementation of sustainable water management practices among farmers, particularly, with the increasing impacts of climate change? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The increasing impacts of climate change continue to challenge agriculture production and food system in Fiji. Sustainable Water Management is a concept with deep historical roots, having been practised by our ancestors over time. It has been refined and developed into contemporary methods such as advanced irrigation technologies, innovative farming systems and effective water retention and utilization methods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Waterways Division within the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways manages a project focussed on supporting irrigation systems for agricultural development. Recipients are selected through an Expression of Interest process which is followed by on-site verification. The irrigation systems have the aim of improving the use of limited water supply in dry farming areas to</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2018</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 improve farm production. A weir with 1.2 million cubic metres water storage volume was built by the then Land Water Resource Management Unit across the Nawaka River in Nadi in 2010. These are the objectives of constructing this weir: • Flood mitigation for food security, to manage water levels effectively thereby reducing the likelihood of flooding in adjacent regions. By regulating floodwaters, it protects agricultural land which in turn supports uninterrupted crop production and secures food resources for the local population. • Irrigation support during dry season. In terms of droughts and insufficient rainfall, this weir serves as a dependable water source for irrigation. This guarantees the continuity of agricultural operations thereby preserving crop yields and sustaining livelihoods even during the dry season. Fishing for food security, the weir establishes a more stable aquatic ecosystem that enhances freshwater fish habitats thereby offering a reliable food source for the community. This plays a significant role in ensuring long-term food security for the villages. The integration of flood management dependable irrigation systems and improved fishing prospects are designed to enhance the resilience of the local communities while fostering sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a young student at Queen Victoria School, I used to spend a lot of my school holidays in Nawaka. I was asking Tui Nawaka when I went there lately the existence of this weir, but he said that it is all now under a lot of shrubs. We will try to clear all the debris so that it is functional once more. For those of you who do not know or may not be clear with what I am talking about, these are in iTaukei, na tore. Na tore o koya dau vagolei tani ga na uciwai, qai dua na tamani tobu vakaitamera. O ira na tobu oqo, mai Nawaka ena gauna oya, e caka tu kina na siwa. Era dau siwa maleya kina, era nunu. It was so big that if you were fishing on this side of the weir, you will not know the other person on the other side. That was how big it was but, unfortunately, it has not been maintained. All we need is to clear up the debris. It is a direct answer to the flooding that happens in Nawaka. I told Tui Nawaka, “If we are going to clean the weir once again and make use of it, it is going to be a source of food security for you and also, it is a flood mitigation method.” This is what I have talked about here, I hope it is clear. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Land Use Division of the Ministry has established two demonstration sites for rainwater harvesting in Namuka-i-Wai Island in the Tikina o Dogotuki and Nagugu Settlement in the Tikina o Naduri; both in Vanua Levu. This initiative is part of the Climate Smart Agriculture Programme and was established in the 2023-2024 financial year and is currently implemented in collaboration with the Live &amp; Learn NGO. In both demonstration sites, water tanks are being installed to collect rainwater. These tanks are linked to drip irrigation system that supplies water to vegetable gardens. The concept of water harvesting involves a collection of rainwater occurring in a specific location and its subsequent transfer to another area. This process enhances the availability of water for sustainable use in regions where water resources are limited. The garden serves as a source for nutritious food for the</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2019 community that depend on an irregular water supply from the mainland for their daily sustenance in the past. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given Fiji’s susceptibility to climate change, the implementation of sustainable water management practices is also essential for livestock production. Some of the key strategies include efficient water use, forest management, legume-grass mixtures, silos production and livestock management through genetic selection, and the development of livestock breeds that exhibit greater resilience to drought conditions, including heat tolerant breeds for those with reduced water needs such as the Droughtmaster breed in cattle. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has adopted Climate-Smart Agriculture as one of its strategic priorities and this includes activities to reforest watershed areas to ensure sufficient and good quality water is available to farmers. The inclusion of agroforestry will ensure water loss from the soil is reduced and integrated farming system will ensure water is utilised efficiently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me enlighten the House that in certain areas in Fiji that are separated by mountains, we have areas where you have an abundance of water on the other side. But then, directly on the other side, there is a big difference of no water. You just have to go along the coast in Nakorotubu and have a look at the Bureiwai area where there is no water. But up in the mountains, on the other side, there is abundant of water, ia rau tikina vata tikoga. So, that requires big infrastructure projects, and I hope that it can be part of the infrastructure vision for Fiji - to get water from those areas and channel it to other areas that do not have water. It is a challenge for Parliament, it may be very costly. As I have stated earlier in my answer to the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s question, infrastructure is a costly thing. If we spend peanuts on our infrastructure, we will get monkeys! We spend money, we throw money into the infrastructure, it will last us a lifetime. These infrastructures that are here that are now falling to pieces were infrastructure from the 1960s, so I hope the Ministry is given the money to fix all these infrastructure. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, be assured that we will fight for the money to get it from Government. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- For you!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Honourable Minister, this is a very interesting topic.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Where is the money? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- It is with the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They have to get it. Otherwise, as I have stated, that is why COP29 is so important and your Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the consistency in our messaging, given our special circumstances and challenges. Honourable Minister, for the tore (weir) concept, if you cannot just look at Nawaka in isolation but the whole area that is being included already under the Nadi River Strategy, that is very important. That is my first question, is that something that you are going to consider? And, I will have more questions as well. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is included in the plans. We want to revisit that area.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2020</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just combine the next two questions together; honourable Minister, you are aware of the Sigatoka Valley. You also have the irrigation system, but it has also been neglected for ages. I hope you can consider that. If you can state an answer to that as well. You have talked about the irrigation system from rainwater harvesting. What is the Ministry’s plan for drip systems from underground water sources, like boreholes? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the saltwater intrusion phenomenon is real. When you go up the Sigatoka Valley, saltwater has intruded right up to the upper valley, and the same goes for the Rewa River. If you happen to stand beside the Rewa River up in Kabara, an estate in Naitasiri past Nabaitavo Village, you stand beside the river at Kabara, you can smell the sea. So, it means that saltwater intrusion has gone right up to those places. Definitely, we have to be serious about the irrigation systems that the honourable Leader of Opposition is talking about, whether it is a drip irrigation or rainwater harvesting, all these will help. Likewise, we must not forget the big infrastructure projects to take care of - our national needs, as I have talked about earlier. It may cost us a fortune, but it is a necessity. I say that it is a necessity because our survival depends on it, water is a basic need. We have to fix it, otherwise farming or agriculture will suffer, and we will become a country that will keep importing food up to the extent where we become a net-food importing country, and surely, we do not want that. Thank you. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, my question is in regards to water management and utilisation, and is in terms of the risks - some of the irrigation support mechanisms that farmers are facing. For example, if a farmer is given the borehole system or the irrigation system, then of course, due to some mechanical failures, the system is now not functioning anymore, and the farmers are not in the capacity to get it fixed. Does the Ministry come in and assist these farmers, or do they have to wait for the next budget? What is the process like, just for the information of the farmers? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The simple answer is, yes, we can assist. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in regards to the dredging in the Rewa River. There is dredging along the other end of Nausori Town, and there is soil erosion on the highway that is connected. There is civic lot where there is Mosque and a Church seated. Also, there is commercial lot on that end of Nausori Town that is eroding fast due to the dredging. My question is, who monitors the dredging because dredging should be in the middle of the river rather than on the side where soil erosion will just continue? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dredging is monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways Officials, from our Waterways Division, so I will find out if what you are saying is true. Accountability in the Distribution of Social Pension (Question No. 234/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D:</span> KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform Parliament on the measures in place to ensure accountability in the Government’s management and distribution of social pensions? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Premila Kumar for the question. Before I do</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2021 so, I would be remissive, and I apologise for missing this out in my previous response, it does cut into my answer for this question. To acknowledge, PhysioNet UK, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who are collaborating with the Vodafone ATH foundation in a huge donation they made yesterday to the National Council for People with Disabilities, donating $1.2 million worth of assistive devices, and these includes motorised scooters, multiple wheelchair types in designs, hospital beds, both electronic and manual, commodes, shower chairs…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR:</span> – That was not my question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> …crutches, medical consumables, adult diapers, gloves, face masks and sanitary pads.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR:</span> – Just answer my question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA:</span> – Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does relate to this question, because of course these organisations and the donations they make are not just limited to people living with disabilities, in fact, there are donations also made accessible to people who are on social pension. So, our elderly who are also accessing these assistive devices as well. So, I acknowledge their support to the Government to assist our people… HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Answer the question! HON. L. D. TABUYA,-...living on pensions. And on that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to respond to honourable Ketan Lal because I see him throwing his hands up in terms of his response to the Anti-Porn Taskforce, please, I urge him to attend the meetings because he cannot just come and bark here and not attend our working group meetings, not informed of the progress of the work. So, please attend the meeting then come and report correctly to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the research and studies have found that income inequalities is prevalent in old age, and most of us are almost in that category. So, we do need to be concerned about what is available for us as we go into this age category. Rapid population growth, combined with lack of adequate social security, will likely increase poverty amongst older persons. The latest statistics released by The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) clearly indicated... HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Irrelevant! HON. L. D. TABUYA.-...that 10 percent of our total population are under the older persons category and it is also forecasted to increase to 15 percent by 2050. So, what is the relevance to this answer?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> The Ministry is in the process of formulating its Ageing Policy because 15 percent of our population, we do need to do a deep dive into how we can make our people with older persons have a more meaningful quality of life. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is committed to our people living with an older persons in this category who are accessing the social pension. Our social pension scheme is one of the best in the Asia-Pacific region and this was acknowledged recently during our Regional Conference on population ageing in Bali, Indonesia, where our Director Social Protection was asked to be part of the panel discussion on how we can enhance old age financial security in the emerging</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2022</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 Asia Pacific and using Fiji as an example. Now, we have got to recognise as there is an ongoing evolution of social assistance, looking at a comprehensive life cycle approach. So, just because you turn 60, does not mean everyone forgets you, it happens.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They may forgotten..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, to correct honourable Premila Kumar stating that there is no bus fare assistance for 65 and under. They are receiving bus fare assistance, 65 and under. And her concern about them not receiving it, I think she has been misinforming Parliament. They continue to be on bus fare assistance, but the only thing that has changed is that those that are turning 60 after 1 st August, yes, they will not be receiving it. Why? Because the retirement age has increased to 60! They continue to work to 60. That is what the Coalition Government brought about. There is financial security until 60. There is a buffer zone of five years to 65 where they have the ability to support themselves. (Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- When it was 55 retirement, they started from 60. So, what happened to the five years there? Why could we say, why did it not start from 55? Same logic! So, please just reflect a little bit, reflect a little bit. Thank you. (Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the previous government from 2013 where the Social Pension was implemented in terms of the amount given for age 70 and above, and then it was reduced to 68, then to 66 and now it is 65. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I reiterate the Coalition Government, increased the retirement age, so in fact, under the previous government from 55 to 65, they were on their own. They were not entitled to a Social Pension Scheme.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Those who are over 60...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> They were not taken care of, in fact, their FNPF balances were deteriorated. So, it created poverty amongst those who had retired at 55. We have breached that gap to 60 and given financial security for our older persons, and, yes, they can sustain themselves for bus fare assistance to 65 where they then get the cash transfer. And with the cash transfer, they are not limited to the bus, which is what they did not do. Now they can travel in the fibre, they can travel in a minivan, in a taxi, gives them the quality of life and ability to travel. (Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under our reformed agenda, we continue to try to ensure that monitoring of the Social Pension Scheme is done properly. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- This Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is committed to digitising our records, it has been a nightmare trying to digitise these manual records, missing records. Trying to bring in to digitise has taken a long time.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1 st October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2023 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Under 60, relevance. She is wasting everyone’s time. I have asked a specific question, so I need a specific answer. Do not go beating around the bush! Come to the point! MR. SPEAKER.- Please, continue, honourable Minister. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I remind honourable Premila Kumar of her question? Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on the measures in place to ensure accountability in the governance, management and distribution of the social pension? If we are digitising our records, we are making it mainstream so that we can ensure those who are not supposed to be on the programme, what scheme of the programme, for example, when we have manual records, Mr. Speaker, Sir, members of the family are accessing this pension because we do not have the manual records, it goes to someone’s M-PAiSA or mobile phone and we have lost record of that. So, it is manually recorded, and we cannot trace back that information. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by digitising, we can ensure that it is tagged to the person’s Birth Registration Number and I thank the Births, Deaths &amp; Marriage Registry (BDM), the Ministry of Justice who have come on board, so that through the digitising process, we are now talking to the BDM, we are now talking to the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), we are now talking to other stakeholders like Fiji Revenue &amp; Customer Services (FRCS), so we are ensuring we are identifying that this is the one same person. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what happens, is that we lose track of an older person, and we are trying to find that person, what we do, and it works every single time, we stop the payment, because the payment is going to another family member. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Listen, we stop the payment and sure enough Mr. Speaker, Sir, the family member who has been receiving, comes to us to ask, “We have not been receiving the money,” So we ask them, “where is the person, who is receiving these funds? Please, give us the contact details.” Oh! my grandfather has moved to another village. We need to trace that person down, so we find that person, so that the person is receiving the benefit and not a family member. That is what we are trying to fix for better management and accountability of our social pensioners. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last budget, the Minister for Finance made the announcement that anyone turning 70 will be receiving $150, and there are people who have been complaining that they have not been receiving the $150. First of all, in the month of August, they did not receive timely pension, and this question I had actually requested for August, but anyway, it came now, but whatever it is, they did not receive $150. And I had simply asked those members to go to the Ministry and sort it out. So, my question to the honourable Minister is, what specific measures are in place to track and resolve complaints from pensioners about underpayment and is there a dedicated system in place to handle these complaints and grievances and track it? Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Before she answers, honourable Minister, let me make it very clear honourable members, the delay in payments, that is an occurrence that has happened in the past. It depends on the cash flow of the government of the day. If there is enough money to cater for all these commitments, et cetera, then payment will be timely. Otherwise, the usual thing happens and at times it will be late, but it will still be forthcoming. Yes, honourable Minister? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to answer your question, honourable Kumar. Yes, we will always receive complaints, we want anyone who’s not receiving to file the complaint with</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1 st October, 2024 the Ministry through our offices, through our phone numbers that we have available, and we do attend to it to ensure that they do receive their money. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Honourable Premila Kumar is saying that we do not pick up the phone. Please, file the complaint, honourable Kumar; file it directly with me. We will ensure that the person who is not … (Honourable Opposition Members interject) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Unbelievable, Mr. Speaker, Sir! We come here to Parliament to make this, but not one of them has come directly to me, except honourable Virendra Lal and honourable Sharma and I thank them. Come to me and we will take care of it. Our people are important and the services to them are important. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the honourable Minister for Women that because of the increase in VAT and cost of living, more people are on social welfare pensions. The complaint by many senior citizens that if they get $125 and they go to the bank and withdraw this money, they are not able to withdraw $125. Somehow the bank is holding the $5 maybe for maintenance fee, activity fee, I am not too sure, but this is what I have been hearing when I visit the communities. How are you going to make sure that the people receive $125? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Again this is the first time I am hearing of it from honourable Sharma. We meet every time at morning tea, afternoon tea, but now, he chooses to bring it out here to the public. Please, get a formal complaint and provide the evidence. If the banks are doing that, then we need to deal with the banks. However, it is important for our people to receive the money, yes, on time. Sometimes, it does not happen and, yes, we had apologised for that occurrence, honourable Kumar, and we have dealt with it internally. But what we need to do, as we prioritised our older persons, we need to work together in the House to do so. If you have complaints, please, file them formally, then we can act, and we will ensure that we do serve our people with older persons. (Honourable Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
