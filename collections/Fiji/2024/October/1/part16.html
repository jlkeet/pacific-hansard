<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT -ASSETS FIJI PTE LIMITED 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - ASSETS FIJI PTE LIMITED 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as I have stated before, there are four speakers that has been listed by the two Whips, as follows: (1) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (3) Honourable M. D. Bulitavu; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on the Assets Fiji Pte Limited Annual Reports for the period 2016 to 2019. Assets Fiji Pte Limited, established in 2015, is the Government’s asset holding company and it forms part of a broader divestment strategy aimed at securing public assets. Currently, Assets Fiji Limited (AFL) holds the assets and leases the land on which the buildings for three entities are situated. These entities are Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited and the Government Printery and Stationery Department. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I really want to highlight this particular point, that the Report highlights the failure of the Chairman of Assets Fiji Pte Limited, who was the former Permanent Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office, who had no time to acknowledge or even respond to the Committee’s request for a public meeting. Sir, this is unacceptable. I want to stress once again and I did that in the last Parliament session, that we must stop appointing Permanent Secretaries and CEOs to multiple Boards when they have failed to manage their own Ministry’s companies or are too busy to attend crucial meetings. This is really a disservice to the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL currently holds $57 million worth of assets, as we have heard from the Deputy Chairperson, ensuring that public property is not lost when shares are divested. This allows assets to be leased, generating revenue for the Government so that revenue comes from two sources - one is from the land that is leased and other one is from the shares and how well the company does. Let us not forget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that AFL was an initiative of the Bainimarama-led Government which created a pathway for privatisation without losing control of public assets to private interests, as we saw in the past. In our last parliamentary debate, which was just in the first week of September, as usual, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics made typical baseless claims, stating that</p><p>2028 Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 we did nothing for 16 years. He shamelessly claimed that only under this Government, there has been major reforms by public enterprises. What reforms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is he talking about? What we are witnessing now are quick fixes, cosmetic changes, like rebranding bizFIJI to businessNOW. Is this what the Coalition Government calls ‘reform’? The truth is that the Bainimarama-led Government spearheaded the real reforms with the enactment of the Public Enterprises Act 2019, which sets up the robust governance framework of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and this can be confirmed by the Asian Development Bank’s Report on co-funding balance 2023 which very clearly stated that Fiji’s SOEs performance was one of the best in the region for 2015 to 2020. That was largely due to the reforms that were undertaken. Often, there is a misconception when we talk about privatisation. The misconception is that if we undertake privatisation, we will lose control of the Government companies and also the assets. The reforms we introduced restored confidence in the governance of Public Enterprises by giving opportunities for Public Private Partnership (PPP), for example, FNPF. Sir, FNPF’s investment in Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, for the first time in an infrastructure area as part of the PPP Programme, we have seen FNPF’s acquisition of 39 percent shares. It not only protected national interests, but also contributed towards high returns that FNPF members are receiving. That is what long-term investments look like. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must not forget the disastrous experiments with privatisations that took place during the SVT government. I want to emphasise because that was the era when privatisation and corporatisation took off. During that period, we saw several public assets sold off or lost forever. This is the stark reminder of what happens when privatisation is handled, not responsibly. The first wave of Public Sector Reforms targeted key state enterprises in 1990, for example, the Post and Telecommunication Department was corporatised as Fiji Post and Telecommunications Limited which later split into Telecom Fiji Limited and Post Fiji Limited. What followed was the sale of majority shares in Telecom Fiji, again a big mistake. Similarly, the corporatisation of IKA Corporation and National Trading Corporation collapsed soon after. The Government Shipyard and public slipways which is also now under Assets Fiji also suffered from this reckless push towards privatisation. Once corporatised, it was then privatised, only to be nationalised again when privatisation failed miserably. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government Shipyard had a very good ship building capacity. Building vessels for Blue Lagoon Cruises, Kiribati Government and even built Reef Endeavour for Captain Cook Cruises of Australia. Building of Reef Endeavour became one of the biggest disasters in the history of shipyard. The Reef Endeavour Project started in 1989 with an initial cost of AUS$7.7 million ballooned to $22 million by the time it was completed in 1996. This disaster lack to severe financial losses. The Government decided to sell 51 percent of Government Shipyard to a $2 New Zealand company, a move that led to a disposal of public assets. Later the Government had no choice but to buy back the 51 percent shares when the company went into receivership leaving the State with about $9 million in liabilities. Fiji had to learn the hard way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have. All these disastrous privatisation happened when Fiji saw some of the most valuable assets lost for ever. Let us not forget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that under the same Government, Fiji lost its National Bank of Fiji (Fiji’s only bank) due to mismanagement or corruption you can call it, at a cost of about $220 million.</p><p>1 st October, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2029 The Government decided to sell 51percent of the National Bank of Fiji which was our only bank to Colonial Mutual Life Assurance for only $9.8 million and later in 2005 the Qarase Government sold the balance of the 49 percent stake for $28 million. We lost the bank completely. HON. S. L. RABUKA. –Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the reviewed Report of Asset Fiji Limited (AFL). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Premila Kumar has highlighted the background, I will go straight to the recommendations in the Report. The old recommendations are noted, and the Ministry of Public Enterprises undertakes to carry out the necessary actions as recommended by the Committee. The first recommendation, Sir, AFL should work closely with relevant authorities to expedite the vesting of pending land titles from Fiji Ports Corporation Limited (FPCL) and Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Ltd, finalising this transaction to enable AFL to fully integrate these assets into its portfolio to increase the company’s overall value. That recommendation is noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As alluded earlier and also highlighted by honourable Premila Kumar, the land asset of FPCL and Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Ltd were transferred to AFL following the divestment transaction. The exercise commenced in 2016 and so far, 37 land titles have been vested to AFL. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at present, only five land titles are yet to be vested. During the vesting exercise, it was noted, that the original titles of these properties could not be located. Thus, AFL is actively working with the management team of FPCL to coordinate the surveys of the properties before lodging the plans with the relevant authorities to issue new titles. Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL also conducts a valuation exercise of the land assets every five years. In fact, in 2017, the market valuation assessed the land assets at $57.3million. The land was re-valued in 2022 and noted the valuation of the land had gone to $84.3 million, which resulted in a revaluation surplus of $24.3million in 2022 financials. The second recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rental income generated from AFL’s real estate portfolio is currently below expectations. So, AFL should consider renegotiating this rental agreement to ensure that the rental rates reflect their market value. While this is being done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the native landowners are also putting their hands up for the onward transfer of these land to the original owners. The Committee recommendation is noted and Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL’s rental income is currently below the market rate as the company is constrained by the terms outlined in the lease agreements which permits rental increase up to 30 percent every five years. It should be noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that many of these long term leases and lease agreements were inherited from FPCL, however, AFL is currently conducting its due diligence to resolve that challenge. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the motion that is before the Parliament and that is for Parliament to note the Committee Review Report on the Assets Fiji PTE Limited Annual Report. I have nothing further much to say, rather the Committee has rather a limited scope of our debate given the layout of the Report has only two findings and most of the findings has been read by the mover of the motion herself and also honourable Kumar. The recommendation has been touched by the honourable Prime Minister. I suggest that probably in future to improve the</p><p>2030 Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 information and to also improve the Report, if some verbatim too can be part of the Report to allow us, before we go into the debate, the information that actually, the questions and what was answered by those organisations, so it gives honourable Members to prepare for debate. I also noted after checking with the Secretariat during lunch hour that the Committee was not even privy to a hard copy, and they only worked on a soft copy that was provided by this particular company. However, the reporting year is 2016 to 2019. To take you back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given what honourable Premila Kumar has gone back over the years, pointing fingers to the previous government. But again, this particular organisation was established in 2015 and you know very well Mr. Speaker, Sir, during that time when we were in the Opposition, we queried this question of divestment when the issue of Aitken Spence came to buy our ports from Fiji Ports Corporation Limited. We were not consulted, there was not much consultation done. We only heard about the divestment when it was brought into that particular budget in 2015 and 2016. And probably over the years, now nearly nine years. I would suggest a review should be done to relook at the arrangements done then, given that we had to protect our sovereignty. Given these are our assets, the Fijian Government’s assets. It is now in this particular company the assets as per land but as divestment in terms of the commercial activities is run by those companies. Some of them are foreign companies from Sri Lanka. We only earn in terms of the leases that are there. Probably we should review some of those arrangement to see whether we are getting maximum returns from this or we can make other choices to see that we can properly use those. Those decisions were done by the FijiFirst Government, but it is up to the Coalition Government to review this. Given it is about 10 years, we need to see if the arrangements still benefits us or those that are benefiting from it now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will also remember questioning this company called the Government Printery on how it was closed down or given out to some other private companies who are now doing government diverse, outsource to these private contractors like Star Printery et cetera. There were some questions during that time about political association, affiliations and beneficiaries. They were probably friends of some of the members of the previous government but some of the things that could be revisited and reviewed in terms of relooking at these assets, especially government printing and how we can revive this which could lessen government expenditure. Those are few things that I suggest to government to take on board, things that happen during the reported year as I had alluded to and also responding to honourable Premila Kumar. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, so much has been said. Fingers pointed at the previous government. The government before that, in fact, I spent some time in the Opposition pondering over this, and one of the issues that we were kind of confused with was in the way the motions were brought in, all the recommendations were brought in by the FijiFirst Government, and that is selling of shares and the divestment of shares. We were all informed in this august Parliament, we have not transferred any shares, we had just divested the shares. Did it spoke about the same thing or is it different? But this was the message that was provided to us when we queried, and that caused a lot of grey areas on our path as to how best we can understand what is happening to Government assets. So, that will be best answered by people who know best, either they are chartered accountants or economists, because they would better understand these two different words and that even happened with the divestment of the shares in the FEA when it was sold in Singapore or transferred. So, I wanted to add that so as to provide you, honourable Members, with some of the words that confused us a lot. So now, I open the floor to the</p><p>1 st October, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2031 Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank you for the opportunity to provide some commentary on the Assets of Fiji Pte Limited General Reports from 2016-2019. But before I do, since a lot of points have been addressed, I will just spend a bit of time in addressing some of the comments frivolously made in this Parliament. The first was by my colleague, honourable Ketan Lal, when talking about the National Pornography Taskforce in saying we are taking too much time and have not done much. Sometimes, I feel the other side of Parliament get forgetful very quickly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The reality with the National Pornography Taskforce and there are a few other major national issues when it comes to issues of national importance, that the other side of Parliament did very little with or even zero. I remember, the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection begging at that time in Parliament, that something be done about national pornography. And what did that side of the Parliament do? Absolutely nothing! Some of these national issues need political whips, and all I can say to that side of the Parliament, be assured this side of the Parliament has the political whip and we will address all the problems that we have inherited because it needs political will to solve. And one of them is of course this issue that is in front of us, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is a structured approach and, oh, he is back! And we will deal with it. The second commentary I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is always accusations about taskforces being created and I am one of the culprits. I would just like to offer this counsel to my learned colleagues, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The difference between that side of the Parliament, that was run by two people, and this side is that we collaborate and we listen, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.– We collaborated and we listened, so that is the big change that is happening in our country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We actually seek opinions. If we look at the taskforce, it is very big, it is actually too big, but that is okay because that is the nature of what we are dealing with. It is a national issue, we need a national conversation and then move forward. So, collaborate and listen, you will learn something from it, honourable Ketan Lal. I will address the business now, on the very flippant comment about business, now. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we rebranded it to be fair, but it was an initial initiative by the FijiFirst Government which we have taken on. But the semantics when it comes to the rebranding. What is important is, we are actually moving forward with the business now. We have just launched the first automation of a business process in Government which is starting a business, the honourable Koya will know this very well and we are about to do the building permits. In terms of ease of doing business, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are very significant actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly with regard to Assets Fiji Limited, the significant thing, I think that comes from the Report that was done by the Committee, is that the returns are low and that needs to be worked on. The honourable Prime Minister just mentioned that the property revaluation went from $57 million to $84 million. So, in other words, if you take the $3 million return after tax as a percentage of the current valuation, we are looking at well below 5 percent return on assets. The challenge on this side of Parliament is, how do we unlock the potential of these large assets that sits within Assets Fiji Limited? Of course, will be left to the Board and the honourable Prime Minister who leads the public enterprise, I am sure will be very keen to ensure that we start to</p><p>2032 Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports 1 st October, 2024 get better returns. An interesting point, the total assets right now for public enterprises is about $9 billion. You have to ask the question, in that $9 billion, does every single asset in that $9 billion are they of the good returns? Probably the answer is, as with Assets Fiji Limited, no, and of course we wholeheartedly support the recommendations by the Committee and look forward to more returns being generated by Assets Fiji Limited. I thank you, Sir. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all honourable Members who have contributed to the debate and we look forward to Assets Fiji Limited doing its part and taking necessary steps and actions in the implementation of the Report. We also look forward to the Reports from 2020 onwards, with that, I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea and we will return when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 4.38 p.m.</p><p>1 st October, 2024 Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports 2033 The Parliament resumed at 5.16 p.m.</p></body>
