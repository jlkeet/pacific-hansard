I rise to leave on the Consolidated Review Reports of Tavua Town Council Annual Reports for the year 2016-2018. The Standing Committee on Social Affairs was referred the Tavua Town Council Annual Report for the year 2016, on the 20 th of November 2023. And the Tavua Town Council Annual Reports for the year ended 2017 and 2018, on the 15 th April, 2024. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Standing Committee through its mandatory role stipulated under Standing Orders 110, undertook a site visit to the government grants project administered by the Council such as the Tavualevu Village Public Convenience Project and the Multipurpose Sports Court Change Room. The Council raised concerns on the challenges they have faced over the last few years. The Standing Committee noted various issues raised by the Council and suggested possible recommendations as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee noted the importance of small municipalities like Tavua in engaging with stakeholders to expedite various planned projects that will be undertaken by the Council to enable them to provide a better service to its people. The Standing Committee commends the Council for having a good rate collection compared to other Councils around Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Standing Committee’s deliberations, the following recommendations, were highlighted: (1) Tavua Town Council to seek assistance from the Ministry of Environment to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for the proposed dump site. (2) A MOU be put in place between Tavua Council and Tavualevu Village Committee regarding the operation and the maintenance of the public convenience. (3) That the Council expedite discussions on the land for the construction of a new market and provision for a carpark and a bus station.

Pillay; (2) Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; and (3) Honourable A. N. Tuicolo. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate regarding the Consolidated Review Report of Tavua Town Council Annual Report for the year 2016 -2018, which was tabled by the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on 5 th September, 2024. This Report is crucial as it sheds light on the operations and challenges faced by the Tavua Town Council during the specified years and it provides us with a road map for improvement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we dwell into the findings of the Standing Committee, it is essential to note the weaknesses identified within the Tavua Town Council's operations. The Standing Committee's review highlighted several eight years that require immediate attention and rectification. One of the primary concerns was the lack of transparency and accountability in financial reporting. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee noted that the Council's engagement with the community was insufficient. There were limited opportunities for residents to voice their concerns or participate in decision making processes. This disconnect between the Council and the community is detrimental to fostering a collaborative environment where citizens feel valued and heard. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the response to these weaknesses, the Standing Committee proposed several solutions aimed at enhancing the Council's operations. Firstly, it recommended the implementation or robust financial management system that ensures transparency and accountability in all financial dealings. This system should include regular audits and public disclosures of financial reports to keep the community informed and engaged by recommending these measures, the Tavua Town Council can rebuild trust with its constituents. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee emphasised the importance of community engagement. It suggested that the Council establish regular forums and outreach programmes to facilitate dialogue between council members and residents. These initiatives would not only empower citizens but also provide the Council with valuable insights into the needs and priorities of the community. By fostering a culture of inclusivity, Tavua Town Council can enhance its decision-making process and ensure that they align with the aspirations of the people. Mr. Speakers, Sir, one of the major challenge for the Council and the people of Tavua is flooding. We all know about the situation, and it was also mentioned by the Special Administrator during the presentation, and I quote: “As far as dredging is concerned, it is a concern. It has been raised on so many occasions, almost in every meeting with the ministries. We are raising this issue for the dredging of Nasivi River. This is a matter of urgency. Although the whole of Tavua Town is not flooded, but the entrance after the bridge and before the bridge - the whole area gets flooded. The whole of Yaladro, Nabuna gets flooded, and before Shop N Save right up to the bus stand, the road is blocked. Villages that also get flooded are Nabuna, Tavualevu, Vanuakula and Rukuruku. We have always been raising this issue, but the promises were made and so far nothing has eventuated.”</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>2112 Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2016-2018 Annual Reports 2 nd October, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Minister for Local Government with the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways will address on the challenges faced by Tavua Town Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee highlighted the need for capacity building within the Council. With recommended training programmes for Council’s staff to improve their skills in areas such as project management, financial planning and community engagement. By investing in the professional development of its workforce, the Tavua Town Council can enhance its overall effectiveness and better serve the needs of its constituents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Consolidated Review Report of Tavua Town Council Annual Reports for the year 2016 to 2018, serves as a critical tool for identifying weaknesses and proposing actionable solutions. It is imperative that we as Members of Parliament support the recommendations put forward by the Standing Committee to ensure that the Tavua Town Council operates with transparency, engages meaningfully with the community and builds the capacity of its staff. With those words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate that is before the Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government acknowledges the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, we respect the reviews of the 2016 to 2018 Annual Report for Tavua Town Council, and I wish to thank the Standing Committee for the review they have carried out as well as very useful and practical recommendations they have included in their report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua Town is one of the smallest towns in Fiji, with only 311 rate payers and a revenue of around $400,000 annually. Despite its size, Tavua Council has demonstrated remarkable efficiency in revenue collection, achieving 77 percent of current rates in the last financial year and collecting of arrears stood at 11 percent. Total outstanding amount for rates was only around $51,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to note that Tavua is ranked one of the top five Councils in terms of current rate collections from all the municipalities in our country. Furthermore, special administrators of Tavua are committed to completing all pending financial reports by November 2024, ensuring timely submissions to the Officer of the Auditor General. The financial reports for 2019, 2020 and 2021 are already with the Auditor General’s Office for review. This demonstrates that even our small Councils are setting a benchmark for accountability and transparency in local government leading by example, managing their finances and upholding public trust. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new appointed special administrators, also very ambitious in developing business ideas for new revenue streams. The Council is working on a concepts to develop a new market, bus stand as well as a car park. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to quickly respond to the six recommendations that were provided by the Standing Committee. One is on the Council to seek assistance from the Ministry of Environment regarding the carrying out of environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports for the new proposed dumpsite. I think I have also shared in one of my presentations this afternoon, currently, the Coalition Government is working on the review of the Waste Management System around the country and one of the projects that we have now is the proposed Western Landfill in the Western Division. Hopefully, once that is completed, we will be able to rope in Councils from Tavua right down to Sigatoka.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2016-2018 Annual Reports 2113 Next is on the MOU in place between Tavualevu Village and Tavua Town Council regarding the public conveniences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministry of Local Government is consistently encouraging our municipal councils to maintain public convenience to high standards. It is something that we have been insisting with all the Councils, we must make sure that all the public conveniences are properly upgraded for better use by the public. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, financial sustainability is the key. While Tavualevu Village has taken the initiative to set up these facilities, the Town Council’s first challenge is maintaining them without a sustainable revenue stream. The Council nevertheless, will work on options that are suitable for both the Council and the Tavualevu Village. We compare the needs of the village and users of the public convenience. On the construction of a new market site as well as provision for a car park and bus stand. That is something that the new administrators are working on right now. They have been talking to the landowners on one of the new sites that they have identified, and one of the challenges right now for Tavua Town is, they do not have a bus station. The bus just stops and parks along the main highway and this is one of the reasons why we have a lot of traffic issues along the main street of Tavua Town. This is something that the Council as well as the newly appointed administrators are seriously looking at right now, reviewing it to ensure they find a place where they can also relocate the market. At the same time too, have a bus stand and also maybe create more parking spaces around Tavua Town. A very important issue is the flooding issue in Tavua Town, which is normally brought about by the overflow of the Nasivi River. Something that we have also been liaising closely with the Ministry of Waterways to find out a long term solution for it. As it is for the past so many years, this place has been flooded, especially with what I was told, with the construction of the new bridge which has really deteriorated due the flooding issue in Tavua Town. It is something that the Council has to seriously consider now, to come up with a long term solution that is in collaboration with the Ministry of Waterways. The dredging of Nasivi River and other models or options that will be assisting and also resolve this long-standing issue. One of the issues raised is, the Ministry of Local Government to assist with the funding of installation of solar floodlights at the Multipurpose Court. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is one of the very important aspect of town and city management in all the municipalities in Fiji, where the lighting in public spaces, it is really important to ensure public safety when communities or the public come and use these spaces. The Ministry, with the support from the Government of the People's Republic of China has provided 16 solar lights to the Tavua Town Council. This is from the 200 solar lights donated by the Guangdong province, and these lights are installed in the market, children's park, bus stand and the rear lane which is Mobil Service Station, and ANZ to name a few. The Council also requested for some more additional solar lights, and we are also thankful to the Embassy for giving us some more solar lights and we are hopeful that we will allocate some of the solar lights to Tavua Town. A very important issue is one of the last recommendations, the improvement of the town rate collection. I think I have also alluded earlier Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua Town is one of the best in terms of the collection of rates. Currently they have collected about 77 percent of the town rates, and it speaks volumes of the effort, as well as the strategies that are put in place by the management as well as the newly appointed administrators in managing the rate collection in Tavua Town.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>2114 Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council 2016-2018 Annual Reports 2 nd October, 2024 The Ministry also assisted the Council to explore some of the rate collection strategies to assist the Councils in the collection of their rates. Like those that are working to actually pay directly from their wages and salaries, and also exploring better options like paying from other payment modes, like M-PAiSA and other online payment platforms. The Ministry will continue to support Tavua Town Council and its executives, ensuring that whatever challenges that they have, the Ministry is there to support these smaller town councils. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution on the motion moved by the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, honourable Iliesa Vanawalu, on the Consolidated Review Report of Tavua Town Council Annual Reports for the Years 2016 to 2018. Before I go any further, I take this opportunity to thank the Chairperson and the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the work they do in scrutinising the Annual Reports of the years in review and compiling the Consolidated Review Report which highlighted the Standing Committee’s findings and recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak on Recommendation 4.4. I noted that, in Recommendation 4.4, the Standing Committee recommends, that the Government to provide funding to the Ministry of Waterways for regular dredging of Nasivi River and to reinstate the annual grant for regular maintenance of the storm or V drains within the municipalities. According to a press release by the Ministry of Waterways in June 2020, the desilting works of six kilometres of the Nasivi River was completed by the Ministry in 2020. The issue of constantly losing crops, livestock, and infrastructure due to flooding for communities living along the Nasivi River, has been addressed by this project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that this is an expensive exercise for the Government, however, the recommendation by the Standing Committee, in the dredging and desilting works, will not only address flooding for the communities in Tavua, but will also boost the business activities in Tavua Town and will further support farmers along the Nasivi River to venture into commercial farming. The change in weather is beyond our control, therefore, the Tavua Town Council and nearby communities must also consider other alternative measures to address this issue, like controlling upstream activities, such as clear-cut logging, poor agriculture practices and other developments that would hinder the water flow of the river by reducing its discharge capacity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again commend the Tavua Town Council with the work that they do in providing services and resources that enhances the quality of life of the Tavua community, and I request that the Municipal Council considers all recommendations put forward by the Standing Committee. I support the motion before the Parliament. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there is a lot that has been discussed in this august Parliament on recommendation from the honourable Members and the onus on the Ministry for Local Government for the implementation of the recommendations by the Standing Committee. On that note, in the review of the Report, the Standing Committee highlighted the various areas that need to be strengthened by the Council and the relevant recommendation formulated for a solution. Once again the Standing Committee would like to thank the Ministry of Local Government</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2115 for providing a timely response to the Standing Committee’s recommendations. On that note, Sir, I have no other comments on this motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
