<body><h3>AUDIT BILL 2024</h3><h4>AUDIT BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 85, I move: That the Audit Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17 of 2024) be read a second time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I beg to second the motion, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Before I call upon the mover of the motion, I remind honourable Members that pursuant to Standing Order 85(1), the debate will be on the principle and the merits of the Bill. I hope I am clear on that. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said quite rightly, focussing on the principles and the merits of the Audit Bill 2024. The establishment of the Office of the Auditor- General (OAG) is legally mandated under Sections 151 and 152 of the Constitution. The Audit Act of 1969 provides the legal framework for the duties and powers of the Auditor- General. The principal objective of the Act, Sir, is to provide for the salary, duties and powers of the Auditor-General, the auditing of public accounts and for other purposes connected with it. So, pursuant to Legal Notice No. 3 of 2023, dated 5 th January, 2023, the Act is one of the written laws that is assigned under the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. The review of the Audit Act 1969, Sir, entails a thorough consultation, so the Ministry through the OAG, undertook a comprehensive review of the Act with a focus to amend the Act to modernise it so that it is able carry out its functions in line with some of the international standards and best practices. So, given that the Act was last reviewed in 2006, it does not really capture the developments that have taken place over the last so many years, in particular, in the public sector accounting practices and new standards that have been adopted in many other countries.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Audit Bill 2024 2101 Sir, the main objectives of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to: (1) Strengthen the independence of the OAG. I think that is the most important thing, consistent with the independence guaranteed in the Constitution. I think it does not matter who is in Government and who is in Opposition, that principle of the independence of the OAG, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very, very important and critical. (2) To clarify the auditing mandate and include specific mandate to carry out compliance with new developments in IT and also in the context of environmental auditing. So, in the whole area of climate change and environmental accounting, there are standards which need to be put in place to empower the Auditor-General to take that into account. (3) To ensure that all audits are conducted in accordance with applicable international standards on auditing, namely the international standards on auditing and the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIS). I know, Sir, that in forums, like the International Parliamentary Union (IPU), these things have always featured and there are countries where governments do not do this, and it has always been an issue. (4) To protect the delivery of roles and responsibilities by the Auditor-General and officers of the OAG from personal institutional perspective and how audit findings are reported. I think that is also a very important principle. (5) To recognise that the OAG, its budget, staffing, revenue streams are consistent with other provisions of the Audit Act and also as provided in the Constitution itself. (6) To provide for the review of audits for entities that are not subject to audit by the Auditor- General in accordance with the Constitution as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is important because we know there was a change, for example, in section 72 of the Finance Instructions and two independent institutions, the Elections Office and the Human Rights Commission. There was a new paragraph stated there that the Permanent Secretary for Finance, for example, could not order or authorise an independent audit without the agreement of the Supervisor of Election or the Human Rights Commission. I do not know why it was done. So, it is very important that, that kind of restriction is not placed on the OAG. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to enhance the powers of the Auditor-General to access data, including more increasingly now data held in an electronic form, and I think FRCS Act that we amended, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms revenue, has also been changed because a lot of the records are now electronic and the OAG ought to be empowered to be able to access those electronic records if the OAG is to be empowered to do a thorough auditing. The Audit Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consultation, as I have said, was facilitated by the Ministry of Finance with the OAG and Office of the Solicitor-General, and it commenced in June 2023. The OAG conducted an extensive consultation and received technical assistance from the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) for which the outcome is presented before the House. The call for written submissions was published on the OAG’s website on 14 th July, 2023, and in the daily newspapers on 15 th July, 2023. Direct invitations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to attend the consultation meeting were issued to 49 key stakeholders. A total of 36 responded to the invitations and through written or oral submissions, and consultation meetings were held in Suva and the Western Division from 24 th July, 2023 to 15 th August, 2023.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>2102 Audit Bill 2024 2 nd October, 2024 While there was generally overwhelming support to the amendments proposed, stakeholders consulted sought clarifications on specific matters relating to different sections of the existing legislation, and the proposed new sections. The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not bringing this as an amendment Bill because there were a lot of changes and we felt that it is better to bring a complete new Bill which also includes some of the original provisions in that Bill so that we could go Clause by Clause and Parliament would have a very clear view as to what the new Audit Bill and we wanted to take a little bit of time so that we are able to do this in a much more effective way. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our development partners have recognised this effort to strengthen external scrutiny in the OAG and this was one of the policy points that we had foreshadowed as part of our budget support with the various international organisations, our development partners, World Bank, DFAT, DFATNZ, and this has been a key focus since we came into Government in terms of looking at the overall Public Financial Management Reforms, which also included the strengthening of the Public Financial Management Legislative Framework, the Finance Management Act, Procurement Regulations, Finance Instructions, et cetera, and, of course, the new FMIS system that I had talked about in Parliament which has come into force from 1 st August, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were few teething problems, but I think all these reforms will support and strengthen the implementation of the new legislation and also strengthen the Office of the Auditor-General. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said in Parliament, the recent appointment of Ms. Finau Seru Nagera by His Excellency the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Offices Commission, as the new Auditor-General of Fiji - the first woman ever to hold this position, obviously, this new legislation, amendments and improvements will significantly strengthen the Office of the Auditor-General. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I commend the Bill for second reading. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now for debate on the motion. Also, I have a list of speakers flagged by the Whips. Leading the batting would be: (1) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (2) Honourable F. S. Koya; (3) Honourable Ratu J. B. Niudamu; and (4) Honourable M. D. Bulitavu. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for presenting the merits and principle of the Audit Bill 2024. In my view, Audit Bill sets the legal framework to protect the interest of our citizens, who are actually the taxpayers of this country. They want their money to be utilised effectively and ethically, and this particular Bill precisely does that. Mr. Speaker. Sir, I also acknowledge the provisions in the Audit Bill 2024 that aligns with international best practices. For example, section 13 includes (as the honourable Minister has mentioned) environmental audit. Environmental audit is an important component of the Audit Bill 2024, and given the increasing importance of climate change, modern audit frameworks now include environmental audits. This provision assesses how public funds are used to meet climate goals, reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable resource management. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suggest a slight change to the title, if we can call this “Environmental and Climate Audits”, because climate change is very visible, so that is the change that I am proposing.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Audit Bill 2024 2103 The second provision in the Bill which is very appealing is the audit of information technology system and the use of international auditing standards. The Audit Bill 2024 empowers auditors to assess the security and resilience of the Government IT System, focussing on protecting public data and ensuring continuity of Government services in the face of cyber threats. So that is really, really important when we are talking about money. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the inclusion of two more areas, and that would be gender responsive auditing, because the Government has moved into gender-based budgeting. So, if it is gender-based budgeting, it would be interesting or important to include gender responsive auditing. Modern Audit Bills increasingly include provisions of gender audits, focussing on whether public funds are being used in a way that promotes gender equity and addresses specific gender-based issues in public policy. The other one that I would like to suggest is the Debt Audit. This is the national debt. It is always important to get a view of the Auditor-General as to how the borrowing took place, how it was utilised and whether the borrowing was at a concessional rate that we hear, or how was it done and how was it utilised? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think at this point, I would like to share my experience considering that I was involved along with Housing Authority Board to undertake a special investigation conducted by the Auditor General’s office and this relates very well to Section 12 of the current Audit Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during this special investigation we faced 3 issues, I do not know whether I can speak about this now or not. Maybe later? (Honourable Member interjects) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Alright, so at this point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said what I wanted to say and I will stop here. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for putting this before the Parliament for its second reading. I am going to be very brief, with just a couple of points on the actual Bill. Obviously, Section 151 of the Constitution is the operative provision with respect to Auditor Generals, but just for clarity’s sake Sir, I think it is important that we all know this in terms of the functions of the Auditor General. Section 1521 (a) basically says, that at least once in every year, the Auditor General shall inspect, audit and report to Parliament on the public accounts of the state, the control of public money and public property of the state and all transactions with or concerning public money or public property of the state. Now, I am not sure but, this might be an issue that needs to be checked with the Attorney General’s office with one of the provisions that is in there, in terms of audit. And I think that it is specifically to do with performance audits and also to do with institutions that may be receiving grants et cetera, Sir. If I read it correctly, it says that it “may”, the Auditor General “may”, if he wants to audit it, it does not say “must.” It needs to be looked at and put in line with what is in the Constitution and doubled checked with the honourable Attorney General’s office, would know better. So, just that one, and in terms of the performance audit itself, I think in today’s day and age, what is actually transpiring, again, because it says the Auditor General “may” at any time, it is at his or her discretion, I think it needs to be synclinal. It needs to be put into a timeframe, that the Auditor General must honour the two-year cycle, do these performance audit, especially Sir, so that we are, the general</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>2104 Audit Bill 2024 2 nd October, 2024 public is quite aware that a particular institution is making sure that they are actually performing in terms of public funds et cetera. Just one or two more issues, Sir. In the definition section, honourable Attorney-General this is addressed to you, I think it is (e) it says that a local authority within in the meaning of the Local Government Act 1972, expect a local authority in respect to which the Minister is responsible for Local Government has directed that the auditor general is not the audit under section 51 (1) of that Act. It is actually a bit of double Dutch, I am not sure what is being referred to, maybe it needs some clarity or somebody needs to get the English right so it is easier for people to understand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a couple of other things. Again, this has to do with the powers of the Auditor General. In Section 6 (1) the powers of the Auditor General, in section 6 (1) (a) it says in the performance of his or her functions under Section 152 of the Constitution, and of his or her functions and duties under this Act, the Auditor General “may” call on any officer, member, employee or contractor or a public entity for any explanation or information that may be required. In light of the recent reports that have come out of the Committee, Sir, and the enquiry that has been instigated by you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe we should include former employees in that particular portion also. Otherwise, we are restricting ourselves to those that are currently employed and officers. I am not sure if former employees is permitted within that, but that may be a provision that we need to put in, in light of the fact that we know we have a report before the Parliament and an investigation current. So, that is just an addition that may need to be put in. In terms of the same, Section 6, we look at (f) it talks about obtaining legal advice and it says from the private practice. I do not know whose private practice is being referred to or should it say from private practitioners in circumstances considered appropriate by the Auditor-General. I think it is just the English that needs to be corrected, Sir. The other thing also is the subsection 3 talks about an offence. I think that is also something that needs to be properly spelt out, but otherwise in general, Sir, the one very glaring thing in there and I am not sure if everyone will agree to this, there is an audited section 8 speaks about the Auditor- General that may delegate to any employee or contractor. So, it goes out, any function due to your power of the Auditor-General, other than the function of certifying reporting accounts that comes to Parliament. In case of handing out unfettered power like that to someone who is a private contractor Sir, there needs to be a bit of a check and balance. I am not sure honourable Minister of Finance, how it should be dealt with, or maybe we need to put some provision in there that it is not an unfettered power, that the Auditor-General has, with respect to that. Just those things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, otherwise in a nutshell itself, it brings us in line with international best practices and standards, and I think it is a timely Bill that has actually come before the Parliament, and I think the Committee will have a thorough inspection of this once it gets to the Committee. MR. SPEAKER.- We just had another change in the listing and the last speaker would be the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for the second reading of Audit Bill 2024. First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the drafters for this particular Bill, I think it is one of the best Bills I have ever seen particularly on auditing laws. It has come into line</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Audit Bill 2024 2105 with the international standards and best practices of what we are supposed to do, particularly the appealing section which has now come into this new Bill, Sir. We have seen that the old Act had only had 13 provisions. Now it has extended to 27 provisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen that as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister had alluded to earlier, the laws goes with the time and we need to change laws, particularly the old common laws which we had relied on. We change with what we are facing nearly every day, and I have seen from section 1 right up to section 27, I have seen that it is in line with the international best practices. I have no further comments to say. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a brief contribution to the Bill, which is for the second reading and just to respond to honourable Koya, given it has been the last eight years in Parliament or even more, we are much used to Standing Orders 51. When Bills come for the short cut provision, we go into debate and we tend to go into the substantive matter and I thank the Government for exhausting the normal procedure to go through first reading and into second reading, where we can only comment on the principle and merits of the Bill and after this, through Standing Order 85(4). Then the honourable Speaker will refer it to the Standing Committee for consultation and other deliberations where the suggestions and the clauses has been referred to by honourable Koya and also honourable Premila Kumar can be part of the individual submissions to the Committee to look into the Bills. We will then have discussions with the drafters at the Attorney-General's office in terms of the final forming of the Bill. They will come back to the Parliament after the Committee reports back, and before we go into the third reading of the Bill and before enactment. That was the procedure given, that we were so used to, the shortcut provision. Sometimes when we go back to the original work of a legislature, we are quite confused at times. But just on the merits of the Bill, I agree with the honourable Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister, in terms of clause 6. But all these come under Section 152 (3) of the Constitution, where a written law can be made in order to add further provisions to see the functions and powers of the Office of the Auditor-General. In clause 6, as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the mover of the motion, it gives more power to the Auditor-General, especially in searches of property and to compel getting of passwords in order to get evidence, if they are doing an auditing or an investigation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the more important provision would be clause 12 of the Bill, whether its merits and principles, which is aligned to your ruling on Monday. The understanding of the Business Committee, where subcommittees through its terms of reference can make investigation if the Standing Committee on Public Accounts’ report comes to the Parliament, and whether from the debate there are some unresolved issues that Parliament may think to revisit in terms of wastage of Government resources or taxpayers’ fund. Where you have the discretion to allow a subcommittee to relook into that. This particular Bill has brought your decision, Sir, on Monday and the Business Committee, where it now allows in clause 12, where Parliament can also instruct through this particular Bill, the Office of the Attorney- General to do a special investigation in terms of any findings that Parliament might see that is not sufficient that has been given. That ruling is now consistent if the Bill comes into an Act, that will cover the Parliament’s role in also instructing the Office of the Attorney-General to do further audits or investigation. On clause 19, it also allows the honourable Speaker of Parliament to now appoint a natural person to audit the Office of the Auditor-General. That is a new provision that is in this particular Bill, where the honourable Speaker of Parliament will now appoint a natural person, the wording that is in the current Bill, to audit the Office of the Auditor-General. Given in the past, there have been many allegations in terms of the independency of this particular organisation. The honourable Deputy</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>2106 Audit Bill 2024 2 nd October, 2024 Prime Minister will well remember a few years ago, when the former Auditor-General was accused of drinking grog with some politicians and was more aligned to some political parties. The independence of that organisation was questioned by the former Minister for Economy at that time. But the merits of the Bill brings it into international standards and best practices. The last clause, I would like to comment on is clause 21, which has principle and merits too. That will outline the matters with the Auditor-General, must report to Parliament including any matter that the Auditor-General may wish to bring to the attention of Parliament arising from any audit, special investigation and review of audits in the preceding calendar year or financial year. It provides a pathway after the Auditor-General makes those special investigations instructed by Parliament through the Standing Committee or through your subcommittee to the terms of reference that you had ruled out the other day. It provides the pathway for the Auditor-General to bring back a second report, probably on any findings that Parliament might want to ensure on whether the state resources or taxpayers money needs to be accounted for. With those words, I commend and support the Bill for the second reading, and look forward for it to come to the Standing Committee where we will then do our consultation plus deliberation in conjunction with the drafters from the Office of the Attorney-General and come back to the Parliament, if needed to be instructed through your decision, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.– Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to speak on the second reading of the Audit Bill of 2024. I suppose, reiterating the merits and the principals that have been spoken about by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, the mover of the Bill in the Parliament this afternoon. One of the points that I think is important to note Mr. Speaker, Sir and I am sure all of us here at in Parliament can agree to, is the point raised by the honourable Premila Kumar. These laws are going to ensure that there is confidence in how public funds are going to be spent. Everyone in this country pays taxes, everyone contributes to the treasury, and everyone contributes to the money that is ultimately going to be shared or given to ministries of government and government departments in order for them to be able to work the responsibilities that are given to them. This is one of the ways and I suppose the only way in which this Parliament is able to convince those that are actually contribute to the treasury that their money, money that they spend, taxes that they pay is actually going to the right place and has been spent on the right occasion. It is through the audits that are conducted that we get the public confidence that we so desire to have here in this Parliament. So I thank all those that have been involved behind the scenes, the Auditor General’s Office, the Ministry of Finance staff who have been instrumental in the early revising the Act of 1969. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister had stated it correctly, the last revision of this amendment that was brought to this Act was in 2006. That is a long time ago and as we know, laws need to be revised so that it continues to remain relevant and efficient in addressing current challenges and concerns as we go year by year. This is a good time, and I see the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister has resoundingly stated that in the Parliament this afternoon Mr. Speaker sir, this is a good time in which the Act needs to be replenished completely. Of course, there are provisions in the old Act that will be maintained in the new one but there are additional ones that provides for the safeguards, provides for the guardrails that attends to the present challenges, the economic challenges that we have at the moment, as well as the business challenges that we also will have to attest to as we move forward.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Audit Bill 2024 2107 Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the principals that I think is important for Parliament to note that this Bill brings, is that it is going to promote effective governance. So, we can see that in the additional provisions that are going to be added on to last 17 provisions that were there before. So these provisions are of course are designed to ensure that governance is one of the main hallmarks of the laws that we are going to see spanning through, hopefully in the next session. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, having to address this Parliament on the relevancy and efficacy of the laws and how responsive it needs to be in our present-day society, is that, once we have these audit laws brought to be passed by Parliament, we are actually going to be inducing a more investment trade and economic growth environment in the country. That is what we ultimately intend to encourage, is that people from within and people from outside looking in, know that we are a very accountable government, accountable to the people and accountable for all the money that is collected to be spent on our government. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the second reading by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. MR. SPEAKER.– Honourable Members, I now call upon the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance to speak in reply. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Members for their contribution and support for the second reading of the Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to also thank honourable Bulitavu for laying out the process. I think that was very clear. The honourable Members will have the opportunity to make their presentations and I am hoping that the Standing Committee will look at each clause and also look at the drafting and the language as well. You know as we normally do in any Bill that goes to the Committee. But just to quickly pick on some of the points, Mr. Speaker, Sir, raised by the honourable Members. The honourable Minister for Lands is absolutely correct. I mean, the history of auditing, whether you talk about mid-18th century or whether about industrial revolution, it all started with the view to ensuring that there is value for money, that there is accountability of public money. Over the years all these things have changed with a lot more sophistication in the way public funds are raised and in the way it is being used. On the issue that, honourable Premila Kumar raised about debt auditing, it is already part of the work of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General's Office looks at financing, looks at debt, interest rates, the whole financial situation of the Government and obviously all that come into play. On the gender auditing, I think that is already or can be done and there is no restriction on gender auditing and it can be done as part of the performance and compliance audits. So the compliance audit can show, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a matter of principle that gender audits, there is no restriction. The issue of environmental audits, that is part of the relevant international language and that is why we have kept it as environmental audit and of course, you know, climate change and everything else would fall into that. The points raised by honourable Koya, were all very relevant Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I guess, you know, those were more the content of what is in the clause and I am sure honourable Koya will have an opportunity to speak about that through the Standing Committees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another point that probably was raised, that people must be wondering, the audit of the Auditor-General's Office itself, you have powers as the honourable Speaker of the House.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>2108 Audit Bill 2024 2 nd October, 2024 You appoint the auditor to audit the Office of the Auditor-General. And again, you know it is an important principle, because it puts every institution in a situation where they are accountable, and of course as a Parliamentary process, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of the Public Accounts Standing Committee is very important and more Public Accounts Committees around the world take more interest in the work of the Office of the Auditor-General. But the important principle, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are including in this important principle in this Bill, if I can add few more. One, is of course protection from liability, performance audits and compliance audits. Timing and publication of reports as honourable, Koya raised. Procedural fairness in relation to reports, notification of serious irregularities, review of audits and of course the principle of independence. So, a lot of the strengthening of the Audit Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is strengthening that principle of independence and we are looking at all the key pillars of independence or key pillars of supreme audit institutions whether it is a Lima Declaration, whether it is the Mexican or Mexico Declaration of 2007. These are all principles that have been enunciated very well by international institutions, including the UN resolutions on independence and existence of the Auditor-General's Office, the powers, et cetera. So, what we have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is bring all these international principles together, look at what they are and how they are going to strengthen the independence of the Auditor-General's Office and support the governance. One last point before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is quite a misconception that some people have about government grants. There are people out there for example, let us say the Attorney- General's Office is holding a conference in Nadi and spending about $300,000 or $400,000. And people look at the Attorney-General and say, we want the audit report. How much you are spending? That is not the way it is done. These are part of government expenditure. So, when a grant is given, there is a grant agreement, there are certain requirements that abetted by the Auditor-General’s Office, the Solicitor- General's Office, and the requirements are that the audited reports will come to the ministries and the Ministry of Finance. And then, the Auditor-General, as part of its audit process and will look at all that. So, I just wanted to clarify that, I think honourable Koya raised that about grants. Otherwise, the Auditor-General's Office will be auditing 150 grants and spend all the time. That is not the principle about auditing grants. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to once again thank all the honourable Members for their comments. I think they are very useful. I wish all the members of the Standing Committee who are going to look at this report, all the best and we look forward to the report. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed. [Audit Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17/2024) read a second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for deliberation, and to report back to Parliament in the December Sitting.] MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members.
