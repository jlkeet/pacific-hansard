<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to todayâ€™s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. Year 8 Students &amp; Teachers - Yat Sen Primary School Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the Year 8 students and Teachers of Yat Sen Primary School. I know you did your very best in your Eighth Year Exams last week, but it does not stop there, children. So, keep on doing your best in school, and welcome to Parliament. You have some of your colleagues from that famous school of Yat Sen sitting here amongst us. I will not name them but, at least, they should be able to come around and meet and talk with you, just to encourage you. You stay on course in the studies that you are doing, and who knows, maybe one day you will end up like your former school mates who are here with us in Parliament. All the best!</p></body>
