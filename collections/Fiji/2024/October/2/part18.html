<body><h3>SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REVIEW REPORT –PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES FOR ADB MEETING</h3><p>SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REVIEW REPORT – PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES FOR ADB MEETING HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Special Investigation Report on Procurement of Goods and Services in relation to the 52 nd Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting which was tabled on 5 th September, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament. As the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, to move the motion, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion for the Review of the Special Investigation Report on Procurement of Goods and Services in relation to the 52 nd Asian Development Bank Annual General Meeting. Mr. Speaker, I will not go into the background in much detail but basically it is an investigation of plausible material mismanagement in the Ministry of Public Service focussing on funds used for the hosting of the 52 nd Asian Development Bank Annual General Meeting in Nadi in 2019 where we spent a total of $10.9 million VAT inclusive price. Apart from going through the Report of the Office of the Auditor-General, the Committee on 22 nd November, invited the Ministry of Public Service for a written response as well as a presentation on the issues raised. The Ministry of Finance was also invited to clarify issues, as well as the Ministry of Finance Internal Audit team which carried out the preliminary audit with the discussion or written response from Ms. Susan Kiran, the former Permanent Secretary. Unfortunately, due to the lapse of time, some of those responsible had left and could not be able to include them including the then Permanent Secretary. The summary of findings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the three objectives to ascertain if a fraud exists in payments. The Office of the Auditor-General found that there was sufficient audit evidence to determine if there was an existence of fraud. The second is to ascertain if payments were made in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations. We found that generally there was non-compliance or there were anomalies on payments and the inability to manage the conflict of interest arising from the appointment of the Events Transport Provider. Then there was the issue of non-compliance on payments due to the lack of capacity, lack</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>2116 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2 nd October, 2024 of segregation of duties and timely planning. There is also significant delays in the processing of ADB meeting events major contracts. Objective 3 is on the limitation of the FMIS system over the processing of payments or other transactions to provide avenues for the misappropriation of Government funds. The Office of the Auditor-General noted that limitation existed in the FMIS. The FMIS at that time allowed reopening of prior year’s open account payables and there was no document, policy and guideline in place to assist the user on FMIS. What the Committee found in addition to the findings by the Office of the Auditor-General was that the main cause of weakness was the setup of a project team by the Ministry of Civil Service. This consisted of contractors and civil servants with poor coordination amongst the civil servants leading to the low level of accountability. We found that there were issues with the Ministry of Civil Service that they were not able to manage the level of funding of around $10 million. They did not have an Accounts Department to manage the payments process. There was no Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) or even a Finance Manual for that matter. An important issue, the report itself was late even when it was completed in December 2020, it came to Parliament on 27 th March, 2023. That was around three years later. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good that the investigation was not conducted as subsequent to the Report, improvements were done by the Ministry of Civil Service and the current Permanent Secretary who managed to forward the cases and the report to FICAC. With those words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I submit this Report to the Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I have a list with me provided by the Whips. Before I go into that, please be reminded honourable Members this is another case, $10 million is involved here of taxpayers’ funds which and it needs close scrutiny and oversight as well. The batting will be as follows: (1) Honourable A. A. Maharaj; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises; (3) Honourable P. K. Ravunawa; (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute briefly on this Special Investigations Report on the 52nd Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting which was held in Denarau. More than 3,582 attendees from both public and private sectors, visitors from around 76 countries and over 30 side meetings, seminars and debates took place during that particular Annual General Meeting. Nevertheless, the initial budget for this particular event was $19 million and was then revised to $10 million but the actual amount used was $10.9 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this event gave us a good economic advantage and prosperous to Fiji because if we recall, soon after this particular Annual General Meeting, we went into COVID-19. It was through the negotiations that took place in this particular Convention that we were able to secure some interest-free loan during COVID-19. There were also certain loans that were approved during</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2117 COVID-19 which resulted from the negotiations in this meeting whereby we did not have to pay for quite a number of years and after that, then we had to pay the sum amount and not the interest because it was given to us at zero percent interest. If we look at it in entirety, some of these amounts would have been in a way, 50 percent was supposed to be paid by the government and 50 percent was issued to the Government in terms of grants. These were some of the advantages that came through after having an event of this magnitude. Never ever before we actually had an event in Fiji with this magnitude, mostly what we would actually have overseas. But nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the findings were quite interesting when we started investigating into this Report because whether it was $10, $100 or in this case $10 million, if there is a mismanagement of funds, it needs to be investigated. If there is any kind of fraudulent act that has been performed, it should be referred to the appropriate authorities. In this case, what was actually surprising was that after this event, someone went into FMIS and voiding all the payments, not just for this year but going back to 2015. What also was surprising was the Chief Accounting Officer not doing anything about this particular case. These were some of the things that raised the eyebrows of the Office of the Auditor-General because then there was also an investigation conducted by Internal Audit from the Ministry of Finance and these two reports were assessed by the Office of the Auditor-General before they carried out this independent investigation into ADB. If we look at the amount of money that was mis-appropriated, it was close to around $10,000. If we look at the ratio around $10 million to $10,000, it comes to around 0.1 percent. But as I have said, a mismanagement is a mismanagement. In this case, what we have seen when the Ministry of Civil Service was created, they had a budget of close to around $1.5 million to $3 million only. But then when there was a reform in the Ministry of Health, the doctor’s salary was transferred from Ministry of Health to Ministry of Civil Service. The Chief Accounting Officer at that point in time, who was the Permanent Secretary should have developed a fully-fledged Accounts Department in the Ministry of Civil Service. What was happening, they were relying on the Accounts Department from the Ministry of Employment. Basically, the staff were loaned from the Ministry of Employment to the Ministry of Civil Service to look after close to around $40 million which was the salary of the doctors. Then when we actually had the event of this magnitude of around $10 million which was precedence in the sense that we never had this kind of event prior to this, the Ministry of Civil Service opted to take it on board and without realising that they do not have a formal Accounts Department within the Civil Service. When they actually started negotiating, going in, preparing for this particular event, that was the time all these mismanagement, misappropriation and data actually started to go missing. What we actually expected back then was for the Permanent Secretary who was the Chief Accounting Officer to take action but the report was handed to the Permanent Secretary back then from the Events Coordinator and nothing was done. One good thing that came out, that it came to Parliament and then to the Public Accounts Committee. Unfortunately, the Public Accounts Committee at that point in time did not have the powers to initiate that kind of investigation but through the Ministry of Civil Service and the Permanent Secretary, the case had been referred to FICAC. In a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Committee’s findings there was no fully fledged Accounts section. No action was taken against the alleged officers. It was stated in the report that according to the Ministry of Civil Service, our preparation was not up to the expectation of ADB but still they went ahead with that.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>2118 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2 nd October, 2024 Sir, there were shortfalls which led to mismanagement of funds but again I reiterate, we need to look at the nominal value as well and not generalise that there was fraud, for example, $1 million or $2 million but there was a certain amount for which accountability was missing. But the events after that led to it, going into FEMIS and removing the payment system, all that raised eyebrows. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the work of the Public Accounts Committee and its Members. The recommendations are practical. Most of them are now being actioned especially with the Ministry of Civil Service. One good thing is, in future if we have to organise an event of this magnitude, at least, now we have a SOP as to how we should go about conducting and facilitating such an event in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk very briefly on the Report before us, because it makes for very embarrassing reading actually. Nice try, honourable Maharaj. Sir, when we look at this Report, you will recall that I used the analogy of the Nabukalou Creek. During high tide everything looks lovely and rosy but at low tide is a mess. This Report actually precisely demonstrates what I have said before. Again, of course, all of us looked in admiration when the 52 nd ADB Meeting took place. A lot of positives actually happened, but, at the end of the day, what does ADB think of us in terms of the money we spent? That to me is probably the most concerning thing from this Report because, yes, we have gone ahead and done a few deals to help us through COVID-19 but again there will be a niggling feeling about accountability and things like that. We can talk about transparency and all these kinds of things, but this Report just says and I hope, even our side of the House will learn from this, that things need to be done properly. We need to resource projects properly, we need to have the right people in the right place, we need to have the right ministries doing the work that is expected and finally, always get advice from your accountants or your bean counters, in this instance, the Ministry of Finance. It appears from the Report there was little, if any, guidance from the Ministry of Finance. Some of the things that I thought I would highlight, Sir, as the Office of the Auditor-General noted and also the Committee that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there is fraud. I hope that FICAC does follow through with the investigation whether it is $10,000 or $1 million, it should be investigated. There were instances when payments were made on inflated invoice amounts or invoices were used as a quotation to support payments. There were instances where unjustified payment of variations of contract, competitive quotes were not obtained, goods and services were not procured without issuance of Local Purchase Orders and there was no evidence to substantiate the receipt of goods. In addition, there was an inability to manage the conflict of interest arising from the appointment of the Event Transport Provider who was also the contracted Professional Conference Organiser (PCO). It was noted that the PCO did not act in the best interest of the Government when its own transport fleet was engaged to provide transport services without following open and transparent procurement procedures. I will use the word that the honourable Usamate says a lot in this House, “flabbergasted” or as we say in iTaukei sometimes, “ sa vakamadua sara ga.” When we have these kinds of opportunities to showcase ourselves internationally, we need to ensure that our ducks are in a row and with things in order because otherwise, we start being looked at as the laughingstock, sadly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to say with the Report in front of us and I thank the Committee for coming up with this Report, that this suggests a major breakdown in processes and procedures;</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2119 everything that you think could go wrong with a piece of project work is right here in this report. I know that as mentioned by honourable Maharaj and also the honourable Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the Civil Service has since implemented a lot of the recommendations that were proposed and that is a positive, of course. But, for all of us in this august Chamber, I think there are some lessons from this Report that we need to take to heart as we plot our way forward in the new Fiji. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister and Members of Parliament, thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Special Investigation on the Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts that was tabled on 5 th September, 2024 and the Review Report by the Committee in the outcome of their scrutiny of the accounting process followed on the Procurement of Goods and Services during the 52 nd ADB Meeting held in Nadi from 1 st to 5 th May, 2019. The finding of the audit, Mr. Speaker presented to us today revealed indeed a disturbing and essential reality by the Ministry of Civil Service. There is a significant degree of non-compliance as alluded to by the previous speaker; non-compliance with rules and regulations pertinent to the procurement of goods and services which include the mismanagement of the Financial Management Act 2004, Finance Instructions 2010, Procurement Regulation and the amended Regulation in 2012, Ministry of Labour and Industrial Relations, Employment Finance Manual 2013, FMIS Access and Password Policy, ADB 2019 Green Book and the General Best Practices. Mr. Speaker, the Office of the Auditor-General confirmed to the Committee that the criteria tested in each of the investigations were sufficient to conclude on the objectives set out on this audit. It was revealed in their professional findings the discrepancy as were noted, has also been alluded to by the previous speakers. It was also noted that there was an absence of disciplinary action on those who are implicated in this default and embezzlement of the taxpayer funds, and this is very serious, Mr. Speaker. Upon deeper analysis of this finding, it seems that the issue stems out from lack of capacity, inadequate segregation of duty, untimely planning by the Ministry of Civil Service for Procurement of Goods and Services, poor handling or processing of quotations and the non-issuance of LPO and the controlled weaknesses of the settlement of invoice are the manifestations of these deficiencies. To resolve this concern. Mr. Speaker, I support the Committee's recommendation to establish a fully-fledged professional accounting team to oversee and monitor the accounting system and the processes whenever we have events of such magnitude. An entity dedicated to upholding the sanctity of our procurement process would deter future instances of non-compliance and reflect our commitment to transparency, accountability and practice of good governance. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, it is critical for us to consider this finding and commit to a part of progressive reform within ministries and departments. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Standing Committee of Public Accounts for presenting this comprehensive Review Report with its recommendations to Parliament, despite the multiple challenges they faced. Their endeavour aid us in our effort to improve, and their recommendations, Mr. Speaker, brings light to the path ahead of us towards an efficient, transparent and accountable procurement system, also we can learn and take on lessons learned from this Report. Let us come together and, navigate this path of transformation towards a transparent, efficient and a robust procurement process. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members who have spoken before me. This Report is important because it does shed light on the critical importance of</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>2120 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2 nd October, 2024 integrity in Government procurement and I must say that having been in Government the last 20 months, there is an area where we have experienced serious issues with respect to having the right and qualified people in place for Government procurement projects, and that ensuring our processes are up to-date. I could go on and on of what happened in the past. We had issues such as procurement waivers for $4.6 million during COP23, but what I want to do today is, not dwell on what happened in the past. When we were in Opposition, we used to raise this very strongly. Some of the lessons that we have learnt being in Opposition and looking at reports of that nature, I think, all we can do is to move forward and improve the various processes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19, and I know the point raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica are important points that we should all remember as a Government, as Members of Parliament, and I think more importantly for our civil servants, particularly those who are responsible for procurement. All these events of the past whether it is COVID-19, whether it is holding big conferences, we hold conferences on a daily basis, there are requests that come to me on a daily basis on waiver of tender for procurement, and there are some valid cases and events, for example, booking hotels. You cannot call for tender, it is impractical because the price keeps changing. When a particular Ministry, for example, Office of the Attorney- General is holding the Attorney-General’s Conference, then what we get is a request for tender waiver for procurement of the services for a hotel. They make sense, they need to be done. But, a more strategic, forward looking procurement approach is essential to ensure that Government processes are executed with the utmost integrity and efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the House, that the Ministry of Finance is taking a very proactive comprehensive approach to address these issues. We have reviewed the procurement regulations, and we have obtained Cabinet approval. For that, we are currently reviewing the financial instructions to complement the implementation of the new FMIS system thereby bolstering the integrity and the efficiency of our procurement and payment system. Sometimes it is the efficiency of the system that puts officials, officers, and different Ministries, there is urgency, things need to be done, and things do not go right. Sometimes it is not deliberate. It is just that the systems are not working. So, we are focusing on issues such as the processes and the systems. In fact, the Ministry of Civil Service, the reforms that happened in the past, when the Public Service Commission, roles were taken by Ministry of Public Service; things happen. Even now the Ministry of Public Service (Public Service Commission) the clarification on payment of allowances, appointments, acting appointments, we find that there is lack of clarity. So, the staff cannot be blamed all the time in some of those cases. The new FMIS system, Mr. Speaker, Sir is going to improve a lot of the data, systems and records and that will help. For example, honourable Maharaj talked about the void payments and how can we avoid all the wide range of risks that are involved in something like that. Unauthorised modifications, so the system that we have got now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has got enhanced controls and they will serve as a safeguard against financial irregularities, and thereby protecting those who are involved in doing it as well as making sure that taxpayers funds are not wasted. The recently approved Cabinet Procurement Regulations 24, Mr. Speaker, Sir, represent a significant step forward. In addition to value for money, integrity, accountability and fair competition, we have incorporated risk management and sustainability as new principles of government procurement. All Ministries are undertaking procurement projects or who are undertaking procurement projects must ensure that these principles are followed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working currently on comprehensive procurement guidelines to</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2121 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working currently on comprehensive procurement guidelines to complement the new procurement regulations, and these guidelines will provide clear, unambiguous guidance to ministry personnel involved in procurement. We plan to implement the regulations and guidelines by March 2025 on top of the improvement, Sir, that have been made. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, all want to say is that there are lot of issues from the past. We have to acknowledge that. It is there. Some of them have not been resolved. Some of them have never been investigated, whether it is to do with the issues within the Public Service or within Public Enterprises, Public Cooperations, but these are issues that are there. However, we have as Ministry of Finance and as a government focussed on improving some of those processes and systems. And I am confident, Mr. Speaker, that this will help the whole of Government. Let me just repeat this very important point, that for procurement, that is a very critical area for Government in terms of the use of taxpayers’ funds because everything that the Ministries do, every project that they do, services they provide, a lot of it is dependent on how quickly, how efficiently the Ministry staff, for example the Ministry of Health. The honourable Minister for Health has all the good policies. There is a lot of advocacy. But what we find is when medicine does not reach Savusavu, it is nothing to do with doctors, nurses and those who are responsible for providing those services is Savusavu or Labasa. It is the procurement. It is the ability of the ministries procurement sections to be able to do that, plan that ahead, if you do not planned it, you can get the drugs on time and those who have worked in the Ministry of Health will understand this. All I want to say is that this is a very, very important area. I am happy that the investigation report or investigation by the Auditor-General, interrogation by the Public Accounts Committee and the public enunciation of these issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In Parliament is an important signal to those who are involved in procurement. We look forward to more improvements as I said in terms of the reviews that we have done. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call on the honourable Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to speak in reply. HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate this afternoon on the Report. I think we all agree there is a need for accountability in everything we do and also for future events, we need to have specific SOP for all events set up before we carried out such events of that magnitude. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the Ministry of Civil Service as well as the other Government Ministries and Departments to learn from this experience so that it does not occur in the future. The Ministry of Civil Service to continue to follow up follow up with FICAC on those other cases apart from the $10,000 loss that is stated in the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Before Parliament is asked to vote, honourable Members with due respect to the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I will be invoking Standing Order 20 to refer the matter to the Subcommittee on Public Accounts to investigate further. This will be an addition to the matter that I had referred on yesterday, and I will await the report from the Standing Committee once more from your Subcommittee. Question put.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>2122 Special Investigation Review Report – Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 2 nd October, 2024 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. There is another disturbance on my right, probably signalling that we have been here for too long, but I thank you for all your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 6.56 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77</p></body>
