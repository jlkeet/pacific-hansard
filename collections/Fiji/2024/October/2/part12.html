There will be no other debate. Update on the World Surf League Corona Fiji Pro HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, and ladies and gentlemen listening through the radio or watching through television or livestream or from the gallery, I take great pleasure in providing an update on the recently held World Surf League Corona Fiji Pro. Fiji is known for many things. We are known for our hospitality, our culture, our beaches and our friendliness, and our goal is to add to that list, top- tier global events is, of course, one of them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the support of Government and the private sector, we successfully brought back the World Surf League (WSL) Fiji Pro after seven years. This is a three-year partnership where the first event was held from 19th August to 23rd August at Cloudbreak, Tavarua. This event not only showcases our stunning natural landscapes, but also reinforced Fiji’s standing as a premier sports tourism destination on the global stage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, surfing is not a traditional spectator event, like rugby or football, where economic returns are largely measured based on how many seats we fill in a stadium. Instead, its economic value is measured by global brand exposure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cloudbreak has gained global fame for its powerful and flawless left-hand reef break, making it a top choice for surfers and a key reason for Fiji’s celebrated to return to the World Surf League event. The 2024 Corona Fiji Pro presented by Bonsoy was Event 9, which is the final event for the 2024 Championship Tour before the finals. Event 9 delivers a much higher audience, as it decides the final five men and women who then go into the finals. And next year, we will be the final stop. So, this will be a strategic advantage to Fiji. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Fiji Pro has set a new benchmark for international events in Fiji, contributing significantly to various sectors of our economy. Allow me to detail the multiple benefits this event has brought to our nation. We had the honour of having the President of Fiji His Excellency, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere officiate the opening of the Event. My colleague, the Shadow Minister for Tourism, honourable Koya, was also present. Mr. Speaker Sir, the economic ripple effects of the Fiji Pro Event has been widespread, particularly in our tourism and hospitality sectors. In the Corona Fiji Pro Event, 36 athletes from 12 countries participated. The event also brought event organisers, support staff, media personnel, and passionate surf fans. Our hotels and resorts have seen a marked increase in occupancy. In terms of direct economic returns, you are looking at airfare, accommodation, food and beverage, transport and taxes in the local economy. Preliminary assessments indicate that this singular event has generated millions of dollars in direct and indirect economic benefits. Local businesses, including restaurants tour operators and service providers have all experienced increased patronage. This, in turn, strengthens the very foundation of our tourism-based economy which has been steadily recovering since the global pandemic.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>2052</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 The financial impact of such international events extends far beyond the event itself, creating a sustainable flow of income that boosts local and national economies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, hosting the Fiji Pro has elevated Fiji’s profile globally. The extensive media coverage, including live broadcasts and media engagement has showcased not only the event, but Fiji’s natural beauty and world-class surfing to millions of viewers worldwide. Mr. Speaker Sir, our preliminary analysis shows over $2.5 million in total brand media value of exposure for Tourism Fiji in social media. We are looking at 205 total branded social posts that produced over 45 million impressions and 29 million video views. The event also delivered over $255,000 in media plan value for Tourism Fiji and 2.3K global PR hits with over $50.4 million in global advertising value equivalency across 36 countries. Mr. Speaker Sir, the event was also supported by global brands, such as Corona, Red Bull, Yeti, Shiseido and Apple Watch. So, we strategically maximised the Fijian brand. The exposure is invaluable for our tourism sector. Mr. Speaker Sir, I also wanted to share the impact the event had on our communities and our people. The WSL rebuild the Cloudbreak surf tower, which was destroyed during TC Harold in 2020, after being operational since the mid-1990s. This is now being gifted to Tabanivono-i-Wai as a legacy asset to monetise via renting the tower out for other events. I also acknowledge the cash contribution made to the Nabila and Momi Villages. Mr. Speaker Sir, the event also saw support to the Fiji Surfing Association and local surfing community. The WSL delivered a three-day women’s development programme and a water safety programme. A local surfer received a place in the Fiji Pro Event as a wildcard and donation of cash and items to the Fiji Surfing Association. Mr. Speaker Sir, we also staged a ‘live site’ in Denarau, to allow locals and other guests who could not go out to Cloudbreak to also watch the event live. One of the other aspects of Fiji Pro Event has been its contribution to jobs and skill development, from event management, logistics and security to hospitality services and transportation; local talent was heavily involved in the planning and execution of this world-class event. Importantly, these employment opportunities did not just provide temporary income. They also quipped many of our people with valuable skills and experience that can be leveraged in future events. This adds long-term value to our workforce and positions us favourably in the highly competitive tourism sector. Mr. Speaker Sir, an event of this scale would not be complete without a firm commitment to environmental sustainability. I am pleased to report that the Fiji Pro Event upheld the highest standards of environmental stewardship. Initiatives, such as the ocean forest diversity, marine environment protection projects and no single-use plastics were also positive contributions. Furthermore, one of the standout initiatives was the encouragement of participants and visitors to plant coral in nearby reefs – an act that directly contributes to the preservation of our marine ecosystems. We have long recognised that our natural environment is one of our greatest assets, and we must protect it for future generations. The Fiji Pro has served as a platform to promote environmental conservation, particularly in safeguarding our oceans and coral reefs. This approach aligns with our broader national goals for</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2053 sustainable tourism development where we balance economic growth with environmental protection. Mr. Speaker Sir, looking ahead, the success of the Fiji Pro positions us favourably to attract more international events. In line with our tourism diversification strategy, we are already exploring new partnerships and avenues to host a variety of international events. These opportunities will continue to deliver significant economic, social and environmental benefits. The ongoing collaboration with the WSL, in particular, is a cornerstone of our efforts to solidify Fiji’s place on the international sports tourism map. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Fiji Pro Event has been a success for our country. It has boosted our economy, created employment, showcased our culture and reinforced our commitment to environmental sustainability. Most importantly, it has demonstrated our capacity to host world class events and has positioned Fiji as a leading destination for sports tourism. As we build on this success, I have every confidence that Fiji will continue to thrive as a global tourism and events destination, bringing long-term benefits to our people and our economy. We look forward to even greater achievements in the years to come. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu, and I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, right at the outset, I want to say “congratulations” to the honourable Minister for Tourism for finally acknowledging the benefits of sports tourism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one must understand that if we focus on our conservative traditional markets, that is just a norm for Fiji. We cannot really just rely on weddings and our return visitors, et cetera. It will become sluggish, and we will have stagnant growth. But we knew that before, in order to expand our tourism industry, we had to look at what were the other avenues. We knew that sports tourism was huge business around the world. There was a lot of information being passed back and forth from the Opposition at that particular time about the golf tournament, et cetera. But I am so happy to see that now, the light is shining bright with respect sports tourism. Now, the honourable Minister understands the importance of global market visibility.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Let love shine:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> That is alright, it is not an issue, honourable Minister. At that time, you probably were not well versed with respect to how the benefits work but I am really happy too and fully supportive of what you are actually doing at the moment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is events like the World Surfing League, coming and running a competition in Fiji, is a great move in the right direction. Although it is coming back after a few years, there were some issues before that, but it has been resolved. Fiji now is becoming an actual desirable destination with respect to sports tourism, Mr. Speaker Sir. It is becoming a major sports destination. We can also see now that we can even hold musical concerts that are bringing in substantial amounts of money. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may remember, that we had several sporting events that were sponsored</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>2054</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 in part by Government at that time, but we needed to put ourselves on the market and we did. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to put things into perspective, that direct expenditure (and I think I am talking about sports in general), in sports tourism roughly equates to about $67.1million. We have roughly about 21,000 individuals employed in that particular sector, which equates to 520 full time jobs. This comes out of a survey that was done by Tourism Fiji with the assistance of the Market Development Facility through the Australian Government. The average spend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to our visitors is about $6,877 that is during their stay. So, the total expenditure is about $40 million and if you break it down, that is about 40,000 visitor nights. So, you can see what sports tourism does for Fiji, Mr. Speaker Sir. The benefits actually goes beyond just normal specific economic immediate gains; there are long term gains. Ninety percent of those people that were surveyed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, said, “Oh, we will be back.” They find a new avenue. Just to put it into perspective, the gentleman surfer who is actually quite famous, you might have all seen it during the Olympics, he was on top of the wave with a symbol on his hand, basically just a single finger pointing upwards, and the picture was taken. That generated a lot of interest. That gentleman, Gabriel Medina, comes from Brazil, Sir. When we did this surfing in the beginning, just the viewership alone, because he has such a huge following, put Fiji on the map with respect to sports tourism. And not just sports tourism, people are wanting to come in, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, all in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you look at sports tourism, it is not just about surfing, it is about our Drua also that have created a huge interest in Fiji in terms of sports tourism - our rugby team, our Super Rugby team - the Drua and also our normal rugby team. We want to ensure also that maybe, one day we can actually start holding a HSBC 7s series here. Also, we do have the facilities, and I am sure the honourable Minister is actually working on seeing what can be done in conjunction with the Fiji Rugby Union, despite all the little difficulties that they currently face. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do hope that the Ministry of Tourism will look at actually growing surfing in Fiji. It is a big and lucrative sport. But as I have said earlier, with sports like this, in terms of golf, surfing and other sports that actually happen in Fiji, that is not just common sports, we have a large viewership. And if you put all of that into the equation in terms of the amount of dollars that we are looking at, we would not be able to spend that much in terms of marketing. Sir, I take my hat off to the honourable Minister for hosting a great surfing tournament and we hope to see a whole more sporting activities in terms of our tourism industry happening in Fiji. And most of all, Mr. Speaker Sir, I take my hat to all the tourism operators that take part and all those who have assisted in it. I think they have done a fantastic job. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka! I now call on the honourable leader of G-9 Bloc or his designate. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement and, of course, the update on the World Surf Lead Corona Fiji Pro. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as rightly said by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we cannot over emphasise the importance of sports tourism in Fiji. You know that hosting this kind of international sporting event on our shores brings a lot of growth in our economy and also our social networks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one important point about such an event is that they do bring large crowd</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2055 of fans with them, just like rugby. When you have world class surfers and a world champion like Kelly Slater, who participated in the Fiji Pro a number of times, these are world class athletes, worth $40million, for this particular guy, and has more than 5 million followers competing in the Fiji Pro, they surely bring fortunes and fans with them. They stay in our hotels, like the honourable Deputy Prime Minister said, they eat in our restaurants, and they use our transport mediums. So, when they depart, they leave behind millions of dollars for our people and for our economy. Just a point for the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, hosting more international events will mean investing on sporting infrastructure. We need to upgrade our facilities to comply with international standards if we are to get more competitions. I know Government is moving in that direction, and I want to thank the Ministry of Sports and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for working on that part. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a suggestion to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Australia will be hosting the 2026 Rugby League World Cup. It will be a boost to our sports tourism if we can have some of these competitions played in our sporting grounds. So, Deputy Prime Minister, we hope that you will work with the organisers on this particular event, if we can have some of those games in Fiji. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Statement and the great work his Ministry is doing in promoting and coordinating more sporting tourism events in Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- You may note, honourable Tuinaceva that I laughed a bit because instead of pronouncing the Minister for Tourism, you mentioned the name of the Deputy Speaker. Sa malo e! Update on Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians, ladies and gentlemen, and Students and Teachers who are with us today from Yat Sen Primary School, welcome. I thank you for the opportunity to address this House regarding the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) and specifically some updates on incidents, remedial actions and also a brief on derelict abandoned ships on our shores and the work of MSAF. Sir, MSAF plays a very critical role in enhancing safe shipping and cleaner seas throughout the 1.8 million square kilometres of Fiji’s maritime space. So, MSAF is working towards being a dynamic and internationally respected, regulator provider and promoter of maritime safety and maritime environment protection. Sir, in terms overview of incidents, a total of 94 incidents from the year 2021 to the present, have been recorded by MSAF. The trend shows that 31 incidents was recorded in 2021, 10 incidents in 2022, 34 incidents in 2023 and 19 incidents recorded so far in 2024. These incidents include vessel groundings, collisions, equipment failures and non- compliance with maritime safety regulations. Out of this total, 80 percent were classified as major, 10 percent of the incidents resulted in fatalities and 1 percent resulted in serious injury. The remaining incidents were minor with no significant impact on life or property. Some of the primary causes identified are human error, adverse weather conditions and insufficient and poor maintenance of vessels. Some of the examples Mr. Speaker, Sir, also include a</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2056</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 vessel on 21 st December, 2033, which was drifting and towed back due to a power failure. Sir, MSAF insisted on the offloading of passengers for alternative routes, and this was implemented. One of the issues regarding this was power backup. Again, this survey had been conducted and a list of defects identified and directed to this particular company. This vessel is still being detained in terms of lack of compliance and also the need to work on those defects. There was one which was prevented from sailing due to air conditioning defects. This was, again, detained but eventually, that was addressed, and the vessel was allowed to be operational again. There was another regarding ramp malfunction, again, this was detained until that was rectified, then allowed to operate. There was another incident which, on 9th March, 2024, lost power and had to be towed to Suva. Again, this had to do with the on-board power backup and this is still detained. So, MSAF is engaged in more investigation and compliance, and ensuring the safety of passengers as we move forward. Related to this is more investigation trainings and auditor trainings for seafarers and vessel operators and focusing on compliance with the national safety regulations and emergency procedures through the IMO International Safety Management Systems and the Local Ships Safety Management Systems. Increased awareness campaigns are conducted through surveys and inspection of ships, and this is strengthened to build capacity for our officers. Further, increase port inspections of vessels have been implemented to ensure adherence to safety standards. These include frequent checks on safety equipment, effectiveness of the ships’ planned maintenance systems and overall operational readiness. In addition, MSAF is also in the process of recruiting more staff to strengthen its presence in the outer stations, and we will continue to expand our services in terms of coverage of Suva, Lautoka, Levuka and other local jetties and boat landing spots. Revisions to existing maritime regulations have been initiated to address gaps identified during incident investigations. These includes stricter penalties for non-compliance and more rigorous safety checks for high risk vessels which have been evident with the recent reactivation of the infringement notices in June this year. This process, from 20 th May to 24 th May, involves informing all maritime stakeholders, including ship masters, seafarers and ship owners, mariners and marine service operators. Effective from 1 st June, 2024, MSAF will commence the issuance of maritime safety infringement notices pursuant to sections 262 and 263 of the Maritime Transport Act 2013. This involves the issuance of notices specifying infringement offences and notices which give operators specific timelines to address issues. So, the law must be enforced, and this is what this Coalition Government is about enforcing laws in terms of our maritime safety and shipping operators. Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF is also actively conducting outreach programmes in remote areas to raise awareness about maritime safety practices. These programmes target local maritime communities, boat builders and small vessel operators. In addition, ongoing efforts to include closer collaboration with law enforcement agencies and maritime partners, such as Fiji Water Police, Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Environment and other relevant maritime stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also progressing towards digital transformation of processes and records to ensure that the identification of non-compliance, et cetera, is provided as per the real time</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2057 data for enforcement purposes. In terms of navigational aid, including beacons and buoys are in progress to improve guidance for vessels navigating through challenging routes. There is a five-year plan to improve navigation aids that have been damaged in the past years through the various weather events. Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF continues to seek technical cooperation in the Ministry in this regard, and recently we had hosted Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries together where visits were done to local lighthouses, beacons and other infrastructure which needed upgrading, and continued partnership in that regard, is being pursued. So, in terms of that, one of the issues, which we do not want to dwell on the past, but if the Marine Department of PWD was there, these issues would not have come up. In terms of the deterioration of our navigational aids and beacons, the Marine Department used to work on time to address these issues efficiently and effectively so that there are no risks in terms of our navigational aids. As I have mentioned, I do not want to dwell on the past as some of the honourable Opposition Members have been doing. But, in reality, the Marine Department was like a Public Works Department. They were constantly moving around in the whole of the maritime islands to monitor, check and fix the navigational aids. But that was done away with and, again, taken up by the private sector which, as we have seen, has not been really effective and efficient in that regard. So, we are doing a catch up in terms of the damage done by the past Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of planned future action, we plan to (in terms of MSAF) conduct a comprehensive audit of all commercial and passenger vehicles in this financial year, to ensure compliance and updated safety standards. This includes advanced training for incident management and adoption of new technologies for monitoring and enforcement. This week two Australian Maritime Safety Authority senior staff are in Fiji to conduct port state and flex state surveys and enforcement training to all of the MSAF surveyors and enforcement officers. The training is made possible through MSAF membership of the Asia-Pacific Regional arrangement on Maritime Safety and Maritime Environment Protection as espoused in the Tokyo MOU Framework. It is building capacity in terms of our MOU local capacity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned, the proposal for legislative amendments are already underway, to tighten the regulations and introduce mandatory incident reporting for all maritime operators. The review entails mandatory marine spill vessel insurance, shipwreck insurance and assessing the compliance requirements and standards, including restricting the age of imported vessels. We also include the possible lowering of the vessel deregistration age. The MSAF remains committed to enhancing maritime safety through continuous improvement, as I have mentioned specifically, also through regulatory framework, enforcement mechanisms and public awareness. On the Pacific regional maritime scene, MSAF has commenced negotiations to establish bilateral MOUs with maritime safety administrations of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. This will enhance the cooperation within the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) and through the MSG Framework in partnership with other maritime nations. The same arrangement will extend to other Pacific Island Forum Member Countries as we are progressing towards supporting the SPC initiative to a Pacific-One Maritime Framework, harmonisation and recognition of Maritime Safety Standards, protection of the maritime environment and capacity building of seafarers across the region. For the future, next year, MSAF will be looking at the same arrangement on MOUs with Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2058</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 In terms of an ongoing issue on marine pollution and derelict ships, through partnership with other maritime partners and stakeholders, in this case the Fiji Ports Corporation Limited have together, derived working data on wrecks, derelicts and abandoned vessels, especially within Fiji’s port boundaries. Sir, a joint MSAF and FPCL Committee on removal of these vessels have been formed and convened on a weekly basis to fast-track the removal processes under the Seaport Management Act and Maritime Transport Act. Both legislations outlined provisions for the removal process to wrecks, derelicts and abandoned vessels. Unfortunately, nothing concrete had been done in the past and I do not want to dwell into the past. Unfortunately, this has been an ongoing issue, and the Coalition Government is dealing with this ongoing problem of derelict vessels which honourable Ketan Lal had also raised, apart from the ongoing pothole issue he has raised. I am pleased to advise that the Joint Committee is working closely with the removal processes. In fact, a meeting has identified wrecks, derelicts and abandoned vehicles and through the FPCL Seaport Management Act processes, all these owners and agents were issued with the Letter of Vessel Concern at the meeting. The Letter of Vessel Concern is for the owner to upgrade the vessel to seaworthiness, or failure to do that within 30 days will result in a Removal Process Letter which they should act on within 21 days. So, failure to comply will result in vessel seizure, removal or auction if the vessel has any value. For the MSAF process, all Fiji registered vessels under this category are to deregister, a full survey conducted to determine seaworthiness and viability, and if beyond economic repairs, then the vessel is seized for removal either through scuttling, scraping and sinking at identified diving areas of more than 30 metres, mostly for recreational diving purposes and fish spawning. Of course, with full consultation with the Department of Environment. With the timeframe in terms of what I have described, the first tangible removal of vessels should begin to happen from November 2024 onwards. There have been issues raised with passenger movement in terms of the management of passengers during peak periods. This is an ongoing concern, not only from the members of the public, but in terms of MSAF as the regulator, MSAF has instructed shipowners. One of the issues raised and identified is the mismatch between the tickets issued and the passengers, and the passengers allowable for that vessel. So, I urge ship operators and vessel operators to, please, put the safety of passengers as number one priority. So, whatever ticket you issue must be the one allowable for that passenger because the number of passengers on the boat is related to the capacity of that vessel and also the safety procedures and equipment in that vessel. For example, the number of life jackets must match the number of passengers. So, that is an issue which MSAF is emphasising right now and closely monitoring. The onus is on the operator to, please, ensure that number of tickets you sell does not exceed. Most of the overloading is in the peak season, for example, school holidays, Christmas and, again, this is an ongoing issue year in, year out. Sir, I have insisted on MSAF to, please, do its role as the regulator and apply the law, because I believe in the last Government, I am not sure of the implications of the MSAF regulation because there was sort of a tendency to look at that very liberally. So, the shipowners are fully aware of the plan and in addition, there needs to be standby vessels if there is an excess of passengers. It is the responsibility of ship operators. For connecting and preparing for unplanned mechanical breakdown, MSAF is stepping up the pace of routine and in-between surveys and spot checks of vessels and its machineries and onboard equipment.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2059 In terms of some of the 2023-2024 activities of MSAF, the Boat Master Licences and Restricted Marine Engineer Class 6 training programmes have been conducted where in excess of 1,500 participants were trained and also certified. In terms of the Survey and Registration programme, 629 registered vessels were surveyed and registered. These include small boats. Seafarers training and registration programme where more than 3,500 seafarers have completed assessment and certification. This is important because in a recent incident in Lau where a boat capsized, the operator was not certified and when someone is not certified, he is not aware of the safety procedures and what to do and what not to do in emergencies. Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF has launched a 5-year training plan to enhance staff competencies. Of course, the review of the Ship Management System and the Audit Framework and conducting maritime survey outreach programmes to remote locations. There is partnership between regional maritime authorities, digitalisation, and there is urgent work where there needs to be catch-up on repairing and upgrading the navigational aids and beacon across the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those were the updates in terms of MSAF and maritime environment and work which continues in terms of compliance and, particularly, for adherence of safety regulations in terms of our maritime operations, and the safety of our people in moving between our maritime provinces and our main islands. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn the House now for tea. Before doing so, I also invite the school children and those in the public gallery to join in and have some free time to discuss things with your, I do not know whether it is favourite Member of Parliament or most popular Member of Parliament since they will all be there having tea as well. We will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.40 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>2060</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.17 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, I would like to inform you that we have, amongst us, another batch of Year 8 Students and Teachers from Yat Sen Primary School. (Acclamation) We are humbled by your presence this morning, students and teachers. This is your Parliament, this is where we make laws, we change and amend laws, and we even repeal laws. This Chamber has been in existence for so many years now since we were in the colonial era and then we had elections and then today you are here with us. Welcome to our Parliament. I hope that the proceedings this morning will give you some idea of how your Parliament and how your Members of Parliament do carry out their work in this august House. Honourable Members, we will continue, and I now invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his address on MSAF. Being maritime sailors 3,500 years ago, the sailors of the Pacific were the best in the world. We were the leading edge on this and when this country was settled by people that came down from Taiwan to Papua New Guinea, to Solomons, to Vanuatu and to Fiji around 3,500 years ago, at that time we were right at number one of the world. When the sailors came to Fiji, they realised how well our sailors did. It is one of the things to get back to that but maritime, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very important for different areas such as tourism, shipping and fisheries. One thing that strike me with the speech by the honourable Minister is that he kept talking about Public Works Department (PWD). He has got all this thinking about PWD running the ships. Let me remind him that PWD was never responsible for shipping in this country. It was the Marine Department, but the Marine Department had two roles. It was the referee and the player, so what Government did was took out the referee bit and put MSAF in. The player bit was Government Shipping Services (GSS). That was what was done. I do not know what the honourable Minister is trying to say; keep the player and the referee the same. That was the development that was done to be able to improve. If you have the wrong the systems, you will get the wrong kind of results. Overtime, that regulatory bit went to MSAF, and it needs to be able to do that bit well. He talked a bit about derelicts without really talking about the complexities of derelicts that we have. When you have derelicts, there are different parties that are responsible for different things. Fiji Ports Corporation Limited has jurisdiction over the ports from Nukulau all the way to Draunibota. They have that, and they control the movement of ships, et cetera. Sir, MSAF is the one that declares the derelicts, but if you declare the derelict and you do not take into account all the other parties, then someone will have to pay all of these. All of those issues are things that need to be ironed out. You are trying to say that the Government in the past did not do it, you need to understand the complexities of it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to hear that the honourable Minister is talking about reviewing the law, all of these things have to be looked at. I would suggest, given the congestion that we have in the port here, we might need to have two different ports: one operational port in Suva where the boats that are actually doing work, unloading, loading cargo coming into Suva, the rest that are</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2061 waiting on operation should stay on the Laucala side. I think that has been the suggestion that has worked in the past and it will help us to control it, at the moment, everybody comes here. Perhaps, we also need to look at one of the big things. There is no shipping company in Fiji that can afford to get rid of derelicts because of the cost. Maybe we need to look at insurance systems, insurance schemes and included in that insurance. Maybe the premium can also be a bit high and included in those insurance premiums are the cost of removing derelicts because when it comes to cutting up or sinking ships, or scuttling ships, it is very expensive. These are the kind of advice I am getting from some people on this side of the Parliament who are IMO auditors and are also certified to captain ships over 1,000 tonnes, so that was the advice that was given across to the honourable Minister today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to see all the work that has been done by MSAF in terms of swift shipping, cleaner seas, lot of good policies. One thing I am concerned about Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope when you have all these policies, it is not the Government Ministers themselves who break the requirements for compliance. I hope it is not the Government Ministers and Government officials when they travel on these ships, they themselves break the requirements. Overloading! I hope as you go around the islands, you are not having overloaded boats and you just turned a blind eye to it because this is one thing, if you have great rules and policies. (Honourable Members interject) HON. J. USAMATE.- I am not saying, I am just saying and I hope that you are not, so please do not do it! I am saying that people say, “oh, great policy! Hey, but the head honchos themselves are breaking the policies. Maybe it is alright for all of us to break the policies and to be non- compliant.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move on, one of the things that I notice a few years ago, MSAF has got ISO 9001 certified. That means they have benchmarked themselves against international standards. I think this is a good move, we talked it about on CAAF about two or three days ago, about how they had to lift the standard and now I suggest this is something that we can apply all across state owned enterprises and statutory bodies. We used to have a system in Fiji which we called the Service Excellence Programme that used the criteria of the Malcolm Balbridge Excellence Awards and apply that to all of our entities, and it allowed us Sir, to benchmark against international standards so that we can lift the whole performance. As I said, our people in the islands, shipping is very important for them. We need to make sure that the quality of ships are good. I am wondering whether we are strictly enforcing the requirements by MSAF to kick off on those people that are allowed to make fibreglass boats because if those boats are not safe, if we are not making sure that they comply to the standards, then their ships break apart in the seas, that will cause loss of life. So, I congratulate the honourable Minister, I know MSAF have got a good CEO now, good Board, a lot of good policies. I noticed also that in their budget, they had asked for, how much money did they ask for? The budget that they have asked for in their strategic planning, they are not getting that money, so honourable Minister for Finance, you might want to have a look if you really think about the maritime people there, please make sure that they get enough money to be able to do things, so we can keep them safe. MR. SPEAKER.- I like the body language and everything that goes with it, a very inspiring</p><h4>way of making your presentation.</h4><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2062</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 I now call on the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement on MSAF, an important organisation for a maritime nation like Fiji. Because of our geography, we are a flag State because we register vessels, and a port State also. We are obliged under international conventions to do a lot of things that comes under MSAF – United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), International Convention for the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). They fall under this very important organisation, in addition to regulating the local shipping, making sure that they are safe. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a lot of yachts that come in Fiji and as soon as they enter Fiji waters, the safety aspect, in some cases, it has to do with this very important organisation, MSAF. One aspect I think of monitoring and ensuring compliance that is a little bit lacking, is on our small boats that are crossing from island to island. They set a crossing from Vatulewa to Taveuni and other points in Vanua Levu, crossing across to Taveuni. There was an incident lately of the small boat that ran aground, and kids were swimming. I think they wanted to lighten the load, and that was exactly the wrong thing to do, to get these kids into the water. I hope the investigation on that incident has been done and remedial action have been taken on small boats complying with safety regulations. I think if you look at the statistics for search and rescue, most of the search and rescue is done because of the non-compliance of small boats that traverse our waters. For islands, that is the only way they travel between those islands. You talked about navigational aids which is equally important. As we make sure the ships are safe, we ensure also that the route that they take is well marked and safe so that they do not run aground. We have a lot of beacons that the posts stand on. The posts only marks where the danger is, it is the part at the top that is missing, that tells the captain which side you should be travelling on. And with that part missing at the top, there is a chance that they might go on the wrong side and run aground. For beacons and lights, because we are so prone to cyclones, every time a cyclone passes through, most of the time the heads of these beacons will disappear. They need to be put back in place. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree totally with what was mentioned by honourable Usamate. MSAF has a good CEO, and we wish him well - Mr. Cawaki and his Board, the big role that he played for the maritime nation like Fiji. I have the feeling that you need to increase the number of MSAF enforcement officers. When we went from Vatulewa to Taveuni with the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, we went on two fibreglass boats to cross over. There was no MSAF officer on the Vatulewa side to check whether the boats that are crossing have life jackets and all the safety features. We had life jackets and there were two police boats that we crossed on. I think there is a need to increase enforcement officers so that they can be spread around these points where our small boats cross. I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement this morning. Fiji Rugby Union Saga HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, I acknowledge the presence of the students from Yat Sen in the public gallery, and viewers who are watching through television students from their comfort zones.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2063 Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move on to my Statement, allow me once more to congratulate our own Fiji school Boys Under 18 Team on their second victory against the Australian School Boys defeating them by 34 points to 25 yesterday afternoon. Sir, I also take this opportunity to wish our Team that will be in Palau this week all the very best. The Team is being led by the Permanent Secretary, Ratu Meli Nacuva and FASANOC. They will be making our final presentations for our 2031 Pacific Games bid. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an ongoing matter that has drawn significant public attention, the situation involving the Fiji Rugby Union and the players. As a nation with deep-rooted pride in our rugby heritage, it is essential that we remain transparent and proactive in handling any challenges that may affect our national sport and its representatives. On the World Cup preparation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the request of the honourable Minister of Justice, the Trustees voluntarily took responsibility of Fiji Rugby in May 2023, four months prior to the World Cup and at that time, their biggest priority was in finding the funding to get our Flying Fijians into camp, to train and then to play in the World Cup and return to their clubs. The only funding in place at that time was from Government of a grant of $2.5 million for the preparation and participation. After discussions with Fiji Water, through the Office of the Prime Minister, their arranged to assist with a sponsorship of $3.8 million. The total budget was $10 million. Mr. Speaker, when the World Cup Team came together in Taveuni and discussed and negotiated their contracts for the World Cup campaign, the then Fiji Rugby Interim Administrator advised that it was agreed that each Flying Fijian squad member, 33 players in total, would receive a sign-on fee of $30,000 and an allowance of $500 per day from 1 st July to 15 th October, 2023. That is around 107 days. In fact, the players had asked for $600 per day and a few players were in camp earlier from around 1 st July. With Government backing and after a visit from the honourable Prime Minister, bonuses were offered at that time of $30,000 for winning the quarterfinal, $40,000 for winning the semifinal and $50,000 for winning the final. The bonuses were, therefore, based on the Team’s achievements and promised for after the World Cup. Mr. Speaker, in addition to the agreed payments, Fiji Rugby, Fiji Government and World Rugby paid all expenses for the Flying Fijians for preparation for and participation in the 2023 Rugby World Cup - all travel to, from and during camp; international air travel; all accommodation and meals; all playing and training gear; and incidentals also. These had also been budgetted for by Fiji Rugby, World Rugby and Government. On the former captain’s claims, Mr. Speaker, the difficulty, of course, is in the former captain’s original statement where he stated that issues existed between Rugby House and the players going back 10 years. Questions have been raised on unpaid money as far back as 1987, 2007 and 2019. But the current trustees have only been there for a year and regrettably, it will be a challenge to investigate every claim if records are not available. Mr. Speaker, there appears to have been a lot of frustration among the players and sadly, the Trustees currently at Rugby House are taking the brunt of it. They have reached out to the players, met with several of them and they have heeded. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on other players’ comments, in various comments from the players, there has been a distinct theme of misinformation, and a lot of issues raised are simply not factual.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2064</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, players concerns raised on what happened to the £6,000 or FJ$1.7million that World Rugby awarded for reaching the quarterfinals was very quickly answered by World Rugby in releases to the media, advising that there was no prizemoney awarded for reaching the quarterfinals of the World Cup. Mr. Speaker, Sir, further questions on where the prizemoney for the Fiji Men’s Sevens Team who competed at a tournament in Samoa last year, a reported $25,000. It was noted that the coach of the Fiji Sevens Team had told the Samoa organisers that they could keep the prizemoney. It was also noted that all the players were advised of this. Upon this coming to the notice of the Trustees, the Trustees requested the Samoa organisers to give the prizemoney to FRU. Internally, the Trustees had agreed that the prizemoney would be shared between the players and the Samoa organisers. Unfortunately, Samoa could not honour that payment, and the cheque received at the time was returned as there were no funds in the Samoans’ bank account. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the coaches, statements that the 15s coach had not been paid and that even the current coach had not been paid for some months has been refuted by the coaches concerned, as the coaches have been paid by the Fiji National Sports Commission through Government grant for internationally qualified coaches. Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially, the issue of corruption raised against FRU has not been proven factual as the Trustees requested evidence with a promise to pass it on to FICAC or to the police for investigation, and no team member has been able to provide any information on instances of corruption. In responding to the former captain’s initial comments, the Trustees expressed concern on the player issues but took the accusation of corruption very seriously. On issues prior to the quarterfinal, regrettably, three days before the quarterfinal, the Team Manager arranged a zoom meeting between the former captain, some team members and the Fiji Rugby Interim Administrator at that time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in that meeting, the former captain and some players demanded payment of bonuses prior to the quarterfinal, and they threatened Fiji Rugby that they would not play the quarterfinal match unless the bonuses were paid first. This was the first time that the Trustees were made aware that the players differed with the Interim Administrator on the timing of the bonus payment. The Trustees took this threat seriously because of the serious implications and consequences in Fiji. In addition, the pressure on Fiji Rugby was enormous, particularly as there would be serious implications on funding if Government did not agree to the bonus. We had no option, but to approach the honourable Prime Minister to seek his advice and concurrence on a course of action. Government would have to pay the bonus, much earlier than planned. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an undertaking was given to the players by the Prime Minister’s Office that they would be paid the quarter final bonus they demanded, immediately after the quarters. Because of Government’s processes which was appreciated by Fiji Rugby and the risk that the bonus would not be paid when demanded, the Trustees had to seek an overdraft facility for the immediate payment. Government then reimbursed FRU later, well after the team returned. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rugby could not and will never risk a boycott of any match by a Fiji Rugby Team, team let alone a quarterfinal of the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The consequence of such a boycott would likely have been Fiji players and Fiji Rugby being expelled from participating in the World Rugby matches. The former captain and the senior players were aware of this but, unfortunately, still proceeded with their demands.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2065 On the payments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that the bonus was not only promised but was paid. The sign-on fee of $30,000 has been paid. The $500 daily allowance has been paid. Fiji Rugby has already stated that a few payments were late due to regulatory processes that had to be complied with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all payments due are part of the full review being undertaken as I speak. Only last week, the CEO of the Drua confirmed that all the Drua players were also receiving their full paid Drua salary as their time with the Flying Fijians was seen as national duty. On available resources, the Flying Fijians are a nationally proud group, most of whom played for national pride when they are called up to do so for family and country. Fiji Rugby and the supporters also want the team to be fairly compensated for their efforts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, sports has become very expensive, and Fiji does not have the resources of Australia, New Zealand, England, France or Japan, where a number of our players are on contracts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, Fiji Rugby's national teams, player development and welfare, as well as our domestic competition, cost Fiji Rugby approximately $30 million per annum and that depends on a few generous sponsors, the Fiji Government and a grant from World Rugby. On the Trustees and their progress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Trustees were appointed last year, Fiji Rugby was in trouble, as reported earlier. It had substantial debts owing over $6.8 million and assets of only $3 million. In the Trustees report, they have cleared the majority of their debt. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trustees have restructured the operations since and after meetings with every union, the new structure has been accepted and, yes, a new professional business model under a company limited by guarantee was approved by all the unions to take over the operations of rugby in Fiji. The company, its Articles of Association and Constitution were approved by all of the unions at the recent Special General meeting. These documents have been approved by World Rugby and FASANOC which represents the Olympic Committee in Fiji. Last week, in the first round of voting by the unions, a Special Nominations Committee was elected. This professional Committee will now be responsible to vet and approve all nominations for the new Board of Directors to be elected at the AGM on 9 th November, 2024. The players have got their wish, thanks to the unions themselves electing to be a professional business. The Trustees and unions, by restructuring and approving the new Constitution and operations, have satisfied the concerns of World Rugby. We now have re-admitted Fiji Rugby to the World Rugby Council and only last week, the CEO of Fiji Rugby was in Dublin at World Rugby Headquarters, representing Fiji at meetings held there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one change that was demanded by both, World Rugby and the International Olympic Organization was that all voting members of any board of national sports organisation had to be elected by the members of that sport and as such, this meant that the previous mandated position given to the Prime Minister's Board nominee could not be appointed to Fiji Rugby Board. However, there is a course of action that can be taken by the directors to invite a government representative to sit on the Board. If any member of Parliament wishes to sit on the National Sports board, they can, but they must be elected. The honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection is a current member of Fiji Rugby Union Board.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2066</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Accusations, Investigation and Audit: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trustees of Fiji Rugby have accepted that the issues and accusations made by the players must be addressed and as such, have written and been in contact with them. The Trustees have held meetings with players and coaches. They have promised to investigate the players’ claims, and as such, engaged I. Naiveli &amp; Co Chartered Accountants, to review each of the 43 players’ contracts, payment disbursements, as well as the timing of payments. Sir, this exercise is currently in progress and the first report should be received later this week. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the 43 players engaged in 2023, all have been given a schedule of payments, that disclosed the funds disbursed to their respective bank account during the period 1 st July, 2023 to 15 th October, 2023, and the players have been requested to confirm and cross-check with their bank to confirm that the payments have been deposited into their respective accounts. Once these player disbursements have been addressed and the final report from I. Naiveli &amp; Co. Chartered Accountants has been received, the Trustees will publicly release the findings of the review. Any shortfalls in payment to any player during the period mentioned, the Trustees are committed to settle them. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must commend the Trustees of Fiji Rugby for the work they do. They were appointed due to their business and professional experience and involvement in rugby and sports. They should be thanked for all they have achieved. Not one of them has received any remuneration for the over 80 meetings they have held in the last 14 months, all in an effort to get rugby on the right track. Mr. Speaker, Sir, rugby is more than just a sport in Fiji - it is a symbol of our national unity and strength. While challenges like this are unfortunate, I remain confident that with the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders, we will resolve these matters promptly and continue to build a strong, unified rugby community. I look forward to meeting with the Trustees once they receive I. Naiveli &amp; Co’s report, so as we can answer and address everything with honesty and sincerity. The people of Fiji require this, and our rugby players deserve the truth which they shall get. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier, the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports had made it clear that the Government is no longer involved in the recent saga between FRU and the Flying Fijian captain’s claims. But now, he has been making statements on it because it is a matter to discuss, because it is about the future of our youth for career in rugby. Very serious allegations have surfaced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is on the verge of boycotting by the Flying Fijians at the quarter final clash against England in 2023. And just now, the honourable Minister highlighted that our players demanded bonuses and threatened FRU, and further states that all has been paid to the players. But it is quite interesting to note that FRU has responded saying that they ensure a thorough and impartial review. They have engaged in an external audit, and they are committed to transparency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I go a few months back, the Fiji Women's Sevens team slept on the benches outside the Sydney Airport while the Men’s Sevens Team slept in a hostel, reported by fijivillage on Monday, 20 th May, 2024. The honourable Minister for Youth and Sports then said that FRU did not realise that Sydney Airport closes at 11 p.m., which led to players sleeping outside. So, the question is, who was sleeping on the job that caused our players to sleep outside on the benches? Many people are asking, is this the way we are empowering the aspiring youths of Fiji for a career in rugby just so that they can sleep on benches at international airports? Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2067 news gets circulated by international media, they make a mockery out of our players, management and the nation as a whole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to this matter, when honourable Vocea asked the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports about the Fiji Secondary School Rugby Deans Competition, I saw this is an opportunity to ask a direct supplementary question regarding the claims by the former Flying Fijian captain. We are a very effective Opposition, and we bring current matters right to Parliament and definitely we will make a very good government in the next two years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to agree with you on a matter of disconnect, which you stated yesterday. I would like to quote you from the Hansard Report, in fact, on Monday, that honourable Prime Minister offered to pay $20,000, and this is what you responded to the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports. You mentioned here that you are not paying for the $20,000 that will be given to the sevens aside team. And here there is a bit disconnection. I agree with you, there is a lot of disconnection, a lot of disconnection with this Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian people embraced rugby. (Honourable Government Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- See a glass falls:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker Sir, the Fijian people embrace rugby, making it part of their daily lives and culture. Today, rugby stands as a symbol of national pride and unity in Fiji. Our Fijian players have …. MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order! HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a misleading statement. I just want to remind the honourable Member that award given to the Fiji Rugby Sevens Team it was my paper to Cabinet. How can I oppose that here? HON. R. R. SHARMA.- You said it!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.:</span> I did not oppose it! It was my paper to Cabinet.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the level of disconnection is quite surprising. I would like to continue. Our Fijian players not only have excelled in the field, but also have become role models for the younger athletes because their claims now, like I highlighted on Monday, the younger ones are looking up to them and what they say. Their success stories highlight the opportunities that rugby can provide both locally and internationally, and rugby has become a pathway for social mobility, offering young Fijians the chance to improve their lives and support their families. I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issues and challenges exist everywhere, and it will be an ongoing issue. But to the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports, you really need to fix this disconnect. This requires proper investigation and audit. Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports, budgeting is one thing and how you use the finances, is the other. We need to promote good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability, because at the end of the day, it is the Government that funds FRU through the Fijian National Sports Commission.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2068</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 I understand there is an AGM that is planned for November, where unions can voice their concerns. There is also calls for a Player Association to set up to protect the players. Like honourable Premila Kumar said, the players need to be part of the decision-making process, especially the younger ones. The appointed personnel who cannot deliver need to wake up or go home. We, as a nation, have come too far with the success of rugby to mess it up now for our future generations. MR. SPEAKER. – I now call upon the honourable Leader of G9-bloc, or their designate. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports for his ministerial statement regarding the current situation of the Fiji Rugby Union. Throughout the world, over many years, sports have unified people. They draw communities together in common purpose. They have people of different faith, different races and different walks of life who come together to support their local team or their national team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, rugby holds this place in Fiji. It is truly our national sports, and we all experience how important it could be to us, as a people our sense of being one nation like in 2016. When we won the Olympic gold medal it was a time of pure pride and great joy for every Fijian around the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji rugby which we are born with has come a long way. We are an international superpower in the sevens code and have been toppling tier one nations in fifteens. Fiji Rugby Union is not an income generating institution but relies heavily on sponsorships and funding from companies and sponsors to support its operations and tournaments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for instance, to host the Farebrother and Skipper Cup, all of the cost is an estimated expenditure of over 1 million dollars. The problem with the Fiji Rugby Union is due to the lack of visionary leaders in the past. They are relying heavily on grants and whenever there is a delay it will affect everyone in the Fiji Rugby Union. Mr. Speaker, Sir, rugby in Fiji has not been effectively monetised to its full potential which could have financial benefits for the sport. For example, till to date there is no merchandise shop of the FRU in order to buy and bring back money to the union. I thank the current Fiji Rugby Union trustees on offering to focus on setting up alternative revenue streams and not to rely solely on sponsors and grants. I would like to thank: (1) Mr. Peter Mazey; (2) Mrs. Jenny Seeto; (3) Mr. Alipate Naiorosui; (4) Mr. Sikeli Tuinamuana; and (5) Mr. Mosese Naivalu. who are all volunteers and Trustees but have rugby at heart. They have committed to improving management practice, instilling a positive work environment and changing communication channels and promoting accountability and transparency with the rugby house to assist with efforts to advance rugby in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am calling on the rugby unions in Fiji to learn from the past and continue to work hard to achieve continuous improvements and management towards the performance of our teams. 4 th International Conference on SIDS HON. S. R. DITOKA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the earlier sitting, the honourable Leader of the Opposition had mentioned that he would like to get a report regarding the 4 th SIDS Delegation that had gone. Just for your information, Sir, I had led that delegation and had already submitted my</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2069 report via Cabinet, but I also acknowledge that I also have a duty to do here in this august Parliament, so I apologise for that. I am presenting my Report now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for raising this point and the opportunity to inform this august Parliament of the outcomes of the 4 th Conference of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) held from 27 th May to 30 th May in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda. The unique vulnerabilities and challenges of SIDS were first recognised by the international community in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit. Since then, three major conferences in Barbados 1994, Mauritius 2005, and Samoa 2014, have progressively shaped our collective agenda to address these specific challenges. Building on the shared narratives established during these foundational conferences, the fourth conference in Antigua and Barbuda advanced our efforts to accelerate sustainable development outcomes for SIDS. They also identified shared priorities for achieving resilient, equitable and sustainable growth pathways for our small island nations. At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister's leadership in entrusting me with the responsibility of leading Fiji's delegation to the fourth SIDS Conference. Mr. Speaker, Sir, SIDS is recognised as a distinct group of developing countries facing specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The SIDS grouping comprises 39 UN Member States from three geographical regions: (1) (2) (3) the Caribbean; the Pacific; the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS). Our challenges are well known, stemming from our small size, remoteness and geographic dispersion and scattered populations and its effect on our economies and development. SIDS require better support to enhance resilience to exogenous shocks, such as market fluctuations, climatic extremes, and frequent and intense disasters. Despite being the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases, more than 40 percent of SIDS have debt-to-GDP ratio above 40 percent, with some exceeding 100 percent. At some stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji was in this group of nations and due to the hard work of this side of the Parliament and the honourable Minister of Finance that has been reduced to almost 70 percent at the moment. Our borrowing from global financial institutions is often at non- concessional rates. Between 2017 and 2021, no more than 1.55 percent of total global Official Development Assistance (ODA) was allocated to SIDS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fourth SIDS Conference, theme “Charting the Course Towards Resilient Prosperity,” brought together over 3000 delegates including 22 Heads of States and Government, highlighting the critical importance of unity and cooperation among SIDS in addressing shared challenges such as climate change, debt sustainability and economic vulnerability. Fiji was represented by myself as the head of the delegation, supported by permanent representatives to the United Nations and the High Commissioner to United Kingdom, the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Climate Change, the Director of National Disaster Management Office, the Director of Multilateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and key Ministry Officials. Their participation in the general debate, side events and bilateral meetings highlighted</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2070</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Fiji's commitment to the SIDS agenda and our leadership in the global discourse on sustainable development. The Fiji delegation co-hosted and participated in 11 side events on a range of issues, including early warning systems, marine biodiversity protection, SDG localisation, enhancing the digital economy and leveraging data and technology to improve planning and decision making. On key decisions and outcomes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SIDS global agenda has been shaped by the Programmes of Action adopted at previous SIDS Conferences, the; (1) 1994 Barbados Programme of Action; (2) 2005 Mauritius Strategy; and (3) 2014 the Samoa Pathway. The 4th SIDS Conference in Antigua and Barbuda builds upon this legacy with the adoption of the “Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS (ABAS) - A Renewed Declaration for Resilient Prosperity.” ABAS outlines the sustainable development aspirations of SIDS over the next 10 years and calls for international support to strengthen health systems, build strong institutions, achieve gender equality, and empower youth. It also seeks support for conserving, restoring, and sustainably using oceans, marine resources, and biodiversity, while facilitating easier access to affordable and concessional finance. Mr. Speaker Sir, ABAS identifies priority areas for SIDS, including building economic resilience, scaling-up climate and biodiversity action and support, conserving and sustainably using ocean resources, mainstreaming disaster risks, health, data and statistics, science and technology, populations, and partnerships. Partnerships are the cornerstone for implementing this agenda, requiring strategic collaborations with multilateral and bilateral development partners and through South-South and triangular cooperation. Numerous initiatives were launched at the 4 th SIDS Conference, including a Centre of Excellence for SIDS and a Debt Sustainability Support Service, both to be based in Antigua and Barbuda. Multilateral and bilateral development partners also announced commitments such as scaling up international climate finance and mobilising public and private investments for SIDS. Throughout the conference, significant discussions were held on revitalising SIDS economies for accelerated sustainable growth, enhancing financing and aid effectiveness, leveraging digital technologies, making climate finance work for SIDS, and investing in human capital. The adoption of the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS, a renewed declaration for resilient prosperity was welcomed as a robust outcome, encapsulating commitments across critical areas such as climate action, debt sustainability, digital transformation, and human capital development. Importantly, it seeks to usher in a new era of development for SIDS, focused on securing more equitable approaches and a better “fit for purpose” modalities for donor support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consensus established at SIDS4 on key financing priorities and reforms required from the global community and existing financing architecture, set a strong basis for SIDS positions at last month’s Summit of the Future in New York held in September, from the 22 nd to 23 rd. A key element emphasised by all SIDS was the value of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index, a methodology designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of national context. Without a robust means to assess national circumstances beyond GDP alone, SIDS will continue to face challenges in accessing finance, managing debt levels, and stimulating private sector investment. Concessional financing for SIDS is essential to building structural resilience, growing</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2071 sustainable economies, protecting biodiversity, and advancing a sustainable and productive ocean- based sustainable economies. The conference saw the launch of several specific new initiatives, including the Centre of Excellence for SIDS and the SIDS Debt Sustainability Service Initiative, aimed at addressing unsustainable debt burdens faced by many small islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to emphasise that the priorities outlined in ABAS align with our national development plans and the region's 2050 Strategy for a Blue Pacific Continent. Integrating SIDS priorities into our policies and plans is imperative to achieving coherent and comprehensive progress towards the sustainable development agenda. ABAS has been adopted by the UN General Assembly in July, and the Summit of the Future offers world leaders another chance to forge a global consensus and support for the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS. Mr. Speaker Sir, I acknowledge the Fiji delegation who actively participated at the conference sessions, including at the general debate, the interactive dialogues, the high-level events convened by the UN Secretary-General, more than 20 technical side events, and more than 10 bilateral meetings. The UN Secretary-General has warned that we are confronting a climate crisis with the speed and urgency of a Formula 1 car, but we are responding with outdated and inadequate tools. The Government cannot tackle this challenge alone, we need the entire society to unite in developing innovative solutions to strengthen our resilience. Despite being the lowest greenhouse gas emitters, we face the most severe climate impacts. We must demand debt reduction and cancellation and ensure easier access to climate financing. Investing in green and resilient infrastructure is essential for our survival and a sustainable future. Now is the time to be bold, take decisive action, and lead the way for our people and our planet. Thank you very much Mr. Speaker Sir for the opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.– Thank you, honourable Minister for that very informative statement that you have just undertaken. And before we invite the Leader of Opposition to make his comments or response, honourable Members, we have two streams here, SIDS, Small Island Development States. One is being headed by the honourable Minister that have just attended the meeting in the West Indies and the other one is chaired by the honourable Leader of the Opposition here, comes under SIDS as well that falls under the International Parliamentary Union (IPU). We, in the Pacific, I lost kind of pride in this whole process, some are attending that meeting, some are attending this meeting. We just come back from Palau, that is part of the SIDS that we are part of, and now we are going to be hosting another one in Nadi, in the hope that we can bring something together. Otherwise, I will find myself in a very terrible situation because I do not know, there is two SIDS here and we are both for Fiji. I think it is better that we come to some understanding, someone has to pull out, we are already chairing this one here and we had several meetings in Natadola where people from the West Indies attended as well. And then, we have this one here, because we were wondering who was going to go there then all of a sudden, we saw your delegation honourable Minister attending this one here. So, for the sake of trying to get some semblance here, what should we do? That is the question I would like to pose here before the Leader of Opposition makes his statement and the G9-bloc. We need to wind this out, otherwise there will be two groups attending the same meeting, and that meeting that occurs in the IPU, I lead that delegation all the time. So, it is a big waste of money and resources. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2072</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 MR. SPEAKER. – Let us suspend the proceedings now and thrash this out, because we need to come up with a better alternative. Otherwise, the honourable Minister will be making submission down there. It is linked to the UN. That particular one is linked to the Forum Secretariat and this one here, is under IPU. So, this is where Parliamentarians have to decide and make submissions on issues like this on climate change and everything. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, let us agree that we suspend proceedings, so we can tackle this one here. For the sake of just trying to find ourselves in a single vote all the time, we agree. So, we will suspend proceedings and let us thrash this one out. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD. – Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. First of all, let me say that you are making a very valid point about the issue and sometimes an overlap of issues being discussed in the same way in different forums. I think there is a difference, the International Parliamentary Union (IPU) is really an institution of legislators which includes both Government and Opposition. It is a separate international organisation designed to bring legislators together so that they have a different platform to address these global issues in a legislative framework and how the legislature can behave. The SIDS is a UN platform and is a kind of a multilateral organisation, represented most of the time by governments, ministers, policymakers and officials. It is a different stream, and I think the reason why it is different is because the legislators have a different role in terms of supporting the UN system or the multilateral agencies. I think what we are doing, Mr, Speaker, Sir, here is very good. Under your leadership and from the Government side as well, we are trying to involve the Opposition in a much bigger way. For example, when we go to COP, COP is really not a parliamentary delegation, but it is a government delegation. But it does not stop Government from taking the legislators from the Opposition side so that we build consensus in our own Parliament, in our own policies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, then we have what we call Pacific SIDS, for example. Yesterday, the meeting that I opened for Pacific Climate Change Ministers was really about the Pacific SIDS coming together and working out their position on a number of issues like the new quantified goal, because we want to have a Pacific position. So, it is a separate PSIDS, it is a separate smaller grouping. But then the parliamentary PSIDS of the Pacific has a broader agenda. However, your point is taken, I think we can connect and share information from the Government point of view, which our Members of Parliament and is good that the honourable Leader of the Opposition is chairing. So, he has the benefit of knowing and understanding the Government processes, but also contributing to a broader legislative framework beyond our Parliament. So, I think there is a difference and that will continue. The IPU is really not a UN organisation, it is an international body to support legislators around the world because in some countries, their situation is really bad, and you come up with issues that others are able to share. So, I hope that clarifies Government allocation of resources for delegations and maybe the honourable Leader of the Opposition may want to add to it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this is a learning for all of us. The honourable Prime Minister and I did mention this yesterday, when we talked about Fiji's Foreign Policy White Paper, he says that “oh our Foreign Policy White Paper says that regionalism and multilateralism are force multipliers for our foreign policy.” The Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) that is the regional body, same thing with the Caribbean, they have the CARICOM,</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2073 they are regional bodies. But when we go into multilateralism, that is where the geopolitics. The geopolitics are just divided into main regions, and you will be aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, PSIDS when it goes into multilateral bodies, we connect to the Alliance of Small Island States. For your information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Chairmanship is going to change from Samoa to Palau, that is happening next year. An Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). When we use the UN system links to G77+China, the biggest voting bloc in the United Nations. That includes Asia Pacific because we are the region and the African Union as well, of course the Caribbean, we are the biggest voting bloc. Mr. Speaker, Sir, multilateralism has so many bodies. The first multilateral body was the IPU. It was formed in 1865 or 1868, the first multilateral body and then we have the United Nations (UN) that was formed in 1945. Under the UN there are so many other arms of the UN. One is the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), for the Paris Agreement, the Climate Change we have United Nations Framework and Conventions for Climate Change (UNFCCC). I believe that the honourable Minister for Lands is going to another Conference of Parties (COP) very soon, I think it is the one on biodiversity, The Minister for Agriculture is our representative to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), that is another body. So, all these are multilateral bodies and for us, in terms of the way forward, we need both. What is importance for us is the consistency in our messaging from regional into AOSIS, into G77 plus China, into the UNFCCC, into the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which you will be heading next week. These are all multilateral bodies, we act locally, but we think globally. That is the main thing in all this, all Minister, all Members of Parliament must be aware of all this regional arrangements. That is why we insisted that a bus be brought into the house. For consistency, I would recommend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have done in your IPU team, before a delegation leaves particularly when you attend a multilateral meeting, there is a Bureau for Multilateral in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it is the best thing for us to seek advice because there are Fiji positions on most of these issues. You cannot just go and say your own! You must anchor on Fiji’s position, and Fiji’s position is best known in Foreign Affairs. You can be interviewed on what is Fiji’s position and that is why it is advisable. That is regionalism into multilateralism, and multilateralism has so many arms. One is the IPU, and we are chairing SIDS. We want to bring up SIDS as a recognised body within IPU. Seychelles initiated back to our special circumstances and needs, back to Bermuda. If we always anchor on this, this is all connected to our National Development Plan, our Foreign Policy White Paper, now we have a bus, our position on the Paris Agreement and, of course, the other issues. I think we need both, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we need work together so that the message from our bus is consistent with the UN Summit. The UN Summit for the future was headed by His Excellency last week and we participated. So, the messaging from this is what we will need to take to IPU, I have some documents for you, Sir, for our meeting next week, so that consistency is there. But we just need to work together on Fiji’s position. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Member. The honourable Prime Minister has led the way. Now, he is kind of withdrawing himself from the COP Meetings because he feels that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and other Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers should be part of that delegation where we go in and bid as a Government. As a Government, we, in attending IPU, will only have to be riding on whatever policies you put in place but that is the confusion that it creates.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2074</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 The confusion that it creates, I would like to share this, in the Pacific we have 13 countries and out of these 13, some are tied to another regional group which has Indonesia as a member and even Australia. The rest of us in the Pacific, we are kind of lost here but even though that SIDS meeting that you attended, honourable Minister, I find that there is a connection there, because then you have PIF and then it comes down. So whatever policies that are being raised by the Government to PIF and to the UN, that is the channel it goes through. But here, when you are talking about the same thing, I am probably at a loss! I am sitting here in the meeting, and I think I have heard this already from the Government. Then all of a sudden you are sitting there, and Fiji is being pushed around. We made an attempt to ensure that we are properly advised from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before we attend our meeting. We would like to see what is the position that we are going to take when going to IPU. Because over there it is a different story altogether, you have 180 countries in the IPU and UN is only 190 something. In terms of membership, IPU is a fully fledged organisation, but in terms of financing that you just discussed in Antigua, Sir, that is interesting! Because that is lacking here, yet we are part of the Government. So which one do we take? Now the honourable Leader of the Opposition is suggesting both to continue, but I think we should make a fair decision here because IPU is for us, Parliamentarians. That is the body that is settled there for us and at the same time it is the UN as well for which we are a member of. And the different bodies, different organisations that exist. For someone new like me coming in, I find it confusing, because Indonesia is there, and we have to sort things out with this West Papua. But by going to Indonesia, I have recently found out that they have done a lot, even West Papua and Papua New Guinea have close collaborations with them as well, and that is interesting. So, that is all I am asking honourable Minister. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would just like to share that there were indeed some learnings that we had during that SIDS Conference, and as the Leader of the Opposition has shared, the general positions of the nation should be made very well clear before we leave. And the coordinating function of the line ministry should be very well established and should be supported. That is something that we should continue to work on, to strengthen. MR. SPEAKER.- What is the general consensus here, both to continue?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- But we talk some more:</span> We are using Foreign Affairs before we attend, but at the same time at least we hear from them. So, there will be two going to SIDS. Thank you, that is a bit clearer now.</p><h4>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- May I respond to the Ministerial Statement Sir?</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have shared a part of it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- We will recommend and continue with the debate. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Probably just to add light to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Maybe I will start with the UN Summit of the Future. His Excellency the Head of the delegation and we welcome the honourable Assistant Minister from the Prime Minister’s office back. He just landed this morning.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2075 What is important, and the takeaway from here is, moving forward. So, strategically when we had the briefing with honourable Naivalurua at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, we strategically asked for sessions where we can bring back issues that will help us in terms of moving forward. The first meeting that I attended, and as far as the subject matter is concerned is, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). The good thing is I will not repeat what the buzz is all about, but this is something that we will take in your IPU meeting. Of course, one interesting thing out of the AOSIS meeting is the Declaration Statehood and Sea-Level Rise. We can access this information, because we have a very strong positions on this, but perhaps with Fiji, honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs and honourable Assistant Minister for the Office of the Prime Minister, we have agreed to Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) in September last year. The expectation from our prune office is for it to be ratified, but it has taken one year now for us to ratify the BBNJ. If Government can take that seriously, because everything about oceans, we the Pacific SIDS, must always champion it. We were the authors of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and we hosted the First World Oceans Conference, again on biodiversity, and this is why it is so important, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The plea from our permanent representative in the UN, if we ratify, if we can work on the instruments and there is a World Oceans Conference in Nice in France next year. If we can ratify the BBNJ before that meeting, because it is important, it is strategic for Fiji. Just the key takeaway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for your information. The Climate Vulnerability Forum, that used to be chaired by Ghana, now it has been handed over to Barbados. It works well for us, and I would also plead with the Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister of Barbados is the voice now of SIDS, Mia Mottley. She is from the Caribbean. But we need a Mia Mottley from the Pacific on our issues. That is why COP29 is very important because it is a finance COP they call it, because everyone is demanding now for a restructure of the Global Climate Finance Framework. I attended one with the Permanent Secretary for Environment and it was very interesting, Sir. Fiji, to our surprise, some of our best practices were highlighted in that, on the innovative ways, rather than waiting for the Global Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund. Some innovative ways in which we can just finance our own adaptation and mitigation to support our climate change initiatives. The Permanent Secretary for Environment has got that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I think what is of interest to your office is the handing over from Ghana now to Barbados. We have been trying Barbados in the IPU, they were missing from our previous two meetings. Now that they are chair of the Climate Vulnerability Forum, we have to get them this time, because this is all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most important messages for us is consistency in our messaging and the other one is application. We have committed the best, and the next thing now is for us to apply and put into action a buzz UNFCCC, Sendai Framework and so forth. This is where our National Development Plan all connects. Perhaps the last thing that I want to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, I think the key takeaway that I took away as well was data, and monitoring and evaluation in terms of application. They are saying on AI, a predicted future is a future that we built, and we can only build that predicted future with data, and monitoring and evaluation is important. We have learnt a lot, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we will sit with the Government side to share this so that we can move the country forward. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Leader of G9-Bloc.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2076</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr, Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his update on the meeting in May that he attended. Much has been said about this report. I think it is all good. It is aligned to Fiji's ambitions. It is aligned to our 2050 strategy moving forward. It is aligned to the intent of Government and likewise this side for a better future for Fiji. Membership of all these multilateral or bilateral organisations is a must for a Small Island State like Fiji. I support what the honourable Leader of the Opposition has said on his observation and the way forward and what must be done, and likewise what you have also stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have four points here that I just wanted to raise to support the report and aligned to Fijis ambition forward. (1) I believe in catapulting Fiji forward as not only a Small Island State but a nation state that has proven in its most difficult situation, it has been able to survive and prove to the world that we are a nation that could be used as a good model for the other island states. It calls for a closer collaboration, Sir and a very strong ambition that must be maintained wherever we are. (2) We must have very strong and very clear plans, and this is what they will ask us. We can make as much noise if we want to. We can talk as much as we want to. The honourable Leader of the Opposition is aware of his experience with the Chinese. We can talk so much, and they will simply ask, what are your plans? Where are your plans? And this is a very important point, and I am so happy that now we have the NDP and to hear that the key outcomes that the honourable Minister attended is really aligned to our NDP and that is a very good, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (3) Is really our ability to sniff where the opportunities are, and this comes about through good engagement, good network and building good relationships and that is very important. To do that, there is a call for closer coordination in our work here. Sometimes we go out in various meetings. We really do not know what the left and the right is doing. So, our discussions this morning, your guidance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very important. So, the way forward in our thinking from this side, I think the way forward is about a joint effort representing both sides in whatever meeting it is. (4) Last and not least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fourth point I wanted to add to our deliberations this morning, is in everything or whatever meeting we attend we must come back and deliver. There is evidence of the actions that we have, so that when we go back, we can tell them these are the evidence in what we have implemented. So, once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am calling for collaboration, strong ambition, good strong plans, the ability to sniff out opportunities and last and not least is really about delivering this evidence is in the actions we make. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Members and for that I am quite content now that the joint effort is to be led by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management and the honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs. So, then we will be able to be guided well, in this other arm of Government going separately to IPU. So, we deliver the same message, because the other Pacific countries are looking towards us as well. Tonga of late, and Palau have been pushing, supported by Tahiti that we were to have another new way of organising ourselves in the region and I said, no, we have met and I was advised by the</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2077 honourable Leader of Opposition with Mereseini Vuniwaqa the former Minister for Women, that it is best that we hold off for a while and just try and put off that supposed plan and have something organised in the meeting in Nadi. That was quickly sent across to the honourable Prime Minister in China which he endorsed and that is the meeting we are about to have. So, at least we will have the single communication meeting coming from one group rather than two. These two as you have highlighted, honourable Members, is to help us to say our bit in whatever comes our way in terms of IPU or the Government. The Government, the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is leading that area in attending that and perhaps, if we may continue, we will get ourselves organised and I will be seeking the honourable Prime Ministers advice as well on this as to see how best we can go forward with us saying the same message all the time instead of two or three. That is all, Sir, and we will now adjourn for lunch since it is 12.30 p.m. We will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.41 p.m.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2078</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.40 p.m.</p></body>
