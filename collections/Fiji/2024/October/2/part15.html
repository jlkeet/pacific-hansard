<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p>Relocation – Sigatoka Rubbish Dump (Question No. 244/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S:</span> KOYA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament if the Ministry has plans for the relocation of the Sigatoka rubbish dump, which is next to our heritage site and at the entrance to Sigatoka town? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address an issue of both the environmental and cultural significance. The relocation of the Sigatoka rubbish dump and the broader agenda of sustainable waste management in Sigatoka Town. The current location of the Sigatoka dump poses serious concerns. The current location has been the dumpsite since 1949, about 75 years ago. No concrete steps have been taken to address or even change the site. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the site’s position is near to the most very precious assets, which is the Sigatoka sand dunes, UNESCO World Heritage site and the entrance to Sigatoka Town from the Nadi way. The dump threatens the environment and the public health, the image of the Town as a gateway for tourism and economic development. So, the Coalition Government recognises the environmental degradation caused by the proximity of the dump to the sand dunes which jeopardises</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>2094</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 not only the ecosystem, but also our cultural heritage. The frequent fires at the site release toxic fumes that endanger health of nearby communities and tourists. Moreover, as a getaway to Sigatoka Town, the dump creates a bad first impression, potentially discouraging investments and tourism which are key to the region’s economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure Parliament of the Ministry in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is committed to a long-term solution for waste management in Sigatoka. It has taken 75 years to come this far, and the Coalition Government is committed to addressing and resolving this issue. It is also part of the new National Development Plan on solid waste management as articulated in sub chapter 8.4, and one of the KPI’s is one landfill in the Western Division, as well as one recycling plant for the next three years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is actively working with the Council and UNDP under the Investing in Coral Reefs and Blue Economy Project to establish a modern sanitary landfill in the Western Division while transforming existing dump sites into efficient collection and sorting centres. This initiative was endorsed by Cabinet in June 2024, which includes the rehabilitations of four dumpsites, which also includes Sigatoka. The facilitation of an open competitive bidding process for Public Private Partnership (PPP) that will modernise waste management infrastructure. This includes proper containment. It is a collection and environmental monitoring systems which are so crucial to preventing the ecological damage associated with open dumping. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ban infrastructure, the Ministry is exploring the establishment of a waste management authority which will centralise resources and expertise from all municipal councils to enhance waste management and recycling efforts. This centralised body once established will ensure improve governance, transparency and consistency in waste management policies across Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of this comprehensive Waste Management Plan will yield numerous benefits for our nation such as significantly reducing environmental pollution and preserving our cultural heritage. The Sigatoka sand dunes will be safeguarded and will maintain its status as UNESCO's World Heritage Site. Mr. Speaker, Sir, modern sorting and recycling facilities will also allow us to recover valuable resources from our waste stream contributing to a circular economy. Current practice as it is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 100 percent of the waste collection goes direct to the landfill or dumpsite. So the improved waste management practices will reduce greenhouse emissions from decomposing waste and dump fires, contributing to our national climate change mitigation efforts. The entrance of Sigatoka Town will be transformed, creating a more appealing gateway for tourists enhancing overall visitor experience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure this honourable Parliament that the Coalition Government is committed to addressing the issue. Throughout this process we commit to maintaining transparency, engaging with local communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their concerns addressed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the task before us is significant but not to other potential rewards. The implementation of a modern waste management system represents more than just an infrastructure project but symbolises our commitment to sustainable development, environmental stewardship and the preservation of our cultural heritage.</p><h4>The location of the Sigatoka dump is not just a warning sadness, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it presents</h4><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2095 our commitment to cleaner, greener and a more prosperous future. This modern waste management system will safeguard our natural and cultural heritage, right from Sigatoka into a more appealing destination and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts by reducing harmful emissions from waste. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government's actions that were set up and dedicated to sustainable development by engaging the community and stakeholders will ensure that Sigatoka Town as well as the entire Sigatoka community and Western Division will benefit with a more efficient and environmentally friendly waste management system. This comprehensive approach to waste management will turn a significant challenge and opportunity for innovation, job creation and sustainable growth. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the honourable Minister's passion with what he wants done, and I acknowledge that it may take some time to actually get it done especially in light of the fact that we are looking at a PPP to get it done. But waste management is big business but in the interim, because it is such a huge problem, especially because it is a tourism-based area, does the Sigatoka Town Council actually have a management regime to manage that particular site? I specifically asked this, honourable Minister, because in light of the fact that if there is an application by Government to turn that into a World Heritage Site, there is a buffer zone that needs to happen, and that would fall within the buffer zone. It is actually quite difficult if you do not comply with those requirements for it to become a World Heritage Site. So, is there a proper management regime on it at the moment? I think we can only use a live example that we have here in Lami which was moved very quickly, and that site is now dead. Nothing can grow in there for quite a number of years, and I think that came through with the assistance of the European Union. So, it has to be something that is addressed very quickly but the management regime, is it in place or is there a management regime with the Sigatoka Town Council? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for raising that issue. I think about 21 months ago when I visited the site, it was really in a very bad condition and they were waste being dumped all around the site. That is something that we have discussed with the Management, as well as the newly appointed Administrators on how best we can contain and manage the current site. There is a system in place on how to better manage the current site, so that is something that the Management, as well as the newly appointed Administrators are seriously working on it right now, to ensure that we continue and preserve that site because it is a declared UNESCO Heritage site as it is something that the Council is seriously considering in maintaining the dump site. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister, since it is next to the Sand Dunes, the last thing we would want is tourists come and visit those places and say that the place is smelling bad. One is physical waste, and the other one is the odour that is released from the dump site because it is waste, it decays. Are there any mitigation plans in terms of smell and odour from the place, that would be grateful? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the site has been there for the past 75 years and you would not want to go closer to the site. It is a really serious concern not only to the nearby residents of Sigatoka, but a big challenge as well for tourists who visit Sigatoka Town. As I have said, it is something challenging and have insisted that the current Administrators and the Council contain the odour that comes out from the dump site. Now, there is hardly any fires around the dump site due to the plan that has been put in place by the Executive Management and the Council in addressing the problem at the Sigatoka Dump Site.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>2096</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.-Honourable Minister, this may not necessarily be only for Sigatoka but maybe all the Councils in Fiji. Has there been any consideration or technical scoping done to see the potential for the conversion of waste into energy, as has been done in some countries? Also, do we have the volume? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, when I was in China in June, I visited one of the Waste and Incineration Facility. It is very good facility and the honourable Prime Minister, in his last visit, also visited one of those facilities. It is something we are also exploring at the moment as part of our review of the waste management system that we currently have in Fiji. If you go to all the dump sites around the country, all have reached their capacity, so it is a really serious issue right now that needs to be addressed immediately. We have also been receiving presentation by some of the agencies and companies on some of the very effective and sustainable waste manage systems that are happening right now around the world, as well as some that may be effective in Fiji. But we are currently reviewing that and, hopefully, we should come up with a system that will be sustainable for our future generation. Increase of Requests for Co-operative Registration (Question No. 245/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU R.S.S:</span> VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on how the Ministry is handling the increase in requests for co-operative registration? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vakalalabure for the question. Sir, it is no secret that since coming into office, we have really tried to push the agenda of MSMEs and also for co-operatives, not only by making them an actual Department within the Ministry, but also encouraging a lot of our Fijians to join and form co-operatives. We believe, Sir, that one of the pathways out of poverty lies within the co-operative movement, as well as the MSMEs. In terms of activity, yes, we have seen a resurgence in activity, Sir, since 2022. In the year 2022, just in terms of awareness, we conducted 182 sessions in awareness. By 2023, the number had grown by 109 percent to 484 sessions. Registrations have also steadily increased whereby 61 co- operatives were registered in 2022, which has gone up to 73 percent, to 134 co-operatives in 2023. So, clearly, Sir, that question is quite intuitive, and a good observation is that we will have some resourcing challenges very soon. We have a grant in place, Sir, of about $0.5 million. For the first time, we have created a grants specifically for co-operatives so that will add more momentum to the co-operative surge and the co-operative movement. What are we doing about it, Sir? Right now, we have decided to try and digitise the database for co-operatives and MSMEs. What that will do is actually allow us to track the registrations and track how that process is happening, including applications for grants and, hopefully, that will create some efficiencies in terms of how work is being done. Beyond that, Sir, I am sure the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will probably be expecting some knock on the door for some additional resources next year because certainly, Sir, there is some serious investment going into the movement.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2097 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I will just share two stories of two co-operatives established recently and the first one is the co-operative in Togabula. At the moment, they plant cassava, and they supply to the Suva Market. When we presented the assistance, they actually got very emotional because they had been waiting for four years for their tractor. That tractor will actually double their production, so right now they are doing about 70 bags a week at round about $100 a bag, and that will grow to about 140 bags. So, that is the type of thing we are seeing. Another co-operative that we saw was just next door in Natadola. A group of cane farmers got together. They were interested, Sir. They did the IHRDP loan, so their one-third was actually loaned from Fiji Development Bank (FDB), and their leader insisted that I go and see the farm itself. When we stood on their farm, he pointed out to me the seven lines of tobacco and seven lines of suki already planted there. In three months, they will harvest it, and they will pay back their one-third deposit to FDB. So, that is the type of innovation, Sir, that is happening amongst our farmers and the co-operative movement, and it is quite exciting to see the level of interest. There are a lot more stories, Sir, and I plan to share one or two very soon, but there is a lot of interest in the co-operative movement. They are seeing a lot of benefits in grouping together, particularly, when it comes to capital expenditure investment, and we will certainly continue to encourage it because we certainly can see a way of creating another pathway for poverty which is high on the People’s Coalition Government’s agenda. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister with respect to co-operatives,, are we from the Ministry actually encouraging some of the older co- operatives to enter the export market because of the amount of things that are in demand offshore, especially local products that we know are in demand in Australia and New Zealand and we have created a pathways for it but we are not actually exporting? Are they being put onto it, that this is a particular product that is required, and they can actually get more out of the Ministry with respect to getting that done? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are encouraging co-operatives where there are farmers particularly, to look at various markets. I know for a fact, Sir, that at the moment, there is shortage of dalo and cassava in New Zealand and also in Australia, so those are markets that are readily available. Two years ago, before I joined politics, I encouraged a group in Lomaiviti to start selling through an exporter here to Sydney and they do tausala, and it is very successful. Traditionally, they used to only sell their dalo to Suva. So, there are a lot of opportunities like that, and we will continue to push them along and encourage our farmers to use co-operatives. On a sidenote, Sir, we work very closely with the Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Women and Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, in terms of pushing the co-operative agenda. Sometimes, because of the shortage, we leverage off their resource as well to get the awareness out. So, as honourable Koya correctly pointed out, there are some low hanging fruits that we flag now and again. Right now, Food Processors is looking for rourou suppliers for palusami, so we are encouraging farmers to supply rourou, if they can. MR. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the ninth Oral Question for today. Since honourable Shalen Kumar is not present, his question has now lapsed, so we will move straight on to the tenth Oral Question.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>2098</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Planned Water Pipeline Extension – Northern Division (Question No. 247/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update on the current and planned water pipeline extension projects in the North? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Tuiwailevu for that question. Sir, the WAF projects, as I have explained, are aligned with the Water Sector Strategy 2050 Plan which is now the national commitment to SDG6 - Water and Sanitation. The Coalition Government has not forgotten the Northern Division. Understanding the ongoing development in the North, the Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all rural grassroot communities on the mainland and also those in smaller neighbouring maritime islands are catered for, including the upcoming planned business developments, residents and visitors to the North all have access to reliable water supply. It has been identified that an investment of approximately $218 million is required for the next three decades to upgrade and build new water projects to meet the growing demand and improve the reliability of water supply in the Northern Division. As part of this commitment, the Coalition Government has already begun executing several key water extension projects, some ongoing from the last Government as the Government re- continue. The major extension projects, Dagau Main Extension Project, Seaqaqa - $0.56 million. This extension project covers 3.4 kilometres pipeline that shall benefit close to 50 households. On the Nabekavu to Dogoru Mains Extension Project, Labasa, costs $0.8 million to cover 2.6 kilometre pipeline that will benefit approximately 30 households. Rural Water Supply Projects, include Kubulau Combined Scheme Project - $2.4 million. This rural extension project covers 26 kilometres pipeline, which is nearing completion. It will benefit close to 220 households. Delaivuna Combined Scheme in Taveuni - $0.9 million, is now in the initial stage and will involve 7 kilometres pipeline to benefit close to 480 households. The major upgrading projects that will eventually lead to new water connections, include Benau to Volanao Bulk Mains Upgrading Project - $16 million. This project is in line with the plan 30 Mega Litres per Day (MLD) Water Treatment Plant and the new Matagi Water Source Intake which will increase the storage capacity at the Volanao Reservoir. This upgrading will allow for future network extensions towards the outskirts of Labasa, including Boubale and Malau. The project is currently in its initial stages with procurement, grant mobilisation and environmental compliance to be fully completed. Close to 600 households are envisaged to benefit. The Benau to Rara Reservoir Bulk Main Upgrading Project - $6.14 million. It forms the first phase of the Tabia Mains Extension Project, aimed at providing a feed supply from the Rara Reservoir. Procurement, grant mobilisation and environmental compliance have commenced, and it is part of a packaged project that includes the Benau to Volanau Bulk Mains Upgrading Project, to benefit close to 300 households.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2099 Mr. Speaker, Sir, these ongoing projects collectively represent a significant investment of $27 million in the Northern Division. This will benefit thousands of households, improve water quality, reliability and address the challenges of ageing infrastructure and water scarcity in the Northern Region. Sir, in terms of future projects, the Tabia Mains Extension Project Phase II will continue the first phase currently underway, extending the water supply to the Tabia community. The project involves laying 25 kilometres of new pipelines, construction of a pump station and installing a 2 MLD reservoir. Nabouwalu Water Supply System Expansion, the 2 MLD packaged plant 1 MLD reservoir has been completed and will extend the water supply network to the outskirts of Nabouwalu. Navaqiqi Water Supply System Extension, a new 5MLD Storage Reservoir will be installed at an improved elevation at Navaqiqi to support further network extension, following the commission of the new 5 MLD Water Treatment Plant. Seaqaqa Water Supply System Expansion, a new water treatment plant and upgraded 2 MLD Storage Reservoir will be constructed to support network extension along the Naduri Road and Nanivuda Village, once the new Naililiyaga Water Source is secured. On Nasasa Water Source Development, WAF is securing a new water source at Nasasa to supplement the water supply for Taganikula and Wainikoro Systems, which will also support future extension. On Wainivasa Water Source Development in Taveuni, that is currently being explored in terms of the potential of the Wainivasa Source to facilitate network extension in South Taveuni. Through these investments in new infrastructure and the expansion of the water supply network, Sir, the Ministry, through WAF, aims to meet the growing needs of the Northern Division's population and support sustainable development in the region. It is the Coalition Government's policy commitment that Fiji’s water resources are managed, maintained and protected to provide equitable and secure access to water for beneficial users for all sectors of the Fijian economy, and support sustainable development uplift of the rural and grassroots communities. Of course, also extending sanitation services where these are viable and for reliability and affordability for all Fijians. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for talking about the issues in the South of Taveuni, which has been an area of water shortage over time and lot of water carting. I am just thinking about the Delaivuna Project and the Wainivasa. The extension of Delaivuna one, is that from the new source in Wainivasa or from the existing sources? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the information I have been provided with is from the Wainivasa source. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, honourable Minister, the plea of farmers in Seaqaqa. I know that most of the land leases in Nanivuda were not renewed, but there was a plan for the extension from Buavou. Is that still under consideration because of the so many farmers in Tadravula and the other sectors in Seaqaqa? It is a very, very important project because our farmers are important, and this has been their</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>2100 Audit Bill 2024 2 nd October, 2024 request from so many years. The previous Government has made efforts to move it to Buavou, but then the extension from Buavou, and now you are considering Nanivuda. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking into that, and as I have also mentioned, in terms of the boreholes, the budget has been provided and we are currently looking into that as a matter of urgency, given the needs in the Seaqaqa area. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of Government, perhaps to save money, there are already boreholes in place. I have asked the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resorces, if we can get the data from his Ministry because Government has eight reserved boreholes in Seaqaqa itself, and if we can utilise that. Perhaps, it can save us from making new boreholes. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last time I visited was with WAF and they were working on those boreholes and the infrastructure to connect them to the communities. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the source that you have mentioned about Nasasa, I assume this is Nasasa Nadogo. If that is correct, is that just for Nasasa Village or the whole of that area feeding into Wainikoro? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot answer that offhand, I will need to check on that.</p></body>
