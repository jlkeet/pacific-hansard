<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Construction of Telecommunication Tower (Question No. 238/2024) HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co- operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament if there are any plans to construct telecommunication towers in the Nasau District in Ra? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question by honourable Matasawalevu, I just thought to respond to honourable Rinesh Sharma’s comments about the FRU and I thought I just make something very clear particularly to the public of Fiji. The trustees of the Fiji Rugby Union have been vilified unjustifiably. These men and women, we should call them “heroes” because they came in when FRU was on its knees. We had uncovered that the whole FRU structure was illegal. You talked about disconnected, there was one big disconnection, Sir, happening there. The trustees were asked to come in and fix the problem and it was made very clear to FRU at that time that if they did not fix it, we were going to be out of the World Cup. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trustees did that. They not only ensured we stayed, and they played very well in the World Cup and also, they were on a pathway now to return power back to the board of FRU on 28 th November. I just thought I would share that with the public of Fiji that criticisms are fair, but we need to be, sometimes research a bit before we make criticisms because sometimes maybe we are being a bit unfair particularly, in this case on the trustees who have not been paid a single cent to actually carry out the work they have carried out.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Point of Order – Standing 80 on Personal Explanation.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- It is a personal explanation:</span> This is something that is in conjunction with what you have stated, honourable Sharma. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Sir, the honourable Minister has accused me of what you said in Parliament. So, it is directed to me and indirectly to you. It was just posted on their page by the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports. MR. SPEAKER.- I am not reacting to it because I have stated what I wanted to state based on something I heard being mentioned by the honourable Minister for Sports and that is where it ends. I am not going to take it any further. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now I will address honourable Matasawalevu’s question. I think the simple answer to the question is, yes. The People’s Coalition Government is very committed to ensuring that we reach the unconnected, Sir, and included in that is all provinces in Fiji.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2079 Having said that, Sir, I would like to tell a story just to explain why it is taken a bit of a time to actually get to where we are getting to now. When I got into the Ministry of Communications, you could say there was a fair bit of dysfunctional in that Ministry: (1) They did not have a properly constituted telecommunications authority. The Board was actually just some civil servants that the Minister at that time had gathered together. What I knew, any regulatory body has to have the best of Fiji on this Board. So, one of the jobs was to actually reconstitute the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji (TAF) Board which we have done. It is chaired by a gentleman by the name of David Eyre, he is a well-known telecommunications expert in Fiji and also an engineer. There is the name such as Tomasi Vakatora (Junior) on the Board. He is a well-known Senior Executive in Fiji, was at one time the CEO of ATH. These are the types of people we brought on the Board. This is just like the Civil Aviation Board that I had mentioned yesterday. (2) There was no CEO in Telecommunications Authority of Fiji. I am not sure for how long and so once the Board settled in, their next job was to actually find a CEO, he has now been appointed. One of his main jobs, Sir, is to rollout the connecting the unconnected to the rest of Fiji. (3) When I got the declaration on universal areas, and we have to gazette the locations that we decide that we are going to rollout connectivity to. The latest Gazette from the Government at that time was 6 th July, 2022 so it is fairly recent. There was no mention of the Province of Ra here – zero. Honourable Matasawalevu, you are not even officially on the list of the sites that are to be looked at. Having said that, Sir, I asked the Telecommunications Authority to relook at the sites, at this stage, prioritising the maritime areas and then looking at other areas that have not been covered. At the moment there are about another 80 sites that have been identified which includes Ra. That will come on board and then we will try and prioritise the actual rollout of the sites. The first deployment which is like, sort of a test deployment will happen towards the end of this year and that is a rollout to some of the maritime locations. Once that happens, that includes Lau, Kadavu and Lomaiviti, then we will start rolling out. There is a fund called the “Universal Service Fund” that actually sits in the Ministry of Communications, we are using that fund, but it is not enough, Sir. I will be reaching out to donor partners as well to try and accelerate the connecting the unconnected. One of the positive things, Sir, that we all know about is, whilst we are trying to get this going, Starlink has arrived in town. Some of our people that can afford the connectivity, and some are doing it through their relatives overseas, I think, here are two in Nairai. That has already started so that is creating some positive assistance in terms to those who want connectivity more urgently. Sir, in a nutshell, yes, we will look at Nasau District as part of the overall plan. Right now, we just have to make sure we plan out the initial phase like on a model launch, if you like, Sir. Once that is done, and then will have a firmer plan and hopefully by then, we have some donor partners so that we can then accelerate the process. Again, Sir, as you know, it needs a bit of a well-articulated plan before we actually go and see the donor partners as well. In essence, Sir, where we are at in terms of the planned rollout but be assured, we are very serious and doing our best to get this moving. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I understand stand what you are saying in terms of rolling out this particular programme, but in terms of the actual hardware that is going to be put on the ground, it is the Ministry that is paying for the hardware that is going in, but like you said, maybe</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2080</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 the donor partners will be involved. Will these towers also, wherever it is put, whether it is in Ra or in Vanua Levu, will you still be permitting Digicel, Vodafone, et cetera to share these towers and other institutions that are involved? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is a very good question. We are trying to be agnostic when it comes to operators that sit on a tower because it is just more efficient to operate that way. At the moment, in the lead up to the launch process, all the Telcos and the other satellite providers are providing offerings to the Ministry of Communications to assess the best option. One of the other things as well, you kind of touched on it, how we actually make payments to the Telcos once they actually do the rollout. We are using the USAID through their expertise there to assist TAF to work out the payment modelling to ensure that when we roll out the towers and the CAPEX is spent by the Telcos, the compensation is sorted as well. As you correctly pointed out, what sort of mode of payment will happen? So those are being part and parcel of consideration of the first rollout, Sir. Partnership Arrangement – NZMFAT and Ministry of Housing (Question No. 239/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E.Y:</span> IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the partnership arrangement between the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry of Housing? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question before the House and I thank the honourable Member for the question. This agreement started back in December 2019 after Cabinet approval albeit the Ministry of Housing and the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a period of three years until December 2022. The new Partnership Agreement was recently endorsed by Cabinet on 12 th September, 2024 for a term until April 2029. From the day of the signing, it is expected to be done before the end of this month, October 2024. The collaboration aimed to support Fiji's ambition to improve socio economic outcomes for low-income earners in Fiji through improved access to quality, affordable housing, support good governance between partners and to facilitate efficient management of resources for greater efficacy and impact. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the arrangement includes technical assistance through the provision of a housing policy advisor with the Ministry of Housing. This advisor will strengthen policy and planning efforts, support the Ministry's regulatory role and oversee the finalisation and implementation of the National Housing Policy Framework. Additionally, the advisor will facilitate Fiji’s housing stakeholders’ coordination platform to support this initiative. Sir, NZMFAT will cover recruitment and salary costs up to six months totalling NZ$1.75 million (equivalent to FJ$2.4 million). Mr. Speaker, Sir, NZMFAT also co-funds the revitalisation of Informal Settlement and Environment (RISE) Programme. It aims to improve infrastructure and implement sustainable water and sanitation management systems in six vulnerable informal settlements within the greater Suva area. Sir, NZMFAT will provide funding close to NZ$3.6 million (FJ$5 million) and oversee governance for this initiative. The phase one site include Matata in Lami, which comprise of about 62 households, Wailea in Raiwaqa of 104 households, Muanivatu inVatuwaqa, comprising of 96</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2081 households, Wanibua in Muanikoso of 43 households, Komave in Nabua of 47 households and Nauluvatu Reservoir Road which has about 91 families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overarching objective is to eliminate the risk of exposure to contamination and where we cannot eliminate, RISE aims to reduce the communities’ risk to exposure to contamination by at least 80 percent. Sir, RISE through its programme, is also doing this by treating wastewater in these communities and reducing exposure by alleviating flooding and reducing interventions to disrupt pathway and pathogens from environment to humans. These interventions include are few key areas, drainage works, pathways, wet ponds, bathroom and toilet facilities, spot backfilling, pressure sewers, communal sewer tanks, treatment wetlands, as well as there is a demonstration now at Tamavua-i-wai which has about seven pressure tanks, one treatment wetland, 16 wet ponds, a spot backfilling and one communal sewer tank. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this agreement, NZMFAT is also co-funding the Model Town Charitable Trust (MTCT) known as Koroipita which offers subsidised climate resilient, housing and community support services to over 1,000 residents. Both NZMFAT and the Ministry of Housing are part of the MTCT governance group with NZMFAT responsible for providing co--funding support. The total funding allocated for this is around NZ$6.1 million, and New Zealand has already provided funding of NZ$3.2 million (FJ$4.4 million) from 2019 to 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, NZFAT will further assist through institutional strengthening providing support for a two-way planning concept to the Ministry of Housing to improve overall health, structure and functioning of the organisation. Sir, NZMFAT will provide funding support to the Ministry of Housing through a separate climate funding arrangement for the development of the Strategic Development Plan (SDP). This initiative is timely, coinciding with the current launching of the 2025-2030 National Development Plan envisioned in 2014. It will act effectively and guide the Ministry and the stakeholders in achieving strategic outcomes for the housing sector. Sir, NZMFAT will also provide funding to support the establishment of the Ministry of Housing’s National Housing Database which we currently do not have one at the moment. The database will be a comprehensive and centralised system to collect, maintain and analyse data related to the housing sector at a national level to inform targeted policy intervention. The total funding for the provision of analytical systems, institutional strengthening at the Ministry of Housing, as well as its SDP and the standard of National Housing Database is around NZ$1.7 million equivalent FI$2.3 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government through the Ministry of Housing acknowledges and thanks the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its support. The outcome of this partnership will create opportunities for: (1) (2) (3) Increase access to affordable high quality social housing for Fijian communities; Increase provision and coordination of basic services to informal settlements in the greater Suva area; and Increase strategy and planning capacity in the public sector for long term development with the housing sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of execution and monitoring, a Project Steering Committee will be established whose role is to govern and manage the delivery of the activities within the housing sector. This Committee is to meet every three months, and its membership comprises of the Permanent Secretary of Housing, NZMFAT representatives and the Ministry of Housing Advisor. The role of the Committee is to provide high level strategic guidance, receive and review workplans and progress reports as well as address any policy or strategy issues as they arise.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2082</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Of the RISE Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Technical Advisory Group comprising representatives of the Ministry of Housing and RISE Fiji will provide clinical advice to the Steering Committee and service providers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this arrangement, NZMFAT will provide an indicative funding amount of close to NZ$11.5 million (FJ$15.9 million) directly to the service providers for the technical assistance. The programme and the model town’s trust subject to conditions that NZMFAT will enter into within the service provider for the delivery of the above- mentioned activities and the New Zealand Government policy and the appropriation by the New Zealand Parliament of sufficient funds to support the activities. The partnership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Ministry of Housing will be reviewed every three years from the date of signing. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership agreement should enhance the Ministry of Housing’s Services by leveraging resources, expertise and best practices from both parties. It fosters collaboration to address housing challenges more effectively, ensures alignment with national and international goals enhancing funding opportunities. Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership is anticipated to lead to improve housing outcomes and greater community resilience. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I heard rightfully, the honourable Minister mentioned that they will be providing assistance to six informal settlements within the greater Suva area to cater for clean drinking water. My question to the honourable Minister is, we have done a $300 million Viria Water Project. What went wrong with this particular project that we actually have to fork out more money to cater for clean drinking water, especially in the greater Suva area whereby we had invested $300 million. While it is imperative for us to actually assist informal settlements, my question to the honourable Minister, what about the formal settlements around these informal settlements that are actually facing this water disruption till to-date because of theses informal settlements? The infrastructure was only done for the formal settlements, not to cater for informal settlements. One common example, I would actually give, in Vatuwaqa, there is a 4- inch pipe running for the formal settlements and then there is a 200 to 300 additional connections throughout the Wailea Informal Settlement and Nanuku. The formal settlements are also facing the same issue. So why is preference only given to informal settlements and not to include the formal settlements in this area? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. I think the assistance that is fully supported by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade is to support the vulnerable families. These are the poor of the poorest. These are people who do not have access to infrastructure that is supplied by the State. These are the people who live on the edges of the town and do not have access to the basic services or amenities. I think we should be thankful that this Government has come on board to support these families, not from our budget but it will be funded by the New Zealand Government with the support of the Monash University in Australia. I think this is a very good initiative and we should be supportive. It is one area that is also going to support the government in the provision of these basic services to some of these settlements that have been there without the process of going through the respective agencies and ministries to support some of these settlements. In a way, the funding is to support the poor of the poorest, those that actually do not have access to basic services and amenities. The issue with some of these informal settlements that face the difficulty with the supply of water to formal settlements, that is something that the Ministry is looking at right now is how best we can identify some spaces where we can actually relocate some of these settlements and also provide them with the basic necessities, proper piping, proper infrastructure to assist some of these informal settlements.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2083 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by the honourable Minister, this partnership arrangement started in 2019 and it is almost like six years now. Of course, the project was disrupted by COVID-19. My question to the honourable Minister is how long is the tenure of the Technical Advisor’s role and what are the expected milestone or deliverables under his leadership? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme will go up to 2029 as I had also mentioned in my speech. Some of the key roles of the Technical Advisor is to assist the Ministry to providing technical support. Currently you must have also heard and seen in the news that the Ministry of Housing is doing a Review of the National Housing Policy. We have an advisor from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently now with the team going around our areas where the consultations will be held, supporting the Ministry in the review and the Ministry has found it very positive on the contribution provided by the Technical Advisor and also going to help the Ministry in providing institutional support and capabilities in strengthening the systems within the Ministry of Housing. Like having a database in place, that is something the support officers will need an expertise to support the Ministry in providing these various core responsibilities Based on my delivery, I have also mentioned that profiling will continue but depending on the Parliamentary support by the New Zealand Government. As long as we need assistance from them, they will continue to assist the Fijian Government as well as the Ministry of Housing. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the consultation started in 2021 and 2022 because the work was substantially done. How much more time do you think it will take for us to finalise the National Housing Policy considering that in the last two budgets, we are not talking about finalising, we are talking about implementation when we have heard from you that one has to finalise the policy first? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the timeline for the Ministry is to complete and also forward to Cabinet for approval before the end of this year. Once we finish all our consultations, after completion of the report, we will have to report back to Cabinet for endorsement and confirmation of the review of the National Housing Policy. MR. SPEAKER.- I wanted to add some more on these informal things and how it is kind of chewed in heavily into the coffers of Government, especially to do with formal and informal, water supply, electricity and roads. I think we covered this substantially in the last few years, but the policy of the Government has changed a lot. We never used to encourage this before but since it is a human rights issue. Previous governments have kind of lent some ears to how the unfortunate and people who cannot afford could be helped. The outcome of that is chewed into the formal sector on the water supply, roading, electricity because people were looking for their votes both in the Local Government and in the National Elections, that has brought about the change. So, the formal sector will have to bear with the sharing of all these benefits so to speak, that has changed a lot. I remember asking the honourable Premila Kumar when she was the Minister for Housing, can we not relax the town planning stringent conditions? Instead of curbed and tarsealed road, we go for gravel? Just some kind of subdivision where, at least, peg marks of the allotment are clearly demarcated, and we will be able to re-establish the boundaries again. But again, the reply that was provided was, what we give out to be the same; same for those that can afford and same for the housing to help the poor, to get the title. To get a proper title you need the proper infrastructure and that is highly expensive, very costly. The Government has to bear that.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2084</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Operational Procedures - Monitoring and Regulation (Question No. 240/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I:</span> NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the operational procedures to monitor and regulate the movement of small boats travelling between islands? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question which have also been alluded to slightly this morning. There have been challenges and we do agree and as acknowledged in terms of the monitoring and regulations of small boats travelling between our coastal communities, between islands. First and foremost, the safety of small boats and monitoring rests with the boat owners and boat masters. If they are certified, they do know what to do and they are trained in it. What MSAF is working on now is to establish, the current problem we have is the monitoring and implementation of the regulations down to village level. There are MSAF officers based at various locations, but they cannot cover or monitor everything. Sir, MSAF is currently working on consultations on a MOU with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs for the engagement and assistance of Turaga ni Koro, or Mata ni Tikina as a sort of Enforcement Officers or Compliance. This could involve: • • • • • • checks on registration of small boats to ensure that these small boats have been serviced and registered; have the right safety equipment; those who are operating it are qualified of the Certificate of Competency; able to provide advice to boat owners in terms of the weather situation, right advice on passenger loading capacity and in terms of communication channels available or in instances of emergencies; closely liaising with the stakeholders such as the local police; and able to submit some kind of monthly report as part of the monthly report that is required with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question. I thank the honourable Minister for his response. The point here is on the enforcement aspects. I understand the big picture at the strategic level, the laws and regulations that has been in place. I just wanted to bring this to the attention of the honourable Minister. It is a tough job on the ground, and I am trying to use Taveuni as an example. Yesterday, as a matter of just an exercise, I deployed a small team from Naselesele Village to monitor the boats that are coming from Taveuni to Matei Landing; 13 arrived at Matei Landing between 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. Out of the 13, only are few were wearing flak jackets, and the list went on. This morning, the team was deployed again. There were 14 boats that arrived from Qamea and not many were wearing those flak jackets or life jackets. When they were asked, they said, “we left it at home.” where they asked and they said, oh we left it at home. My question to the honourable Minister, can we review the modus operandi at the operational level or tactical level? I know the resources are limited, but it can be done. There are many hands on the ground that could be used just to make sure that it does not result in any of these undue situations that may cost us more, moreso of a life.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2085 MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply to that, I recalled the statement shared by honourable Naupoto, the Standing Committee travelled from Vanua Levu to Taveuni on two open punts, very little was seen on the safety aspects of that travel. That included the Parliamentary Standing Committee. No life jackets were seen, but these were the ones that were always traversing these two islands. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, as I mentioned, the regulations are there, it is just the monitoring, and I suppose the components of monitoring and enforcement. As I have already mentioned, the infrastructure of the Ministry of the iTaukei Affairs is there, and we are working with them in terms of some of their personnel on how best to do the enforcement and the monitoring. I suppose the other part is, what is the responsibility of the community themselves, and that is the wider awareness and respect in terms of observing safety protocols. From what I have seen, even crossing rivers in my province, that is a requirement, but they do it once there is an Enforcement Officer there. Once they move away, then it goes back to the old practice. I suppose it is a general attitude in society in terms of safety. I suppose a lot are saying that they are kai wai, but no one is a kai wai, only the fish, I suppose. Yes, it would involve a community wide or nationwide change in attitude amongst our people. I mean not another taskforce, but just starting from us. I have been guilty of not wearing a life jacket crossing a river, so if the Members of the Standing Committee, I am not sure whether they wore it or not.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- We did:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> You did, okay.</p><p>Even for us, Ministers of Members of Parliament can send out that message as we are travelling then that will be good. I am not perfect, I have not practiced it too, but it is something that we need to do. It is just an attitude change. Because Taveuni has been used as an example today, I would like to request the Turaga Tui Cakau …. MR. SPEAKER.- You only have one marine checker? We have only one marine checker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> On the island of Taveuni, yet we have so many Turaga ni Koro. How do we get the Turaga ni Koro or even the villagers? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- We will work on that with our various stakeholders and ministries, and I request you, Sir, as the paramount chief to also assist with Naselesele and the tikina in that regard. We all have to work together in this regard - maritime safety. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I thank the honourable Minister for his explanation. It gets a bit worrying to see the actual play that is going on the ground. There are people travelling from Vanuabalavu to Cicia, and they are travelling from Moala to Matuku and to Totoya. I just wanted to ask the question if the honourable Minister think that by, it is a financial return that forces the boat operators to continue? If a fine or some kind of responsibility is given to the boat drivers and the owners just to stop them, it is a huge responsibility of running in the middle of the ocean with a small fibre glass boat. Does the honourable Minister think in the same line as I am thinking?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, that is the in regulations, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2086</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No enforcement:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- the enforcement part is identifying the offender and imposing the fine. There needs to be people there who are identifying and enforcing:</span> In addition to what I mentioned, with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, we are also increasing the number of enforcement officers. I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for his thoughts in also assisting us in terms of maritime safety. MR. SPEAKER.- It is strange to see, even to hear these open boats travelling from Vanua Levu to Tuvalu. You would be surprised. They are frequent users of this passage, the open boat, the punts with no life jackets. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just have a question for the honourable Minister given this rural area experience. As much as we want to enforce the law, one of the huge problems that people in the rural areas face is access to the items, life jackets, flares, et cetera. That is the usual feedback to us. Why do you make laws but not get these equipment readily accessible to us? It is not a new issue, honourable Minister but probably something that you need to consider or if you have already considered, what is the plan? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- From my understanding, at the beginning when the survey is done, they have it there. I think after that, I am not sure, they go and store it away or something. That is a good suggestion. These things are expensive too and we have to fork out the cost. The honourable Minister for Finance might look at subsidizing some of these items to assist our rural and maritime operators. That is an option. He is shaking his head. We respond in a positive way to your suggestions and that is something that we will definitely look into. It is not only that, it is the flares and a few other items, the costs have gone up a bit which we need to assist the operators with as they do not earn a high income, they are mostly our rural and maritime community members who have subsistence income. I believe they should be assisted with some sort of subsidy. Thank you for the suggestion, honourable Leader of the Opposition. MR. SPEAKER.- Life jackets are very expensive. The latest ones look just like a shirt. Not like the big thick ones that we used to have before. These are now in the market but as you said, honourable Minister, they are really expensive. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just two suggestions to the honourable Minister: (1) The introduction for survival swimming, especially in our maritime areas.

S:</span> TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on what measures are being undertaken to improve the water</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2087 supply in the Nadi-Lautoka areas? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Sakiusa Tubuna for his question. Sir, with the rapid expansion of the Nadi-Lautoka urban areas, a population of approximately 220,000, the Government of the day sees it fit under the Water Sector Strategy 2050 to account for an investment of approximately $397 million in the water sector and approximately $1.22 billion in sanitation by 2050. The measures shall also address the increasing demand for water and wastewater services by the tourism sector. For the two financial years, 2023-2024, 2024-2025, the Water Authority of Fiji through the funding support of the Fiji Government is investing approximately $47 million into water and wastewater infrastructure upgrades in order that these projects are aligned to the Water Sector Strategy 2050 Plan against strategic outcomes: (1) Access to clean and efficient water services; and (2) Access to safe sanitation services which of course is aligned to Section 35 and 36 of the Fijian Constitution. The significant investment is focussed on improving redundancy and capacity of both water and wastewater systems ensuring that they can cater for existing and future demand. Some of these ongoing projects, Varaqe to Saru Water Treatment Plant Pipeline Works. Varaqe Dam and Saru Water Treatment Plant were first established in 1959 and the infrastructure, particularly the raw water trunk mains has age significantly over the past 64 years. These assets have not undergone substantial upgrades. Frequent operational issues, natural disasters and environmental wear have compromised the reliability of this system. To address these challenges a robust design with improved pipe material is being implemented to enhance the resiliency and water conveyance capacity totalling project cost of $9.7 million which should be completed by December 2024 and Nagado to Nadele trunk mains upgrading works. The Nadi-Lautoka water system faces a supply demand gap of 4.4 megalitres per day or 5.4 million litres per day due to outdated infrastructure and insufficient treatment and conveyance capacity. To address these gaps WAF is upgrading the trunk mains which will ensure a better hydraulic performance, improve redundancy and provide flexibility in operations between Nadi and Lautoka. The project cost $8.3 million, duration of 44 weeks, completion date approximately estimated to be December 2024. And of course, I had mentioned prior to the upgrading of the Nagado Water Treatment Plant capacity, the Nagado Water Treatment Plant was originally commissioned in 1982 with a capacity of 45 megalitres per day (MLD) and that has been incrementally upgraded to current capacity of 90 MLD. However, the plant faces operational challenges. Frequently processing raw water exceeding its design capacity due to increased demand. In addition, fluctuating raw water quality from the Vaturu Dam has exacerbated production limitation and water quality compliance issues. To progressively address this, water authorities installed an additional 20 MLD package treatment plant to increase the treatment capacity, costing $14.6 million and completion date first quarter of 2025. Unfortunately, setbacks have been experienced due break-ins and thefts of key essential components and I am requesting to the public to please respect our assets in terms of our public assets supplying basic necessities such as water and even roads and other infrastructure. In addition to those, the planned upgrading of the Wastewater Pump Station and rising main from Denarau Island to the</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>2088</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 Water Treatment Plant. Again, I had already mentioned the current plant was established in the 1970s for the capacity for one or two hotels and not the number of hotels which are there now and planned. So, we need to expand that to accommodate the growing demand for further developments and the pump stations are now operating at the maximum capacity, costing about $15 million and that has been tendered and we are looking at 24 to 36 months. In addition, the upgrading of the existing Navakai Wastewater Treatment Plant, this has been there for quite some time and work needs to be done in terms of that to relieve the load and cater for additional wastewater connections which envisage up to 2040. For the Denarau Plant, collaboration has been established with Denarau Corporation Limited and Ministry of Tourism in terms of design and input and also the load. So, we are looking forward to that project, ensuring the future sustainability of water and wastewater services on Denarau. A major contributor to Fiji's GDP through the tourism industry. So, this project represents major commitments from the Coalition Government and of course acknowledging the building on the work of the last government, which is of course to be commended, in which we prioritise long term development of water and sanitation services across the country in key economic areas such as Nadi and Lautoka. Again, that is the developments which we look forward to, to cater not only for the current challenges, but also the future demands as we move forward in the Nadi and Lautoka areas. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I thank the honourable Minister for his explanation however, I hope he knows that Nadi has Akhil Sam in Nawaicoba. I hope you know that. Is the Coalition Government considering of utilising Akhil Dam to ease the water problem in Nadi because Akhil Mines has a huge volume of water and can ease majority of that problem. You can utilise that dam for the water problem. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Nawaicoba dam, which dam? HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Akhil mine dam. I hope you went to that site, Nawaicoba MR. SPEAKER.- Akhil mines.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.:</span> Yes, in Rada, Nawaicoba. I think most of them do not know about it.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you. We will definitely look into that suggestion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for providing an update on the measures being undertaken to improve the water supply in the Nadi and Lautoka area. I believe every effort should be made to provide clean water to people. People who live close to Vuda Reservoir, in Lautoka, have raised some concerns and that is regarding fencing and security at the reservoir. According to them, the reservoir area should be properly fenced, and it should be protected by security, especially at night time, so that the youths do not consume alcohol in the area. That is current practice in that area and my question to the honourable Minister. Are there plans to have the reservoir area, especially this Vuda reservoir area secured so that the reservoir water is not contaminated and safe for consumption?</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2089 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, in terms of the specific location, we will definitely look into that, but normally there is a facility or asset you secure that and ensure that it is secured, that is my understanding from what I know have security or those who are caretakers there, but that is something I have to check in terms of what you have mentioned. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nadi and Lautoka are heavily populated areas and of course we need to support the tourism sector. I know the previous government has done direct lines to some of these facilities, but our ability to respond when it comes to times of emergency, the previous government has purchased package plants. So, what is there in your plan about building upon this capability so that we can respond to this request particularly that water is a basic need? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned we have the Fiji Water Strategy 2050 which is an assessment of water resources and needs in Fiji and the strategy to address those. So, it is all there in the strategy and that is the plan which we are working on implementing. And it also includes package plants and extending pipelines in addressing areas where the needs for water in terms of not only the urban but rural needs. Also, we the Government has budgeted $5 million, close to $6 million in terms of expanding water sources which will cover the boreholes and that is something which the Ministry of Lands and Water Authority of Fiji and our ministries is working on in terms of implementation and ensuring that those come online to the various committees who are in need of that. MR. SPEAKER.– Yes, honourable Koya. HON. F. S. KOYA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand your very comprehensive response, you spoke about waste water treatment plants now, with respect to Nadi and Lautoka both waste water treatment plants sit right at the entrance of the City and the town. Are there plans, or do you have any immediate plans, or in the future to move those wastewater plants outside of the City limits or actually putting it somewhere you do not actually get the smell wafting through the cities in the towns and closer to Denarau, Nadi. I know it is in-between the towns, centre and going towards Denarau, and Lautoka is right at the entrance of the town at Natabua. Have you got plans to move entirely the wastewater treatment plants into an area where it is not going to affect the general public? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU – Yes, there are. Wastewater is an area which we have not developed satisfactorily, in terms of stances and needs, in order to serve up the population so, that is an ongoing assessment. I know that some of the landowners do not want this water treatment near their areas so, there is a current assessment of some of the locations in terms of the viability of them being here and there. Also, alternative locations, and of course we have to do a cost benefit analysis in terms of moving that. And if there are plans for further developing or moving then we need to have a financing models to support that. So that is something, it is an ongoing work in terms of what the Ministry and the Water Authority of Fiji is doing. Piped Water Supply to Vunitaqala Settlement (Question No. 242/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S:</span> NAND asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on when it is likely to have piped water supply for Vunitaqala Settlement in Navua to enable the community to have access to clean drinking</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>2090</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 water? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.– Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think that the Parliament has seen enough of me today. Oh no, you still have some more! You are a very popular Minister, Sir. (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.– So, I am referring to Standing Order 42(1), where the maximum number of questions to be asked of a Minister is two. But I think the interpretation of that might need to be looked at the Business Committee. Anyway, I thank the honourable Member for the question. So, in the Water Sector 2050 Strategy, if we could all read that so in the next one and a half years, I do not get asked any more questions. But, anyway, jokes aside, it is quite critical and important document. There is a plan for a 10 mega litre reservoir in Wainadoi and network extension at a cost of $25 billion by 2030, plus a 3 mega litre Navua Water Treatment Plant and power extension at $8 million by 2030. In terms of this specific question on Vunitaqala Settlement. In 2022, Rotary Water Pacific undertook some upgrading work in the neighbouring of Maqumaqua Village where new pipes were laid to connect Vunitaqala Settlement. Unfortunately, due to funding constraints, this was not completed to Vunitaqala but Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has initiated discussions with Rotary Pacific in order to relook at the scope and plan engagement with this settlement, to ensure that there is no overlap in project responsibilities moving forward. That is still in that stage, relooking at the full scope and we will liaise with the community for another submission to be made, but with required mandatory documents to be made with their submission including the normal land access or access before any work is done. Once these are provided, WAF will be in a position to conduct a feasibility study of the water source and work with the Department of Water and Sewage in terms of the water supply management plan, and we could consider it moving forward in the next budget. Update – National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027 (Question No. 243/2024) HON. K. V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. In terms of the National HIV Surge Strategy for 2024 – 2027, that has been developed as a response to this sharp and persistence rise in the new cases of HIV in Fiji. As I have mentioned, a number of time UNAIDS - Global AIDS Monitoring Report of 2022 reported that since 2010, the estimated number of new infections in Fiji has risen by 260 percent and unfortunately, we are the second fastest growing epidemic in the Asia Pacific, only behind Philippines (I believe) and we have surpassed Papua New Guinea as well. Since 2021, just to show some context in terms of the data, the Ministry recorded a new HIV cases in the hundreds for the first time since we reported our first case some 35 years ago in 1989. There were 121 new HIV cases in 2021, 245 new cases in 2022, 450 new cases in 2023 and for this</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2091 year in the first six months, we have recorded 552 new cases. Out of those, for this year alone from January till June, 552 new cases, 97 percent were diagnosed in adults and 3 percent, or 12 cases were diagnosed in children less than ten years old. Divisionally, Sir, the Central and Eastern Divisions recorded 69 percent or 380 new HIV cases. The Western Division recorded 27 percent or 151 new cases. The Northern Division recorded 3 percent of 19 new HIV cases. The male gender is the most affected with 69 percent or 381 new HIV cases. In terms of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, this has also increased with 14 infections who were diagnosed in newborn babies in 2022, eight in 2023 and so far, in 2024, six from the period of January to June this year. Also, on the same period, 15 percent of more than 552 new cases who were amongst those with injectable illicit drugs. AIDS rated deaths has also increased over the years, with 25 deaths in 2021; 46 in 2022; 82 in 2023; and currently we have 13 deaths in 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the strategy, that was developed following a wider consultation between the stakeholders within the Government and then the community as well. Consultation forums on the strategy organised by the Family Health Division of the Ministry, were attended by the representatives from the faith-based organisations, community support, advocacy groups, partner government agencies, civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations and their contributions and insights have been captured in the strategy. Input from the Permanent Secretary Sub-Committee on HIV and Illicit Drugs and the HIV Board have been incorporated both senior level bodies have endorsed the Strategy. So, through these consultations, the Surge Strategy has been harmonised with the National Counter-Narcotics Strategy of 2023-2028, which Cabinet had endorsed and is now being implemented. We are not alone in terms of assistance from our international technical organisations such as World Health Organisation (WHO), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales in Australia, who have actively participated in the formulation of the Strategy. Sir, the HIV Board through its mandated pro under the HIV Act of 2011, have also endorsed the setting up of two multi-sectoral taskforces to facilitate the implementation and roll out of the Strategy. Cabinet on 12 th September, 2024 has also endorsed the National HIV Strategy Implementation. Over the months ahead, the Ministry through the taskforces and with the support of our technical and community partners will roll out the strategy to the whole of Fiji. People may ask what does the Strategy comprise? There are five priority areas that addresses the need to increase public awareness and understanding of HIV infections. Reduce HIV transmissions and expedite public health response, treatment, care, human rights and social justice for people living with HIV. The goal of the strategy is to enhance early diagnosis, ensure effective treatment, achieve sustain vile suppression and foster a supportive environment free of stigma, discrimination, to improve quality of life for individuals living with HIV and reduce transmission rates. I want to be on the record to say to members of the Parliament and to those that are listening in, that before we see a reduction in the number of cases, Fiji will see a rise in the number of cases. Simply for the fact, that our programmes are increasing testing, so numbers will increase before we start to see the numbers decrease, due to the effectiveness of this strategy, Sir. Another important point to note as well, being diagnosed with HIV now, is no longer a death sentence. With appropriate treatment, people living with HIV can live a productive, fulfilling life,</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>2092</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 contributing effectively to their families, their communities and to Fiji as a whole. I thank the honourable Speaker for the opportunity to share briefly on the National HIV Surge Strategy. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his reply. It was quite shocking to hear that we have surpassed Papua New Guinea. We used to have a regional response to HIV, but at the moment, we are talking about the biggest cause being the “blue-toothing.” There have also been in some quarters saying that one of the reasons for the rise is the lack of money that is going into preventative health and research. If that is true for this, how does the Ministry make sure that it does not happen in other areas? I think there used to be a 2013 regional response where they had some funding, but once that stopped it had an impact on this. I am just wondering how the honourable Minister is looking at how to make sure that preventative funding is coming and the research, so we do not have these kind things happening in the future, not only HIV, but in other areas too. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Since taking office, I have been briefed on UNAIDS and its role on HIV in Fiji, even though the numbers have decreased, but they have maintained a staff at the UN office. In terms of the funding, yes, to note there was a decrease when coming in, but there has been some renewed assistance since taking office, and since announcing the numbers and that has been very much forthcoming within our development partners, mainly DFAT that have put in funding through WHO. I was privy to that handing over ceremony back in Geneva and other development partners are stepping up and assisting us in this space. Yes, I do agree the, the funding for research, the preventative side of it. That is why the Surge Strategy will capture those issues especially on the prevention side. In terms of a budgetary allocation, there have been an increasing budgetary on consumables, especially with testing the capabilities and that is why not only that, together we have used the UN agencies platform in terms of purchasing that has been endorsed by Cabinet. So, we are using that platform to allow them to buy for us the drugs, consumables testing things to enable us to do more. As I have said, we will see a rise in the numbers before we see a fall, and the strategy we will direct us in the way should go forward based on evidence and mostly based on data. MR. SPEAKER.- I think there should be more awareness done here, because we need to take in mind the new cases that we have enough of HIV, it is 500 just for the first six months of this year. That is quite alarming! Perhaps if the honourable Members would be able to come up with some ideas as to how best you can inform the members of the public of the seriousness of the case that we have. We have drugs that has already been highlighted well, but no HIV. It is kind of lingering around us all the time and now there is a sudden increase. I think the concern is very much there. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that help the advocating, we used to have champions. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, the former President and former Speaker was a very visible champion of this issue. So, I think those sorts of things, people in prominent positions, he used to actually take things out of his pocket at events. I think that was getting something like that from a person of that stature really helped to get that message across. MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps you may be able choose one amongst yourselves as to be the new champion. You put the condoms and everything in your pocket and we should not be ashamed of it. Ratu Nailatikau did hell of a work there, “put it on bring it on” that is what he usually says.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2093 Honourable Members, at this juncture for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to the sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
