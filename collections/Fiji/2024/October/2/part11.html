The Committee acknowledges the contribution and support provided by its development partners and international</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>2 nd October, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2049 organisations and commends the overall performance and achievements of the Ministry with a few recommendations to be considered. In accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), our Committee is tasked with scrutinising issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture, and media. Mr. Speaker Sir, through our comprehensive review, we have identified several key concerns and challenges affecting the health sector and have put forward a series of recommendations to address these issues. We recognise and commend the Ministry of Health's ongoing efforts to enhance the health sector through its current policies and procedures. Mr. Speaker Sir, as part of our duties under Standing Order 110, the Committee conducted site visits to hospitals across the Western Division. These visits highlighted several concerns, which we subsequently raised with Ministry of health Officials during their public submissions to the Committee. Our report details these concerns and offers actionable recommendations to address them. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Permanent Secretary and his executive team for their valuable contributions to this review process. I also wish to acknowledge the outstanding leadership and guidance of the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Alitia Bainivalu, and former Committee members - honourable P. K. Bala; honourable K. K. Lal (Alternate Member); and honourable P. K. Bala (Alternate Member), and the current Committee members for their dedicated efforts in finalising this Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and encourage all honourable Members of this esteemed House to review its findings and recommendations. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion without notice that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence hereby submit to Parliament this morning a Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2023 Annual Report that was presented in Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 nd September, 2024 in the last Sitting.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>2050</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd October, 2024 The Financial Intelligences Unit was established in 2006 under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004. The Unit functions both, as an intelligence unit and as a regulator, as mandated by the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004. These two core functions are aimed at protecting Fiji’s financial system from abuse by criminals who seek to use the financial services offered to launder the proceeds of crime or to facilitate other serious crimes. The Unit is fully funded by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) and the Governor of RBF was delegated the responsibilities of the line Minister over the Unit in 2005 and has remained that way up to the reporting period. This Review Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was compiled after the Committee perused the Annual Report and a face-to-face discussion with the Acting Director and her senior staff. The Committee extends its gratitude to them for their timely response to the Committee’s request for information and their openness during our discussions. The Fiji FIU must be commended for being up to date with their Annual Report and I must add that the professional way in which the Annual Report is structured and presented greatly enabled the Committee to compile and table this Review Report back to Parliament in a timely manner. The Review Report has five recommendations, two of which the Committee feels that the line Ministries should look at with some urgency. I thank the Committee Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for the hard work involved in the compilation of this Review Report. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence I submit this Review Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
