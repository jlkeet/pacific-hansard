<body><h3>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</h3><h4>PERSONAL EXPLANATION</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to seek your leave to assure your honourable and respected Chair, and to allay the concerns you have raised yesterday about the various findings of the Committees, and you encouraged Government to carry out follow-up actions. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier in the week, I had mentioned that it might be appropriate for Government, and I quote from what I mentioned in the last paragraph on Page 1715 of the Daily Hansard on Monday, 2nd September, 2024: “I was just thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that, perhaps we can look at the procedures in our parliamentary processes, particularly with the Public Accounts Committee and the various recommendations they make, particularly also in the case where we are looking at</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1868</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 almost generational reports that cover so many years and all the enterprises.” At the end of it, we voted, “We will now vote to note the contents of the Report”. We, at Parliament, could say that we have done our duty, who noted the Report. But you encouraged us yesterday, Sir, to carry out what needs to be done, particularly those that come close to omissions or commissions that are almost culpable, but beyond our power to determine whether they are or not, and that should be carried forward from just noting the Report. I just want to assure your honourable Office that the Government is serious about that, and we will follow up on those Committee Reports. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Prime Minister. I thank you so much for your response on that matter. Once again, the three Committees have raised their concerns in this august Parliament. We, as Members, in listening to our colleagues as Members of those Committees, fully understand where they are coming from. We understand the nature of their responses and yesterday, the diatribe continued, so as to say, I was not informed, you are not present, even though emails and copies of emails were made available. Again, what is there in our role as Members of Parliament? We have another avenue available to us, and it is whether the Cabinet or the Cabinet Sub- Committee, with the honourable Prime Minister, make the directive in this august House and trying to kick in the new format of seeing that things of this nature are fully addressed by this august House. We have the powers of scrutiny and oversight, and that is something that we have attested but we have got them all in order in the Standing Orders. All I was asking is to bring that to your notice, honourable Members. There are ways and avenues of skinning the cat. I thank you most sincerely, honourable Prime Minister, for your response this morning. Do not worry, Sir. As Prime Minister, as soon as you stand, we will have to all wait and hear what you are about to deliver in this august Parliament, whether is it an instruction, or it is something that you have asked to be done immediately. We thank you, Sir.</p></body>
