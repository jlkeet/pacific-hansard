<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for this week. I also welcome all those joining us in the gallery and those watching proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the students and teachers of Totoya District School from Totoya. Welcome to your Parliament and I hope that the proceedings this morning will give a clearer idea of how your Parliament works. Dou bula vinaka mai na wekai keitou mai Totoya. Dou mata vinaka mai. Au vakavinavinaka vakalevu ni ko ni yaco sara mai eke, ena nomuni Vale ni Bose, mo ni mai raici ira na nomuni Lewe ni Bose Lawa, ka vakarogoci ira talega. Vakanuinui vinaka vei kemuni ena nomuni tiko voli oqo. [Greetings to our relatives from the Island of Totoya. We welcome you this morning. We are, indeed, grateful to receive you at your Parliament, and to witness firsthand and hear the deliberations from your Members of Parliament. We sincerely hope that you will enjoy your visit.] 5th Pacific Islands Parliamentary Group Conference (PIPG) For the information of honourable Members, Fiji will host the next 5th Pacific Islands Parliamentary Group Conference (PIPG) from 25th August, 2025 to 29th August, 2025. May I request that you lock in those dates so that we can have as many honourable Members as possible</p><p>6 th September, 2024 Personal Explanation 1867 participate in the Conference. Pacific Blue Identity You may have realised that we have been having a lot of debate, especially from the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations and the group that he leads, and the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the group that he leads known as SIDS but, again, the honourable Prime Minister has been devoting his time a lot in trying to unite the whole of the Pacific under one common identity and, that is, the border that we have - the Pacific Blue. There is only one identity, honourable Members, and we need to identify ourselves with that identity, that we hold dearly to us, because otherwise our voice will not be heard, as alluded to by the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations, including myself. Honourable Members, if you go out to these international meetings, you try as much as possible to get the voice of the Pacific through. There is only 13 island countries in the Pacific region, but if we bring in Indonesia, there is more. Indonesia has 7,000 islands, so it will be great if we can rope them in under that one identify which we share. Written Responses For the information of honourable Members, the Secretariat has received Written Responses from the following Ministers: (1) Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport for Written Question Numbers 101/2023; 114/2023; 124/2023; 125/2023; 134/2023; 65/2024; 76/2024; and 87/2024, all asked by honourable Usamate. (2) Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration to Written Question Numbers 39/2023; 88/2023; 123/2023; 182/2023 and 194/2023, asked by honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua; Written Question Numbers 144/ 2023 asked by honourable Virendra Lal; and Written Question Number 10/ 2024 asked by honourable Kiran. Honourable Members, the responses have been conveyed to the respective honourable Members and copies are available in the Parliament website. I thank the honourable Ministers for furnishing the Written Responses and I am pleased to confirm that there are no overdue written responses. Thank you, honourable Members, we will proceed to the next item.</p></body>
