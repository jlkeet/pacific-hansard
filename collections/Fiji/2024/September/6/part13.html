<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Criteria on Cadet Training in Schools (Question No. 205/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1869 Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the criteria used by the Ministry to approve Cadet training in schools? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for this question, given that it can be a great testament of this cadetship training at the school level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had requested that I be given a time to provide a Ministerial Statement on extra-curricular activities in schools, which includes cadetship training, rugby and athletics, that are currently involving students and school resources, to allow for a brief and better reflection of what is being carried out in schools. In the history of cadet training in schools at that time, there was only a limited number of schools who have its intended purpose. But now, there are about 30 schools that are currently involved in cadet training. In line with the SDG4, this is now part of the lifelong learning so I assure you, honourable Members, that I will make a Ministerial Statement in the next Parliament Sitting, to address all these extra-curricular activities in line with the SDG4 and also part of the Denarau Declaration 202. Currently, Sir, for the schools that are engaged in cadet training, the criteria that is used is as follows: (1) Written parental consent from the students. (2) Medical clearance that the child is physically fit and able to participate in the activity. (3) Religious rights of the child is also taken into consideration because some faiths have reservations for their followers to be part of the cadet training, like the Jehovah’s Witness. (4) Commitment from teachers, teachers must be assigned to supervise and assist the military personnel. (5) Affordability for parents and consent for their child to participate and acknowledge that there will be associated costs that will be shared with them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the criteria that have been used, but like I said, I will be giving a Ministerial Statement covering these extra-curricular activities that are involving students in school. MR. SPEAKER.- First of all, we fully appreciate the position that has been taken by the</p><h4>Ministry and we look forward to that Ministerial Statement.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> I have a supplementary question, honourable Minister for Education. I have a feeling that we have strayed off track, as far as the objectives of cadet training is concerned. Perhaps, a review is very much needed. I know it digs into the pockets of parents to buy the uniform. Right now, it is just marching in uniform. The objectives of discipline and teamwork, I think needs to be relooked at and turn this programme into a useful programme for schools and to keep them occupied, given the problems that we have on drugs. I would like to add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a great addition to cadet training, especially for boarding schools, is to get them to have a brass band. Get them occupied in music. My supplementary question is, would you be willing to make a review of cadet training in schools? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we are trying to do an evaluation of the programme, to improve in terms of the current practice that is being done now, especially with the provision of brass bands to schools, like Queen Victoria School (QVS), which has a long history in terms of the provision of cadet training in schools.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1870</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I think in the 1960s, Suva Methodist Boys School which I had attended, used to have a set of drums donated by the Military and that was how we learnt how to beat the drum and march to the beat of the drum as well. That was in Toorak. Toorak was the only renown primary school that existed then in the Suva area, going right down to Qauia in Lami and right up to Tacirua and Tamavua. Soon, we had the set of drums. I do not know who donated the drums, but we used it and we marched well to the beat of the drum, knowing how to beat the drum for slow march and quick march. I am just sharing that, whilst we await the statement from the honourable Minister for Education. Marketing Initiatives for Destination Fiji (Question No. 206/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the marketing initiatives in place for Destination Fiji in support of Fiji Airways’ forthcoming services to Dallas, United States? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Just last week, on 29 th August, the Air Service Agreement (ASA) for Open Skies was signed between the Government of the United States and the Government of Fiji, which has been heralded as a great achievement by the Coalition Government. We already knew that the honourable Prime Minister, together with the Deputy Secretary of State of the US had signed this in Tonga last week, Mr. Speaker. In preparation for this milestone, earlier this month, Fiji Airways proudly announced its first ever non-stop flight, connecting Nadi, Fiji, with Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, commencing on 10 th December, 2024. The new route represents a significant leap, as Fiji Airways’ 24 th international direct flight and its fifth destination in North America, joining Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu and Vancouver. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Dallas itself, what we have there is the partnership with American Airlines. Fiji Airways has linked up with American Airlines and the AAdvantage travel rewards programme, which is for American Airlines, is a huge step forward for anyone flying Fiji Airways and American Airlines. American Airlines advantaged members can enjoy ticketing through services on Fiji Airways, with all the same benefits, like priority check-in, priority boarding, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, AAdvantage is the longest running loyalty programme in the world. Fiji Airways is now the 50 th full member of Oneworld Alliance, beginning in 2025. There are 115 million members of the AAdvantage programme – the largest in the world. Dallas Fort Worth has 193 domestic US ports that fly directly to Dallas, and 67 international non-stop destinations worldwide, across 26 countries. So, what it means, for example, tourists will be able to fly non-stop from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, through Dallas to Fiji, or from London to Dallas and on to Fiji. So, just one stop into Dallas, Mr. Speaker. The airlines in the Oneworld Alliance include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, Sri Lankan Airlines, Fiji Airways and soon, Oman Air. Dallas Fort Worth is the third busiest airport in the world and in 2023, served 82 million</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1871 passengers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, American Airlines has 850 outgoing flights from Dallas Fort Worth Airport every day. Dallas is considered one of the best and most efficient airports in the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, their service to Fiji is non-stop, of 13 hours, and will operate three times a week - Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, utilising our state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft. In a joint effort, Tourism Fiji has launched a series of collaborative marketing campaigns, aimed at maximising the visibility of the new Dallas route. These campaigns span both, digital and traditional media, specifically targeting key demographics in the Dallas Fort Worth area. By showcasing Fiji’s unique attractions and experiences, through social media campaigns, search engine marketing and targeted email initiatives, we aim to capture the interest of the vast majority of potential visitors. In addition to the direct marketing and advertising activities, the Fiji Airways Sales Team has also been actively promoting the new Dallas service through its trade partners, including travel agents, travel wholesalers, like Flight Centre, and online travel agents such as Expedia. These partnerships not only promote attractive travel packages featuring the new direct flights, but also includes some special incentive programmes to further boost the promotion of Fiji as a travel destination. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to generate buzz and excitement and public relations around the new route, a series of press releases and media engagements are ongoing. These efforts will be complemented by collaborations with prominent travel influencers and bloggers, who will create organic content that highlight the allure of Fiji and the convenience of our new services. Additionally, during the US Roadshow in September, there will be targeted PR events, including the engagement of travel journalists, influencers, industry stakeholders, further elevating Fiji’s profile. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tourism Fiji is also organising promotional events and roadshows in key US cities, including Dallas, New York, Toronto and Los Angeles, with 24 Fijian tourism businesses. Our participation in major travel trade shows and expos, including Virtuoso Travel Week and IMEX America, will allow us to directly engage with industry stakeholders and promote the new route. Since the announcement of the new Dallas service, Fiji Airways has been proactive in promoting it across key markets. Special offers were launched in the US, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, leveraging Fiji Airways paid owned channels, including the website, social media and paid search. Furthermore, last week a promotional fare was launched through digital marketing in New York to drive travel to Fiji. Additionally, our consumer marketing initiatives will span key markets across Texas, California, New York and Florida. This include outdoor advertising, strategic TV spots and contractual sponsorship opportunities with major Dallas-based brands. As part of our commitment to provide a unique Fijian experience from the moment travellers step into Dallas, we are collaborating with the airport to establish a temporary Fiji-themed lounge. This pop-up Fiji lounge will offer a taste of our renowned Fijian hospitality, cultural experiences and detailed information about the new direct flights. Additionally, prominent signage within the airport will further promote the upcoming services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, these marketing strategies are not only designed to elevate Fiji’s visibility as a premier travel destination, but also to ensure the success of our new direct flights to Dallas. By broadening our global connectivity, we are not just bolstering tourism, we are opening new doors for Fijian businesses, creating opportunities for export products and establishing vital</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1872</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 partnerships with American companies. This initiative is a testament to our unwavering commitment to diversifying and strengthening our economy. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the update on the marketing initiatives in place for Destination Fiji, especially in support of Fiji Airways. In light of the fact that the Open Skies Agreement has been signed, and I understand is now actually active, that particular Agreement includes unrestricted capacity and frequency of services for both, passenger and cargo, and open route rights. The question is, does that mean, physically, we will see more metal coming out of the US into Fiji, or is it really specifically just restricted to a few airlines that have partnered up? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, open skies is open skies. It is between the American carriers and Fijian carriers. Any American airline operator can fly into Fiji under this open sky agreement. So, Fijian companies can fly into any US port and any American airline can fly into Fiji from anywhere in the United States. But the reality of the economics is always there, because the route here is thin, so we do not expect any competition that would compromise the survival of our airline. It has actually been there, Mr. Speaker Sir. The recent ASA gave the Americans freedom to fly into Fiji and beyond, free freedom and all that. It was already there. So, what we did, by signing this, is for us to also enjoy those rights. Sir, I understand where the honourable Member is coming from. We have looked at the risks and we do not think it is a risk that can affect our airline. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, we will move on to the third Oral Question for today. I am allowing honourable Usamate, and I would like to inform this august Parliament, that this will be the last time I am allowing this to happen. In someone’s absence, the mover has always been allowed for someone else to raise the question on his behalf or if he is still away. But the Standing Order is very clear, and I have allowed this to run for some time, but now I am making it a rule that this will be the last time we are allowing this, and I am allowing honourable Usamate to ask Questions No. 27. Update on Local Government Elections (Question No. 207/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on when the Local Government Elections will be held? HON. M. K. NALUMISA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for this</p><h4>question, but I was expecting honourable Bala to be present to ask me this question.</h4><p>To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to refer to a media article dated 25 th September, 2014. A similar question was asked to honourable Bala “as to when the Municipal Council Elections will be held?” This was his response, and I quote: “That is my immediate task and that is what I am going to do now and after that within two or three weeks, I am going to visit all Municipalities to brief them on what is expected out of them and to see how we can run our Municipal Council elections.”</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1873 Again, in 2015, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while responding to questions raised by Opposition Parliamentarian, Prem Singh on when the Municipal Council Elections will be held, he said, “The Act has not been reviewed since 1972”, and he termed it as Hurricane Bebe Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though the honourable Member is not here, I must ask the honourable Member he is not here, what action did he take during his tenure as Minister for Local Government to hold this election? Did our residents and ratepayers see any election during his term in office? Did he even make an attempt to initiate the process? A simple answer, Sir, is clear, no action, khali baat, and only empty promises. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker Sir, let it be known that the Coalition Government did not sit idly by, within just one month of coming into office in January 2023, we put our words into action. In 11 months, that is by November 2023, we have achieved what the previous Government did not accomplish in eight years. We reviewed and amended the Local Government Act 1972, aligning it with the current policy and legal frameworks. That was a significant accomplishment achieved, not only by the Ministry of Local Government alone but with the invaluable support of the Fijian Elections Office (FEO), Office of the Solicitor-General, all Municipal Councils and key partners, such as the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES) and the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), extensive consultations were held, something that honourable Bala seemed to disregard. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister for Local Government, I believe the timing of Local Government elections in Fiji is a matter of significant public interest that will be topic of discussion among Fijians and political leaders for several years. The Ministry of Local Government, in consultation with the FEO, plays a critical role in this process, as we are responsible for ensuring that all necessary conditions are met for the elections to proceed. The date of elections is certainly the responsibility of the Electoral Commission, as the Ministry of Local Government has complied with all the requirements and processes towards a successful Local Government elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Local Government elections is vital for ensuring that communities have direct representation, and that Municipal Elections reflect the will of the people. Local Governments operate city or town councils, responsible for municipal services, local infrastructure and the communities’ welfare. However, it is important to note that the last Local Government Elections in Fiji was held in 2005 and since then, Municipal Councils have been managed by appointed Special Administrators rather than elected Councillors. This situation arose in 2006, after which the former Government decided to abolish the elected Councillors and replaced them with Special Administrators. The rationale provided for this decision included concerns about corruption, inefficiency and mismanagement in the Councils. Mr. Speaker, Sir, reinstating the Local Government elections is part of the Coalition Government’s commitment for promoting democracy, accountability and community representation. I would like to reiterate that in 2023, the Ministry commenced the work on the preparation of Local Government elections. This includes an action plan formulated by the assigned working group, which has planned activities and timelines for the same. Since then, our team has been vocal about Government’s plan to hold this elections, emphasising the importance of local democracy and the need to empower communities through elected representation.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1874</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, running a Local Government election in Fiji is also challenging due to its complex social political landscape, diverse ethnic makeup and historical tensions. The lack of regular local elections since 2006 adds to the complexity, requiring substantial efforts to educate and mobilise voters, while ensuring compliance with the electoral laws and fostering a political stability in a fragile democratic environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the major issues that the Ministry has noted is discrepancies in the Municipal wards. The lack of proper documentation for transfer of wards in few Municipal Councils has also caused delays in the finalisation of wards. This imbalance can lead to unequal representation and resource allocation, affecting the effectiveness of local governance. Sir, for the first time, the new policy guiding the representation in councils is where each resident’s vote within a Municipality carries the same weight. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend our key agencies - IFES, International IDEA, Commonwealth Local Government Forum and New Zealand Local Government, and the Government Ministries for their assistance in the preparation of the Local Government Election thus far. With the assistance provided by our key agencies, the Ministry has completed major processes, such as conducting public consultations, revision of the archaic provisions relating to Local Government elections in the Local Government Act 1972, awareness raising concerns and finalisation of Municipal wards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, the Ministry in the consultation with all Municipal Councils, is in the final stage of ironing out the logistical details for the upcoming elections. Our focus now is on establishing policies and procedures for the allocation of Councillors per Municipal ward. This is to ensure that the electoral process is transparent and fair. Once the Ministry finalises all the technical requirements, the next phase will involve collaboration with the FEO and the Electoral Commission for the remaining process. In this case, we want to make sure that accurate information and proper processes are followed before handing over to the FEO. Therefore, the Ministry is working very closely with the FEO with objective to have the elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the status of local elections reflects Fiji’s Government’s commitment to restoring local democracy, ensuring that communities have a voice in their own governance. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, work is underway to allow villages within municipal boundaries and, at least, 2 kilometres outside of the boundaries, to be part of the elections. These are villages with landowners of towns and cities; hence, they have the right to participate in the process to elect councillors. These villages will be included through section 125 of the Local Government Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as per section 125 of the Local Government Act 1972, the inclusion of the iTaukei villages will require the approval of the iTaukei Affairs Board. It is worth noting that the Board has been consulted and the Ministry is awaiting the confirmation of the above. In addition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Solicitor-General has drafted appropriate regulations which is, again, pending at the iTaukei Affairs Board for comments and suggestions. We endeavour to conclude this process as soon as practicably possible, to enable a smooth transition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I want to underscore that merely polling and elections are not enough, we must ensure that the foundation upon which the new Councils we appoint is robust and resilient. To this end, we have been diligently working to establish a comprehensive Code of Conduct and other essential guidelines through new regulations. We are also undertaking a thorough review and standardisation of inconsistent bylaws,</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1875 ensuring that they align with our commitment to good governance. With the valuable support of the New Zealand Local Government, we are putting in place new policies, rules and procedures that will be firmly in place by the time the new councillors take office. These measures are designed to guarantee that the Councils operate systematically and professionally with unwavering accountability and transparency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is not just preparing for elections, they are building a solid foundation for the future of local governance in Fiji. While there are challenges to overcome, the Government is making progress in its preparation, and there is clear intention to hold the elections in the financial year 2024-2025. The day of the election will be confirmed, following consultations with the FEO and the Electoral Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude with a call for continued support from all the political leaders, CSOs and the public, to ensure that the Local Government elections are conducted successfully, which will contribute to the strengthening of democracy in Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to this question. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 17 th September, 2023, as reported by Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC), the honourable Deputy Prime Minister made some comments where Fijians will be able to vote in Municipal Council elections in August 2024. The question is very clear, when? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the honourable Minister to provide definitive timeline as to when will the elections be held for the Municipal Councils? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already stated that it will be held in the next financial year. The response by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was that the possible timeline for it, but I want to assure the honourable Members as well as the members of the public that Local Government elections will be held. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question was already asked by honourable Ketan Lal. MR. SPEAKER.- This question has triggered a lot of interests.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have a statement and a question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Question! HON. R. R. SHARMA.- It is a very serious statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I formally write to the Ministers if issues are raised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a complaint about a Special Administrator, going into the shops and saying, “I am the King of this Town!” (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I will be formally writing it to the honourable Minister:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- These kinds of people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should not be part of our Administration. It is a serious matter, take it in a serious way! Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister is very effective, unlike others in responding to issues. They have talked about the promises of Local Government election, but they are running on</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1876</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 the national deficit budget… HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Areh! HON. R. R. SHARMA.- …they have increased their debt, how will you finance the Local Government election? Not at the cost of taxpayers, please! MR. SPEAKER.- It is up to you, honourable Minister for Local Government, to answer the question. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I need to respond to the comment made by the honourable Member regarding one of the comments made by one of the Special Administrators. I am not really sure of the Special Administrator that he is referring to, but, all I can say to the members of public, whatever issues that have been raised by them regarding any of our Special Administrators, and even raised by some political parties, I have managed to resolve some of those issues. That is something that I have done. so, if it was brought to my office, I would have responded to that question. Based on the funding, that is something that the Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is also going to consider before we actually hold the Municipal Election. Thank you. Functions and Composition - Fiji’s Human Rights Taskforce (Question No. 208/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Attorney-General update Parliament on the functions and composition of the proposed Fiji’s Human Rights Task Force? HON. G. E. LEUNG.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for i-Taukei Affairs for his question. As of 2019, Fiji is a party to the nine core International Human Rights Treaties of the United Nations, as well as several optional protocols that are part of the Treaties. These include the: (1) Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; (2) Convention on the Rights of the Child; (3) Convention on the Rights of People with Disability; (4) Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment of Punishment; and International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, et cetera. (5) Mr. Speaker, Sir, by ratifying these Instruments, Fiji has assumed responsibility under international law for implementing the obligations under the respective Treaties. Every Treaty, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires Fiji to report periodically to each of the Treaty bodies that are part of the Conventions, and then participate in a public examination by the Treaty bodies which are typically situated in Geneva. The Treaty body then makes recommendations which, as a State’s party, Fiji must consider implementing, and then subsequently provide progress reports to those bodies on the state of those implementations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to Treaty obligations, Fiji as a States party and a member of the</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1877 United Nations, participates also in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) conducted by the Human Rights Council which, again, is situated in Geneva. This is a Member State driven peer-review process under which every country’s human rights record is reviewed, every four or five years. Recommendations received during the UPR process are either formally accepted or rejected by the State being reviewed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji completed its third UPR Review in November 2019, where the report showcased how the majority of the recommendations from the second cycle were implemented. At the conclusion of the third UPR, Fiji had received a total of 242 recommendations made by 97 States or Countries that are part of the Human Rights Council. Of those 200 plus recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji accepted 207 recommendations. As a result of the reviews and the recommendations, Fiji has reporting obligations which are outdated. For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination were required to be submitted by January or February 2016, that has not been reported. The initial report by Fiji to the Committee Against Torture was required to be submitted by April 2017, that is outdated. Fiji’s initial reports to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was due in July 2019, again, we are in arrears. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just as a further example, Fiji’s sixth report to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), was due in March 2022, and we have not complied with our reporting obligations. Those delays, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are a matter of concern and they do highlight, at the national level, the need for a robust mechanism to ensure that we, as a State party to these important international Instruments and Treaties, that we report on a timely and effective basis. As a result, of those outdated reports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations has advocated that we establish a National Mechanism for the Implementation, Reporting and Follow-up of the Treaties, in short, known as NMIRF. The mechanism envisioned will be a permanent Government structure, tasked with inter-agency or inter-ministerial coordination and engagement with international human rights mechanisms, to ensure that we, as a country, are able to comply with our reporting obligations and to not experience further delays. Mr. Speaker, Sir, following Cabinet's approval last month, the Fiji Human Rights Taskforce was launched on Friday, 30 th August this year. The purpose of the Taskforce and its functions will include, for example, engaging and liaising with international human rights mechanisms, including the UN Human Rights Treaty Body, the Universal Periodic Review process and the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Organising and coordinating the preparation of Fiji’s National reports to these international human rights mechanisms, including initial reports, periodic reports, the common core document, our mid-term reports and follow ups, responding to communications and decisions, country visits by special rapporteurs, follow up questions, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the effectiveness of the Taskforce, it will comprise inter-agency representatives from different Government Ministries and agencies, including the Fiji Police force, the Corrections Service, the Fiji Military Forces, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics, et cetera. This wide composition will enable comprehensive and coordinated action on a range of human rights issues across all sectors of Government. The establishment of Fiji’s Human Rights Taskforce will demonstrate Fiji’s commitment to implementing the 14 Universal Periodic Review recommendations that Fiji accepted in 2019. This is a significant milestone in our journey towards a more transparent, accountable and rights respecting society.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1878</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to answer the question, and I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for i-Taukei Affairs, for the question. HON. F. S. KOYA.- The honourable Attorney-General, we understand what the Taskforce has been set up for, basically, making sure that we are compliant with what we have signed in the previous years. I also just wanted to know whether the Taskforce will be engaging in providing more policy direction and different recommendations, in terms of what can be bettered in terms of the foundation that we already have on the human rights platform? Will we be looking at some bold new policies and recommendations that may come out of this particular Taskforce that has been set up? HON. G. E. LEUNG.- I thank the honourable Koya for his question. I would simply say this, honourable Member, by way of response, the inter-agency inter-ministerial Taskforce will provide a vehicle for robust discussions between public officials in those respective agencies to engage in a critical analysis of Fiji’s obligations under those Treaties, and to provide recommendations to the Taskforce on how Fiji would be able to implement more effectively, its international human rights obligations. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea and we will resume and continue when the bell is rung. The Parliament is adjourned. The Parliament adjourned at 10.57 a.m.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1879 The Parliament resumed at 11.33 a.m. Level Of Expansion - Outsource Industry (Question No. 209/2024) HON. F. S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, inform Parliament on what level of expansion we have had in the outsource industry in the last 24 months and has the wage rise affected this expansion? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually a very good question, as it gives me an opportunity to talk a bit about an industry that has great potential for our country. I know I have talked about billion-dollar industries too much in this august Parliament, but this particular one is another real possibility. Speaking to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) just recently, he advised that the foreign exchange earnings from outsourcing industry is around $200 million, and about 8,000 employees, give or take, a couple of thousand. On that trajectory, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would suspect that in 10 years, it should be half a billion-dollar industry, and beyond that, the sky is the limit. It contributes to economic diversification in our country and is a great way for our young people to seek employment, particularly for those who, perhaps, have no visibility on a career path and are just wondering about what they would like to do. It is an excellent opportunity because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the type of training that these young men and women get, is basically world class training for work exposure because they are working for offshore companies and so the standards, the expectations, the deadline setting, all these very important items when it comes to permanent employment, Sir, our young children are actually working at an international level. They are sitting in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but for all intents and purposes, they are offshore working on behalf of very big organisations. Just as an aside, Sir, just recently, one of the larger outsourcing companies in Fiji actually started providing services to the UK Hertz in the United Kingdom, this is the car rental company. From that, they are now talking about a wider relationship, which may include the global Hertz brand. This is the type of opportunity that is in front of our country, and compliments to the previous Government for kick starting it. I was still in the private sector then and tried to do my bit, and we are just continuing the work. This industry has great potential and great benefits for our young men and women. Over the past 24 months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s outsourcing industry has undergone another transformation. I would like to report that despite the minimum wage rate, the industry still remains competitive and resilient and has emerged as one of the critical sectors when it comes to our national economic development. In the last two years since August, there has been a record of about eight companies that have set up business outsource operations in Fiji, and that number continues to grow. Things that work in the industry’s favour is the fact that we are neutral speaking, we have a very good education and literacy level, proximity to some of the key economies of Australia, New Zealand and the US, even Europe and the UK are starting to consider Fiji as a real option. Of course there is a cultural similarity, everyone knows that when an Australian or New Zealander calls and they realise they are talking to someone from Fiji, it suddenly turns into a rugby conversation. These are the types of cultural</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1880</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 similarities that have created great benefits for the industry. The other thing that we are seeing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is one particular outsourcing company which is a large operator, starting to consider operations outside the normal city location. Right now, they are operating in Drasa Vitogo, just outside Lautoka, they are operating in Navua, and these are a couple of a hundred young men and women, taking the work closer to the rural or their places of dwelling. There is potential, Sir, according to that company, to even move to Labasa, potentially, and may be Savusavu, and with the cable being installed from Labasa down to Savusavu by Telecom, that actually has a real opportunity as well. Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, the knowledge process outsourcing had been asked here in this Parliament on occasions and that is also developing and evolving. We have one company, Sir, in Fiji that has already has 12 local staff being Artificial Intelligence in Fiji and that just crept up in the last 12 months. So, the potential, Sir, for this industry is very exciting and is very promising. As a government, we will continue to support this industry as best we can, to ensure that we realise some of the real benefits that are in this industry. And just to give you an example, Sir, Google, who we are developing a partnership with, their Philippines Call Centre is 30,000 strong. Wonderfully, we can get, at least, 5,000 of that at some stage in the future, Sir. In terms of the specific questions raised around wage rates, the outsourcing starting salary has been always above the basic minimum wage rate. According to my calculation, it is about 56 percent more, and so in terms of the minimum wage rate adjustments, it does not quite play because it is already above the minimum wage. However, that does not mean we should be complacent. We are competing with some very aggressive destinations. This outsourcing industry has started to move into Latvia and some of these other European countries, into South-East Asia, so we just have to watch that we do not get too far ahead of ourselves in that regard. However, certainly, Sir, when you look at the closer economies of Australia, New Zealand and the United States, we remain quite competitive. In terms of the broader issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess, some of the challenges that the industry is currently facing is to do with employment. Currently, according to the outsourcing industry that is struggling to find workers which is a bit saddening, Sir, we are trying to work together with them to try and ensure that there is a good pipeline of workers coming through to allow the industry to continue to grow. I hope, over the next 12 months, that is certainly going to be a focus for the Government. On top of that, the need to have data protection laws, that is already underway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of consultation with the donor partners. We do have the EU stepping up to actually help us with that regard, so that will create more market readiness, if you like, to take on more larger operations, Sir. Of course, in terms of Artificial Intelligence, how does it look in the next few years against the current BPO operations? All I can say is that, obviously, there will be a transition, but it demonstrates if you already have capability, if you already have 12 young men and women in our country, in the AI space, that augurs well. Finally, Mr. Speaker, certainly out of this industry, we are talking about other things like, perhaps, Fiji being a cyber security hub, not only of the Pacific, but even at the global hub. So, these are some of the opportunities, Sir, that in this very exciting space, it is an excellent opportunity for our young people, and we are looking forward to work with Government and also the other side in continuing to support this industry which will do wonderful things for Fiji.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1881 HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a follow-up question. We had earlier on, just post-COVID, we found out that there was a tremendous amount of interest from Europe when Fiji actually opened up. As you know, post-COVID, we actually went to Portugal to do all these things. It is great to see what is actually happening, we have set a platform and it is good to see the Ministry actually ensuring that the numbers may catch up to about10,000 people a year, which was looked at earlier on with a lot of support from our development partners. The question that came out of the fact that there was a lot of risk diversification that was happening in this particular area because they found that out during the COVID-19. One of the tools that we had, as you have rightfully said, is that we speak neutral English, and we have highly educated young workforce. Will you also be looking at talking to the Ministry of Education where the schools can start teaching in their curriculum, languages like French and Spanish, et cetera, because that will also take us to another level? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The broader discussion around just education generally in outsourcing is something that we have been trying to push, as the honourable Minister knows, even from his time, in trying to develop courses that are focussed on BPO-type operations. The discussion on languages has come up as well with some of the universities, so we are trying to discuss that as well. Recently, I think the Chinese language was going to be introduced through the education system, so we are headed in that direction. It may require some more cohesive effort in a not-too- distant future but, certainly, we are fortunate that USP and FNU have a ready resource of French speaking undergraduates and other languages as well. So, the BPOs tend to use those for now but I suspect as we continue to grow, there may well be a need to look at the question of language a lot more closer. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his elaboration and it is great to see the development and growth of this sector. It has been a very useful sector in mopping up our graduates, the unemployed, or those who have not completed their degrees. One of the things that has occurred to me is that, at the beginning, a lot of the work has been pitting at the lower level - answering complaints, transferring complaints, and I am glad to see there has been some focus on cyber security which should be at a level a bit higher. I think we need to look at areas of writing code, instead of just doing basic accounting sort of thing, queries going into audits, et cetera. In terms of the movement towards higher value adding jobs in the BPO sector, is there a concerted effort or a policy to try to generate that rather than just the BPO jobs at the lower level? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, honourable Usamate, for your very pertinent question. Certainly, I mentioned briefly about Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) sector. In terms of the posture of the Outsource Fiji organisation, certainly Government is to try and attract KPO type of operations into the country. Right now, you probably would not realise this, but a certain accounting firm in Fiji is already doing quite a substantial amount of KPO work. Apart from their normal chartered accounting operations, they have a back office that is doing a lot of the technical work around accounts receivable - that kind of accounting work, including AI. So, it is a growth area and as we know, there is about four international firms in Fiji. Just imagine, one of them has already had 200 persons strong in Nadi and Suva. Potentially, if the other accounting firms starts moving, we will have another 800 people gainfully employed in professional areas. As correctly pointed out by honourable Usamate, the KPO industry, obviously, pays a lot</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1882</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 more. Just to give you some feel, a basic cyber security analyst will get paid up to US$40,000 to US$50,000 in the United States. It probably would not get paid but you can imagine what that means in terms of the potential. The discussion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, around, how do we raise our wages in Fiji and get to a higher wage level, I know the hotel industry is already at around about $8 an hour and moving fast, but certainly the BPO sector and the ICT industry can really transition a lot of our young people to get into these higher paying roles and very exportable roles. My message always to the young people is, start doing IT jobs or study in IT, because there is a great potential. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to honourable Usamate’s question, yes, it is an area of interest, and we are working together with certain organisations that do have KPO content in their work. We will certainly try and ensure that with Google coming on board, with Starlink coming on board and communication becoming more accessible, that we leverage a lot of these and turn them into real genuine opportunities. Sub-Recipient Agreement – Global Fund Programme (Question No. 210/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the Sub-Recipient Agreement between the Ministry and the United Nations Development Programme for a Global Fund Programme to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Tuberculosis and Malaria in Fiji? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sub-Recipient Agreement (SRA) between the Ministry and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for a Global Fund Programme to fight Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria in Fiji has already been endorsed by Cabinet, and the Ministry is awaiting to sign the SRA with UNDP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Global Fund contribution to UNDP is at FJ$489,165, which will be under the SRA, to carry out activities stated in their workplan for a period of three years from 2024 to 2026. In accordance with the Grant Agreement, UNDP is the principal recipient, that may provide funding to other entities to carry out activities, contemplated under the project as sub-recipients. In this case, the Ministry is referred to as sub-recipient. In terms of the workplan, the project intends to combat and control the increasing number of HIV and TB cases in Fiji through a design workplan that looks after the activities such as, HIV Combination Prevention Programme, stigma and discrimination, online courses for healthcare workers, capacity building for healthcare workers and transgender health, to name a few. A grant award to carry out the project was initially US$460,000 plus, equivalent to more than a million Fiji dollars. However, the Ministry had further consulted the World Health Organization (WHO) and together, they have revised the workplan by moving some of the activities to WHO to facilitate, as they have their expertise to undertake those activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, understanding the great situation of HIV and TB in Fiji, this funding has come at a much-needed time, to contribute to the development and strengthening of the public health and clinical response. The Global Fund Grant workplan has been developed by a technical working</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1883 group of the HIV and TB programme members, identifying the country’s needs in collaboration and consultation with our non-government partners. It will contribute to the National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027 Plan and the National TB Strategic Plan implemented by the Ministry’s Family Health Unit or HIV and TB Programme at the Tamavua Twomey Hospital. Under the SRA, the UNDP will implement the Integrated Biological Behavioural Surveillance Survey for key affected population and rapid assessment for drugs in 2024. This will benefit the nation in better understanding the situation of HIV, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and its relationship with drugs in Fiji. Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we thank the UNDP for assisting the Government to help with the procurement of these drugs. My question to the honourable Minister, does the Ministry have the capacity to combat this problem of HIV/AIDS, and we know that this $5.2 million is only for three years, what preventive measures are in place to control the rise in HIV? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank honourable Ravunawa for his supplementary question. In terms of the capacity, we will always need help in that area in terms of human resources and other resources that need to be made available to the Ministry to combat HIV/AIDS. Basically, we need the support not only from the whole of Government, whole of Parliament, but also throughout the nation. As I have mentioned, this is a fight not only for the Ministry of Health, but for the nation as a whole. In terms of your question on what the Ministry is doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of budgetary allocation, yes, there is budgetary allocation, and we are grateful, again, to our development partners, both multilateral and bilateral, for stepping in and assisting us in this space. This year, when I went to the World Health Assembly in Geneva, I was very fortunate to attend the handing over ceremony between DFAT and WHO, and that money is specifically to combat HIV/AIDS here in Fiji. Again, we thank theGovernment for progressing these issues and also thank our development partners for coming onboard and assisting the Ministry in its time of need, especially combating HIV/AIDS. As I have mentioned, the capacity, yes, we have some capacity but we will need to improve and refocus our attempt on improving the capacity within the Ministry to tackle HIV much better. Vinaka. Progress of Termite Control Assistance Grant (Question No. 211/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the progress of the Termite Control Assistance Grant for dwelling and structures affected by the Asian Subterranean Termites in both, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years there has been an increasing spread of the Asian Subterranean Termites (AST) in the Western Division, which resulted in a surge in notification and infrastructural damages received by the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF). So, given the significant increase in the spread of termites in the Western Division, the Government, for the first time, specifically in the 2023-2024 Budget allocated a sum of $3 million for the Termite Control Assistance Programme.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1884</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 Under Head 50, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to assist affected households with relief packages and in addition to continue with the efforts to minimise the spread of AST, a sum of $2 million is provided in the 2024-2025 financial year programme. As part of the implementation mechanism, the Termite Taskforce was established to help foster Government’s effort in assisting households affected by AST infestation. The Taskforce, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is co-chaired by the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, with members comprising of staff from BAF, Lautoka City Council and Ministry of Finance. The Taskforce chose to use the first year to pilot the programme to evaluate the best approach to help control and eradicate AST in Fiji. The Termite Control Assistance Programme considered the Lautoka area under the pilot programme. The main activities of the Taskforce include: (a) enhanced collaboration between BAF, Lautoka City Council and Ministry of Finance to improve termite operations; (b) procurement of termite baiting services and establishment of the Termite Subsidy Programme; and engagement of media organisation for awareness programmes. (c) In order to provide relief to the people whose homes have suffered extensive damages due to termite infestation, Government announced a Termite Subsidy Programme, mainly for people in Lautoka, Ba, Nadi and Rakiraki. The Termite Subsidy Programme was a subsidy of $5,000 is provided for households with combined household income of less than $30,000 and a subsidy of $2,000 is provided for households with combined income between $30,000 and $50,000. The subsidy, Sir, intends to help residents repair their homes and ensure that they are structurally sound for people to live in. Just to give you some details, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,327 applications were received by the Lautoka City Council, the staff stationed at Commissioner Western’s Office of 1,327 applications, 448 applications have been verified to be in accordance with the criteria of the programme and have been paid $5,000 and $2,000 subsidy with the total cost of $2.2 million. Those below $30,000, the number of successful applicants were 439, that amounted to $2.195 million, and those between $30,000 to $50,000, only nine were successful. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 327 applications have been verified and will be paid in the coming months, while 160 applications are pending verification. Sir, 392 applications await information clarification, and 54 applicants were unsuccessful. So, in summary: (1) Approved and paid for – 148; (2) Verified to be paid in September – 327; (3) Pending verification – 160; (4) Pending information from applicant – 338; and (5) Unsuccessful applicants – 54. The unsuccessful applicants, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were due to: (1) duplications such as father-son application; (2) (3) (4) household with no sign of AST infestation. tenant and landlord application; insufficient documentation; and</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1885 Sir, BAF and Lautoka City Council provided administrative support and verified all claims of AST and income category before payments are made. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we just do not stop by providing the subsidy, I think in the long term, the idea is to eradicate AST and those household that have the subsidy will simultaneously receive the termite baiting system because I think that is the most effective way to deal with it. So, the termite baiting system is used to control termite infestation by deploying what they call “tasty baits” above or below ground to attract termite before they reach a home or business. The objective of the initiative is to ensure that baits are readily available. The public and nest termite baiting services is promoted in places like Lautoka for properties that have been severely impacted by AST. The initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to help approximately 1,000 households, manage the spread of AST and, of course, meet the required criteria of the programme. The tender for the baiting services has closed, and a service provider has been selected and we are currently in the contract signing stages. We expect the baiting services to commence next month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, BAF has been strengthened. We have provided additional 12 officers, one vehicle for compliance, and to protect the spread of AST, a grant is also provided for the establishment of BAF Officers in Nadi, Ba and Nakasi, and we are also looking at Labasa, so the Taskforce is already on it. I want to take this opportunity to thank both, the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, for their leadership and the ability, for the first time, to get a government programme to be able to address these issues. It is now also affecting houses in Nakasi, it has gone to Labasa, and it is causing significant problems for low-income households and the houses get damaged very quickly. This is the Government’s programme in dealing with that. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Lautoka is the worst affected by termites. This is not a question but just a comment. Looking at the number of people who have been assisted, it is only 448, but there are many who have been affected. My suggestion is that proper awareness should be carried out so that people, especially living in the remote and rural areas, come to know or are made aware how to apply and what are the requirements. That is my request. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have three points and one question to this. I thank the Government for this initiative, yet there can always be amendments. One thing I experienced when building my farm, I bought treated pine, but at the end of the day, the termites had infested. Basically, I was sold untreated timber at a price of treated timber. It is something the Government can really look into, because it is how our Fijians are being cheated upon, and some businesses are making money in this way. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government can also look into this. When a recipient goes, for example, to a hardware store and say, your final quote is $4,900. The person, obviously, would say, “Can you reduce the price?” What happens is, receiving the termite assistance and then going to the hardware store and purchasing untreated timber, again, and building your house, you are, sort of, setting yourself up for another infestation. Can the Government monitor this assistance so that we have permanent solutions on how we are helping households with our funds, and it is not gone to waste? One more thing, is there a biological solution to this matter? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first point, as I have said, one of the programmes in the scheme of things is the engagement of media organisations for awareness programmes. Just to address honourable Sharma’s comment, I agree with him. I think a lot of</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1886</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 cheating goes on in terms of treated versus untreated timber. In the long run, as I have said, the big effort in this programme, and this is what the Taskforce that honourable Tubuna and honourable Kiran have been emphasising with BAF, is that the biological approach based on baiting approach that have been tried in Australia and in other countries, has worked. So, what we intend to do is scale up these programmes. Probably, by the time we come for the next budget and there are new areas that are opening up in Nakasi and Labasa, it could become a big national problem affecting a lot of people’s houses because even in concrete houses, these termites eat away all the timber and it creates a mess in those houses. Yes, I think those are good points to take into account. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for his detailed explanation. I just wanted to add on by sharing my experience with the kind of timber that is sold in our hardware stores. There are certain requirements by the Ministry of Forestry as to how they can fill up a sheet as certain information needs to be there when it goes to the hardware stores. But during my investigation when I was with Consumer Council of Fiji, we found that most of these hardware stores do not care. They just got the timber, they label it as treated and they will sell it at a higher price, as has been highlighted. So, the point that I want to raise here is, no matter how much bating we are going to do, no matter how much money we are going to spend, if you do not treat or really seriously take the issue of treating the timber right, we will have that problem. And I can tell you one thing, it is not just the hardware companies who would or rather like the system to be as loose as it is, but also the timber treatment companies. I recall that we had so many meetings with the Ministry of Forestry. We did awareness raising, but at the end of the day, we realised that it is really the consumer who has been cheated, because they cannot identify what is treated and what is not treated. So, I just wanted to alert the Taskforce that perhaps, that is where we need to dive deeper. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, a purchaser should know what he is buying. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are issues that are real. I experienced that myself some years back. You buy treated timber, it is not treated, and then after two or three years, it gets bad. So, maybe, we need to look at that more carefully. So, I agree with it. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Lautoka was the first area to be infested by termites and then starts spreading elsewhere. It has gone to Vanua Levu and areas such as Vunivau and Valebasoga are suffering. So, what the Government can do is, the lessons learnt from Lautoka can be quickly implemented there so that the spread of termites can be controlled so the damage is lesser. So, I request the Government to quickly look at these areas where the spread is little and can be controlled, and quickly implement the lessons learnt from Lautoka into those areas. The other question is, I see that the programme budget has reduced from $3 million to $2 million. Could the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance explain why it has been reduced? Is the uptake slow or we are unable to disperse the funds? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- There are two reasons, we looked at the usage in the previous budget and as I have said, the Taskforce is still getting a handle on what is happening - how the baiting system is going to work and also identifying the people who are actually affected and those in that income categories. So, when we look at subsidies, we look at those who need it most.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1887 The other part of the programme, which is baiting, as I have said, that requires a little more work and I think the Taskforce is on it. Obviously, the lessons learnt in Lautoka would be used in other areas, particularly in Labasa. The Taskforce is already working on the Labasa issues, so if there is additional funding that is needed as a result of what the Taskforce will do, then we have options of deployment and virement, as we had discussed yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, once again, thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for his explanation. I was going to talk about the issue of baiting, I am not too clear now whether that baiting is happening yet or not because my suggestion was going to be, in areas like Nakasi and Labasa. I declare my interest as I live in Nakasi. I realise the funding for the last year was not fully utilised. So, if that money can be directed to baiting as a preventative measure in these areas where it is about to explode in Nakasi for instances and Labasa, would that be one of the plans you need to do as preventative measure up front? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-I think the Taskforce is looking at that. You are right, we need to look at all the areas to try and stop the spread. The focus is on baiting, otherwise we can provide subsidies. People will go and buy timber, and they might not get the right timber, and you end up with this vicious cycle that will continue. So, we are trying to make sure that we break that, and the best way to do that is to use the baiting system that works in other countries. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. It takes care of that. It is how you bait it, honourable Kiran and honourable Tubuna, to come to attend to your problem there, otherwise it will infest on its own. Blue Economy Cooperation and Sustainable Development (Question No. 212/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between Fiji and the People’s Republic of China with respect to Deepening Blue Economy Cooperation and Sustainable Development? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management for the question. In keeping with the good work done by the previous Government, we will continue to deepen relationships across the board with our economic partners, and it is fair to say that China is actually one of those partners. So, the question was about an update on the MOU between Fiji and China concerning the Blue Economy Cooperation and Sustainable Development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this month, the honourable Prime Minister, on his official visit to China, signed an MOU with the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China. The MOU outlines a framework for cooperation aimed at fostering sustainable and inclusive blue economy, aligning with our national objectives and the broader Pacific regional strategies. It is important to understand that the MOU does not place any legal obligations on the parties. However, it creates areas for renewed and deepened strengthening of relationships. Key areas of focus in fostering new economic drivers within the blue economy includes areas in environmental best practices, bilateral investment cooperation, good business practices and, of course, international</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1888</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 environment commitment support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOU is very beneficial for Fiji for several reasons, particularly in promoting and facilitating sustainable investment in the country. It directly supports Fiji’s national plans for sustainable economic growth and environmental conservation, particularly, those related to the blue economy. We all recall the initial Blue Town initiative that was initiated by previous Government which the current Government is also continuing, and this MOU will ensure that the Blue Town concept that initially was around Savusavu, Cabinet has now broadened it to be more national in nature, it starts getting executed and MOUs such as this will assist greatly, Sir, in furthering those objectives. It, of course, aligns to the broader goals of the 2050 Blue Pacific Continent Strategy, ensuring that our national efforts also contribute to regional prosperity and sustainability. By fostering new growth drivers in the Blue Economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOU, looks at expansion sectors such as, fisheries, marine tourism and renewable ocean energy. This diversification is crucial for creating sustainable revenue streams that will support Fiji’s long-term economic resilience. The MOU also aims to position Fiji as a hub for blue economy investments in the Pacific by creating attractive investment platforms, including marine economic cooperation parks. This will not only attract direct foreign investment, but also drive infrastructure development and business growth in key areas, contributing to job creation. The MOU emphasises capacity building and the transfer of knowledge and technology, which are vital for enhancing the skills of our workforce and the competitiveness of our businesses in the global market. Collaboration with research institutes will also foster innovation, leading to more efficient and sustainable use of our marine resources. This MOU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reaffirms Fiji’s commitment to global environmental standards by adhering to international obligations, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Paris Agreement on climate change. In addition, the focus on green investments will support Fiji’s transition to a low-carbon economy, preserving our marine biodiversity for future generations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to pick on some of the practical investment potentials as appearing from this MOU, quite recently, we had one investor from Hong Kong, expressing his interest in looking at oysters and giant prawns in Fiji. So, there are some active discussions happening on that front now, Sir. If they come to fruition or gain momentum, we will certainly share them in Parliament. But these are the early harvests from the MOU that we are discussing today. In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reiterate that this MOU is not just a bilateral cooperation initiative but a very much strategic partnership that reflects on our collective dedication to fostering sustainable development and deepening our engagement in the blue economy. It opens new avenues for investment, capacity building, and international cooperation, all of which are essential for building a prosperous and resilient future for our beloved Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Just before we allow supplementary questions to be raised, just a matter of housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders in respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1889</p></body>
