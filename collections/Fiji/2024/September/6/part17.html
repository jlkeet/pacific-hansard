<body><h3>BILLS - FIRST READING</h3><h4>BILLS - FIRST READING</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 84, I move: That the Audit Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17/2024), be now read the first time.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>1907 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion (Please hand the four copies of the Bill to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- While it is the first time, the Government hasâ€¦</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> After a long time, Sir.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- I have not finished what I wanted to say. You should count yourselves lucky because the Government has decided that this one here will take the full process of having the Bill scrutinised and debated in this august House. [A Bill for an Act to repeal the Audit Act 1969 and provide for the powers, duties and mandate of the Auditor-General and for the audit of the Public Accounts and Public Entities and related matters (Bill No. 17 of 2024)] Honourable Members, in accordance with Standing Order 84(1), the Bill has now been read the first time. The Bill will now be listed on the Order Paper and set down for Second Reading on a future sitting date. Honourable Members until such time the honourable Deputy Prime Minister will give notice for the Second Reading, I encourage all honourable Members to utilise this time to peruse the Bill and prepare for debate which will primarily focus on the principals and merits of the Bill. Interestingly, there should be a clause on immunity, I hope, because we are trying to immunise the Auditor-General as well in carrying out his duty. We do not like the Office of the Auditor-General to go through that critical journey where he is not allowed to freely flex his wings, so to speak in carrying out his duties. The Australian Auditor-Geneal has that protection and, likewise, we were so happy that it is now part of Clause 9 of the Bill.</p></body>
