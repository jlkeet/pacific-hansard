<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, thank you for the update on the actual MOU that has been signed with China with respect to deepening the blue economic cooperation and sustainable development. Honourable Minister, this obviously has a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that was begun in 2018 as per to the actual agreement. The question is that under that BRI, there were quite a few things that Fiji was a beneficiary of, and I am talking about the Suva City Council building, et cetera, the Nabouwalu Dreketi highway, and some of the bridges that were done. Does this particular MOU have a portion of that agreement that will mean that we have some projects that Fiji will benefit through this particular MOU that has been signed, especially in terms of the sustainable development part of the MOU? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the great things with MOUs is, it is almost like a blank canvas. So, it allows for cooperation on various aspects so, I guess, the opportunity is to do quite a few things, including direct economic investment, and other issues suggested by honourable Koya, will be part of the ongoing discussions going forward in terms of the development of this MOU. But sadly, in the initial conversation, what this brings to the table is an opportunity to discuss some areas of real opportunity for Fiji and try and convert them into good economics as well.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1890</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, definitely, we want to do more, we want to grow the economy. When we do sign MOUs, probably something that is critical and Government needs to seriously look into this now, is probably more along the lines of the question that honourable Koya has asked - the expertise within to help us elevate the standard of service and implementation so that we can achieve more, of course, particularly towards sustainable development goals. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation talked about brain drain yesterday. This is a problem. In my response to His Excellency’s Address, I talked about strategic immigration policies that probably allow us to recruit expertise. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, this is very critical for us and I hope that Government can be open to this in getting in experts from our partners whom we are signing the MOU with. You just talked about prawn farming. The secret in prawn farming is the fertility of the mother prawns, and that is a specialist area. So, whether we have it in the Ministry of Fisheries or not. If we do not have it, for prawns to grow and to do better, we need specialists. So, will this be an important agenda under these MOUs? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I will answer the question in a couple of ways. One, is just in terms of the immigration question per se. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, there is an active endeavour to fix immigration issues. We are hoping that towards the end of the year, there will be a total change in the way immigration currently provides services and God willing, if that is happening well, it will allow us to then, backfill some of the gaps that we have in terms of our manpower development. To the specific question raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, which is a great question, the MOU does talk about capacity building and technical knowledge support. You are correct that in the early discussions on prawn farming, the issue of technical expertise did come up, which the investor is willing to provide, in this instance, but certainly in a broader sense. I think we all agree that whatever areas of cooperation that we get into, if the need arises in terms of technical support or capacity building to be able to ensure that sustainability to some of these initiatives is given, the MOU adequately covers the ability to reach out for technical assistance and capacity building resource. Development of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (Question No. 213/2024) HON. J. N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the development of the dedicated Drug Rehabilitation Centre? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Member for his question. With increasing Injectable Drug Use (IDU) which is a significant issue in the country, Government, through the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, intends to have a Drug Rehabilitation Centre. To do so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will need to tread carefully in terms of ensuring that services to be provided at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre is of local context.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1891 Just to inform the honourable Members of this August Parliament on what is drug rehabilitation, it is a multifaceted therapeutic approach aimed at aiding individuals in overcoming addiction to substances, including drugs and alcohol. This process requires multipronged pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, including spiritual components under guidance of expert professionals. To give an update on the development of the Drug Rehabilitation Centre, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sub-Committee of the Counter Narcotics Committee (CNC) are working towards the National Counter Narcotics Action Plan for August 2024 – July 2025. Included in this Plan is the Counter Narcotics Framework which consists of four pillars, as follows: (1) Harm reduction which focuses on Treatment and High Risk Behaviour. (2) Demand Reduction which focuses on Prevention and Awareness, (3) Supply Reduction which focuses on Law Enforcement and National Security. (4) Legal Reform which focuses on Prosecution and Drug Court. The implementation of these four pillars involves a whole of Government approach, involving the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection; Ministry of Youth and Sports; Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration; to name a few. The Drug Rehabilitation Centre comes under the Harm Reduction Pillar which is to be implemented by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services in the next three to five years. The aims of this pillar are as follows: (1) Reduce substance abuse morbidity and HIV incidents from IDU by 85 percent over the next five years. (2) Have practical recovery-oriented treatment frameworks in place that leads a person through clinical treatment into community recovery (with provisions for anticipated relapse episodes in the medium term).</p><h4>(3) Have St. Giles as the last (not the first) option for treating people presenting with</h4><p>substance abuse disorders. (4) Have specialist rehabilitation centres for patients with drug use disorders to begin specialised treatment and recovery programmes in partnership with faith-based organisations (FBOs) and our Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). At the moment, the Ministry is utilising available resources to deal with the current drug rehabilitation cases and, at the same time, will need to ascertain what services will be offered at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre should we intend to have one. (5) Facilitate access to medical therapies where appropriate. (6) (7) Create posts and funding for, at least, one full time counsellor and social worker, there Increase hospital-based counselling capacity at all health facilities. would be specific therapy training at each facility. (8) Ensure screening resources are available at all hospitals, divisional and subdivisional. (9) Provide training to nurses on drug screening and drug use assessment as needed. (10) Develop clear protocols around drug use reporting and patient notes and when an external report can be requested. (11) Acquire land, building agreement which can be used as a first rehabilitation centre. (12) Set up a team of practitioner stakeholders, health and community sector to plan a recovery treatment framework for the rehabilitation facility, funding and resources for this framework can be sought in the following year. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to update this august Parliament.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1892 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 Written Question Teachers in Primary and Early Childhood Education (Question No. 214/2024) HON.
