<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes, with a 10 minute response by the Minister or Ministers responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate. We will begin with honourable Aliki Bia, and then I will propose that we take a break for lunch, before we resume again to complete the rest of the weekly statements. The floor is yours, honourable Aliki Bia. Melanesian Community in Fiji HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, Deputy Prime Ministers, the Leader of Opposition, fellow Members of Parliament. It is an honour for me to stand and be given an opportunity to make this statement. I would like to thank the Business Committee who also allowed me to make an end of the week statement, about Melanesians in Fiji or those that are descendants of the blackbirders in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year is a very special year, for us descendants of black birders as we will commemorate the 160 th year, since the arrival of our forefathers in Fiji. The question we ask ourselves every day, have we finally broken the shackles of our slavery? Once again, we ask ourselves every day, have we finally broken the shackles of our slavery? With that, I thank the Government for approving a celebration later this year which we are very well looking forward to. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our cry for justice is much more than just the celebration, but I am thankful that the celebration is a step towards the right direction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, much respect to the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, honourable Filimoni Vosarogo, for spearheading discussions about the formalisation of the Melanesian Settlement in Baba, Levuka in Ovalau, and the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister for the ongoing consultations around our Melanesian communities in Fiji.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1893 Mr. Speaker, I stand this morning echoing the same sentiments of those that have gone before me, that our painful era deserves recognition and understanding. After 160 years as descendants of blackbirders, we do sometimes consider ourselves as the forgotten group of people who played a major role in the development of Fiji in the early days. To put it in the simplest way possible, because of Fiji, our forefathers lost their cultural connection, and they were not able to see their families ever again. We paved the way for development in Fiji, but 160 years down the line, we became victims of what we started. By saying this, some of our communities have become victims of development by having to be evicted to other areas. Just a few weeks ago, a number of Melanesian families in Namara Settlement have to be relocated, and currently close to 18 families at Nadawa Melanesian Settlement are on the verge to be evicted to make way for ongoing development. Our Melanesian Settlement in Wailoku, namely, Wai, Bali, Vateleka, Marata and Koio, have been told that they only have few years left on their leases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been relocated so many times during the past decades, and this has created a sense of uncertainty amongst the Melanesian community knowing that everywhere we go, we are just temporary. This has generated fear and instability within our Melanesian communities around Fiji and at times, having sleepless nights thinking of what the future may hold. Please allow me to highlight some injustices that currently continues to derail the progress of some Melanesian communities. In some maritime islands communities of Wailailai, Baba, and Wainaloka in Levuka, Ovalau, their Turaga ni Koro (Headman) only received half the normal allowances given to the Turaga ni Koro (Headman) in every village. Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just share this experience in iTaukei: E dau mosi vei ira na Turaga Ni Koro oqori ni dau tautauvata kece tu na veilesi ena vuku ni kena qaravi na i tavi se na veika e dau lavaki mai ena Vale ni Volavola ni Yasana ni dau vakayacori e dua na soqo ni vanua. Ia, na gauna me ra dau saumi kina na Turaga Ni Koro, e dau musu tu ga vakaveimama na kedra i sau. Oqo, e sega walega ni qai leqa ‘qo, se leqa tu mai ena dua na gauna balavu mai na veimatanitu sa oti. Ia, sa tiko na veivakabauti ni na dua na gauna ena wali na leqa oqo. [It is, indeed, a painful experience for our Village Headmen, who only receive half the normal allowance given to their peers in other villages, even though the various tasks allocated by the Provincial Office are the same as to their obligations to the Vanua meetings. The unfair payment of allowances was not of late experience, our Headmen have been unfairly treated over the years by past Governments.] Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, some of them have not received their Turaga ni Koro allowances since last year to date. I will not be mortified to say this, I question the purpose of setting up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Is this a set up just to heal the political injustices of the past or also to bring justice to the painful era that our forefathers went through? Some of them even lost their lives while working as slaves in farms and building roads for development across Fiji. I have heard so many past and current politicians in this nation apologising for the political injustices of the past, and events that may cause inequality and bias to other ethnic groups, but never have even one bothered to apologise to the blackbirders descendants who are spread out across Fiji. Their forefathers who were whipped to death while working, some were starved and made to walk day and night, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some even had to witness their wives, mothers and sisters brutally assaulted during the black birding era.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1894 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 160 years, we continue to cry for justice, writers and philosophers who have wrote publications about our history have labelled us as the landless people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have no choice but just to go through the trauma of this painful memories and silently adjusting to the many injustices that confronts us in our daily lives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, over the last 18 to 19 months, the people of Fiji have been observing and listening to all of us in this August Parliament trying to figure out the change that we may bring and how can we impact the daily lives of ordinary Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of us as honourable Members of Parliament, we are representatives of the people and it is very important that we listen before we speak out, and when we listen, we need to listen well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, knowledge is important to produce informed policy, but listening and understanding of the people of Fiji is vital to ensure democracy. We, as leaders and Members of Parliament, need to listen to people’s deepest concerns, fears and hope of a better Fiji. We need to listen to all sectors of society and not only elites and lobbyists. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot have democracy if we do not have the trust of the very people that we serve. Once again, we cannot have democracy if we do not have the trust of the very people that we serve. Vinaka vakalevu, God bless the nation and God bless the people of Fiji. HON. S. L. RABUKA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I request that the honourable Assistant Minister respond. HON. S. TUBUNA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to what has been shared by honourable Aliki Bia. Firstly, I would like to thank honourable Aliki Bia for highlighting some of the issues and the injustices being done to the Melanesian people. Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the injustice that has been done to the Melanesian people stem from the implementation of the 2013 Constitution. As you look at the previous Government, a lot of support has been done to the Melanesian people from the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL). But when you look at the Constitution, when we are all labelled as Fijians, this is where the greatest injustice has been done to minority communities in Fiji. When there is no special assistance being targeted to the poor people of this country, particularly the Melanesians. When we came into power, we undertook a survey of all the Melanesian communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you look at all these communities, 100 percent of the people are living under poverty. This is when there was no targeted assistance in the last 10 years of the FijiFirst Government. No assistance for these people to improve their standard of living to come up to the level that we want, Mr. Speaker Sir. When we are all labelled as Fijians. I was at one village, in Waidradra Community, and they said that the assistance was going to the Fijian village just next to them, and they did not receive any assistance. This is where another injustice has come, and I would like to thank the honourable Bia because last year in his maiden speech he said, providing everyone the same equal rights benefits the Melanesia communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know, and I totally disagree with that. It is not that when you provide equal rights to every community, that it will benefit the Melanesian people and of course this Government is committed to uplifting the life of the Melanesian people. During our term, we will see that all land that the people that are living on, has to be formalised. We are now committed to that. We will look at the injustices that has been done, so that we can try to provide a solution to their needs. No one else has done that, to go around to the communities and interview them. What do you need? What do you really need?</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1895 We are just going around and ensuring that equal attention is been done to all the communities is not going to solve the problem. We have to listen to them. When we came in, we provided some provisions in the budget where we went down to all communities asking them what are your priorities? What are your needs? What do you need your Government to assist you with? And that is what we are looking at. This Government is going to address all the issues that has been highlighted by Mr. Bia, starting with this celebration that will be undertaken in November. No one has ever done that before! This is the Government that cares for the people! Looks after the needs of the people! And that is why we are doing that, because we care for the people. We look after their interests but at the same time this Government is committed to looking after the interests… MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bia. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Honourable Bia, apologies, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I usually go up to Newtown where honourable Aliki Bia lives. You know when you look around the communities, there is a lot of social problems. Some of the houses have no toilets and this is what we are trying to help in going down to those villages, to assist them. Mr. Speaker, I wish to say that your Government has never done anything for these people. Of course, we are totally committed, and we will try to help in whatever way and in whatever assistance that we can provide to these communities. MR. SPEAKER.- I apologise, I cannot sit in silence and hear two honourable Members from the same community pitting against each other. One honourable Member is saying there is a lot of discrimination, et cetera. Au kerea me qai qarauni ga na i vosavosa. E dua na i wase levu era dabe tu vei keitou era sega ni sauma e dua na ka. Era kana, vakayagataki qele, ka kece. Eso era sa curu e na i Vola ni Kawa Bula. Ni lako ga mai qai mai veisautaki tu va qo eso na i vosavosa, e sakasaka toka na kena i tautau, honourable Aliki Bia, ni qai qarauna toka. The honourable Prime Minister established the Multi-Ethnic Affairs. That took care the interest of the minority groups. Now, some of them are within my mataqali, Valewaqa in Vunilagi, Vatusoqosoqo in Qamea, you name them, they are there. Some are registered within my village, within my other clans, Yavusa o Benau but been bracketed, descendants of Solomon Islanders. They are registered in the VKB and yet you still have the audacity to come and say you are being ill-treated and mistreated, but you are part of us already. You are voting. That is through the work of former Prime Ministers and administrators in trying to take care of the minority group within our society. So please all I want to raise is, please ensure that you understand what you are talking about. You said you have been discriminated all this time and how come you are living amongst us? The Alliance Government ventured to pay for all the evacuation cost of removing the people from Vunilagi, the largest estate in Fiji back to Solomon Islands. They came all the way to Suva from Vanua Levu and before we could put into effect their evacuation procedures, some of them returned to Vanua Levu. They could not leave without that place, that is our mataqali land. So, we had to come in and receive them because they have been there. The way they live is different. That is what honourable Tubuna is saying. Some they do not have toilets, yes, Naviavia is like that. Naviavia is trying to integrate into the Tikina of Wailevu so they would be fully part of that district when they hold their annual meetings and that is the onward trend right throughout Fiji. So, to say that you have been</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1896 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 mistreated, honourable Bia, I take exception to that, and I do not fully agree with what you have said, because you have been offered seats in the House, the Parliament of Fiji. Even in the Multiethnic Affairs, Mr. Sanegar and then you have Father Sanegar in the Anglican Church who used to be a great leader for the Melanesian brothers and sisters. So, I take exception to that, honourable Aliki Bia and honourable Tubuna. Please, make up you twos’ mind whether you want to be Fijians or want to go back to the Solomons because I will not sit here and listen to all these diatribe going on that you all mistreated, et cetera, because I say, “no, it is totally different.” Remember that case when the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) Government under the present Prime Minister, the Minister for Agriculture then was the late Militoni Leweniqila. He was charged with the responsibility to evacuate all the descendants of Solomon Islanders in Vunilagi back to the Solomons, but they only came as far as Suva and then they went back again, they have been living there ever since. They eat freely of our land. Honourable Members, I hope you do not mind me uttering what I have stated because I am also wearing another traditional hat in this House, and I will not sit back and listen to all these kinds of, shall I say “hot air” without that being fully proven with facts that you have been ill-treated all these years. I intend to adjourn the House now for lunch, and when we return at 2.30 p.m., we will resume with the End of Week Statements. The Parliament adjourned at 1.00 p.m.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1897 The Parliament resumed at 2.31 p.m. Benefits of Remittance to Fiji’s Economy HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, ni sa bula vinaka saka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my End of Week Statement on the Benefits of Remittance to Fiji’s Economy. Over the past five years, Fiji has witnessed a remarkable impact of remittances on our economy in Fiji. Remittances have become a vital source of foreign exchange, bolstering our nation’s financial stability. They have not only provided a lifeline for countless Fijian families, enhancing their purchasing power and improving living standards, but have also played a pivotal role in supporting local businesses and stimulating economic growth. The inflow of funds from our citizens who have gone abroad through the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme, migration, peacekeeping duties and other overseas work engagements have been instrumental in financing educational obligations, healthcare needs and small-scale entrepreneurship. In essence, remittances have empowered individuals and communities to seek improvements in their living standards and explore opportunities for growth and development. In retrospect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that during challenging times, such as the global pandemic, remittances served as a buffer, helping our economy to stay resilient and supporting the ordinary Fijian. The June 2024 Report from the World Bank on the latest Migration and Development Brief which was released after a period of a strong growth during 2021 to 2022, officially recorded that remittance flows to low and middle-income countries moderated in 2023, reaching an estimated $656 billion. In 2023, remittances surpassed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Official Development Assistance (ODA) and like other developing nations, remittances have been increasing steadily over the years, making it a substantial source of foreign exchange earner for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Ministry of Labour data, the PALM Scheme in Australia and Regional Seasonal Employment (RSE) Scheme in New Zealand remittances from 2018 to-date is approximately FJD300 million. I am sure that all of us seated here in this august House have read on social and print media how this has helped many individuals and households here in Fiji. Personal remittances have helped support consumption in families, which include purchase of household goods and motor vehicles. Moreover, they may be used for social activities such as weddings, funerals and other community projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, personal remittances has been the second largest foreign exchange earner for Fiji since 2004, next only to tourism and outranking our traditional foreign exchange earners, such as sugar, timber, gold and garment. The significance of remittances to the Fijian economy has increased over the years, particularly as it supplements the household income, as well as a major and reliable source of foreign exchange here in our homeland. The growth in remittance over the years is driven by many factors. Notably, there have been increases in the number of nurses, early childhood education teachers, peacekeepers, caregivers and sports personnel who are working abroad and who provide the utmost fast remittance to our homeland. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, the number of military personnel serving in the Middle East has</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1898 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 also increased. Many individuals and families rely on their wages and salaries as the primary source of income to meet the basic household needs of those who fall under this category. Based on indicators such as the location and migrant population abroad, the major source countries of our inward personal remittances are Australia, United States of America, New Zealand, Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward, it is crucial that we continue to recognise and maximise the benefits of these financial contributions, ensuring that they are directed towards sustainable development and long-term economic prosperity for all Fijians, to mitigate challenges and minimise dependency on remittances. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Education for his Statement. He has quite rightly pointed out that remittances is ow the second largest foreign exchange earner for Fiji and it has been like that since 2004, next to only tourism. Mr. Speaker, in the last five years between 2019 and 2023, personal remittances have grown on average by a staggering 17 percent every year. In 2019, it stood at around $606 million and have more than doubled to $1.25 billion by the end of 2023. Sir, between 2019 and 2023 we have received a total of $4.5 billion in remittances alone. The adoption, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of Fiji’s mobile e-wallets for receiving remittances made a significant difference and advancement in the country’s financial ecosystem. It provided a more accessible, efficient and secure method of transferring funds and this shift, Sir, has somewhat reduced transaction cost, delays and also provided extensive accessibility to people in the rural areas. So, by leveraging this mobile e-wallet technology, our people are now able to receive remittances directly on their mobile devices, reducing their dependency on physical cash and enhancing financial inclusion, particularly, for unbanked and underbanked populations. The remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, received through mobile network operators - M-PAiSA and MyCash, were a meagre 3 percent in 2019, has now increased to about 38 percent in 2023. In 2023, remittances received through the mobile money e-wallets totalled $476 million. Sir, 20 percent, about $252 million, came through commercial banks. About 42 percent - $524 million, came through money transfer operators, the foreign exchange dealers around the country. Remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not just an abstract economic concept. As the honourable Assistant Minister quite rightly pointed out, it is a critical source for household income and it goes into consumption, but also providing basic necessities such as food, education and healthcare. It contributes to poverty alleviation and improves the overall quality of life for ordinary Fijians. So, in 2023, the total remittances amounted to about 10 percent of our GDP and that underscores the significance in sustaining household consumption and driving local demand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the remittances also have a multiplier effect on the economy, which means that every dollar that comes into the country has multiple effects - stimulates local businesses, create jobs, fosters economic activity and, particularly, is important in rural and remote areas. Someone said to me that people in Labasa have a lot of money. The consumption and new businesses opening up in Labasa are doing very well. So, I said, “Yes, per capita, a lot more people from Vanua Levu are, perhaps, in Suva and also outside of Fiji, so remittances in Vanua Levu might be higher compared to some of the other areas.” Also, remittances from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1899 We also recognise that remittances contribute to human capital development. Many families use remittance income to invest in education and skills training for their children which, in turn, enhances our national workforce and supports long term economic growth. Remittances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as honourable Vanawalu pointed out, offer a stable and predictable source of income that is, kind of, less vulnerable to economic cycles, compared to other revenue. So, during periods of economic downturn and disaster, remittance inflows remain steady or even increased during those emergencies because Fijians abroad send additional support to their families. So, these counter cyclical nature of remittances provides a crucial buffer to smooth consumption and stabilise our economy during challenging times. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is clear that the effect of us receiving remittances is quite multifaceted. Sometimes it not only has temporary effect, but also has a permanent effect. The source of our remittances, 44 percent of our remittances come from Australia; US is second - 24 percent; New Zealand - 18 percent; UK - 6 percent; and the rest comes from the others. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister, Government and, indeed, all the honourable Members of this Parliament, all I want to do at this point is to thank our people - our diaspora, whether they are in employment there, whether they are playing rugby or in peacekeeping duties, we want to thank them for sending remittances, for looking after their families and friends and, in particular, for supporting their families and friends and contributing generously to Non-Governmental Organisations to support activities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to also point out that as part of that strategy to attract our diaspora back into the country, we want to gain their brain. While we send people from this side, they go there, they work hard, get the experience, earn enough money, and some of them are coming back and investing in the country. So, it is not just remittances, it is also about gaining from the experiences of our people. This Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has initiated changes to our immigration rules. For example, we are now allowing all those people and their children registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula (Native Land Register), if they do not have a passport but have a passport for another country, if they want to come, live, reside and work in Fiji, they do not need to get a Fiji passport. For others, all they have to prove is that their grandparents or their parents were citizens of Fiji at the time of Independence. This is just one of the first steps that this Government has taken. We are looking at other policies, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications was in Canada and he was telling me that the interest of our diaspora wanting to invest in Fiji is quite big. It is a happy story in some sense, Sir, when our people go out of the country, they go and work there, some of them live there, but their love for Fiji and they are constantly coming back to Fiji. It is not only just remittances, a lot of the tourist dollar that comes in, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is also part of our diaspora coming back and spending their time here with their families and friends and spending their money. Again, we want to take this opportunity to thank all of them. Protecting Coastal Communities Against Sea Level Rise HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity to make a Statement regarding the real challenges faced by our vulnerable coastal communities here in Fiji and other small Island States in the Pacific and the Caribbean region.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1900 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 As many of you know, Fiji is confronting profound challenges due to climate change - rising sea levels, increased frequency of extreme weather events, changes in precipitation patterns and ocean acidification, pose significant threats to its coastal communities. These populations, largely dependent on agriculture, fisheries and tourism, are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. This Statement highlights the challenges posed by climate change in Fiji, the impact on coastal populations, agriculture, waterways and floodplains, infrastructure and other critical issues, while proposing pathways for mitigation strategies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, rising sea levels is one of climate change’s most direct and immediate consequences. According to the IPCC 2021 Report, projections indicate that the global sea level would rise from 0.3 metres to 0.8 metres by 2100. In Fiji, numerous coastal areas are less than a metre above sea level, making them exceptionally vulnerable. The Fiji National Climate Change Policy indicates that rising sea levels can damage homes and coastal ecosystems, threatening food security and livelihoods. This is in reference to the Government of Fiji 2018 Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to climate change, we also witness an increasing incidence of extreme weather events such as cyclones, floods and droughts. The devastation caused by TC Winston in 2016, which resulted in estimated damages exceeding $1 billion, serves as a stark reminder of the potential impacts of climate change, according to the World Bank 2016 Report. The changing climate is likely to exacerbate such events, thus destabilising the socio-economic frameworks that coastal communities depend on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of this deadly combination of rising sea levels and severe weather events, we have witnessed significant new challenges to our coastal settlements and villages, properties and livelihoods. The sea, which was once the very source of survival for our ancestors, is now threatening the survival of these communities. Rising seawater is washing away houses, villages, burial grounds and fertile agricultural land. The FijiFirst Government has displaced some communities, while others are awaiting relocation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving entire communities is not an option any community would willingly choose. Leaving their ancestral homes implies abandoning their roots, cultural heritage, traditional grounds and way of living. It is an option no family or community would prefer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one option for the protection of vulnerable coastal communities is constructing seawalls. As stated by the former Minister for Waterways, Dr. Mahendra Reddy, in the last term of Parliament, 114 communities needed protection through seawall construction as of 2022. What is the progress on this? The former Minister came up with a brilliant idea of constructing nature-based solution seawalls. I note from his recent 2024 paper published in the European Journal of Engineering and Technology Research, Vol. 9, Issue No.4, he provides the detailed design of the nature-based solution seawalls and noted that as of 2022, Fiji needed to protect 142 villages by constructing 108 seawalls with a total length of 38.2 kilometres. Over the period, 2018 to 2022, 12 nature-based solution seawalls were constructed around Fiji. What is the progress since then? I note from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announcement on 13 th March, 2023, a picture of the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, shaking hands that KIWA awarded €326,077 (FJ$700,000) to construct seawalls at six sites: Nakawaga Village, Vesi Village, Ligaulevu Village, Somosomo Village, Navola Village and Navolau No.1 Village.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1901 These projects were supposed to be completed by December this year. What is the progress, honourable Minister? Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change has also significantly affected the health of these vulnerable coastal populations. Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns lead to outbreaks of waterborne diseases, vector-borne diseases and heat related illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that these health risks are exacerbated in low resource settings, affecting the most vulnerable populations, especially children and the elderly, according to the 2018 WHO Report. I wish to ask the Government on what plans and strategies it has in place to educate and protect these vulnerable coastal communities from the negative effects of climate change on their health. Mr. Speaker, agriculture is the cornerstone of Fiji’s economy and a principal means of subsistence for many coastal communities. Climate change, however, poses severe risks to agriculture through the loss of arable land and decline in crop yields. Good quality arable land in low-lying areas is being washed away or inundated by saltwater, rendering it unsuitable for agriculture. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to ask the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, what strategies do you have to prevent saltwater intrusion and loss of arable coastal land? Increased temperatures and altered rainfall patterns significantly impact crop yields. Studies by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate that climate variability can lead to reduced crop productivity, particularly for staple crops, such as taro and cassava, according to the 2020 FAO Report. This decline threatens food security and livelihoods, pushing rural population further into poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to ask the honourable Minister for Agriculture on what research programmes do they have to address this issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices can enhance food security and resilience against climate variability. Agroecological methods, such as crop rotation, intercropping, and organic farming can help maintain productivity, while minimising environmental impact. What strategy has the Agriculture Ministry developed on this? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rise in sea level also poses a threat to coastal communities regarding the availability of clean drinking water. This is further compounded by extreme weather patterns, such as increased variability in rainfall and prolonged droughts, therefore, affecting the quantity and quality of ground and surface water. What plans are in place to provide these communities with alternative water sources so that we do not panic when we completely run out of water? It is not only households that will be affected, but also schools, health centres and agriculture located in these areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, empowering local communities through education and engagement is vital. Training programmes focused on climate adaptation strategies and sustainable practices can enhance community resilience and empower individuals to respond to climate challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our public infrastructure is also under threat. Coastal roads are being washed away, such as the road in front of Taveuni High College, which is subject to coastal erosion. The scouring of riverbanks is also threatening the collapse of critical bridges in coastal and rural areas. Some schools and health centres in the Northern Division are being threatened by riverbank erosion and coastal erosion.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>1902 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, have our relevant ministries conducted a stock take of these issues and developed a plan for adaptation and mitigation? Time is running out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Government should enhance policies that focus on climate adaptation strategies. This includes investing in resilient infrastructure, upgrading drainage systems, and developing early warning systems for extreme weather events to protect vulnerable communities. While I acknowledge progress in some drainage work, we need a countrywide plan. According to the Asian Development Bank 2019 Report, the cost of climate-proofing infrastructure in Pacific Island countries is projected to be substantial, affecting government budgets and development prospects. We must spread this cost over successive years rather than wait to spend it all at once, thereby facing budgetary problems. In concluding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing climate change requires local, regional and international cooperation. Collaborating with organisations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), can enhance resource mobilization and bring in expertise for effective mitigation strategies. We must act now; failure to do so will devastate vulnerable communities, our tourism and agriculture sectors, and our economy. In the long run, it will affect the Government's ability to engage in development and distribution policies. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Kirpal for his End of Week Statement which covers a lot of ground on climate change, not only limited to the subject I was given to prepare on and, that is, protecting our vulnerable coastal community against sea level rise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier on in the week, it would be good to review our procedures as the civil servants working in our offices prepare detailed answers to the questions, particularly the questions that are relevant at this time in our development, in our history. So, when we provide answers, we are conversational in our responses, while the prepared text have a lot of information on the subjects. Perhaps, if we can, at the end, they come and collect our questions and responses, and if all those could be included in the official records for future generations. They come, they talk about climate change, they will know, “Oh, honourable Sanjay Kirpal asked the question and the response came from the Prime Minister”. They would probably just read the Daily Hansard Reports and not get to the bottom or get to the heart of the responses which have the facts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this afternoon, even before I go deeply into the response to the very good question asked, I would like to pay my respects to a former Lord Mayor of Suva, the late Vijay Raghwan, who passed away earlier in the week - a very good friend of mine. He was one of those who was a bridge in my relationship with the Indo-Fijian community after 1987. He was Lord Mayor in 1987 when the Fijian Nationalists in Suva were terrorising everyone. They threatened to go on site to those who were working in the market and the late Vijay Raghwan, as Mayor, called me and said, “See, these people want to burn the market”. I asked, “Who?” He replied, “The Nationalists, they said they will march up to you.” I said, “Tell them, who are you going to march to?” They told him, “To the Commander.” I said, “If they tell you that, ask them, ‘Who is the Commander? I do not know the Commander, I am the Mayor of this city.’” That is exactly what happened. They threatened him and he said, “I do not know the Commander, I am the Mayor of this city and his camp is within my city.” They were baffled and stood down. He was a good man, Mr. Speaker, Sir. One of my Minister’s defended him very well when he got the tender to build the Civic Towers. I was asked by the former Leader of the Opposition, the late Justice Jai Ram Reddy, “Did you give it to Mr. Raghwan because he is your friend?” The Minister for Housing and Urban Development said, “Yes, I gave it to him because he is my friend.” Again, he asked, “Why?” He responded, “Because I knew he would do a good job”, and that was the end of the questions. I sent</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1903 my condolences to his children and grandchildren. To those of us who will continue to look after Suva, hopefully, we will look after the city that he loved very much, properly. The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the late Mrs. Ema Bovoro who was the CEO of St. John Ambulance Fiji, the St. John Association of Fiji and recently decorated with the Officer of the Order of St John. She has done a lot of work for the St John’s in Fiji and our condolences go out to her families and friends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the rise in sea level, unfortunately, as abbreviated here, “SLR” – Sea Level Rise, it says SLR is a hazard. I am going to sack these civil servants. (Laughter) However, it is, sea level rise is a danger. I hope I will be able to table my response because it has the facts. Conversationally, my house is the first one in my village next to the sea. When it was built, when I came back from Lebanon, the steps out of the kitchen was stepping straight into the high tide. If you want to walk out that kitchen door, make sure it is low tide otherwise you walk out of the front door. Now, that has been reclaimed by the Army at the time. The first seawall was built by the village men who went to New Zealand to do fruit picking before the seasonal workers programme came in. We collected money, and we are very grateful to the FijiFirst Government, they built a replacement sea wall. A little further out, a little higher, but we will have to keep doing that with the rising sea levels. You asked about what we are doing about inundated coastal areas and you directed your comments to the honourable Minister for Agriculture. I went to look at an area at Ba where they are anticipating a lot of that area which used to be under cane, being inundated with seawater, and there are researches going on about seawater resilient varieties of cane and rice and also the possibility of starting giant crabs, giant prawns or tiger prawns as they call it in parts of Asia. I thought a cartoon artist would show a man perched on a tree eating big prawns. We are living the reality of sea level rise all over Fiji. The Government has a programme which carried on from the previous Government on the relocation on some of these villages. Some are still ongoing, we have heard so much about Nabavatu, very close to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance’s farm. They all need to move very soon and also villages in Bua and Kadavu. I must remind the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection that her grandmother’s village is almost under sea now, but they will also be moved up to Udu Point in Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is a very good one and I have some very good answers here, the facts and names, and I hope I can table the response so that future Members of Parliament, historians and maybe, scientists will look back and say, “Ah100 years ago, they were talking about this, they were talking in a Parliament House in Suva. Where is that?” “Down there”, they will be sitting up on the mountains of Naitasiri and pointing down at where we are today. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, it is a very good question and not only for Opposition and the Government to talk about, but it is also the whole nation, as I have said. I also like to inform the House that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is coming up. The honourable Leader of the Opposition will be accompanying His Excellency the President</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>1904 End of Week Statements 6 th September, 2024 and the honourable leader of the G-9 Bloc, to support the President as its leader of the delegation to the UNGA. I hope they have prepared. On the side meetings on climate change, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be involved on security, the leader of G-9 Bloc will be involved and talking to G20 Leaders. I hope they are ready to go, if not, they can always decline my invitation. MR. SPEAKER.- For the information of honourable Members, the Secretariat has run up voluminous report of all these exchanges that we are doing, in the hope that we could have something like what the Prime Minister wants. It is in black and white. The Australian Parliament and New Zealand Parliament have it as well and these are all the exchanges here. We have them in big volumes, so it becomes a good reference book as well. But the only thing now is we are looking around for sponsorship in order to get them bounded. Madam Secretary-General is dealing directly with UNDP in the hope that we get some funding there, but that is the development we have so far, Sir. We thank you so much for your kind thoughts. Stray Animal Campaign – Cattle and Horses HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, miau sa bula re. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before you to address the House on matters related to stray animals, specifically cattle and horses. This has been a continous problem in Fiji, affecting farming communities, with significant impacts on nutrition, health, economy and public safety. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ownership of animals entails a significant degree of responsibility. It is often witnessed that due to negligence of their owners, these animals are frequently seen wandering unsupervised, especially in rural areas. This situation has resulted in considerable crop losses and damages to farming communities, increased risks of accidents to road users, losses of revenues for farmers and increase in NCDs from poor nutritious food. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are more than one Act that covers the subject of my address today and that includes: • Pound Act of 1877; • Brands Act of 1928; • Protection of Animal Act of 1954; • Trespasses of Animal Act of 1955; and • Biosecurity Act 2008 which repealed the Quarantine law of 1964). While these Acts (except Biosecurity Act 2008) are very old and they cannot address Fiji’s current situation and needs, a thorough review of these legislations is urgently required. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pound Act defines the term “poundable animal” as any horse, cattle, goat, sheep and pig, young or old, male or female. The Pound Act covers establishment of specific livestock pounds intended for the confinement of stray animals. This legislation stipulates that: • Any animals that are not confined on the owner’s property and are straying on roadsides or • other farms will be trapped, loaded and taken to animal pounds. If your animals are tied onto someone else’s property without the owner’s consent, the animal will be captured and taken to the pound as well. Once the animals are loaded on to the truck, they will be taken straight to the pound and will only be released to their owners if the requirements are met.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>6 th September, 2024 End of Week Statements 1905 • If your animals are tied near to the roadside and can reach up to six metres from the centre of the line, that animal will also be taken for pounding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, stray animal causes substantial destruction to agricultural fields, affecting crops such as sugarcane, dalo, cassava, vegetables, and limits our food security. The destruction of these crops not only impact farmers’ livelihoods, but also have wider economic consequences. It had also been noted that stray animals had been a major cause of widespread tuberculosis and brucellosis infection in cattle and had also costed Government millions of dollars every year for disease control. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some factors contributing to the challenges associated with stray animals include irresponsible ownership, economical status of farmers and outdated penalty charges that are implicated to owners or offenders. The primary cause of stray animal problems is the absence of responsible ownership. Owners fail to provide proper care, or containment of their animals, resulting in their unrestricted movements. In addition, economic factors including poverty and restricted access to resources play a significant role in the problem of stray animals. It is also sad to note that some livestock owners are ignorant of animal’s welfare and will only attend to their animals when they need them. The high fencing cost, low quality of fencing material and absence of quality control for farming equipment and inputs have been a major contributor to improper fencing and control of livestock movements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last three years, a total of 2,193 complaints had been lodged by farmers and members of the general public on issues related to stray animals. Similarly, the Ministry had successfully captured more than 2,700 stray animals over the past three years. Proper procedures were implemented to guarantee that animals that had been branded were returned to their rightful owners who came to retrieve them. These animals that remained unclaimed were auctioned off, following a period of 10 days’ notice. We urge farmers to follow the guidance provided by our officers at the Animal Health and Production Division, and our officers are stationed throughout Fiji to perform this vital task. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our officers normally await requests and complaints from communities and the public before campaigns are carried out to capture stray animals. There had been instances in the past where firearms and tranquilisers had been used to address stray animal control. This used to be a very strict procedure, and it is only done when human lives are at risk. The Government has acknowledged the seriousness of the problems concerning stray cattle and horses and has implemented several initiatives to address it. For the 2024-2025 financial year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has allocated a budget of $530,000 for stray animal activities. The Pound Act 1877 provides a structured framework for the law and orderly management of stray animals. Across the nation, there are 27 pounds situated in strategic locations where stray animals are impounded after they are captured. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Brands Act 1928 requires cattle owners to brand animals. According to the legislation, the sole method of identifying an animals’ owner is through the brand. The brand should be visible, readable, and accompanied by a registered number issued in your name by the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways. Owners can only obtain a brand registration certificate by applying at the Office of Ministry of Agriculture Fiji-wide. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has conducted numerous public awareness campaigns designed to educate the public about the importance of responsible animal ownership. These campaigns have emphasised the necessity of proper care and management of livestock to prevent potential nuisance</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>1906</p><h4>Bills – First Reading</h4><p>6 th September, 2024 and hazards. For the past three years, a total of 267 awareness campaigns had been conducted and continue to take place throughout Fiji, especially in the Western Division, which is a red zone for stray cattle and horses. In addition to Government initiatives, local communities have also been proactive in addressing the stray animal problem. Initiatives such as organising cattle drives and establishing community grazing areas has also been undertaken to manage and reduce the number of stray animals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, although progress had been achieved in addressing the problem of stray animals in Fiji, we will continue to encounter the challenges in the near future. Apart from the review of the old Acts, the Government will continue to intensify initiatives with individuals and communities, to alleviate the adverse effect of stray cattle and horses. I finally want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I will be providing a statement in this House with regards to the use of antimicrobial and livestock production in Fiji. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the Statement, I think the problem of stray animals is an extensive one. Just last week, I received pictures of sheep being attacked in Nasarawaqa - 100 sheep perished by a pack of dogs. I had already talked about this in this august Parliament. In fact, the problem of stray animals has become a disincentive to our livestock farmers. We have Acts that bind us in terms of what we can do in controlling stray animals. But then, most of these legislations are very old, such as the Brands Act which is an Act from 1928. Then there is the Pound Act 1877, which is just as old as the Brands Act. The Pound Act 1877 is a very rigid legislation. It does not even allow the Minister to use his discretion to release an animal, should a farmer request the release. With the processes that are contained within the Pound Act 1877, an animal without the brand will surely end up in the abattoir and given the diseases that we have now (brucellosis and tuberculosis), we do not want to keep animals inside the pound, or bringing animals from somewhere else into the pound located in another geographical area because under the Biosecurity Regulations, we cannot do that. So, without the brand, surely the animal will end up in the abattoir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to inform the House this afternoon that we are already into the process of reviewing the Pound Act 1877, simply because of the rigid nature of that legislation. It gives no flexibility to the Director or to the Minister or anyone to release the animal, once it is impounded. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ask for the support of Parliament. Sometimes, as a Ministry, we cop a lot of flak. I was interviewed by the Fiji Sun or one of the dailies, and I said, “I think these dogs should be shot.” There were comments of cruelty, et cetera. It is a catch 22 situation. On one hand, you have farmers who want to breed livestock that will contribute to the economy and yet, on the other side, you have others who just keep breeding dogs and let them run loose, and then when there is a dog attack, hundreds of animals like that perish. I have the pictures here if you want to see, honourable Member, I can show you.</p></body>
