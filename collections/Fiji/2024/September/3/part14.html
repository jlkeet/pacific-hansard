<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome Honourable Members, in the gallery this afternoon, we have the students and teachers from Moce Secondary School. Welcome to your Parliament.</p><h4>Adjournment - Unplanned Power Shutdown</h4><p>At this juncture, please be advised that I will have to adjourn Parliament now due to the unplanned power shutdown. The automatic recording through the ITC infrastructure has been affected. As a result, we cannot broadcast live and the FTR cannot record as well. That is how the Hansard Team records all that is said and done for our future records. I hope you will bear with us on this effect of the sudden unplanned power shutdown that occurred just after 2.00 p.m. Therefore, honourable Members, I will now adjourn the House until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 3.03 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33</p></body>
