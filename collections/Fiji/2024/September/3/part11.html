<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Review Report on Assets Fiji Limited 2016-2019 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby submits to Parliament the Review Report on Assets Fiji Limited Annual Report 2016 to 2019. Assets Fiji Limited (AFL) is a private limited company, fully owned by the Fijian Government, established and incorporated under the Companies Act 2015.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1726</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL manages all interests in assets previously owned by Fiji Ports Corporation Limited (FPCL), Fiji Ships and Heavy Industry Limited (FSHIL) and Government Printery and Stationery Department. The key responsibilities of AFL include effective management, valuation and accounting of non-financial assets that are being divested. It plays a crucial role in maintaining and optimising the use of these assets to yield maximum returns to Government. The pertinent issues identified by the Committee are as follows: (1) The Committee commends AFL for the effective handling of its assets during the period under review. AFL recorded an accumulated net profit after tax of $3.39 million for the years 2016 to 2019. The company’s strategic priorities and assets were valued at approximately $57.38 million. In addition, the company had no external borrowings and maintained a liquidity ratio of 2.9 at the end of Financial Year 2019. (2) The Committee expressed concern about the low rental lead generated from the asset portfolio valued at over $57 million is disproportionately low, however, this is compensated by higher dividend given by FPCL except GPSD. (3) The Committee acknowledges the successful vesting of 35 land titles which is strategically located near Lautoka, Levuka, and Suva Port areas, and the independent valuation of assets underscores AFL’s ability to manage its real estate portfolio. (4) The Committee noted that an independent external valuer conducted a valuation for all land vested into the company on 10 th February, 2017. The valuation was based on market value and the land’s highest and best use. However, land titles pending vesting were not included in the fair value assessment. (5) The Committee expressed concern that a total of nine pending land titles from FPCL and one from FSHIL are yet to be vested into AFL, which is necessary to establish a complete financial and equity position. (6) The Committee noted that Government grants were continuously issued to AFL from 2016 to 2019 to support AFL’s operations. At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Members who were part of the team that produced this Report: (1) Honourable S. Kiran – Deputy Chairperson; (2) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (3) Honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; (4) Honourable A. Bia; and (5) Honourable P. K. Ravunawa. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend this Review Report to Parliament and request all Members of this august House to take note of the Report.

VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Consolidated Review Report on the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2021and 2022 Annual Reports. As mandated under Standing Order 109(2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to health, education, social service, labour, aviation, culture and media. The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF), in trying to adjust to the changes in its operation because of COVID-19, had undertaken certain measures to adhere to the restrictions of the pandemic and, simultaneously, allow the operations of the Authority to continue. The former Committee had undertaken a site visit to the CAAF Office and held its public submission with senior CAAF officials. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted the concerns raised and identified recommendations to better address its findings. The Committee commended the establishment of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Office for the Pacific Small Island Developing States in Nadi and for being awarded the ICAO Council President Certificate. I thank the Chief Executive and Management of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji for the assistance rendered during this review process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I take this opportunity to thank the former Chairperson of the Committee, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for her leadership and guidance; the former Committee Member, honourable Parveen Bala and Alternate Member, honourable Ketan Lal, for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork; and the current Committee Members for the finalisation of this Committee Report. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion without notice that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a future sitting. HON T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1728</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 Review Report - Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report. As mandated under Standing Order 109(2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports’ ability to rebound from the setbacks of successive lockdowns as the second wave of the pandemic hit Fiji, is evidence of the organisation’s resilience in a time of extreme challenges. Fiji Airports managed to complete major runaway maintenance work in half the usual time due to a longer working window caused by the absence of international and domestic flights. The Committee was informed of the upgrade and extension of the Nausori Airport runaway. This $60 million project will allow opportunities for increased flights on both, domestic and international routes. Furthermore, the Committee commends Fiji Airports in its commitment to the SDGs on the Green Airports Initiatives, attaining a Level 3: Airport Carbon Accreditation in having their solar farms and the introduction of electronic vehicles. I wish to convey my gratitude and sincere appreciation to the CEO of Fiji Airports and his team for their valuable contribution to this review process. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank the former Chairperson of the Committee, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for her leadership and guidance; the former Committee Member, honourable Parveen Bala; and Alternate Members, honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Penioni Ravunawa, for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork; and the current Committee Members for the finalisation of this Committee Report. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion without notice that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
