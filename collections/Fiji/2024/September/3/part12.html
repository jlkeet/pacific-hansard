<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make</p><h4>a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40, the:</h4><p>(1) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1729 (2) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; and (3) Honourable Minister for Education. The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to also speak for five minutes. There will be no other debate. I now call on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to deliver his Statement. Report on the 53 rd Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and I also greet those who may be watching us on livestream or listening in on the radio. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week, Pacific Leaders gathered in Nuku’alofa in Kingdom of Tonga for the 53 rd Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting 2024. The Forum brought together Heads of States, Heads of Government and Ministers from across the Pacific region. The theme for the Forum Leaders Meeting was “A Transformative and Resilient Pasifiki: Build Better Now”. On Thursday, 29 th August, 2024, Sir, I joined other Forum Leaders in the beautiful island of Vava’u for the Leaders Retreat. The retreat provided an opportunity for Pacific Leaders to consult and hold honest discussions on matters of priority, challenges and opportunities facing our region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the retreat also provided an opportunity to discuss the concept of the Ocean of Peace which I had presented in this August Parliament not so long ago. Leaders reflected on the concept and welcomed its alignment with the 2050 Strategy for a Blue Pacific Continent, the 2018 Boe Declaration on Regional Security and the 2000 Biketawa Declaration. Forum Leaders acknowledged the importance of the principles presented through the concept for the Ocean of Peace. I am pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Leaders have tasked the Forum Secretariat, in cooperation with Fiji, to develop a draft Ocean of Peace Declaration for consideration by the Leaders at the 54 th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in Honiara, Solomon Islands, in 2025. My fellow Leaders and I were especially encouraged by the very positive remarks of the representatives of the United States (US) and Chinese Governments at the Meeting. The US Deputy Secretary of State, Dr. Kurt Campbell, and China’s Special Envoy to the Pacific, His Excellency Qian Bo, in their remarks, embraced the concept of the Ocean of Peace, and demonstrated in a very clear language the intention of China and the United States to cooperate in the Pacific with Pacific Islands countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to quote Dr. Kurt Campbell, the Deputy Secretary of State, who had this to say, and I quote: “I had a very good meeting just now with the excellent representative from the People's Republic of China… We have agreed that in the weeks and months ahead, the United States and China in the Pacific will work together to find programmes of action where we, together, can work to develop habits of cooperation between the United</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1730</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 States and China, in the Pacific, to address issues of climate change, rural development, or other areas which are critical to the peoples of the Pacific." Dr. Campbell continued, and I quote: “I will say he was enthusiastic about it, he believed it was important. I think it is critical for our friends around the table here that we, together the United States and China, are committed. Next year when we meet, we will be underway with those projects of cooperation." In response, Special Envoy Qian Bo said, and I quote: “…what Deputy Secretary, Mr. Campbell, has proposed, in my view, is encouraging and constructive. It is not only in line with the consensus reached by the leaders of our two countries, but also in the best interest of the Pacific Island countries and the Region. We wish to keep in close contact with the US side to discuss specific projects on climate change on which we can work." Mr. Speaker, the words of these two distinguished representatives of their great nations are the very demonstration of what is possible when we go for peace. When we believe in peace, advocate for peace, stand for and uphold peace, it resonates and removes fear. When this happens, it empowers one to cross the line, to reach out to the other side and offer, "peace be with you". Those were the same words that our Lord Jesus uttered after his resurrection and his victory over death and Hades. He said those to his disciples who were paralysed by fear. In my discussions in London and in New York, I had mentioned that peace is really the absence of fear. Peace moves people to dare again, to rediscover themselves and eventually, offer the same peace. I am very encouraged that at this time, we are also having our own truth and reconciliation processes here in Fiji, and I believe that is going well, according to the report from the Minister responsible. The Pacific Policing Initiative, another significant milestone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the endorsement of the Pacific Policing Initiative on the heels of the Leaders decision on the Ocean of Peace. This is a major regional initiative to strengthen collective peace and security throughout the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, the Pacific Policing Initiative can be said to be a practical expression of the Ocean of Peace. If the Blue Pacific wants to make a leading contribution to global peace, we need practical means to support peace here at home. Mr. Speaker, one of the principles of the Ocean of Peace calls for the introduction of a code of conduct. No one needs reminding of the scourge of drugs and related crimes that befall our nation and others around the region. The Pacific Policing Initiative is central to the Ocean of Peace. Peace needs to lead to a change of behaviour. The Pacific Policing Initiative provides for the establishment of regional training centres of excellence and a standing multi-national deployable force. Mr. Speaker Sir, this Initiative came to life through Fiji's Chairmanship of the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police Conference chaired by the Acting Commissioner, Mr. Juki Fong Chew. The region</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1731 has seen the benefits of regional peacekeeping and humanitarian training through Fiji's facilities at Blackrock Camp. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on discussions surrounding climate change and resilience, the Forum Leaders provided support to the Pacific Resilience Facility. This is the first Pacific-led, member- owned and managed, and people-centred climate and disaster resilience financing facility. Leaders agreed that the Facility will be domiciled in Tonga. Development partners have made commitments to the Facility, including: (1) Australia (AUD100 million); (2) Saudi Arabia (USD50 million); (3) People's Republic of China (USD500,000); (4) United States of America (USD25 million); and (5) United Kingdom has pledged the provision of technical support valued at £1.3 million. Mr. Speaker Sir, in addition to this, Forum Leaders were provided an update on the situation in New Caledonia by the President of the Government of New Caledonia, the honourable Louis Mapou. Fiji, along with other Forum Leaders, reaffirmed our continued call for order and stability to prevail. I also reiterated Fiji's commitment to the deployment of the high-level Forum Troika Plus Observer Mission to New Caledonia, as discussions continue on a date for the Mission. Other highlights from the Forum Leaders Meeting, Sir, are reflected in the Forum Leaders Communique developed as an Outcome of the Leaders Plenary and Retreat. Although I did not want to interfere with Troika, there was a personal invitation from the President of France for me to be present. Mr. Speaker Sir, in parallel to the Forum Leaders Programme, the Fiji delegation held 22 bilateral meetings throughout the week. The Annual Forum Leaders Meeting provides an opportunity for Fiji to meet bilateral and multilateral development partners to progress development cooperation. I had the privilege of meeting and holding discussions with the: (1) United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who continue to express his admiration and respect for Fiji because of the work done by our peacekeepers; (2) Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Honourable James Marape; (3) Prime Minister of Cook Islands, Honourable Mark Brown; (4) Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, Honourable Jeremiah Manele; (5) Prime Minister of Tonga, Honourable Sovaleni Hu'akavameiliku; (6) Governor of American Samoa, Honourable Lemanu Mauga; and (7) United States Deputy Secretary of State, Dr. Kurt Campbell. Mr. Speaker Sir, I am pleased to report to this August Parliament and the Nation, that Fiji's first official Air Transport Agreement for "open skies " was signed with the United States on Wednesday, 28th August, 2024, in the margins of the meeting after our Cabinet approved the day before under the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. The Agreement will advance our countries' bilateral aviation cooperation and bring the civil aviation transportation relationship between the United States and Fiji to the highest modern standard.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1732</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 The Agreement will expand our economic and commercial partnership, promote people-to- people ties, and create new opportunities for customers, airlines and travel companies. Under the Agreement, air carriers will be able to provide more affordable, convenient and efficient air services to travellers and shippers, promoting tourism and commerce. The Agreement includes unrestricted capacity and frequency of services for both passenger and all-cargo carriers, open route rights, an open charter regime, self-handling provisions and open code-sharing opportunities. I am confident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this will foster increased investments, maintain trade and increase visitor arrivals for Fiji’s tourism industry, and also contribute to our continuing growth. Fiji Airways’ new Nadi to Dallas flight route will commence on 10 th December this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also take this time to acknowledge other bilateral engagements by Ministers and Senior Officials from our delegation. These included the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, Permanent Secretaries, our Permanent Representative to the United Nations, High Commissioner and Special Envoy, supported by Technical Officials. Fiji actively participated in various side events and meetings that were held on the margins of the Leaders’ Meeting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the meeting has concluded, the next stage for work to start. All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the meeting in Tonga was a timely reminder of the resilience of our Pacific region when we work in solidarity and unity. This was evident when meeting proceedings were barely affected by the 6.6 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks occurred after heavy rain in Tongatapu on Monday, 26 th August. It was a stark reminder to all that were present of the challenges that we face on this side of the world. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to His Majesty the King Tupou VI, the Prime Minister, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, their Royal Highness Prince Tupouto’a ‘Ulukalala and Princess Sinaitakala who were at the meeting throughout the five days occupying Tonga’s Chair in the conference. The people of Tonga made excellent arrangements in hosting the 2024 Pacific Leaders’ Meeting and for the warm hospitality extended to all delegations during our stay. Tonga’s rich culture and tradition, vibrant dances and exuberant mafana, uplifting sounds of choir and harmonious community spirit of the Friendly Isles was on full display, a most remarkable experience and wonderful showcase of our “Pacific Way”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministerial Statements are great opportunities for the Government to keep the Opposition Members abreast with what we are doing. It is where we also benefitted while we were on that side. When they made Ministerial Statements, we knew where to take over from when sides change, so please do not try and crowd out our many Ministerial Statements. It is our way of informing the Opposition and the people of what Government is doing. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I thank the honourable Prime Minister for the Ministerial Statement that prepares us for coming across, come 2027. But honourable Prime Minister, you made a mistake by not taking the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways with you to Tonga. I also stated this to the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. If you want a reliable guide in Tonga with local knowledge, you should have taken the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. The honourable Speaker knows that.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1733 MR. SPEAKER.- Malo lelei. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- But on a serious note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his Statement this morning. I did pick a few things, honourable Prime Minister, from your statement that you made during the plenary session, particularly highlighting that the Pacific we are in now, is no longer the Pacific we were in 20 years ago, given the challenges that you have stated and, of course, the priorities and the opportunities too, although we do agree that we are in a very challenging environment but if we strategise well, we will always benefit, despite the maneuverings that are happening, particularly in as far as geo-politics is concerned within the region. There are some serious questions, there has been a lot of papers written about the future of regionalism but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to agree with the sentiments echoed by the honourable Prime Minister, that our dignity is in our unity and that is also our strength, and we will need to continue to build on that. However, on Ministerial Statements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I continue in the two minutes that I have left, I would also urge Government if we can also have a Ministerial Statement on the recent participation of Fiji in SIDS4 in Antigua and Barbuda. This is very important when we want to link this with the statement that you made in Tonga, that today, security as noted by the Boe Declaration is not just understood in military terms but also in terms of human security, and we want to link that with the SAMOA Pathway because that was also the theme of the Pacific Islands Parliaments Group (PIPG) Meeting in Palau. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is all linked and the continuation from the SAMOA Pathway into SIDS4, we would appreciate if we can also be furnished with the information because we are anticipating this National Development Plan, particularly on the areas of human development and human security because the Pacific Island countries (I want to stress this), due to its vulnerability and the special circumstances of SIDS, we have that advantage and, hopefully, we can use it to our best advantage because it will help us a lot in terms of our priorities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the PIPG Meeting in Tonga, the focus was on human security and the theme in PIPG in Palau was, “Human Development in Oceania: How Can Legislatures Strengthen People-Centred Security for the Pacific Islanders?” Mr. Speaker has said in the Business Committee that we will continue to provide information as well. There is now a move in the legislative work of PIPG to link PIPG with PIFS and the Secretariat is working on it. The only key thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of time limitation, and I had briefed you on this and the honourable Prime Minister has just talked about some of the financial assistance that we are getting, is that it has already been identified that the special situation of SIDS – their small size, remoteness, narrow resource export base, exposure to global and environmental challenges and external shocks, including a large range of impacts from climate change and potentially more frequent and intense natural disasters, this drew attention to the special circumstances of SIDS and that is why, into the SAMOA Pathway and into SIDS4. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just end by saying that this is the one thing that was strongly emphasised in the development of these documents regarding implementation, that we need genuine international co-operation and partnerships based upon the principles of national ownership. This is something, Sir, that I want to stress here because I know that we have national issues, we have regional issues, and we have our CROP agencies as well. This was one of the issues highlighted in one of the Leaders’ Meeting in Tuvalu and I have briefed Mr. Speaker on that. When we have funding, the important thing is, what are our national issues? What are our national priorities? Because some of the donor agencies have this tendency of dictating to us how these funds are going</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1734</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 to be utilised. That is why the link between SIDS4, National development Plan and the utilisation of funds, we need to use it to the best of our advantage. That is something that I will urge the Government to keep an eye on because funds are being offered, but how is it positively impacting the lives of every Pacific Islander and every Fijian, given the context of human security and human development, people-centred development as emphasised in the Boe Declaration. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to start by thanking the honourable Prime Minister for the update on the Pacific Island Development Forum (PIDF) for its future functions and roles. He has termed, after the outcome of the review, PIDF will be the Integrated Development Centre. I think this will be an appropriate platform, not only to serve the best interest of the Island States, but Fiji also. Congratulations for the review of the PIDF into the Integrated Development Centre. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on to PIF in Tonga, I concur with my colleague, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, on his remarks regarding the Statement by the honourable Prime Minister. I thank you honourable Prime Minister for a very clear and comprehensive overview of the results of your Leaders Retreat, bilateral and multilateral engagements, and likewise, the understanding of the efforts to try and bring peace and stability into New Caledonia. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a special congratulations to the honourable Prime Minister for the endorsement of the Ocean of Peace. It resonates well with our nation, a nation that has stood on peace externally and in our efforts in trying to bring peace within Fiji. When this is driven and articulated well, it should be a model not only for the world, but in our region in the Pacific. I concur with the Pacific Policy Initiative and thank you, Sir, for supporting that in the meeting. With all the key outcomes that has now been reported by the honourable Prime Minister, our view from this side of Parliament is our ability to thread this together, how it is converged and threaded together. On that note, Sir, I look forward to the National Development Plan and how this will be threaded together, bringing more meaning, and how the Government will take Fiji forward as a better, prosperous and stable Nation. On these initiatives, this side of Parliament and my group are in full support. On those key areas of how we shape our nation forward, I take this opportunity to talk about five key initiatives, and those are: (1) determination by the Government to amend and review our Constitution, and I commend them for that; (2) Truth and Reconciliation Initiative; (3) ongoing current developments on the review of the Security and Defence Review; (4) (5) the effort towards our external relations on the White Paper for Foreign Affairs; and the National Development Plan. Those key guiding documents will help us shape a better future for our Nation. I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his complete and comprehensive report on the outcomes of his meetings in Tonga. Sandalwood Harvesting: Development of Project and Proposed Plans for the Future HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1735 Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen; ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker Sir, I am pleased to deliver my Statement on the progress of the development of Sandalwood in Fiji. We have three main species of sandalwood that we are promoting, and these include our native sandalwood - Santalum yasi, the Indian sandalwood - Santalum album, and a crossbreed between Santalum yasi and Santalum album known locally as the Santalum hybrid. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking back in history, sandalwood ( Santalum yasi ) was one of the commodities that put Fiji’s name in the international trade arena in the 18th and 19th century. Unfortunately, the resource was over exploited and the local yasi almost became extinct. Like in other Pacific Island countries, there has been a failure in properly managing the harvesting of sandalwood due to strong market demand, coupled with the very low levels of replanting. This has resulted in the disappearance of much of the initial natural stands, causing concerns for the species' future survival. Mr. Speaker, between 2010 to 2022, we exported a total of 154,172 kilogrammes of sandalwood with a total value of FJD12.3 million. The average price over the period was around FJD71 per kilogramme, ranging from FJD35 to FJD208 per kilogramme, with the lower values recorded from 2010 to 2011. From 2012 to 2016, the value went above FJD100 per kilogramme, and reaching more than FJD200 per kilogramme in 2015 to 2016. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the value declined to around FJD83 per kilogramme in 2017, the value, overall, was on an increasing trend over the nine-year period. Sandalwood trade was on hold in 2020 due to the global COVID pandemic. However, trade re-commenced from 2021 with prices hovering below FJD100 per kilogramme. Mr. Speaker, the buyers of Fiji's sandalwood include Dubai, Hong Kong, China, Australia and Taiwan. Current evidence suggests that market outlook and prices of sandalwood of high quality will remain very strong for, at least, the next five years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the high demand for sandalwood, especially in the Asian market, began investing significant number of resources in research to work out ways of improving natural standmanagement and to introduce sandalwood in agroforestry systems, as well as in plantations. the Ministry of Forestry, in realising Mr. Speaker Sir, the Fiji Government has continued to support the development of sandalwood under a capital project, investing FJD1 million over a decade now in the revitalisation of sandalwood development nationally, with a focus on enhancing policy and regulatory requirements to support the sustainable management of sandalwood and to promote more re-planting towards the establishment of a long-term sustainable high value industry for the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, interest in planting and expanding the sandalwood resource has been increasing over the last 10 years or so, given the crop's high value and its good long-term prospects in terms of both, price and demand in the international market. Under the initiative, over 132 hectares of sandalwood woodlots have been planted with over 58,000 sandalwood trees. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total area of 31.4 hectares was planted with sandalwood using the agroforestry system, integrated with other timber and fruit trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, sandalwood can now be seen in almost any village/community and any inhabited island in Fiji. In the next five years, we have forecasted to to be growing</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1736</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 harvest around 106,000 kilogramme of sandalwood with an estimated export value of FJD10 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, FJD0.1 million was invested in the Sandalwood Development Project. The fund was mainly used for the sandalwood grower's consultation in the three Divisions (Central, Western and Northern), with the main objective of establishing the Sandalwood Growers Association that will protect the interests of the farmers. Sandalwood inventory was also carried out and also established sandalwood demonstration plots using the agroforestry approach. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project plans to continue the consultation process with the farmers in the three Divisions in this few financial year and also formalise the establishment of the Sandalwood Growers Association to promote sustainable planting practices using the agroforestry approach and the Sandalwood Industry Framework for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project also plans to continue the inventory of sandalwood woodlots in Fiji. The project will also carry out a farmer survey in this new financial year documenting the views and observations made by sandalwood farmers on the effects of climate change in the last 10 years on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would also like to mention here that the Ministry of Forestry in 2021 submitted a project proposal titled ‘Promoting the Sustainable Production of Sandalwood in Fiji’ to the Asia Pacific Network for Sustainable Forest Management and Rehabilitation (APFNeT). Sir, APFNeT is an organisation constituted by its members which comprises 27 economies and five international organisations in the Asia-Pacific region. Fiji is also a member of this organisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project was approved for funding by the APFNet Council in 2022 and will be implemented over a period of three years beginning this year, with a total grant of around US$0.9 million. The inception meeting is planned to take place in the first quarter of this financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aim of this project is to promote and expand sandalwood resources that will improve the long-term rural socioeconomic development in Fiji through the promotion of efficient plantations and sustainable management of sandalwood. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two main objectives: (1) (2) To promote a substantial expansion and quality improvement of sandalwood resources through development and demonstration of efficient plantation and sustainable management of sandalwood; and Silviculture technologies and experiences on sandalwood are to be enhanced and knowledge extended in the Pacific region through information sharing and capacity building programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of the three years, the APFNet Sandalwood Project aims to achieve the following: (1) (2) Construction of a 3,500 square metre nursery with a capacity of 20,000 high quality sandalwood seedlings; 60 hectares efficient sandalwood plantation and sustainable management demonstration established;</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1737 (3) (4) (5) 5 hectares demonstration on sandalwood plantation using different hosts since it is a semi- parasitic plant; training courses conducted for project stakeholders; and best practice guidelines on the planting and management of sandalwood for landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the domestication of the sandalwood in Fiji in the last 40 years and the establishment of planted sandalwood woodlots, the Ministry of Forestry is confident that we are on track in reviving and revitalising the sandalwood industry. With the right policies and regulations in place, we will never repeat the mistake of the 19 th century which almost led to the depletion of our natural stock which is mostly due to unsustainable harvest practice. MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning and when we resume, the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate may make his response and after that the G-9 Bloc to also make their response to the Statement. The Parliament adjourned at 10.29 a.m.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1738</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.06 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make their response. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minster for Fisheries and Forestry in deliberating on the subject of sandalwood this morning. I appreciate the fact that she has brought this up, especially on sandalwood, after the discussions on fisheries development in the coastal areas of Fiji yesterday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important, because this is one of the fundamental resources that the rural isolated communities in Fiji can depend on. She has covered the historical aspect of the sandalwood trade, the current status, sandalwood development plans and proposed future developments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, sandalwood in its historical aspect was one of the causes of wars in Fiji. As you may recollect Mr. Speaker, Sir, the war in Bua was the Sandalwood War, in Bua Bay, and this is where Charles Savage was finally put down on top of the hill in Naivaka where the Buan warriors were able to trap him, slaughter him and lovo him, as some might say in my normal dialect. (Laughter) It is important, as it was one of the traditional commodities that was farmed and harvested in the early days. It was either sandalwood or bêche-de-mer, and the early impacts of overharvesting has caused the depletion status that we see today. The honourable Minister has highlighted the development aspect of what the Ministry of Forestry is trying to do, and I think the honourable Minister can be confident on the natural aspect that we enjoy in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just divert a little bit, about five years ago I went to Ogea and told them that they are quite fortunate because I can see a lot of sandalwood in your island. They said yanu, this sandalwood is not planted by us, we are fortunate to have a lot of birds that pick on the sandalwood fruits and as they fly around, and they plant all the sandalwood for us. So, in these small island communities, in the rural areas, where there are so meagre resources they can depend on. I think that this one of the other resources that the Government and the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry can concentrate on. Replanting the natural aspect of it, the weather is good, the climatic conditions, it can grow almost anywhere and more so, closer to the beaches and the sandy parts of the islands. I appreciate the fact that she has brought up the subject, because there are a lot of avenues that we can generate. What I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, if she could look into value-adding. If there is a possibility of value-adding, then the returns to the resource owners would be much higher with sending wood and then they value adding to overseas. I think the prospect of giving a maximum return to the resource owners is not to the level that is expected. I thank the honourable Minister again for bringing up the subject of sandalwood, and I wish her well in her endeavour to improve on this commodity. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1739 HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for the statement this morning. Thank you, former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for that response. If we put a dollar sign or value to sandalwood, and I can just give an example from the Forestry website. In 2016, they auctioned a 40 year old sandalwood tree and it was bought at $300 a kilogramme. That one tree was worth $60,000, that is the worth of sandalwood, and the longer it stays, the more valuable it becomes. As alluded to by the honourable Minister and the former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, it now grows almost anywhere. It never used to grow in Vatoa, but now sandalwood grows on my island. The key to replanting, I suppose is a nursery, and nurseries that are accessible. So, for those small islands it will be worth going over there and setting up nurseries where you want to replant sandalwood I mentioned this before in Parliament, that there is a way to advertise the planting of sandalwood, and that is to young families. When they have a child, when the child is born and if you plant 10 sandalwood trees, when that child is 21 years old, the trees are 21 years old also. If we half the value of that tree that I mentioned of $60,000, or let us say one tree is $10,000, if you planted 10 trees then this child who is now 21 years old, there is a $100,000 there ready if you are sending him off. It is also a worthwhile investment for those in the villages when you build houses. For example, if you build a school in the rural area and at the same time plant 50 sandalwood trees, by the time that school needs repairs in 20 years, you do not have to fundraise, there you go! You just need to harvest that sandalwood, and it will go towards the rehabilitation of that building. Also, another way of advertising the worth of these trees is, the longer you leave it, the more valuable it becomes. I just encourage the Ministry, I think it is a very worthwhile project to get this very easy commodity. If you look at the value of mahogany, it is a big tree and you have to weigh it. To harvest your mahogany you need all the machines et cetera. Except for sandalwood because it is not a very big tree and it is easy for those that have sandalwood plantations to harvest and take it to the market. I agree with the former Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, if you can get oil extraction here in Fiji, that will be worth more than the sandalwood now. We are exporting sandalwood oil rather than exporting the wood itself. I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement, and I wish the Ministry well in this very worthwhile project that they are doing. MR. SPEAKER.- You might recall honourable Members that I mentioned in this august Parliament that a house belonging to the present Turaga Tui Bua came from the proceeds of sandalwood. A complete house was able to be funded and the construction took off, and that is where the present Tui Bua resides in Lomanikoro, Bua. The funny thing is sandalwood that was growing overnight had disappeared and some very strange things happened, not only in Bua, but even in my village in Somosomo. When the sandalwood is growing to this height, you will be lucky to see them around the garden of that particular household. And not in the too distant future, of course it will disappear. So, value-adding is, indeed, a great thing, because I remember quite vividly that honourable Koroilavesau promoted this idea with nurseries in the village, and we learnt to intercrop with dalo ni tana, it grew very well. And there is the white sandalwood in Lakeba, Lau. I do not know if it produces that same odour or smell which makes it attractive for people to buy. So again, value-adding is indeed a great area to ponder upon, honourable Minister for Forestry, if we would like to encourage villagers to grow more.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1740</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 Rehabilitation of Schools Around Fiji HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; bula vinaka and good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise this morning to inform Parliament on the progress of school rehabilitation works to date on the schools that have been affected by natural disasters or man-made disasters in the past years since TC Winston. Before I do that, I would like to acknowledge the work done by the former Government in rehabilitating all the 336 TC Winston damaged schools at a total cost of more than $230 million. Out of this, 206 schools were managed by the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) and the balance by the Ministry of Education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recovery work has been uneven at some stages and some of the most devastated segments of our population in the rural, remote and maritime areas continue to be disproportionately impacted. For instance, the recovery efforts from 2018 to 2022 were halted in the rural and maritime zones and efforts were directed to the mainland of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all understand Fiji’s geographical location, which falls within the cyclone paths that normally develop around the region. Fiji suffers from an extended cyclone seasons from November to April with usually two to three cyclones per year. These cyclones are usually associated with heavy rainfall, massive flooding and tidal surges. The culmination of these can lead to massive destruction such as landslides, loss of vegetation, destruction to the physical environment, resulting in damages to school buildings, teachers quarters and dormitories. Once the work on the TC Winston rehabilitation was still progressing, Fiji was again hit by several other tropical depressions and cyclones of varying intensities. A typical example was TD04 depression that affected the Fiji group from Monday, 12 th December, 2016 to Sunday 25 th December, 2016, causing multiple floodings, landslides and widespread damages to major infrastructure. The extensive landslide affected the Laucala District School which totally destroyed a one by four classroom, Head Teacher’s quarters and the school water tanks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, plans for the one by three classrooms have been approved by the relevant Government Agencies and we are also thankful to the Taveuni Rotary Club for sponsoring the building materials. The Office of the Prime Minister is still working on the tender for the barge to take the building materials to Qamea Island. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TC Gita developed from Tonga and made its way to the Lau group. It damaged six schools in Southern Lau, including Ono Levu Primary School, Doi Village School, Vatoa Village School, Matuatabu Primary School in Ogea, Fulaga District School and Babasea Primary School in Matuku. To date, schools have been scoped by consultants and drawings are ready for tender process. There is a need to reassess the documents before they actually go on tender, as some value engineering may need to be done to match classroom sizes with current school rolls. Some minor repairs have been undertaken by school management to continue with everyday learning processes pending the upcoming major rehabilitation works. In April of 2018, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 36 schools were affected by the two cyclones, including three stand-alone ECE, 30 Primary Schools with attached ECE and three secondary schools in Kadavu. Additionally, two maritime Nadroga schools were negatively impacted. Lead consultants were engaged by the Government to carry out detailed assessments and manage the rehabilitation works for TC Keni. Before the tenders were called for TC Keni rehabilitation, TC Harold struck two years later leaving a trail of more destruction on Kadavu schools. The associated whirlwind that developed in</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1741 Wainibuka also destroyed some school buildings, Tailevu North College and Namalata Primary School in Korovou. Same number of schools in Kadavu, plus two additional schools in Tailevu were affected and lead consultants had to be engaged to redo scoping and detailed drawings. The final documents are yet to be completed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is contemplating on continuing with the same consultants or to opt for Public Works to continue with the program. In December 2020, TC Yasa struck mostly affecting schools in the North with a few schools in Northern Yasawa, Lau and Lomaiviti also suffering damages. A total of 59 schools were affected with 38 seen as suffering damages. Some schools have been quickly fixed by RFMF engineers with oversight by the SMC. Sir, DFAT also came on board to start with the rehabilitation works for the TC Yasa affected schools and I am happy to say that seven out of the nine adopted schools have been completed and commissioned. The remaining two will be commissioned by the end of September 2024. Yadua Island school was also badly affected by TC Yasa and to date there has been no rehabilitation awarded. The school is using UNICEF tents as classrooms. Currently the Vanua is constructing a temporary one by two wooden classrooms, the Ministry of Education, Northern Education Office is also assisting in providing the materials for the classrooms. TC Ana and TC Bina hit the country on 30 th and 31 st January, 2021 and brought with it heavy flooding which affected the two main islands and Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Heavy flooding was experienced in Labasa and also in Rakiraki to Nadi. Fiji was also impacted with COVID-19. There were a number of schools that were also being destroyed by fire. Ongoing fire rehabilitation is happening at the Lelean Memorial School and Vanuakula Catholic School in Waidina, Naitasiri. Degei House in RKS is at a completion stage and should be handed over during the 100-year centennial celebration for the school next week. Other burnt dormitories included Sukuna House in RKS and Verata House and Rewa House in QVS have also been included in this year’s budget and preliminary works have been undertaken, a tender to be called before the end of this month. There are also other schools which had suffered the same fate through fire incidents, which included Vatuwaqa Primary School, Ba Special School to name a few, and plans are in line to start in this financial year. At present, the engineers of NRW Macallan (Fiji) Ltd have done a thorough inspection with the DFAT team on the burnt buildings of Vatuwaqa Primary School and a report is yet to be furnished to the Ministry of Education before further actions are taken. The Ministry has set up a Rehabilitation Unit within our Asset and Infrastructure Section, and we have plans to secure rehabilitation staff within the first quarter of this financial year. Once the Unit is up and running, we will relook at all the scoping reports and drawings provided by the lead consultants that were engaged with the then CIU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the administrative works and review of the technical aspects of the rehabilitation works will be happening in the second and third quarter respectively. The Ministry has been allocated a $6 million budget under Head 50 in this financial year to cater for the rehabilitation works. We are hoping to also have access to the Climate Change Fund of US$22.5 million to cater for all the pending cyclone rehabilitation, as most of the schools are usually used as evacuation centres during natural disasters. The Ministry of Education is also challenged by having the right personnel with the right qualification, therefore, the Ministry has undertaken an interview process and should have the right people with cyclone rehabilitation experiences to fill up key positions to kick start the rehabilitation programme within this financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during our school visitations across Fiji, it was also found that some schools did not have valid land leases, and the Ministry of Education is currently working with iTLTB and</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1742</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 other stakeholders to effect land leases for affected schools as part of the mandatory requirements for rehabilitation assistance. Matuku Secondary School is one of the schools that has land lease issues. The school was part of the establishment of Junior Secondary School in 1967, however work on the project was incomplete. The forms of EA2 and EA3 have been given to the Interim School Committee for their furtherance and the secondary school will be part of the Ratu Mocevakaca Primary School lease while working for having their own secondary school lease is underway. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is so fortunate that over the years and through past major disasters, we have had assistance of our development partners, other humanitarian groups and financial institutions to come to our aid. Their assistance cannot go unnoticed as they have contributed in speeding up our recovery and rehabilitation efforts. The strengthening of our Vuvale Partnership has seen DFAT extending its support during TC Yasa. We also acknowledge the Embassy of Japan, MFAT, UAE, Government of Indonesia, UNICEF, Save the Children Fund and many others that I have not mentioned here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry has started on its Fire Rehabilitation Programme. We are poised to start with the cyclone rehabilitation works given that we have an opportunity to access the Climate Change Funds for this programme. All rehabilitation buildings will be seen to be in compliance with the new standard building codes and other regulatory requirements for stronger and resilient structure. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make their response. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Education for his Ministerial Statement on a very important subject, that is, rehabilitation of the schools in Fiji. Our aim is to improve the quality of education through the management of facilities and infrastructure so that our students are provided very good learning environment. A school is a social institution whose existence is part of the nation’s social system which aims to produce capable, democratically faithful, physically and spiritually healthy individuals. The honourable Minister has highlighted a number of good plans to bring about improvements and I would like to thank him. The support of good facilities and infrastructure will help teachers teach effectively, learning activities will also be more varied, interesting and meaningful. It is the responsibility of the schools to maintain the facilities and infrastructure that they have. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted vast improvement in facilities and infrastructure in schools since the introduction of Free Education Grant. The Free Education grant was introduced by the Bainimarama Government, all the schools are given grants … HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Hogwash! HON. H. CHAND.- … whether it be government schools or committee schools. If the grant is well managed and utilised properly, I am sure all schools in Fiji will have good teaching learning resources, good classrooms and will be able to maintain the buildings. There is an allocation of 20 percent for buildings and maintenance and 15 percent for teaching and learning resources. If a primary school has a roll of 500 students, the school will receive a grant of about $100,000; $20,000 can be used for building and maintenance and $15,000 can be used for teaching and learning resources. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear!</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1743 HON. H. CHAND.- Secondary schools get more grant than primary schools. There is also provision for virement if there is a need. Mr. Speaker, Sir, teachers’ welfare is very important. The Ministry of Education spent $4.4 million from 2015 to 2020 to upgrade teachers quarters for 187 schools around the country through its building grant allocation. The improved facilities and better infrastructure such as new classrooms and other school resources will create better learning and teaching environment for teachers and also for the students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2016 many schools were badly damaged by Cyclone Winston and the FijiFirst Government, with the support of other development partners were very quick to rebuild and rehabilitate the schools and students were back in their classrooms within weeks and in some cases, it took a month. (Chorus of interjections) HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now the cost of everything has gone up and I urge the Government to consider increasing the grants to schools, so that schools can bring about improvement in the teaching and learning facilities and infrastructure. The Government should be committed to providing quality education, not only in words, but also in action. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! HON. H. CHAND.- I would like to thank you Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity, and the</p><h4>honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and plans.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Group of Nine or their designate. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I rise to response briefly to the Ministerial Statement presented by the honourable Minister for Education on the rehabilitation of schools around Fiji. Mr. Speaker, at this juncture, I thank the honourable Minister for updating this august House on the Ministry’s rehabilitation programme for schools around the country that are in dire need for repairs, maintenance and upgrade and also thank the Coalition Government for the continuation and completion of rehabilitation works started by the FijiFirst Government. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to commend all teachers and support staff from these respective schools on their dedication, commitment, perseverance and efforts to continue in imparting knowledge to our students, despite the conditions of the schools they serve in. Mr. Speaker, with the completion of the rehabilitation programmes, it will indeed bring forth relief and hope to our teachers and most importantly, our children in having to now dwell in an environment that will be conducive to learning. Mr. Speaker, I will also urge the Ministry of Education to consider upgrading school dormitories both, primary and secondary, teachers and staff quarters. Our teachers and staff should deserve better living conditions, and their welfare must be paramount. Mr. Speaker, I noted that Vatuwaqa Primary School is also one of the schools listed under the rehabilitation programme. The request has been brought to this august Parliament before and I thank the Coalition Government for considering our plea. Mr. Speaker, with the reconstruction and upgrade phase, I urge the Ministry to ensure that it continues to fulfil Target 4.8 of SDG 4, that is, to build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1744</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 environment for all students.</p></body>
