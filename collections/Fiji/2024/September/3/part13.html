<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Update on the Review of the iTaukei Affairs Act (Question No. 172/2024) HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts inform Parliament on the status of the review of the iTaukei Affairs Act? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Niudamu for the question. The overarching objective of the review of the iTaukei Affairs Act is twofold - the economic empowerment of the iTaukei and the strengthening of vanua governance. The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs undertook the review of the iTaukei Affairs Act, not only to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its service delivery but to improve the overall wellbeing of the iTaukei communities. The request for the Expression of Interest was published on 9 th December, 2023, and it was closed on 22 nd December, 2023. At its closing, seven applications were received and four were shortlisted for the interview. After going through the relevant process, one was selected. The team signed a four-month contract on 6 th May, 2024. The work commenced immediately and will be completed on 17 th September, 2024, in two weeks’ time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review team’s work is guided by the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG). The review is divided into five phases where in each phase, the team presents an update to the Strategic Advisory Group. The review team has met with the following groups: religious groups; tertiary and university students; iTaukei institutions; iTaukei Affairs stakeholders; (1) (2) Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs); (3) (4) (5) (6) women’s Group; (7) statutory bodies; (8) provincial councils; and the (9) public at large. The review team has covered sufficient ground in its work. It has consulted and obtained the views of credible cross-sections of the community. During the consultation, Fijians have expressed their support for the iTaukei administration to continue but there must be a fundamental shift in how it does its business. It must take into account emerging issues that are shaping the development of today’s agenda. More will be revealed when the review team completes its work. The team is expected to wrap up its work and submit its report by the middle of this month.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1745 Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages (Question No. 173/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the National Policy on Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages and its Standard Operating Procedures? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. The National Policy on Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages at all Government ministries and institutions and its SOPs and Guidelines were launched on Wednesday, 14 th February, 2024 by the honourable Prime Minister. Cabinet has also endorsed the adoption and implementation of this National Policy at all Government ministries and institutions. The new policy supersedes its predecessor, the Healthy Catering Guideline which was endorsed in Cabinet of 2017. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this policy is a bold step in tackling NCDs in Fiji and mainly the ultimate goal of the policy is to reduce the number of people in Fiji developing NCDs and succumbing to any complications of diabetes, heart disease which are the most common causes of sickness and death in Fiji. For some clarity, in the last 12 months, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services together with our Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) partners conducted screening activities at 107 workplaces where 3,456 participants were assessed. The result showed that 50 percent of participating workers were obese, 32 percent have high blood pressure, with 5 percent had severe hypertension category. In addition, 60 percent of the workers in the age group 20 years to 25 years who have high risk of developing an NCD while 41 percent had a high risk of suffering from heart diseases in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these findings are consistent with our national disease burden with heart attack as our number one killer and coupled with the risk of obesity and high blood pressure, as well as the reports from 2021 Food System and Nutrition Survey and Multi Indicator Cluster Survey of 2021. Therefore, in summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a policy has been adopted and it is mainly to try and reduce the effects of NCD in the workplace. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular policy, I understand actually comes on the back of two things that were conducted in 2021. One was the food systems and nutrition study and there was a cluster survey. I think in it there are quite a number of recommendations. Currently, I understand what the policy says is with respect to Government workplaces, et cetera. When will the Government be taking this out to the general public in terms of that particular policy for the public at large because these two surveys indicated how much there is a need for us to keep a tab on this. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for his supplementary question. As I had mentioned, it was launched earlier this year, it has been adopted by Cabinet and right now it is a policy within the Government institutions. We, as the Ministry of Health have taken the lead in most of our catering, healthy food choices have been put on the table. With that being said, based on the findings of the cluster study, and the surveys that was done and also the recent one with the workplace survey, it has indicated that the workplace area within the government institutions especially the workforce are at risk of developing NCDs especially at the younger age. So, with this policy being brought in and its SOP, will allow Government to take the</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1746</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 lead in trying to combat NCDs. It has taken into consideration also the data from the previous studies in 2021 as well. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. In terms of the Government institutions, et cetera, does the SOP have a programme whereby if there are functions, et cetera taking place within Government institutions, is there some monitoring that is done with respect to the food that is being dished out to these particular institutions? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, part of the policy is the training. The Ministry takes the lead in doing the training to the various other ministries. So, Training of Trainers (ToT), that is currently being conducted and we will do more training in the future. But nevertheless, it is trying to standardise the catering services throughout the ministries and that will involve training as well and that is included in the SOP. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. Once implemented, will the National Policy affect those vendors who sell food on the roadsides? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, similar to the catering within the school, so it is within the vicinity of the workplace. Outside of the workplace, that is beyond the relevant Ministry’s control. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for coming up with an excellent policy to guide the catering within government services. My question to the honourable Minister is, we are talking about healthy food choices and beverages. Does your policy include serving of liquor at government functions? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will have to come back to you with a response. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please join me in welcoming a delegation from the House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia. It is headed by honourable Mohammed Muraz and the Ambassador of Indonesia, His Excellency Dupito D. Simamora. Welcome to Fiji and to the Parliament of Fiji. For the information of honourable Members, Fiji and Indonesia established diplomatic relations in 1974 and since then, our two countries have progressively developed various sectors including people to people exchanges, technical training, human resource development, defence and policing, agriculture, disaster management, forestry and fisheries. Our enduring friendship through our two Governments and Parliaments continue to strengthen, fostering mutual understanding and shared achievements. Again, I welcome you all, Your Excellency and honourable Members. Honourable Members, just a little bit more, before we attended a meeting in Indonesia known as Indonesia-Pacific Parliamentary Partnership, there was a huge protest, it was being carried out in front of Parliament showcasing how people were not responding or taking into account the great task that the Government of Indonesia was doing in West Papua. Upon this visit of ours, in exchange this huge delegation is here, we heard directly from the honourable Members in the House of Representatives in the Republic of Indonesia how they constructed huge roads, wharves and jetties, airfields, et cetera in the very areas that they were protesting for outside here. That was straight from the honourable Members to us who are visiting</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1747 their country for that particular meeting and here they are, and as the honourable Prime Minister had sounded in the PIFS meeting in Tonga, he is trying all his best to promote his Blue Ocean bounded by the Pacific Ocean, and of which the great Government of Indonesia shares with the rest of us that shares our border in the Pacific. It is a huge task that is now being undertaken and endorsed by PIFS in Tonga, but it is a matter of how best we can support each other. They are well known for MMSE, they are so far ahead in that particular area and there are so many things to learn from Indonesia as well. Being a huge country with this massive population of almost 300 million, they are a market to themselves, and we wonder as to how best they have progressed both in all areas of development including the military and police as well. We are so grateful for them to be here, and we will be having a private luncheon with them when we rise midday today, in the hope that we continue to foster this relationship and see how best we can work on areas that will benefit both, including the region as well. Construction of Crossings – Nakawaga Village and Viani Village (Question No. 174/2024) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the construction of crossings for Nakawaga Village in Koroalau and Viani Village in Navatu, Cakaudrove? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question in terms of these two crossings. We as a Government are very open to discussions on these crossings, especially I have impressed upon FRA and also within my Ministry the need to really look at those communities which have issues in terms of crossings, especially where school children, women and the general public are involved and which we can solve quickly. Just looking at this one, the Viani Crossing in the Tikina o Navatu, we have not specifically budgeted for it but we are considering this too within the Ministry and also FRA in terms of inclusion. It is not really a wide crossing, it is approximately about 10 meters, we can cater for that and that is something we are considering at the moment. Just looking at the location, it is near the coast, so it is affected sometimes by excessive high tides and such events. That is something which we will also need to be considered as the team is looking into that. The other one, Nakawaga Crossing in the Tikina o Koroalau, the first one in the Tikina o Navatu, this is in the Tikina o Koroalau, again this is planned in the next financial year as part of our broader strategy in terms of infrastructure in the North. It is also part of the broader Nukubuno to Navakuru Rural Rroads Programme from the Savusavu side to the Labasa side. That will provide an alternative route connecting Labasa to Savusavu. So just looking at the sketch again of the area, it is quite a wide river, it is 30 meters and when there is a sea-level rise, it is quite wide. There are locations along that which are not as wide as where the road is. So, again, that is something we need to relook at in terms of the location. HON. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, when it comes to Cakaudrove, I always stand and speak for those people. Apparently, there has been a few instances where the road has been turned into gravel and still the FRA has not tarsealed that, for example, the road near the Savusavu Airport. It is our tourist hotspot. I hope the FRA and the Minister will look into this matter and tarseal those roads.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1748</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just a statement:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> We thank you for that statement of yours, honourable Ketan Lal. (Laughter)</p><h4>Any other supplementary questions?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Email me:</span></p><p>Health &amp; Safety at Work (General Workplace Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 (Question No. 175/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations update Parliament on the justification to amend the Health and Safety at Work (General Workplace Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2024? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Kiran for asking the question. In line with the Whole of Government Review on Ease of Doing Business, spearheaded by the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communication, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations has reviewed the effectiveness of the general workplace inspections and audits conducted by the National OHS Inspectorate at workplaces in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Bank through the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications reported on 25 th August, 2023, the following issues: (1) The Ministry of Employment through the National OHS Services does not have a full list of businesses and workplaces to be inspected. (2) Updated data is available at Fiji Revenue and Customs Service and the Registrar of Companies, but this is not shared with the agencies or made publicly available. (3) Ony a small percentage of businesses and workplaces in Fiji are inspected. (4) Publicly available information from 2018 indicates that FRCS had 28,984 SMEs and workplaces registered in its database. This number would have grown significantly since Fiji’s reopening after the pandemic. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OHS inspectors spend significant amount of time inspecting workplaces and businesses which are already compliant, and this time could be better spent visiting and advising non-compliant workplaces and SMEs. In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, it is essential to strike a balance between ensuring the health and safety of workers while also supporting businesses, growth and employment creation. As such, there is a growing need to review and potentially adapt existing health and safety regulations to better align with the needs of businesses and facilitate job creation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the regulations introduces a new clause in Part 26, Regulation 66(1) and (2)(a) and (b) of the general workplace conditions. Regulation 24 outlines a risk-based inspection and audit provision with a proposed schedule. The provisions and schedules outline the workplaces based on high and low risk, and corresponding inspection and audit frequencies. Low risk workplaces to be inspected and audited at least once every three years. These workplaces present minimal safety hazards. High risk workplaces to be inspected and audited at least</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1749 annually and based on the elevated level of risk, which has the potential to cause accidents, injuries or even death. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also an inclusion in Regulation 66 is a new Regulation 4, which requires that in the case of non-compliance on the part of an employer rated as low risk workplace, the Chief Health and Safety Inspector has the power to classify the workplace as high risk. Sir, OHS is one of the critical areas for businesses anywhere in the world, because of any non-compliance in this area, there will be significant impacts on human lives and work environment. Ensuring compliance with OHS laws is a priority for this Government, and hence, the need to review these regulations was very critical for ease of doing business for both public and private sectors. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, as you have mentioned the new regulations actually create a high risk and a low risk factory, premises, et cetera that you look at. As you also mentioned, the Chief Health and Safety Inspector is the one that is given the authority for compliance and non-compliance. Will the honourable Minister be able to further amend it in terms of checks and balances to ensure that it is not a singular person that signs off on this, purely because it could be an area where they may be some corruption, et cetera that may arise? For example, if the Permanent Secretary was to co-sign, or the Minister himself, would the honourable Minister be doing that? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Koya for the suggestion and we will definitely discuss it with our senior staff. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response about the amendments. My question is about the general workplace conditions because there is a question raised by the general public about the health and safety concerns around amusement ride operators. Fairly the points that have been raised is, are these amusement rides safe for our children and are they OHS certified? I do thank the honourable Minister for Local Government for his early intervention into the investigation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious matter because a lady has died from a ferries wheel incident and yet justice is not being served. So, in terms of OHS compliance, this very morning the honourable Minister has stated that the caused had been identified and operations has been ceased. What is this cause in terms of the failure of the amusement ride operation? MR. SPEAKER.- Would you like to answer that? I have just been informed that it is now before the courts. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Sir, I would just like to partly answer that question; the first one. I just wish to say that I had given a full explanation to this House in the last sitting and it was your directive that because it is a triable case and it is with the DPP, it is not wise to discuss this any further. I find it very strange that the honourable Member has brought it up again.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- People are asking:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> People are asking and we have made the statement very clearly, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Minister, we will leave it at that, because a ruling has already been done on that. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, it is not a question but a statement. I have passed a message to the honourable Minister. There are some workers in workplace who deliberately try to cause accidents or sabotage things and today I saw a video where a pallet trolley was rolled in Raojibhai</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1750</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 Patel Street and someone was waving and taking a video while sitting on the pallet trolley and rolling down. That is a deliberate attempt to cause an accident, people can get hurt, properties can get damaged, people’s lives are at risk. Pallet trolley is not supposed to ridden on the main road. Raojibhai Patel Street is a very busy road. I hope the honourable Minister can put measures in place that culprits as such needs to be taken care of. MR. SPEAKER.- It is just a statement.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, supplementary question to the honourable Minister.</p><p>Are there any changes to the OHS legislation for climate change adaptation? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I can get an answer to that new question for the Member later. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the review of this regulation. I have always been concerned about OHS particularly on the health aspect. It is about occupation health and safety and unfortunately in Fiji, we neglect the health component of that regulation. What is the honourable Minister going to do about it, because we need a healthy workforce in order to boost production. This is one of our major issues in Fiji; the health aspect of the regulation. What is the Ministry considering and what are the plans we have to deal with this issue? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition…. MR. SPEAKER.- The Wellness Programme and all that going? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Yes, Sir. I just wanted to advice that PPE’s are compulsory in all workplaces and there is awareness provided by the Ministry at workplaces, at floor level, as well as inspections done at all workplaces. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- We have to appoint officers who will do these inspections. With this Parliament, the food that is served here, nice food but is it healthy? Is it contributing to improve the health of the workers? That is what OHS, the health aspect is all about. Training facilities, you have the gymnasium, it should be part of the regulation. MR. SPEAKER.- Before the honourable Minister replies, I would like to make an attempt to answer the question because you pointed a finger at the food that is being prepared here. Honourable Members, with due respect to you, this is your demand that we provide lunch. We have gone out of our way to ensure that it is the best lunch that can be provided to each and everyone. There is a variety that we have dished out in front of you. On that, I think the Secretariat is doing a great job in ensuring that we provide good food to you honourable Members and secondly, since it is free of charge. (Laughter) Update on Replanting Indigenous Trees (Question No. 176/2024) HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1751 Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament how has the emphasis on replanting indigenous trees progressed considering that Fiji has concentrated on the introduction of high-value species in our country? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Koroilavesau for his question. I first want to highlight the difference between indigenous tree species and high-value tree species. Indigenous tree species or native tree species are those which have been growing naturally in our country. This will include dakua, makadre, damanu and kauvula. As a direct comparison, both pine and mahogany, our main plantation species are termed as “exotics” meaning that they were introduced into our country. High-value tree species on the other hand are those which can be either native or exotic but of high value in terms of their wood product prices in the market. Most of our native species especially dakua, vesi, yaka and sacau are considered high-value species. In terms of our plantation species, mahogany is considered to be higher value when compared to pine. Sandalwood, both our local species and the introduced ones are much more valuable than any other tree species that we have both natives and exotics. Mr. Speaker, from 2012 the Ministry of Forestry embarked on a number of tree planting initiatives which included the Million Trees, Reforestation of Degraded Forests and the Four Million Trees in four years which expanded to 30 million trees in 15 years, an initiative in response to commitments made at the UN Heads of States Climate Change Summit in New York in September 2019. Mr. Speaker, tree species that were planted included native tree species of different types, both timber and non-timber, tree species, food trees, exotic timber trees, coastal species including mangroves and non-timber forest product including high-value species like sandalwood and agarwood. Mr. Speaker, according to the Ministry’s planting records, the total number of trees planted so far is around 19.2 million trees. Out of this total, 14.9 million or about 78 percent are pine seedlings majority of which are under the management of Fiji Pine Limited. The remainder comprising of mahogany at 776,081, mangrove 930,920 seedlings, sandalwood 17,114 and mixed species including all indigenous tree species amounting to around 2.5 million seedlings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget for our Reforestation Programme for this financial year in supporting the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years is $2.5 million. A major focus of our programme will be the maintenance of beat-up activities, replacing all the dead seedlings in all the planted areas in the three operational Divisions. The target has, therefore, been reduced from 1,800 hectares in the last financial year to 600 hectares for this financial year, to allow our teams to carry out their maintenance activities and to also conduct their monitoring. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to our reforestation efforts, we have been working on the protection and conservation of our native tree species, mainly because of their significant importance in maintaining our rich biodiversity and also, because of their social and cultural importance to our people. MR. SPEAKER.- The question was on indigenous species. In your reply, you stated that pine has been one of the ones that you have been replanting. So, on the question of indigenous species,</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1752</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd September, 2024 our friends from Indonesia are here. Teak wood is one of their popular trees species, or shall I say, hardwood. They do a lot in ensuring that they get the maximum benefit out of value -adding from those teak wood. Your Million Trees that began by the FijiFirst Government, I do not know how far it has gone. How many trees have we planted? These are the kind of issues that we would like to hear, honourable Minister. You do not have to make an effort to reply now, I am just raising this because the crux of the question was on the indigenous species. HON. J. USAMATE.- A supplementary question, Sir. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for her elaboration on the number of trees that they have planted, in particular the 19.1 million that we have managed to plant for that 30 Million target. I think you mentioned around 2.5million, was it 2.5 million?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Budget of $2.5 million for reforestation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> For indigenous trees or plants?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> Yes, for the Reforestation Programme.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> My question is, and this is the question that I asked the other day, how do we calculate success? Is it the planting, or is there monitoring on the percentage of success of the growth of those particular trees? Do we have that in process, or do we count it as a success when you have just planted one? That was the issue that was brought up in the Copra Millers Report when they were counting the number of coconuts they planted, but there was no monitoring of the real success in terms of making sure the plants grow. So, is that part of the process when you look at these indigenous trees that we are planting? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. I mentioned there have been 19.2 million trees that have been planted so far. Depending on whether these trees are planted around Fiji, the various Divisions, the Ministry of Forestry is responsible for the monitoring of the survival rate of these plants. That is how they monitor the progress of the of the programme, and that is by looking at the survival rate of the plants that are planted in the various Divisions. HON. J. USAMATE.- A follow-up question on the indigenous species, in particular, what is the survival rate of the plants been planted? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- I can provide that information to you later on this week, but based on the survival rate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the officers at the Ministry do, they change the way or the method of planting that they have undertaken in order to improve the survival rate. So, in the case of honourable Usamate’s question, I will get the answer later on this week, Sir. Vinaka. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- A supplementary question from me, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are dealing with an extractive industry and we have always talked about sustainable development. Honourable Minister, is it possible to put it as part of your law or regulation too, particularly in terms of replacement? I know that developed countries have this. You log one tree, and you replace it with three trees. This is about sustainability. What are we going to leave for our children in the future, particularly when it comes to indigenous species? So, that is the question that I want to put before you. Thank you.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1753 HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU- I think the current practice or the initiatives that have been carried out by the Ministry now, is to encourage the landowners to undertake that activity. For every mahogany plant they cut down, they plant three or four more in place of that. That is one initiative that the Ministry is currently undertaking now. Currently, we are also reviewing the Forest Act, so all these will be incorporated into the Act once the review is finalised. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn the House for lunch, especially when we are having a meeting and lunch as well with the delegation from the Republic of Indonesia. We will now adjourn and resume at about 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.22 p.m.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>3 rd September, 2024</p><h4>Communications from the Speaker</h4><p>1754 The Parliament resumed at 3.00 p.m.</p></body>
