<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Plans to Address Flooding in Rakiraki Town (Question No. 217/2024) HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the plans to address flooding in Rakiraki Town? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, flooding in Rakiraki is a persistent problem, primarily caused by its geographical setting and climate. Located in the Naqoro Flat, with a backroad of Nakauvadra Range, Rakiraki is prone to flash floods during periods of heavy rainfall, especially during the wet season and during tropical cyclones. Floodwaters usually affect homes, businesses and agricultural lands causing significant disruptions to livelihoods and the local economy. The low- lying areas of Rakiraki Town and nearby villages are particularly vulnerable to these floods or flooding events. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 27 floods were recorded from 2018 with an average of four floods expected yearly in Rakiraki. That is really a big number. The Town is usually closed due to floods and the main public roads and businesses normally take two days to three days to clear and clean up. According to a survey conducted by the Rakiraki Town Council in 2022, loss to businesses was approximately $200,000 to $300,000. For a small Town, that is a major dent on their livelihood. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is anticipated that after any flood, diseases such as leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue can arise due to contaminated water, poor sanitation and the rapid increase of vectors like mosquitoes. In mitigating these risks, the Council has prepared a Disaster Management Policy that includes the Disaster Management Operation. This is usually activated in November and deactivated in April the following year. The processes include areas liable to Town operations, such as awareness and visitation by the Health Team to all residences and business houses in Town. The purpose of site visit is to raise awareness on the effects of floods and to remove or reduce mosquito breeding places, proper boiling</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1922</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 of drinking water and proper WASH processes, which is water, sanitation and hygiene. The Disaster Management Operation is a success for Rakiraki Town as there was no record of leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue in the area since 2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most critical strategies to address flooding in Rakiraki is improving the Town’s drainage system. Unfortunately, Rakiraki Town Council or the Ministry of Local Government cannot work alone in resolving this matter. This requires effective inter-agency collaboration, as tackling flooding in a small town such as Rakiraki requires appropriate resources. Flooding worsens by the inability of existing drainage infrastructure to cope with the volume of water during heavy rain. The Council has upgraded most of its stormwater drains and even removed big rocks or boulders to divert the flow of water. This provides immediate relief as it directs water away from the Town more efficiently. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dredging of rivers around Rakiraki is crucial. Over time, the build-up of sediment in rivers reduces their capacity to carry water, increasing the risk of overflow. Dredging involves removing the sediment to deepen the river channels and allowing them to accommodate high water levels during storms with extended periods of rainfall. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Council has submitted a request to the Ministry of Water ways for dredging of Penang River, as well as the Nakauvadra River. The Ministry of Waterways has advised they will move the dredging machines towards Rakiraki once the main rivers are dredged. It is also important to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Waterways has started desilting farm drains near Rakiraki, which will reduce the effect of flooding in the future. We have also received confirmation from the Ministry of Waterways, that they will start desilting works of Penang River by December 2024. Another significant effort made by the Council is the development of early warning systems. This is done in preparation with the Ministry of Meteorological Services and the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO). The Council actively notifies residents living in low lying areas when rivers reach dangerous levels. This allows people to take precautionary measures, such as moving to high grounds or securing their homes, as well as other necessary materials before the floodwaters arrive. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government and local authorities are focussed on resilient infrastructure development. Future construction projects in Rakiraki are being designed with a focus towards flood resilience. This includes elevating buildings, as well as constructing flood areas or land in strategic areas. The structural changes aim to limit the damage caused by floodwaters and allow quick recovery after flood events. Plans are also on the way to retrofit existing infrastructure such as homes and bridges to withstand the impact of floods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally there is an increased focus on community engagement and disaster preparedness. The Council is working closely with the Chamber of Commerce, local communities and ratepayers to improve awareness on flood risks and to develop response plans. Regular trainings and simulations are conducted to help residents better understand evacuation procedures, prepare emergency supplies and protect their assets during floods. Reinforcement culture preparedness and resilience, Rakiraki aims to reduce human economic costs of future flooding events. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through a combination of infrastructure upgrades, natural resource management, early warning systems and community preparedness, Rakiraki is taking significant steps to address the ongoing challenge of flooding. These efforts, supported by Government and through partnership, aim to minimise damage caused by future floods and help the community recover more quickly when floods reoccur. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to the question.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1923 HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for a detailed response. My question is from a Rakiraki resident. His name is Fazeel, and he has stated the things that the honourable Minister has stated, that dredging has not been done in two years. Branches of all sizes are lying there, overgrown grass, no clean-up campaign. The honourable Minister spoken about the efforts to mitigate this. So, I am asking a simple question, by when? Is there a timeline, is it going to be done next week, next month, next year or after the election? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for asking a very important question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only for Rakiraki, I think for the towns in the Western Division that are prone to flooding. One thing that we have emphasised to the Administrators of the Councils is to start preparing before the wet season or the cyclone season starts. So, what they have done now, they have also got the Council in a small way, they are cleaning and clearing up drains. I have also said in my response, they are also clearing some of the big boulders and rocks that are stuck in some of the major drains to stop the diversion of the flow of water. I have also mentioned that the desilting by the Ministry of Waterways was going to happen by December 2024. But the Councils, not only in Rakiraki, they have also gone into clearing the drains as well as other areas that affect the flow of water when floods do happen. HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on average of four floods in a year, I think it is too much for a small town like Rakiraki. I know at some stage there has been some talks about the realignment of the river. My question to the honourable Minister is, how far has these talks have progressed? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also one of the ideas and strategies that came up during one of the consultations that I had with the residents, as well as the people around Rakiraki, the idea of diverting the Nakauvadra River. I think it is a good idea but it needs more detailed planning, even something similar to the works in progress at the Nadi River where the engineers have also come on board to start coming up with more economical and more resilient strategies, instead of river diversion we can put some water retention near to the river source so that when water flows downstream, at least there is a minimal flow of water during a heavy down pour during flooding. So, talks are ongoing, and we are also engaging with other NGOs to help the Ministry come up with a very practical solution. If you look at dredging, dredging alone is a very expensive exercise. If you do dredge annually, you are going to a dry up our resources. So, we need to come up with a very practical, a long-term solution that can not only addresses the issue of flooding in Rakiraki, but also the other towns around our country. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, one of the major problems, not only in Rakiraki Town is about the development being conducted within the municipal boundaries. The unfortunate thing is, there is no risk assessment done on pre and during developments and this is one of the major contributing factors. What is the Ministry considering to address this issue? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Thank you honourable Leader of the Opposition for asking that question. I think it is a very important question. Maybe I will just a good example of a project that I have just issued a stop construction order, that is the development done by Grace Road in Yalalevu, Ba. I must thank honourable Bala for flagging that to my notice. These are some of the things in the area of development, some of the very important process like having a good assessment done on EIA report, even during one of the meetings with the Chamber of Commerce in Ba, they also highlighted some of the places in Ba that have been prone to flooding for more than 40 years.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1924</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 When the Ministry does the assessment on the application for any development, we also take that into consideration - the flow of water, the connectivity of the drains that leads to the major rivers and these are some of the infrastructural challenges that we also take on board especially when the Town and Country Planning and the Council does its assessments. I think it is very important that all these are done and maintained to ensure that any developments done without proper vetting, proper checking of all these infrastructural improvements will lead to more disasters, more problems when we have flooding issues in the future. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his response. I will just make a comment before I will come to my question. In terms of river dredging, we have seen past governments doing river dredging, but we have noted that it is not really working in Ra, flood continues. I am asking if the Ministry can consider other options. I am thankful that the torch is going on in rediverting the Nakauvadra River to follow the Naqoro River. My question is on the market vendors in terms of flooding, especially when they come from the interior and the coastal areas. Is the Council looking for a solution to solve their problems during the rainy season because what I have heard is just focusing on big businesses? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one of the challenges faced by the market vendors with water seeping into the market during a heavy rainfall. I am also happy to say that this year, we will be doing some improvements to the adjacent market because there were some engineering shortfalls that we had noticed even before flooding. When there is a heavy downpour, the water seeps down to the ground floor and affects the place where our market vendors are selling at the moment. But in this financial year, honourable Member, we had allocated close to $300,000 to upgrade the roofing as well as the structure that is going to stop the seeping water flowing down to the level where the market vendors are selling. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019 a Dutch Disaster Risk Management Report came out and it clearly stated that there is a building in Rakiraki that is actually the cause of the trouble. It also highlighted that dredging is a solution and it suggested that eco-based solutions should be used in the upper catchment area so that siltation is less. How much of that report has been implemented or have you considered eco-based solution as a way of solving the current problem? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the dredging issue is not only focussed on Rakiraki, we are also taking the lead from the work that is required to upgrade and resolve the issue at the Nadi River. We have also been having consultations amongst the Ministry on the best way forward because even things like dredging, if we do that every year, it is also very costly. We need to come up with ideas where we can actually manage the flow of water downwards to the riverbank or downstream. That has been one of the things that has also been raised by one of the engineers to do some of these strategies near the river source up the catchment area so that we can maintain or reduce the overflow of water downstream. MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Member is still not satisfied with that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Waterways used to give a small grant to the small municipalities to clear their drains, et cetera and this grant is no longer there. Can the honourable Minister talk to the Ministry of Waterways and have this grant reinstated? I think it will help the small municipalities (they do not have much revenue there) look after the drains. MR. SPEAKER.- They have reinstated the Drainage Board.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1925</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Now the Drainage Board is not responsible for drains:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this is within the town boundaries. The Drainage Board looks after the drains outside the town boundaries. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think some of the basic services that used to be carried out by the Council were removed by the previous administration. This is something that we are trying to bring back.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> For repairs in the Councils, if there is an issue regarding their drains, they do not go to the Ministry of Waterways or if there is an issue with streetlights, they do not run to the FRA, they report their complaints to the Councils. This is something that we are reviewing right now and hopefully before the end of this month, something should be confirmed on reverting of some of these basic services to the municipalities. MR. SPEAKER.- Remember, most of these drainage within the municipalities, they still have not been handed over to the Ministry of Waterways. They have only been deemed to have been transferred and come under their responsibility. In that, there is a breakdown in who will be responsible for all these drainage. Once we iron that out, then we fully understand where we should be focussing on and who should be the one doing the focussing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- I think it should be given back to the Council:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, like you have in Lautoka. When there is a deluging and all of a sudden it is flooded, but the Waterways people are not responsible, and the Local Government are not fully responsible as well. In the meantime, that part of the city is flooded, that is near the Coronation Church, down to Morris Hedstrom (MH). Foreign Workers’ Working Conditions in Fiji (Question No. 218/2024) HON. K. V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations Update Parliament on the working conditions of foreign workers in Fiji? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. All employment related legislations which include the Employment Relations Act 2007 and Health &amp; Safety at Work Act 1996 apply equally to both foreign and local workers, thereby protecting the rights and welfare of all individuals in the workforce. My Ministry is tasked to ensure that all employers comply with the minimum standards. Awareness sessions are conducted together with workplace inspections nationwide. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2021, the Ministry has received a total of 165 labour complaints from migrant workers. Of these cases, 159 have been resolved while four are still pending with the Employment Relations Tribunal and two are under investigation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst these 165 migrant workers, 46 were employed in the wholesale and retail industry, 121 in building, construction and civil engineering, nine in the informal sector, seven in the manufacturing industry and two in the hotel and catering industry. The Ministry has</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1926</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 recovered a total of $54,337.34 as arrears of wages for these migrant workers. To enhance the welfare of migrant workers working and contributing to the Fijian economy, the Coalition Government is currently undertaking a review of legislation. This review includes the extension of coverage of foreign or migrant workers, particularly seafarers, who are not covered under the current legislation. The Government is also reviewing the Immigration Act to strengthen the work permit process and the development of the Fiji National Labour Mobility Policy Framework and Strategy in collaboration with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government through my Ministry is dedicated to ensuring decent, sustainable and fair labour practices promoting a safe, healthy and supportive work environment for everyone which enhances overall productivity and wellbeing. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, this question relates to exactly what you have just spelt out and also to a statement that you made this morning in the news with respect to the standard of workers that are entering the country. It is relative in terms of the employers being compliant. Are we ensuring that our missions are being used, are we setting in train some kind of standard when we actually bring these workers into our country because we must remember that our workers have set high standards, and this is why they are in high demand in other countries off-shore. Are we actually setting standards and our missions being used to ensure that we get the right people that can cover the standards in Fiji? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been occasions where we have received complaints from employers that the skills level do not match the certificates that have been forwarded to them by the agents before recruitment and these creates a number of problems. First of all, the employers are very unhappy because the skills that they were expecting are not there, not possessed by the worker and then they redeploy them and when they are redeployed, the workers complain about the reduced wages that they are paid. Some have ended up with the Human Rights Commission that have been referred to us and we are now dealing with the agents to ensure that the certificates that they come with are actually genuine. Some of these labour-sending countries actually have Government agencies that deal with labour mobility from their country, export of labour and we are encouraging employers to deal directly with those agencies. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently it was in the news that some of our workers were mistreated and abused. What sort of support has your Ministry given to those workers, and how will this be addressed? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just explained that we receive complaints and we attend to them immediately. Monitoring and Controlling Schools Fundraising (Question No. 219/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on how the Ministry monitors and controls fundraising in schools? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just get a clarification from the honourable Member, is this fundraising related to school or any fundraising?</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1927 HON. H. CHAND.- I am talking about fundraising that is done in school? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- For school purposes?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> Yes, by the schools.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.:</span> Still not clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because as we note that a lot of fundraising have been held in schools. That is why I wanted to ask and clarify whether the fundraisings are for school activities or for the school or any other purpose? HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is about fundraising that is done in school, by the school, for the school. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the simple answer to that as he might be fully aware that the conduct of fundraising by schools, in schools, for the schools are clearly documented in the School Management Handbook regarding the purpose, approval process and post-fundraising activities. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think my question was not answered. The reason why I have raised this question is because it is very important for the Ministry to monitor fundraising, which is done by schools, so that the parents and students are not forced to raise funds, or they are not levied. That is the very reason why I asked that question. My supplementary question is, are there any limitations on the number of fundraising that schools can do in one year? MR. SPEAKER.- Is that not covered in the Handbook, honourable Member?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.:</span> It is there, Sir. He is fully aware, but I will just read it out for the benefit of the honourable Members of this House. Fundraising is only permitted for very special circumstances as per Ministry's regulation, and only one fundraising per school per year is allowed in the school premises. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, are you aware of any incidents where school fundraising is being done to supplement teachers’ wages? Carefully answer that, Sir. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just ask the honourable Member to clarify which particular year is he referring to?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> This year, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.:</span> Sir, for the year 2024, 83 schools from the 916 schools - 178 secondary and 738 primary, within the nine education districts, have been granted approval to organise fundraising. The purpose of fundraising is for: • • • • construction of additional classrooms; purchasing of building materials for the construction of quarters; building sickbay for the wellbeing of the children, considering, the geographical locations of villages, settlements and workplaces; upgrading of school playground;</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1928</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 • • • • • • collecting funds to construct multipurpose hall at school premises; completion of pending school projects; raising fund for the ablution block; purchasing of additional resources for school libraries and science labs; paying for school lunches for students in need and supplement PTFA project-needed funds; and upgrading of the schools' equipment, sporting resources and coaches - the supplementary ancillary staff, to name a few.</p><h4>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to present A case study before I can present</h4><p>question to the honourable Minister. There is a school in Lautoka in the Western Division…. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, this is question time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Yes, Sir, I will come back to the question.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Could you go straight to your question? HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question to the honourable Minister is, is the Ministry aware that these fundraising activities are placing additional financial and emotional pressure on parents and students, especially in rural and low income communities? What steps will the Ministry take to ensure that no child or parent is put in such a position in future? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I enlighten this House, again, on the process of request for fundraising and, hopefully, will be able to answer his question. The request to conduct fundraising is on voluntary basis or scenario, and fundraising must be approved and co- signed by the Head of School and the school manager, and this is directed to the Divisional Education Office, who verifies the requests before sending them to the Ministry of Education Head Office for the approval. The documentation to request fundraising, Mr. Speaker, should include the objective of the fundraising, the project for which the funds are being raised and the projected amount, and an explanation as to why the Free Education Grant is unable to accommodate the project, the date of the proposed fundraising, the safety and medical provisions on site, the type of fundraising and confirmation that any fundraising will be on a voluntary basis or voluntary contributions. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Minister is aware and the whole of Fiji is, in fact, aware, that grants have not been given to the schools in a timely manner. Government says, “ paisa nahi hai ”, and fundraising has been used now to basically be a form of income for the schools. Students who cannot contribute to the fundraising, there has been cases of teachers neglecting them and they feel left out. My question is, how is the Ministry addressing that? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Sir, I would like to invite the honourable Member, if he is free, to come and visit our office to shed some light. As I have said in the last point that I had raised, the confirmation of any fundraising will be on voluntary basis, so that should answer your question. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, I think the honourable Minister is not aware, but there is a circular given to one of these primary schools and it says, “Each family will be given a $2 a vote card to raise funds for the school. After completing each card, the family can volunteer for more cards from the office”. I can pass this to the honourable Minister, Sir, but maybe he could get his facts correct as well.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1929 MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps, you may extend your invitation to honourable Lal. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Maybe, we can request the honourable Member to advise us as to who has been texting him about that. Update on the Northern Development Programme (Question No. 220/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the Northern Development Programme and its impact on stimulating economic activities in Vanua Levu? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Northern Development Programme (NDP) is probably one of the most successful programmes that was launched by the previous Government, and we are continuing it. Since its inception, there has been an investment of over $13 million since 2008, covering 2,755 business ventures across sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and the manufacturing sector. Of course, it focusses on the North, Sir, but one of the things is that the grant is unique because it actually provides for a 45 percent loan funding on the grant - allows for a loan grant of 45 percent and 10 percent contribution from the applicant. Perhaps, the reason why it is so successful is because similar to the Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRPP) grant, because of the accountability and the contributions made by the recipient, it seems to have gained a lot of attraction. One of the most influential lending partners has been the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), Sir, and which has allowed contributions to the North over the last three years. In fact, we have invested about $1.5 million in grants and securing loans of about $2.4 million. We see the value in supporting MSMEs in the North, and let me just to share some interesting facts, Sir. Based on recent visitations, there is about 95 percent success rate recorded in the NDP. Our Monitoring and Evaluation tells us that every MSME we support in the Programme creates about three jobs. Essentially, our investment, if you look at it in total since 2008, has created up to 8,200 jobs and contributing to about 39,000 livelihoods. On average, one recipient can earn close to $13,000, which varies by sector, and we have also noted the shift from informal business ventures to a more formalised compliant entrepreneurial real ventures in agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to share one successful story from the grants and this is the case of Ms. Meena Gounder, who started with only 100 layer birds with the assistance of NDP and has now grown her business to be one of the key suppliers of eggs in the North. Of course, her example has broken all gender stereotypes, triumphing the course for women but business in general. As you can see, Sir, the grant, at this point, I think certainly from the Government side with the renewed resurgence, I think economically in the North, this grant is actually proving more and more popular and more and more sustainable. It is no secret that Damodar investment in the North is close to completion, there is also Parmod Enterprises, Vinod Patel and Namena Plantations, that are investing in the North. In our estimation, there are about eight investments, earning about $44.5 million that are under construction at the moment in the Vualiku and, of course, there is the much anticipated opening of the Ramada Encore by Wyndham, which is significant because it actually</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1930</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 signals the first branded property in the North, which will actually mean, as the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation knows, when the Sofitel was launched, it created a momentum of branded resorts as a catalyst in those areas, and we are expecting similar momentum in the North, Sir. In fact, there is already one big name sniffing around in Taveuni as we speak. Of course, the Grand Eastern Hotel too is expanding, which is positive. In the North, at the moment, at concept stage, there is about $142 million worth of investment that is, sort of, already in the pipeline and this covers real estate, tourism, construction and commercial buildings. So, in a nutshell, the grant, as I have mentioned, has been quite positive in its contributions. The Ministry continues to exhaust all funding that is allocated to this grant, and we will continue to seek more as we move along. But, overall, Sir, as you can see, not only is the grant popular but from this side of the House, the North is starting to boom, and we will see significant growth in the next three to four years. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in answer to the North booming, do not forget the West started it all. Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that the NDP is so successful and, especially, there is a lot that can be done with respect to agriculture, are we doing the handle-hold exercise with respect to exports to the markets that we know we can supply to? I know for a fact that a lot of pathways that were opened with Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF), we still have not utilised. So, are we getting new people to do these things in the North because they seem to be a lot harder working than some of the other ones in the mainland? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Member is aware, we do teams that do assist in terms of facilitation of pathways for export, and that still continues. At the moment, there is a bit of a focus on the kava industry for the obvious reasons that I have mentioned in this Parliament. In fact, what I can see is, with a growing economy, there will be demand for more manpower in terms of supporting some of these initiatives and that is something, I guess, we will have to cross at the next Budget. But, yes, the support that we continue to give to kava and other agricultural products continues, and that is also overlaid by business training and other types of training that is required, Sir. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to see that the NDP is moving forward. Thank you, honourable Prime Minister and honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Can you clarify how the NDP has addressed infrastructure and logistical issues that could potentially hinder economic activities and also noting the high fares of Fiji Airways? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Lal makes a very good point. In my view and certainly the view of this side of Parliament, the North is the next economic frontier of Fiji. And you will have seen something that was initiated by the previous government which was the World Bank funding of US$200 million. What will happen, Sir, is that a lot of that funding will go towards infrastructure and actually assist the concerns of honourable Lal. The honourable Prime Minister has negotiated with China on some additional roading. At the moment, I am in deep discussion with a certain potential hydro operator, Sir, in Taveuni, to electrify Taveuni fully on hydro and then maybe, look at supplying Vanua Levu. So, these are the type of exciting opportunities, Sir, that exist and if we set the right base, Vanua Levu can be as big as Viti Levu in terms of economy and land size and, obviously, the quality of the food and fish is second to none. To answer honourable Lal’s question, yes, the Government is focussing on infrastructure because as we all know, without infrastructure economic development is futile.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1931 HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister, the infrastructure, I think, is a good answer, so thank you. But in terms of making sure that all of the businesses in the North, are they also being assisted in terms of digital enhancement and upgrading so that they can be the next supplier of what we need around the world? I know that necessary digital infrastructure have been set up but are they also getting the training to make sure that they are digitally-savvy? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will put that in the work-in-progress category. Firstly, at the moment, as you may be aware, Telecom Fiji Limited is building fibre from Seaqaqa down to Savusavu and then eventually from Seaqaqa to Nabouwalu so that will open up the ability to communicate in terms of digitally. That is one priority. There is always challenges with digitisation in the North, so there is still a bit of hand holding at the moment that happens from our Ministry in terms of request, but hopefully over time, once the infrastructure gets built, Starlink is now starting to get available as well Sir. These are tools that might help with the digitisation process. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the two main contributing factors to the success of the Northern Development Programme are training and monitoring and evaluation, because applicants undergo eight days basic training, monitored, and then they do another package, considering the growth to take them to the next level. So, how is this being considered in the Ministry particularly with the other SMEs that you are doing? How effective is your training and monitoring and evaluation so that the success from the Northern Division can also be replicated in other divisions? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The recent statistics that I have seen shows that the effectiveness is not too bad and by that, I think from recollection the success rate was around 83 to 85 percent in a nationwide polling, but Vanua Levu seems to be high. We have quite an extensive Monitoring and Evaluation team that does work on the ground to monitor closely. One of the things that we also do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which I think helps with these projects, is that there is a lot of initial training before even a grant or assistance is brought into play. For example, there is a desire to form a co-operative, there is a series of trainings that happens before, and that is done specifically to ensure that when the grant funding comes, that there is an understanding of what it means. In a broad sense, Sir, the funding is quite effective and we will just continue to monitor it to ensure that we continue to get the best results from the money that is coming from our taxpayers. Reduction of Soil Erosion and Coral Reef Rehabilitation (Question No. 221/2024) HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament if the initiative to replant trees on riverbanks to reduce soil erosion and use mangroves aimed at contributing to coral reef rehabilitation, is still being pursued? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- I can confirm that these initiatives are, indeed, still being pursued by the Ministry. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. One of the initiatives that we used to carry out is litter collection around urban areas, we use to hold it on Wednesday afternoons at 2 o’clock which used to be physical training also for Ministry of Fisheries</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1932</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 and Forestry. The timing was so that it is conducive for school movement when the children coming on buses returning from schools so that they are aware of the litter problems. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if that is something that he plans to do in the future. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the Ministry is undertaking a programme to assist in addressing a question that was raised by the honourable Member, we will make time to allow for that initiative to be integrated with the current programme that the Ministry is undertaking now. Pathways to Pursue Rugby as a Career (Question No. 222/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports update Parliament if there are pathways in place for students who wish to pursue rugby as a career after having participated in the Fiji Secondary Schools Rugby Deans Competition? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just before I answer that question, allow me to congratulate the Fiji School Boys under 18 that made history in the weekend by defeating the Australian Schoolboys by 26 points to 14. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank Professor Broughton, who is in the public gallery with Mr. Rajesh Singh this morning and Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Ltd for putting together Fiji's bid for the NRL franchise. Last but not the least, I congratulate all our weightlifters who participated in the recent 2024 Commonwealth Championship here at home. They made us all proud and we wish you well in your future endeavours. Mr. Speaker, Sir, reference to the question raised by the honourable Member, I wish to highlight that there are a few pathways in place that allows or gives opportunities for secondary school players. The most prominent pathway is through the Fijian Drua set up. Due to its elite nature as a franchise team. The pathways into Drua involves the following path: Drua under 16 Academy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year in August, the Fiji Rugby High Performance Unit established under 16 Boys Academy. There are 30 spots for Drua Under 16 Academy with all players selected from the Dean's competition from all over Fiji through talent identification, talent taking and talent processing. There is also a $2000 support allowance per annum for each player. In this structure, players will go through a two-year processing phase where the best at the age of 18 years, will then be chosen to be part of the Drua Development Programme with a starting salary of $10,000 to $15,000 per annum. Progressing from the Drua Development Programme will be the players selection into the Drua professional contract, starts at a base salary of $40,000 per annum. High Performance Unit Academy for men and women. Mr. Speaker, the Fiji Rugby High Performance Unit Academy for men and women players also select players from the provincial competition with ages ranging from 17 years to 23 years. Most of the selections for these cohorts are from the schools throughout the competition using our long-term athlete development plan. Under this plan, there are 60 contracted players for men and 30 contracted sports for women. The players selected from schools under these programmes Under 16 academy and the LTADP have opportunities to progress further into men’s Fiji Under 20, Fiji Warriors, Fiji Men’s Sevens Team, Fijian Drua and the Flying Fijians. For women they have the opportunity to progress further to the Fijiana 7s, Fijiana 15s and the Fijiana Drua. This pathway model has been a successful factor in the establishment of the Fijiana Drua Programme in 2021 with 80 percent of players in the initial Drua setup coming through the</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1933 pathway. The Flying Fijians Rugby World Cup Team of 2023 had 60 percent of players that have come through the school’s pathway. Overseas Schools Scholarships, Mr. Speaker, the above setup or pathway in the Fiji Rugby System also focusses on lead talents from our domestic schools. It does not restrict or control the best talents in all schools being offered rugby scholarships in New Zealand, Australia and Japan. Some of our best talented players through secondary schools that go across progressed further to universities and to the different franchises of the countries that offer scholarships of this nature. The same concepts apply for players from schools that offer academy contracts with premier clubs all over the world. The same process for professional franchise applies. Semi-professional pathways, Mr. Speaker, under the semi-professional pathways, school players are offered engagements with clubs, mainly in Australia and New Zealand where they are playing part-time with work. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the above are the current pathways for secondary school students looking to use rugby as a career opportunity. However, further to the above, a review of the Fiji National Sports Commission is approved by Cabinet earlier this year will be conducted soon. This review will ensure that a clear sports development pathway is established for all sports, not only rugby, in the country and more importantly the establishment of the Fiji Institute of Sports to coordinate such developments. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response talking about development in Fiji. One of the key problems is perhaps the governance. Milo Kaji has its own organisation. Fiji Secondary School Rugby Union has its own organisation, and Fiji Rugby Union, there is no connection. This is something that hinders development in the country for rugby. What is the Ministry considering together with the stakeholders in order to sort out this issue? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for pointing that out, that is something that we have noted and that is why we are doing a review of the Fiji National Sports Commission to try and line-up all the structures that we currently have with rugby being sort of distributed and not focussing as one effort. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that you will accept this question because the honourable Minister talked about Fiji Rugby League and he raised the report.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- New question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> No, no, he mentioned it in his response so this is why I am asking this question. There are a lot of issues, Sir, concerning Kaiviti Silktails. There is money given by the Australian Government to developing rugby league in Fiji, but it has been alleged that this funding has been abused or misused. What is the Ministry's plans on looking at this so that it can work together with the Fiji Rugby League? So, that it can also develop the sports Fiji? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Thank you honourable Leader of the Opposition for highlighting that. At the moment the Fiji Government has supported NRL for its bid for the NRL franchise, which I have mentioned in my speech, it has been documented by the Broughton and we are so thankful that they have done that. It will create pathways for our local talents to be showcased overseas in the international arena, something that Fiji will need.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1934</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 Yes, for your question regarding Kaiviti Silktails, it is something that is beyond our hands. It is something that Mr. Petero Civoniceva approached the NRL, and it has nothing to do with our Government but we are our trying our best to talk to both parties on how they can work together Fiji NRL and Kaiviti Silktails because they are looking after the same course and talents we have locally, and how they can channel that to be showcased at the international level. I thank you for your note on that. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be a Member of Parliament, to be behind a uniform or to play, to wear the national jersey, it is a matter of national pride. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the youth have reached out to me, youth that play rugby who aspire to play for the Fiji team have spoken about what has been happening with FRU and the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports has not said anything much about it as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youths are discouraged to see what is happening with FRU in terms of the payments and the allegations that have come up. What is the Ministry doing to mitigate this sense of discouragement among the youths in order for them to actually have national pride and play for the country? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 29th June, there was a Special General Meeting. The Fiji Rugby Union has removed the Prime Minister's nominee from the Board of Trustees of Fiji Rugby Union. At the moment, the Government does not have a say in running of the Fiji Rugby Union, but we believe that with the trustees that are in place, a current board of trustees, which was appointed by our government, are doing their work. They are professional people. They will be able to work out something for the future of rugby in Fiji. And on top of that, the AGM is already planned for November, where unions can voice their concerns, members of the Fiji Rugby Union can voice concerns at the Annual General Meeting. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I tend to agree with what was raised by the Opposition. There seems to be a disconnect in the role of FRU and the role of the Government, especially your office, honourable Minister. When the honourable Prime Minister, same as the previous Prime Minister stepped in to make statements that are kind of challenging, as well from the Government’s perspective, they offered to build someone’s house, the Captain of the Sevens Team. It was not really fulfilled by the then honourable Bainimarama, but it was fulfilled by the honourable Prime Minister Rabuka when he offered to pay $20,000. There is disconnection from your good office, Sir. We are not paying for that! You mentioned here that you are not paying for the $20,000 that will be given to the Seven-a-Side. Here, there is a bit of disconnection that is causing all these. I will give you the floor to make your reply because rugby is part of us. You remember the days when we used to play in Lautoka, it is part of us, but when there is an initiative being done or undertaken by the Government and to say we are not going to be paying for that, you are speaking from your own Ministry of Sports, Sir, allocation of funds according to your budget. But this is coming from the honourable Prime Minister when he has mentioned that we will pay $20,000 per player, that has been done. That is the only concern, I fully agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition. There is some kind of disconnection, then all of a sudden, we do not know where to pin the thing to FRU or the Government or Ministry? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, may I clarify the money that was promised to the Fiji Sevens Team has been paid, the $20,000. MR. SPEAKER.- That statement was made by the honourable Prime Minster and you refuted it here, saying we are not going to be paying for that. We do not know where the $20,000 is coming from. I am trying to get back on what I stated earlier on, and the honourable Prime Minister sent me</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1935 to present the jerseys to the Seven-a-Side Team in Dubai. That is the disconnection that is being highlighted here, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.:</span> Sir, I take note of the issues raised.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, this is definitely an interesting discussion that we are having. So much of skills are around and we are very proud of our sports, but the only challenge that I see, often the decisions are made by adults – how the sports, which direction it should take? I think in the review exercise which the honourable Minister just mentioned, it is extremely important that consultations should take place with the players who are already complaining about so many things. That will only entice our young ones to take rugby as a career, because they do see rugby as a career, it can generate a lot of money, but the other side of the coin is, when the career is over, money is over. How are we going to manage the financial aspects? When the going is good, how do they do the investment so that when they are not in rugby, they can still lead a proper life? My question was that - review! (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. SAUKURU. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, just responding to honourable Premila Kumar’s statement, we are about to call for expression of interest for the setting up of that review team. That is where young people from all walks of life can come in and participate, have a say in how we want to build sports in Fiji. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact that the IRB issues directions with respect to interference with Fiji Rugby Union. What will you be proposing in terms of how to handle the current situation because it will require some kind of government investigation, et cetera into it to see what has actually happened without treading on IRB’s toes. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, just to respond to that question, World Rugby has made it very clear they do not want Government to interfere in Fiji Rugby Union’s business. But yes, of course, the Fiji Government has been pouring a lot of funds into rugby house in supporting rugby as our flagship, sort of marketing our small Pacific Island to other parts of the world. They have been doing successfully. Yes, we will talk to them when it is right. At the moment, the plate is quite hot, because the players are showing and coming out with their frustrations and the trustees are trying to come to terms with that. But we will surely talk to them when the time is right. As I have said, we are really concerned about the position of World Rugby and we would like to be watchful of that situation at the moment, but we will certainly come in when the time is right. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that calls for a suspension of our proceedings now so that we may have lunch and then we will return when the bell is sounded at 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.32 p.m.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1936</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.40 p.m. Maintaining and Repairing the Railway Network System (Question No. 223/2024) HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry update Parliament on the progress of maintaining and repairing the railway network system that was damaged and is no longer in use? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can hear my voice is not right. So, I do not expect</p><h4>any supplementary questions.</h4><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Can you leave that for me to decide? (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I came into the Chamber, someone asked me, “are you sick?” There are two versions of being sick. One is sick then I am a Sikh. I do not know which one to answer? But having my wife as a doctor, she knows that I am very sick, so she gave me this medicine today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Pillay asked a very pertinent question about the railway system. But before I answer him proper, I will tell you one thing, as I was having lunch at home (I normally have lunch at home) …. MR. SPEAKER.- What are you doing?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- I had a nice lamb curry:</span></p><p>(Laughter) Mr. Speaker is talking about lunch. I had a nice lamb curry cooked by my wife with chutney. The railway system in this country has been there for 140 years under the CSR government. What happened in 2019, the FijiFirst Government signed an agreement with a company called Farer Group Pte. Limited to run the tramline between Nadi and Vuda and they were leasing the tramline for only $10,000 a year. Then in 2019, they also re-signed another agreement from Nadi to Cuvu for $20,000. That system never worked, today, that company Farer has sued FSC for $31 million and that case is before the Court. Here FSC is struggling to survive, how can this type of agreement be signed under the last government.” HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Very poor!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Fix it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Fix it, no! Who will fix it but you have to pay for it.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1937 I tell you one thing, this is the biggest litigation in the history of this country. MR. SPEAKER.- What was the question raised? The railway? HON. C. J. SINGH.- I am simply saying, Sir, where are we heading now? (Chorus of interjections) I will answer, take your time. What has happened? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address the question raised by honourable Pillay regarding the progress of maintaining and repairing the railway network. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time he has said that. I can also say to him that he choro everything from his family. If he wants to continue that, I can also say that, but I want to say that stop saying all those nonsense. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Sit down!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You are not the Speaker:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Carry on, honourable Minister. HON. C. J. SINGH.- First and foremost, I appreciate that inquiry as it demonstrates the concerns of the sugar industry. However, I must highlight that my time in Government has been significantly shorter than the 16 years of the FijiFirst Government if they had addressed those pressing issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me take a moment to consider the current state of the tramline network, a total of 482 kilometres of railway across our mills, only 384 kilometres remain operational. Let me explain the breakdown: (a) Lautoka Mill has 225 kilometres, 135 kilometres operational (b) Rarawai Mill has 130 kilometres, 125 kilometres operational. (c) Labasa Mill has 127 kilometres, 24 kilometres in use. While these numbers indicate that any pursuit of our rails are functioning, we cannot overlook the fact that the substantial portion remains damaged and non-operational. Additionally, we are challenged by the outdated locomotives which are barely operational, along with the shortage of rail carts, all of which require significant funding to address. In the good old days, dating back to 20 years to 30 years when you were not born, delivery by rail were over 90 percent and this declined steadily over the intervening years. Even looking at the recent data from nine years, one can see the trend of how fast rail to trucks ratio is changing. In 2015, rail accounted for 21 percent of deliveries while trucks delivered 79 percent of the crops. The ratio has continued to shift dramatically in favour of the trucks with 7 percent of sugarcane being transferred by rail. This decline is not merely a statistic, it represents missed opportunities from the previous regime to bring back the rail system by investing in the rail network. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this Government, it is investing in railways infrastructure known to be cheaper and more efficient.

Areh, I am a farmer, I know what is happening. (Laughter) The previous Administration has taken the necessary steps when they were in power. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we may not be in a position today where the sugar industry requires a bailout from the Coalition Government. That being the fact and a history now, we have now recognised the urgent need for the restoration of the railway network. We are currently in discussion…. (Hon. R. R. Sharma interjects) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Listen man! Listen! We are currently in discussion with a reputable company from India to conduct the feasibility study on the railway system, while we will await a report from the Food Agricultural Organization as well. This is a very crucial step in our commitment to revitalise this essential transport network. However, our Government is very clear, that we will not make a hollow promise. No more hollow promise. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Our mission will be based on the findings of the study, and most importantly, of the needs and the desire of the farmers. In conclusion, while I appreciate the concerns raised by honourable Pillay, it is essential to reflect on the history of inactions that has been brought here by us and by you people. We are committed to restoring the railway network and supporting our farmers, but this journey requires a thoughtful planning, collaboration, and without being directly impacted.

Is that within your budget to be able to do that within this parliamentary term? Most decent Members from that side will ask, apart from others. I know why, because, yes, the costing needs to be done. We are getting the people from India. They will come and assess the railway system on what is not operating and what is operating. And I tell you one thing, I was told that the railway system, this concrete with gravel, that has to be done and because it has sunk in so many places, that is why the trucks tilt over.

T. N. TUINABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: With the revival of the Rural and Outer Island Programme, can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on how the Ministry will implement this Programme to ensure maximum return on this investment? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for the launching of the new National Development Plan 2025-2030 of the Coalition Government, which sets the direction and platform for us, as we progress in building our beloved nation. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most, if not all of us, in this august House, would have spent time already in perusing the document. I am pleased that a chapter is specifically dedicated for the Rural and Outer Island Development, which stipulates Government’s planned strategic focus areas in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question at hand is with regards to one of the many programmes administered by the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, which is the Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all aware, the Coalition Government decided to revive the ROI Programme through the Ministry from January 2023. This revamped ROI Programme already undertook a thorough consultation with our key stakeholders, including key private sector components of society, during the formulation stage in order to understand the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities that exists in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry value chain system before mapping the pathway for the revamped ROI Programme. Understanding that value chain system is crucial, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that the revived ROI Programme is focused, targeted and based on statistical evidence that can holistically address the development issues faced by our rural communities for more than a decade now. Mr. Speaker, some of the key rural development issues that were identified during its consultation with key stakeholders includes farm access road, market access, communication network, transportation, water supply and the issues of climate change in terms of sea level rise and riverbanks erosion. The above development issues are also common in all Bose ni Tikina and Bose ni Yasana development forums. In addition to the above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, high rural poverty rate (36.5 percent), particularly with those associated with our subsistence farmers and rural-urban drift are the two major issues that the Ministry is currently working on closely with our key stakeholders to systematically address these issues through their various development programmes. At the same time, Sir, the Ministry is also mindful of those rural population that are living near the poverty line and are most likely to fall below the poverty line when faced with economic shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1941 Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the increasing demand and broad inter-related issues facing our rural communities, the revamped ROI Programme needs to focus on complementing the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry programmes, particularly on improving farm access roads, land preparation, market access, value-adding, and network connectivity. The above interventions from the overall objectives of the revamped ROI Programme and to ensure that our ROI budgetary allocation is focussed and addressing the real needs on the ground. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of Rate of Return on ROI investments, one of the expected outcomes of this ROI Programme is on improving productivity and increasing production, mostly targeting our subsistence farmers. This is crucial, given that expected increase in productivity will lead to increase in agricultural production and increase in income which, in turn, contribute towards addressing rural poverty due to the expected increase in the purchasing power of our rural subsistence households. The same principle applies with the Fisheries and Forestry Sector, targeting income generating projects. This ROI Programme also ensures that it contributes towards addressing food security and nutrition, which is a very important component of measuring poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure increased production and contribution from our rural farmers are realised, the Ministry is currently finalising its production and farming plan and will proceed soon with our ROI Community Awareness and Training Programme regarding their monthly targets and expected post-harvest annual returns. Helping our ROI farmers understand the dollar value of their post-harvest annual returns may provide that necessary motivation and drive towards increase in productivity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all our ROI communities' production and farming plans will be closely monitored by our Divisional Technical Working Group (TWG), chaired by our Divisional Commissioners. This TWG is expected to closely monitor our ROI communities’ production and farming plan and address any technical issues that may arise. An Advisory Committee comprise of key government stakeholders and Permanent Secretaries will also be established to address those value-chain issues that may arise from the TWG discussions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has noted the importance of the Programme sustainability, thus all our ROI farming communities will be incubated for the next three to five years, to ensure their targets materialised as planned, whilst there is expected results achieved in terms of improved standard of living and reducing poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to measure these results, the Ministry will proceed with the profiling of these ROI farming communities in order to have some baseline statistics on their current living standards, income levels, and their goal for the next three to five years. The above baseline data is also crucial for the evaluation of the Programme’s effectiveness in the next three to five years. The above are the new initiatives that this revamped ROI Programme introduces to ensure sustainability, scalability, and with the future expectation of being self-sufficient and reduce their over-dependence towards Government assistance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2023-2024 financial year, the ROI Programme, in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, has constructed a total of 22 rural farm roads at a cost of $2 million. This includes the construction of 75.5 kilometres in the Northern Division, 16.9 kilometres in the Western Division, 5.9 kilometres in the Central Division and 5 kilometres in the Eastern Division. These rural farm roads when strategically constructed, does not only give access to farmers, but enables women to reach markets as vendors, children now travelling on proper roads, infrastructure to school, and the elderly are able to reach the nearest postal agency to access their social welfare benefits.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1942</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the intention of the Ministry is to ensure that all rural communities are connected to road infrastructure through the strategic construction of rural farm roads. We understand the limited budget constraints of Government and the limited machineries available with the Ministry of Agriculture, to ensure all farmers receive a fair share of infrastructure access. As the coordination Ministry for rural development, a total of 22 contractors with road infrastructure machineries were approved by the Government Tender Board. Having more contractors accelerate the construction of rural farm roads, this indirectly increases competition for the private sector, strengthening Private Public Partnership and in return, a source of revenue for the Government in terms of generating tax, which is the multiplier effect of the ROI Programme investment in rural farm roads. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all rural communities have much expectation for the Coalition Government to facilitate improvement in livelihoods. In this context, the ROI Programme, in consultation with the Ministry of Forestry, procured four portable sawmills for each of the four Divisions to facilitate Scheme 3 of our Rural Housing Programme. This is a one-third and two-third contribution between the Government and communities that have available forests as their one-third contribution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that all in this august Parliament have realised the growing kava or yaqona, dalo, ginger and turmeric production in our rural economy. As we continue to explore markets globally, the ROI Programme has focussed internally by procuring food processing units to make possible the growth of niche markets through rural processing hubs. This directly connects farmers to locally created markets and generates economic activity widely, and employment creation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are already existing farmers that are driving the agriculture sector in all areas, heavily reliant on manual labour. Our coordination role with the Ministry of Agriculture at the divisional level through established technical working group highlighted earlier, has guided the ROI Programme to procure and supply farming implements, such as ploughs and harrows, to these farmers. One may argue that we are duplicating implementation, however, the objective is to complement and supplement technological and machinery support to farmers wherever possible, to improve agricultural production and its contribution to GDP which was once a driving economic sector of the nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, rural communities have evolved globally due to the growing rural subsistence sector, and Fiji was once a leading economy in the Pacific region - we have lost the prestige. The ROI Programme and in communities that are beneficiaries of the project, will be formed into cooperatives to drive economic activity. The pilot initiatives are undertaken in Vatulele and two communities in the Bua Province, with technical support from the Ministry of Industry and Trade and Department of Cooperatives. The key objective is to strengthen savings for the members with controlled loan based on clearly defined bylaws. The Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is thankful to the increase in the budgetary allocation for the ROI Programme from $2.5 million in 2023- 2024 financial year to $3 million in the current financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is determined to achieve the objectives of the revamped ROI Programme which is an important component of the Coalition’s National Development Plan, as well as the Ministry’s vision of inclusive development for production in resilience communities. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, it is good to see the ROI Programme in action. But with respect to the outer islands, one of the most critical components in it would be Government shipping and our shipping that is able to get those new vegetables, et cetera, all the things that our outer islands can do. So, with that particular programme, has there been, or will there be some more</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1943 consultations for the transport and Government Shipping Services (GSS), et cetera, with respect to being able to bring those goods into the mainland or for export, et cetera? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for the question. At the moment, our focus is on trying to unlock the potential in assisting market access and where we are able to assist with transportation, we will certainly discuss that, in co-operation with the line Ministry which is the Ministry of Transport, so we can consider that. I believe there is a review of GSS which is currently being undertaken at the moment under franchise. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. What is the difference between the ROI Programme that the Ministry is currently undertaking, compared to the one that used to be offered by the Ministry of Agriculture? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past when the ROI Programme was held by or offered by the Ministry of Agriculture, they focussed mostly on the commercial farmers. But the focus of the ROI Programme now is working with those having traditional ownership of land which is 54 percent of agricultural land, and we are leaving the Ministry of Agriculture to focus on the commercial side, while we work with those who operate other traditional ownership which is 54 percent and which is, at the moment needs to be unlocked in order to have contribution to the GDP as I mentioned.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Progress of Fiji’s 5G Readiness (Question No. 225/2024) HON.
