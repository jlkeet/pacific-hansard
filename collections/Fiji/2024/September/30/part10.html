<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your interest in the workings of your Parliament. Standing Committee on Social Affairs – Savusavu Town Council 2011 Annual Report For the information of all honourable Members, I have approved the request from the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to refer the Savusavu Town Council Annual Report for 2011</p><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1909 and 2012, to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. This is to allow efficiency through the even distribution of the workload. Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 Honourable Members, please, kindly take note that I have received legal advice that by operation of Section 11(1) of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014, the new Determination made by Parliament on 24 th May, 2024, which was published in the Gazette on 30 th May, 2024, had superseded the 2020 Determination. As a result, the 2020 Determination had been effectively revoked, and the 2024 Determination has established that the current salaries is at 100 percent effective from 1 st August, 2024. You are now on 100 percent. You all seem to be looking at the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.</p></body>
