<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - NADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - NADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Nadi Town Council Annual Report for the year 2016 which was tabled on 4 th September, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the review report of the Nadi Town Council Annual Report for the year 2016. The Nadi Township was established in 1947. The electoral system was introduced in 1967 by Dr. A. H. Sahu Khan, who was the first elected Chairman of the Nadi Township Board. With the introduction of the Local Government Act in 1972, the Board Chair, the status of the Council was H. M. Lodhia, who became the first Mayor of Nadi Town Council in 1972, and remained Mayor until December 1973. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nadi Town Council being one of the oldest municipalities, and known for actively contributing to the tourism sector in Fiji. The potential for investment has been optimistic and this foreign investment has led to an increase in development and in population as well. The Nadi Town Council is therefore, embarking on a proposal for an extension of its own boundaries to cater for the increasing population, and to continue with the necessary processes of declaring Nadi as a city.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1945 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the year 2016 was the year that affected most people in Fiji, and Nadi was no exception with a widespread diversification and loss of life, all the infrastructure and the environment. The Committee noted concerns raised by the Council in its key findings, particularly, the constant flooding of Nadi Town. As part of the Committee's recommendation, the Committee had highlighted the following: (1) The new design of Prince Charles Park to be in line with international standards so that it can attract international events and tournaments; (2) The Prince Charles Park to be renamed King Charles Park; (3) The Council to work closely with the local Government’s Committee and key stakeholders in the process of extension of its own boundaries to be included in the Nadi Municipality for better service delivery; (4) The Ministry of Waterways is to reinstate annual grants to maintain an open drain and manhole within the municipalities; (5) The Council to continue working closely with the general Government and other donor partners in terms of the Nadi Flood Alleviation Projects; (6) The Nadi Town Council is to seriously identify a suitable dumpsite for the ratepayers of Nadi and to save costs in terms of transportation to Lautoka; (7) The reintroduction of Challenges Fund to the municipality to assist in the identifying of capital projects, such as a leisure park, multipurpose court and the development of Wailoaloa picnic spot; (8) All efforts to be made by the Council to collect outstanding rates in terms of house-to-house visits, face to face meeting with ratepayers, Small Claims Tribunal, and the last resort, to take defaulters to court; (9) The Council needs to work closely with all relevant stakeholders to declare Nadi Town a city; and (10) The Council to replace all the old lollipop metres in the pay and display parking metres to generate additional revenue for the Council. Once again, the Committee would like to thank the Ministry of Local Government for their timely submission in response to the Committee's recommendation. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee’s recommendation is aimed to enhance the infrastructure, Government and service delivery of Nadi by aligning Prince Charles Park with international standards and renaming it to King Charles Park. The Council can attract global events and elevate the Town's profile. Collaborating with key stakeholders to extend the Town boundaries and improve service delivery, reinstating the annual grants for drainage maintenance and work on the Nadi Flood Alleviation Project, are crucial steps towards sustainable development. Identifying a suitable dumpsite, introducing the Challenge Fund for capital projects and implementing effective strategies to collect outstanding rates will further strengthen the Town's operation efficiency. Additionally, declaring the Town as a city and upgrading parking metres will generate additional revenue and improve urban management. The Committee looks forward to the successful implementation of these recommendations which will significantly contribute to the growth and prosperity of Nadi. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have also got a list of speakers that have been sent by the respective Whips. There will be three speakers from the Leader of the Opposition and his designate and there will be none from the G-9 Bloc, and there will be three speakers from the Government as well.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1946 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 The batting will be led off by honourable Koya, followed by the honourable Minister for Local Government, honourable Hem Chand, honourable Minister for Justice, honourable Joseph Nand and then it will be rounded off by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member and also the Committee for the Report. I think, Sir, Nadi is a very important part of the whole of Fiji’s tourism industry. It is a Report that needs to be thoroughly discussed and there are some very pertinent issues that have been raised in the Report which need to be highlighted, and I am hoping that the Ministry of Finance is actually listening so they can assist Nadi Town Council in getting things done. Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest problems that is actually faced by the Nadi Town Council, it has been an ongoing issue for many, many years and apart from the one that we all know about, which is flooding. It is the one that we forget. Every single town or municipal place in Fiji pretty much has its own place where there is refuse collection and the rubbish, et cetera that gets dumped in proper places, Nadi Town does not. It has not done so for many years, and I see within the Report it says that they are actually actively pursuing them to find a place where they can actually build one. We must look at this as an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is an opportunity where we can talk about recycling. We talk about proper refuse being looked after and done properly so that we are not actually harming the environment. But this is an issue that has been at the forefront of literally every government since the 1970s and it still has not been resolved with respect to the rubbish that actually comes out of it. I will give you a case in points and examples of how bad it used to get and I am hoping that it is not the case at the moment. Nadi Town also houses particular villages right next to it. Unfortunately, previously the Councils would never use to pick up rubbish from the villages so it actually used to end up in the river. That kind of stuff should not happen in any city or town that we have. So, I am hoping that these things are actually addressed. It is quite commendable also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that within the Report, Nadi Town has actually collected 92 percent of its town rates. They only have 8 percent remaining in arrears for that particular year. Now, it is a growing municipality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You can see with the development that has occurred from the airport right through to Denarau, and it is a different kettle of fish from any other town or city in Fiji. And I think that needs to be capitalised on, because what happens now, there is a separation. If you look at the road that actually comes from the airport all the way to Denarau, then you go to the left when you come pass McDonalds and come towards town, there is chalk and cheese difference. We have left the other part that leads into town in complete disarray. So, it is things like that, that the Council needs to look at, the Ministry of Finance also needs to look at, FRA needs to look at, to ensure that we do the right thing, as it is the first point of contact, hoping for a million tourists who actually come through Nadi Airport to move to other parts of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also look forward to the day that Nadi Town becomes a city, and I am sure that is not far off, but if you want to become a city, the necessary infrastructure needs to be right also. I know there are serious problems with respect to sewerage, with respect to water, I know there are serious problems with respect to flooding etcetera which we are about to go into hurricane season and that is something that needs to be accelerated, so that we can actually deal with this problem. Nadi Town residents are very resilient people but at the end of the day, it is the problem that they face on a yearly scale. Mr. Speaker, Sir, garbage as I said, is an important issue that they needs to be looked at. Sewerage also, it is a growing city and there are many large companies that are actually housed there</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1947 plus we have a whole lot of tourist workers that are housed there. And it is now, as of a couple of weeks ago, we see it as a destination where you are going to have huge concerts etcetera that will happen and we need to have the necessary services available so that, that particular place can be one of the highlights of being in Fiji. The hospital itself also needs to be upgraded. We need to look at Nadi as we do Suva, as we do Lautoka – it is actually a port, but we do not, we seem to be riding rough short of all of this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Flood Alleviation Project, I know the Japanese Government has been very actively involved in it, I am not sure how far its actually progressed, but I am hoping that it is done at a better speed than it is up until now. With the Fiji Roads Authority, honourable Minister for Public Works and Transport, and I hope you will pay more attention to it also, and one of the most important things for tourism towns is to ensure the cleanliness of the town. I see in today’s newspapers, the Nadi Chamber of Commerce President, reporting about Touters, et cetera, who are harassing tourists. All of these things need to be addressed. The re-establishment of the Nadi Tourist Police, I am not sure if that still exists, maybe it was a good thing, it is a good thing, maybe that needs to be looked at and I see that the honourable Minister is not here but that is something that needs to be looked at. With respect to the re-naming of Prince Charles Park, now its King Charles Park, there is one thing that is forgotten, and I hope I am not wrong, Sir, but I am hoping if I am corrected, this names not forgotten within Prince Charles Park, the actual stadium was named A. D. Patel Stadium. In my travels within and out of Nadi, I have not seen that name, it has actually been removed. It would not be an honourable thing if we removed the name and did not put the name back on to the Stadium because it is for someone who was part of our history and has done a lot for this particular country and that name should remain on that particular stadium. I am hoping that they put it back on but I know it was removed and I see the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance looking at me like that. Please, have a look and check it and I hope that that actually and still remains as A. D. Patel Stadium, as it has been there from many, many years. He is an important part of Fiji’s history. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know there are several weaknesses that are within the Council in terms of rate collections, they are facing delays now and also within the staff, but I think with the upcoming project of elections or local elections, that some of the problems that can be solved after the elections, but that is something that needs to be looked at urgently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing is, we must also turn that city or town into a town that is compliant with all the sustainable development goals, as I have said, it sits at the forefront of our tourism industry which earns us the most amount of dollars. We need to make sure that all councils update their policies and procedures, so we are actually lean and mean at the end of the day but we are clean. Traffic is a huge problem which still has not been resolved. I think also what needs to happen is that in terms of the council and auditing, regular audits and performance evaluations, they really need to happen within Nadi Town Council. I think these are issues that have been raised by the Committee and these are the issues that need to be at the forefront, and I am hoping that the Ministry of Local Government will look at Nadi Town in a different light, because it is one of the first ports that anyone sees when they visit Fiji. It is our tourism town, it is our next best city about to become, we look at Namaka, Sir, it is phenomenally good and all of that area, but it is the town area that needs to be seriously looked at. I support the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I grant you the time to speak honourable Minister, just let me acknowledge honourable Members, those present in the gallery now. On the right are familiar faces, renowned personalities in our Government - Mr. Parmesh Chand, Mr. Mesake Nawari, Mr. Mark Halabe. I am sorry I have missed out the lady. On the right are our visitors from abroad, even though we do not have the factual details of your presence here ladies and gentlemen, but we do acknowledge</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1948 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 your presence in Parliament. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before the House. Firstly, I would like to thank the Committee Chairman and its Members for doing a thorough review of the 2016 Nadi Town Council Report. Even though it is an old Report, it is something that we are trying tell the Ministry to make sure that all the financial accounts and reports are forwarded to the Office of the Auditor-General for audit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the past 25 months has been spent in my Ministry by instilling good governance in all the 13 Councils around our country. The first task that I assigned to the team of new Special Administrators in January this year was to get the Act of the Councils in order and this should be achieved by first bringing all annual reports and accounts in order. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform Parliament that all the 13 Councils have committed to completing the pending financials and have their accounts ready for audit by the end of this year. As of today, approximately 37 accounts have been submitted to the Office of the Auditor-General, whilst 50 financials are being prepared and ready for submission to the Office of the Auditor-General. That is something that I had said earlier, something that is lacking in most of our Municipal Councils, except for one, which is Rakiraki Town Council is the time they are taking to prepare their financial accounts as well as get their accounts audited by the Office of the Auditor-General. Based on the Report submitted by the Chairman this afternoon, there are about 10 recommendations, and these are very important in terms of development at the Nadi Town Council as well as Nadi Town in addressing some of the very pertinent features of the Council. It is a tourist town, and we want to maintain the standard to ensure that we keep Nadi as one of the tourist centres, as also was a tourist town in our country. First, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the design of Prince Charles Park, which the Committee has highlighted the need to re-design the park to ensure that it can attract overseas teams and also up to international standard. I remember a year ago when there was a trial game done by the Super Rugby where the Drua played against the Rebels. It was a good turnout, even though it was a trial game. The Council is working on trying to upgrade, uplift and also design the current Prince Charles Park. Also alluded to by the Chairman is the need to also change the name to King Charles Park because of the change in the monarchy. That is something that the Council has also written to the British High Commission as far as protocol is concerned, to give them some confirmation on the changing of Prince Charles Park to King Charles Park. Another very important recommendation is for the Council to work closely with the Local Government Committee and key stakeholders in the process of extension of its town boundary and to be included in the Nadi Municipality for better service delivery. I think that was done in 2018 where the town boundary was extended, and the Council must now focus on providing adequate services to the newly included area. It is also worth noting, Mr. Speaker, that any further extension to the boundary will be done after the upcoming Local Government Elections. The Ministry is committed to ensuring that future expansions serve the best interest of the Council and its residents in enhancing service delivery and ensuring equitable development across Nadi. The Council to work closely with the Government as well as donor partners in terms of the Nadi Flood Alleviation Project. I think this is a very important exercise and a very important activity for Nadi. For so many years now, Nadi has been under water due to flooding caused by heavy rain</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1949 downpour. There is also a plan in place, in collaboration with JICA on further engineering works that need to be done to alleviate the problems Nadi Town is facing, that is from the effects of flooding and even heavy downpour. Another issue is the relocation or identification of a suitable rubbish dump. At the moment there is none for the Nadi area. In July this year, Cabinet has reviewed and endorsed a proposal for a new landfill project in the Western Division. Something we need to seriously reconsider right now because there is a need to have a good wasteland system in place to look after the waste that is produced by all those municipalities within the Western Division. The importance of the re-introduction of the challenge fund, the municipalities to assist with the identification of capital projects such as leisure park, multipurpose court and the development of Wailoaloa picnic spot. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the quality in introducing a challenge fund is one matter that we take very seriously. This fund previously supported the Municipal Councils in delivering capital projects such as leisure parks, multipurpose courts and also some smaller sports like the one at Wailoaloa. While the challenge fund will not create new processes for personal identification, it will centralize funding allocations, providing a streamlined approach to support these initiatives. The Ministry encourages councils to continue submitting their project proposals for the public sector investment project process to ensure capital needs are met and the requirements, heavy infrastructure as deemed necessary. Another key area that was also highlighted is the need for the Council to review or to relook at the collection strategy to collect outstanding town rates. Town rates is one of the key drivers. It is one of the very important income drivers for the Council. It is very important that they have practical as well as a good strategy in place to collect more rates from all the outstanding rates. Various collection methods have been suggested such as house-to-house visits, face-to-face mediums as well as even encouraging wage earners who have fixed employment to do direct deduction so that payments are made weekly to the town council and also to avoid arrears. Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, those accounts that are hard for the Council to collect or exhausting, they will be exploring legal avenues to try and collect these hardcore arrears. And also, the Ministry has also amended the Local Government Act to help arrears from 11 percent to 5 percent as well as changing the interest methodology from compound interest to simply interest. This is solely to assist ratepayers who are facing financial hardship to pay up their rates at the Council. The issue of the Council to work closely with all the relevant stakeholders to declare Nadi Town a city, I think we all aspire for that but before Nadi can be declared a city, there are some important elements of development that needs to be complied with. That is something that the Ministry is also exploring with the Council on the way forward for this. Lastly on the lollipop metres, something that the Council had just changed recently. They also acquired display parking meters. If you have been to Nadi Town recently, you will some newly installed digital parking metres. This is one of the strategies the council has undertaken to try and improve the income stream of the Council. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a collaboration of planning and unwavering commitment to the people. Those recommendations highlighted by the Committee highlight some of the critical areas of focus and assure the august House as well as the Ministry of Local Government will continue to work tirelessly to support Nadi Town Council, and all stakeholders involved. Mr. Speaker, I fully support the motion before the House.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>1950 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 MR.
