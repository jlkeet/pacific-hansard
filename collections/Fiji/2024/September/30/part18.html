<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT  -CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF FIJI 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF FIJI 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports which was tabled on 3 rd September, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Civil Authority of Fiji (CAAF) is an independent statutory authority established under the CAAF Act 1979. The main objective of the Act is to establish a CAAF with functions related to civil aviation and matter incidental thereto. It provides for the establishment of a regulatory framework for maintaining, enhancing and promoting the safety and security of civil aviation in Fiji, with particular emphasis on preventing aviation accidents as well as incidents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the operations learned posed by COVID-19 pandemic, the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji has implemented several measures to comply with the pandemic related to restriction while ensuring the continuity of its operation. The former Committee had undertaken a site visit to CAAF office and had public consultation with senior CAAF officials. Furthermore, the Committee noted the concerns raised and identified recommendations to better address its funding. The Committee recommends the establishment of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Office for the Pacific Small Island Development State in Nadi and for being awarded the ICAO Council President Certificate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee's recommendation, the Committee has highlighted</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>1968 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 30 th September, 2024 the following: (1) The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to expedite the Civil Aviation Bill to amalgamate the Civil Aviation Act 1976, the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Act 1979 and the Civil Aviation Reform 1999. (2) The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to fulfil the current vacant specialised position at the earliest. (3) The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to strengthen its skills framework, policies to enable them to recruit suitable, specialised personnel with suitable positions and benefits. (4) Government to urgently rectify the three International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aviation Security International Convention to better address aviation security issues namely: (a) Beijing Convention, (b) Beijing Protocol and the (c) Montreal Convention (5) The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to set aside emergency funding to cater for the future unexpected pandemic such as COVID-19. (6) The timely submission of CAAF’s Annual Reports to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji for the measures implemented during the pandemic and acknowledge the other achievements attained. The Committee anticipates the successful implementation of the recommendations provided in this Report. MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate and I have a list with me. As usual it will alternate between the Opposition and the Government. The batting will be led by; (1) Honourable V. Pillay; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; (3) Honourable F. S. Koya; (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises; and (5) Honourable J. Usamate. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to address the Consolidated Review Report of Civil Aviation of Fiji (CAAF) for the years 2021 and 2022. As we dwell into the findings of this Report, it is crucial to emphasise the recommendations made by the Committee. These recommendations are not mere suggestions, they are vital steps towards enhancing the operational effectiveness and strategic direction of our aviation sector. While we acknowledge the hard work of CAAF, we must also be candid about the short comings that remain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has rightly highlighted that while CAAF is dedicated to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals, there is an urgent need for more substantial action, initiatives like the use of remotely piloted aircraft systems for medical supply deliveries are commendable. However, they must not be seen as isolated success, but as part of a broader commitment to improving health access and connectivity for all Fijians, particularly in remote areas.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 1969 Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report underscores CAAF’s role in promoting quality education through safe air transportation. This is a crucial area where we must improve, especially regarding increasing female representation in aviation roles. We must take concrete steps to create pathways for women in our aviation sector. The report also raises concern about the sustainability of our aviation practices. While Airports Fiji Limited has plans for photovoltaic solar initiatives in their master plan recently launched, we must push for further enhancements. I urge them to consider the installation of solar power, pilot activated lights and runway lights are essential for airports and airstrips like Savusavu, Taveuni, Kadavu and Lakeba. These initiatives would not only ensure safe operations, but also increase night-time accessibility significantly benefitting our remote communities. Importantly, while the operations of these airports fall under Airports Fiji Limited, it is through CAAF that approvals and regulations are made. By adopting this enhancement, we can elevate safety standards across our airports and strengthen the overall civil aviation industry in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the operational challenges, the Report indicates while the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) has had some positive outcomes, competitive salaries from airlines continue to be a significant issue for staff retention. We cannot ignore this challenge. The JEE has improved job satisfaction, but unless we address the salary gaps that lure skilled personnel away from CAAF, we will face ongoing staffing shortages that jeopardise our aviation standards. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report reveals a pressing need to expedite the modernisation of our aviation legislation. The draft Civil Aviation Bill must be prioritised, delays in this area could hinder our compliance with international safety and security standards, putting our aviation sector at risk. We need robust regulations that reflect global best practices and CAAF must lead the charge in this endeavour. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to commend CAAF for the successful outcome of the Universal Security Audit Programme. This reflects positively on our security measures, however, we must not become complacent. The aviation sector face ever evolving threats and ongoing collaboration with relevant agencies is essential to maintain our security post. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we examine the Corporate Plan for 2021 to 2023, it is clear that CAAF aims to be a model aviation regulator. However, we need to ensure that this vision translates into actionable outcomes. The plan emphasises stakeholder engagement and continuous improvement in safety and security, yet these initiatives must be rigorously followed through to ensure tangible results. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also like to reference the Nadi International Airport Master Plan 2024 - 2033 which outlines 18 projects aimed at accommodating future growth. While upgrading facilities is crucial, we must ensure that these plans are integrated with the operational needs highlighted in the Committee's recommendations. For example, the proposed photovoltaic solar initiative and must not only enhance energy efficiency but also align with our commitment to sustainability. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speak, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs Review of the CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, CAAF is making significant strides in addressing the Standing Committee’s recommendations. Ongoing legislative reviews, recruitment drive efforts, policy updates and international convention ratifications are enhancing Fiji’s aviation sector. These measures ensures</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>1970 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 30 th September, 2024 that Fiji complies with the International Aviation Standards fostering safety and security within the civil aviation operations. The key legislative framework guiding CAAF include the Civil Aviation Act 1976, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Act 1979, Civil Aviation Security Act 1994 and Civil Aviation Reform Act 1999. These laws empower CAAF as Fiji's aviation safety oversight organisation responsible for fulfilling international aviation obligations, especially in line with ICAO standards. Effective oversight of aviation in Fiji strengthens the nation's ability to maintain and expand its flight information region and international air routes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently Fiji boasts an ICAO audit of 76.3 percent, well above the Asia- Pacific region's average of 65.5 percent and the global average of 69.4 percent. So, we are tracking well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If I can highlight some of the responses to the recommendations tabled by the Parliamentary Standing Committee: Recommendation 1 The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to expedite the Civil Aviation Bill to amalgamate the Civil Aviation Act 1976 and Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Act 1979 and the Civil Aviation (Reform) 1999. The response from CAAF is this, Mr. Speaker, the Civil Aviation Bill 2024 Draft Three is currently under review by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. Following this review, the Bill will progress to the Solicitor General's Office for further legal assessment and refinement, and we aim to bring it to Parliament in the first quarter of 2025. Recommendation 2 Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji to fill the current vacant specialised positions at the earliest. Mr. Speaker, Sir, CAAF has been actively recruiting to fill vacant positions. Out of the 77 established roles within CAAF’s structure, 70 positions have already been successfully filled. The remaining seven are expected to be filled with the next six months. Meanwhile, to ensure uninterrupted service delivery, CAAF has contracted overseas consultants. As I have highlighted in this House many times, finding and keeping these highly specialised people is a continuing challenge in aviation, but we have had some measure of success. As highlighted here in the meantime we use overseas consultants. Recommendation 3 Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji strengthens its Scarce Skills Framework policies to enable them to recruit suitable specialised personnel with suitable positions and benefits. The response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is CAAF is currently working on enhancing its scarce skills framework policies. These updated policies aim to attract and recruit specialised personnel, by offering suitable positions and competitive benefits. Now, this is a tough call, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, as soon as they are qualified and experienced, our neighbours grab them, so it is quite a challenge. The improved process are projected to be implemented by the fourth quarter of 2024. We are investing in continuous training and development and leveraging the Pacific Liaison Office by ICAO to help in growing the capacity HR. Recommendation 4 Government to urgently ratify the three ICAO Aviation Security International Conventions, to better address regional security issues namely:</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 1971 (1) The Beijing Convention; (2) Beijing Protocol; and (3) Montreal Convention. In response, CAAF is advancing the necessary processes for the Government’s ratification of the three ICAO Aviation Security Conventions. This will enhance Fiji’s ability to address aviation security concerns in line with international standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in short, CAAF is doing very well and is highly respected in the Asia-Pacific Region. Twice now, Fiji has been asked to Chair or Vice-Chair of some high-profile aviation conferences. As you know, I chaired the one in Dubai on CAAF/3 which is the Civil Aviation Alternative Fuel, and two weeks ago in Delhi, I was Vice-Chair on the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference. The Chair was Ram Mohan Naidu, the Minister for Civil Aviation in India, I was the Vice- Chair. There is a recognition of Fiji’s position in aviation in the Pacific. We were fortunate that day at the closing, honourable Narendra Modi came to close the Conference. Tourism is flourishing. As highlighted by our honourable Minister for Finance, the forecast of growth had been increased upwards to 43.6 percent, and being driven by tourism. Aviation is very critical to tourism. I assure the House, the Coalition Government is committed to supporting civil aviation by extension, supporting our tourism industry. I support the findings of the Committee. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee with respect to the motion before the House on the Report of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji 2021 and 2022. The Civil Aviation Authority is a hugely critical component of our nation’s infrastructure. The importance of ensuring that Fiji is actually compliant with international standards, particularly those that have been set by ICAO sits at the forefront. Civil Aviation, we must realise that it is not just the means of transportation, it is actually one of the pillars of our national development. It is a driver of our tourism industry, it is a lifeline for connecting our communities, and also connecting our global communities. The strength of that sector has actually got far reaching implications. The Report is timely, and I think it is important that there are some sections that have already been dealt with. Honourable Gavoka is correct, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji has moved on in leaps and bounds and done a fantastic job. I think it is a testament to the actual leadership, and the current CEO also, Mrs. Levestam, who is actually doing a fantastic job with it, Sir. The recommendations that have been given by the Committee are there to enhance the effectiveness in the strategic direction of CAAF. What we must realise, Sir also, is that with civil aviation, we have to continuously look at our compliance with respect to the standards that have been audited by ICAO. Critical elements required by ICAO for Aviation Authority is to achieve compliance is what we need to look at. I think that also comes out in the Report. We have had successful audits that have been carried out, as the honourable Minister for Tourism actually spelt out now, we are about 70 percent with a tick off. We must remember that that is great, but the rest of the 30 percent that we have not, we will need to ensure that we do. It is critical because it is significantly to do with security and concerns identified within the aviation industry that need to be looked at and the positive outcome reflects the effectiveness of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF). Now, the successful audit also indicates a healthy position with respect to the security posture for Fiji and it enhances our reputation in the aviation industry. That is why we continuously get asked</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>1972 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 30 th September, 2024 to chair meetings and honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is now, I think he has done it twice, one which I attended with him, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, Fiji has a very, very high place in the space with respect to civil aviation. But we must continue to ensure that we keep that. Now, to do that also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are recommendations in the Committee's Report which are quite valid. It is important also that we now have an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) office, a liaison office based in Nadi which was recently opened, that enhances our Fiji's access to ICAO expertise and it is actually tailored for our regional needs. We also need to ensure that we look at the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) exercise that has happened, we have an issue with respect to staffing. As I mentioned earlier on, it's not just one industry. This is another industry where our staff are extremely good. They get headhunted, we lose them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is not good. So, we need to ensure that we are competitive. We need to ensure that we do capacity building, competitive in terms of salaries, et cetera, all that kind of stuff. Our information and communications technology (ICT) upgrades need to also be at this particular level, because you are talking about civil aviation. But the most critical component now, and something that the Office of the Attorney-General, and I know he very short staffed, but this is something that needs to be looked at, is the legislation. It really needs to be brought up to speed and up-to-date, and I think if it requires us to get assistance even from offshore to ensure that we get our legislation right with all of the Acts that have been spelt out by the honourable Minister, it is important that we do that. I think there is a Review of the Civil Aviation Bill. I think three different Acts that are actually being looked at. I know CAAF is also working towards rectifying some ICAO Conventions. Mr, Speaker, Sir, I think that also needs to be looked at. What it really does it only enhances our aviation security and compliance with international standards. Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure, but correct me if I am wrong Honourable Minister, the implementation of ICAO's Global Air Navigation Plan means that we must invest. We must invest in modernising our Traffic Management Systems, it is critically important that we do so. Otherwise, what it does effectively it then affects our compliance standards, our airspace which we actually do considerably well out of, that also needs to be managed with modern technology. Also, the other thing is we have such great development partners, and these are the areas that we need to look at with respect to us making sure that we never lose that status, that we have around the world. We must ensure the highest level of security, safety and efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also, I think we must take our hats off to how CAAF has operated COVID and post-COVID, we have kept ourselves afloat and done a fantastic job, so hats off to all those that are actually part of CAAF. It is imperative that the Government acts urgently to do these things that I have mentioned. There are some gaps in the compliance issues that have been recognised, and the Honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation has recognised those things, and I think it needs to be addressed and I think these increased investments in aviation security and safety. We need to also see if we can allocate more resources to CAAF to ensure that it can actually recruit, train and retain the specialise personnel that the Honourable Minister just spoke about. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, our Air Traffic Management and Navigation Systems ensure safe and efficient management of our airspace using the satellite-based systems and our radar coverage that we have. But I cannot say this enough, the regulatory framework and the strengthening of our legislation is required and the amendments that are required with respect to the existing laws</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 1973 and new legislation has to be done on a very urgent basis. One of the other things that we must realise is that regionally, the region looks up at us and therefore we also have great regional partnerships and we must leverage with ICAO to ensure that these partnership is successful and other aviation bodies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all that is in place, and I am actually confident that we can achieve. It will be fantastic to do so, we can achieve ICAO full compliance as the Report has spelt out, what is needed and what is not. There are other issues that needs to be dealt with, and just on a quick note before I finish off. We have a booming voice on the other side who continues to come out and I think something he said about 16 years, I just want to remind him, and I have a list here and I could go on. The honourable Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs and Communications keeps saying, but let me remind you, Sir, that we did the: (1) New Ba Hospital; (2) Navosa Hospital; (3) Navua Hospital; (4) Nakasi Health Centre; (5) Waimaro Health Centre; (6) Rotuma Airport; (7) Nausori Airport; (8) Rakiraki Market; (9) Nausori Market; (10) Namaka Market; and (11) Vunisea Jetty. Really, you do not want to hear it, but I am going to say it. We did the: (1) Valelevu Court House; (2) Valelevu Police Station; (3) Nakasi Police Station; (4) Nadi Police Station; (5) 52 new bridges; (6) Laqere Market; (7) New Fire Stations at Nabouwalu, Nakasi, Korovou, Taveuni; and (8) New pavilion at Albert Park. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did the: (1) New renovated Nadi Airport; (2) New Nadarivatu Hydro Electric Dam; (3) Somosomo Mini-Hydro Dam; (4) New Hibiscus Highway; (5) Under sea connection from Ovalau to Motoriki which was done for providing solar electricity; (6) Four lanes from Suva to Nausori; and (7) Four lanes from Nadi Airport to Denarau to Martintar. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I could go on, so for once honourable Minister, please, let go of the 16 years because I can stand here for half an hour and go on the list of what we did. Thank you very much Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Report.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>1974 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 30 th September, 2024 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk about civil aviation, between me and the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, we share a passion for civil aviation and tourism because we did spend a bit of time working in that industry. But before I go there, I think the other side of the Parliament is getting too sensitive. The reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that whilst they did a lot of good things, and you have heard me acknowledge them here for doing the good things, but there are a lot of things they did not do well too. So, there is no need to be so sensitive, the fact is, there are certain things that were not done well, and we are going to fix them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to start off, when honourable Gavoka took over the position of Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, two of the great things he did immediately. One, for the first time the board of CAAF has now become a very professional board. It was led by, and I would also like to acknowledge the late Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya, who was the first Chairman of the Civil Aviation Board, this is upper echelon when it comes to Civil Aviation. In their Government, the Board was not of high-calibre, and we did that because we knew how serious civil aviation was for Fiji. The second thing we did, and complements to the honourable Minister, we confirmed the acting appointment for the Civil Aviation Authority, Mrs. Theresa Levestam. She was acting whilst she was operating from the other side and the honourable Minister within a few months confirmed her as the first woman CEO of the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji. Again, someone who is very capable, and so right now, in terms of white board governance, the Civil Aviation stands as a beacon, I think to the Pacific. In terms of the quality of Board, in terms of the quality of CEO and the quality of management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just coming back to the Report that is before us in terms of the 2021-2022 Annual Reports. Firstly, I acknowledge the work of the Standing Committee in reviewing the Annual Report. Of course, we do have to commend the Board and management of CAAF for their tireless efforts in progressing the civil aviation sector. As directly pointed out over the COVID pandemic period, which was a challenging period for us all and particularly aviation. The civil aviation sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir does play a critical role in our country which is obvious and the fact that we now have a very high calibre Board and a high calibre CEO talks to how this side of the Parliament views the civil aviation sector and how we will ensure that we continue to support them in the years ahead. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key highlights in terms of the Report in 2022, they started earning a profit again up to about $5.9 million. Alot of that came from the departure tax, but again a positive development, which means we have an organization that is self-sustaining, that can actually run on its own two feet and can invest into the regulatory body as appropriate. Also in 2022, CAAF was awarded the International Aviation Organization Council (IAOC) President Certificate, acknowledging the oversight in terms of safety. There was a successful completion of universal security audit. There were no significant concerns identified, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and something the honourable Minister worked on was the establishment of the International Civil Aviation Organization Pacific Small Developing States Liaison Office which was opened in Nadi quite recently. Again, this strengthens our position in the Pacific and strengthens our Civil Aviation Authority in the years ahead. Mr. Speaker, Sir, like any other organisation there are some key challenges, there is continued shortages in technical staff, and I certainly agree wholeheartedly with the Committee that CAAF</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 1975 needs to continue to strengthen its scan-skills framework and recruit suitable personnel as required. Also pleased to see they have recently completed their job evaluation exercise. Of course, this is a step closer towards attracting better skilled personnel on attractive packages. I am told that they are advertising for the relevant expertise that we cannot locate locally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also pleasing to note, that CAAF continues to invest in its capacity building and training for its staff and we support that wholeheartedly in terms of its importance to maintain a high level of safety and security in terms of aviation. In fact, prior to 2022, Fiji had only one ICAO certified auditor but now CAAF has four certified officers by ICAO, the international body. Which again, attaches to how this organisation continues to develop and again I would like to congratulate the CEO and her management Board for their contributions today. On that note, I support the motion before the Parliament. HON. J. USAMATE.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the time to talk on this particular Report. First of all, I would like to congratulate the Committee for the work that is being done and putting it together on an organisation that has been very critical for Fiji. The importance of CAAF is something that we know about, the importance of aviation safety in the globalised world that we live in today, aviation is very important. And as the Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation had said during post COVID, tourism was our saving grace and behind that fact, was not only due to that Government but also to the things that we did before they got there. Over and above that, I noticed, that when the Minister for Tourism had said that CAAF is now well respected globally, that did not happen overnight. To get that kind of respect takes time. So, it is not only this Government, but it is the people that were there before, they put in the processes, they put the systems in place and as a result you get the performance that you, and as I have always said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you stand on our shoulders, we did the ground work for you, now you have to fly. So, stop complaining, stop talking about 16 years, get on with the job! So, great airports and aviation is absolutely critical. I would also like to share my comments about Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya. He is a person that I have met over time as an aircraft engineer, a quality management person, a person that is very involved in human resources development also at ATS and CAAF. And I think if you look at some of the things that CAAF has been able to do in terms of processes and so forth, I think it links back to the kind of people like Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya. People who are well versed with process engineering, with quality management, people who are expertise in this area. I think we have one sitting here, our industrial engineer, Mr. Mark Halabe, who is also a well-known exponent of fixing systems and processes, so they work well. It comes back to this point that I have said often again, fit for purpose, you have the right people in place they will move the bus in the right direction to get the kind of results that you need. I congratulate CAAF on some of its achievements, this council president certificate, I was reading about it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it shows that they have been successfully implementing the civil aviation organization regulations which is quite good because it has an impact on the recognition of our own Nadi flight information and also with this certification, it gives us some influence with the ICAO. Also, that we have this office in the pacific for the P-SIDS countries that we have here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed that they had a very successful safety audit and one of the things that I wanted to say, one of the good things about organisations like this they do not depend on their own audit they go for third party audits, so they do not compare themselves with their own standards but against international standards. If you look at organisations that have done well, this is what they</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>1976 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 30 th September, 2024 do, they look at their performance, they benchmark against others and they benchmark against international standards, that is one of the important reasons why CAAF has been able to do well and other organisations in Fiji can learn from this. In Fiji, over the past few years we have things like ISO 9000, we have things like ISO 22,000 about Food Safety, and so I think this is a general overset of how we can improve performance, this is something we need to pick up across Government, across our SOE’s, across Government departments, how we benchmark ourselves against the best in the world. And as the honourable Minister mentioned, CAAF has now got four ICAO international civil aviation auditors. That is good. What has happened now for CAAF, for international organisations they will get CAAF to audit, I think that is a process we can also use in Fiji for other sectors. We get organisations in Fiji to audit other sectors at the international standard and that will help us lift the performance that we need in this country. The challenges that have been faced by the organisation, CAAF faces continuous shortage of skilled and technical specialised workers as they seek opportunities abroad. I also, read the verbatim report and I noticed that even though they had job evaluations, the management said they did not really stem the loss of people. So, I am thinking that this is something that we really need to look at in terms of how to make sure we get the right technical, well, specialised skilled people. I think perhaps it is not something that we can do an organisation by organisation basis, but more on a sector basis. The aviation sector to look at the kinds of needs that we have in place to be able to continue to provide people with specialised skills. One of the things when you have skilled workers like this, you cannot learn it in an institution. There is part of it that is learned in an institution, the other part is to learn with people in an organisation or know how to do it. If you do not have that, then you are not going to get the development, the kind of people that you need. So, the shortages need to be filled, I think there is an issue here for the appropriateness of our training and development methodologies, not only within that particular sector, but across Government in the Higher Education Commission of Fiji, et cetera, to see how all of these things gel together. Perhaps the Government will need to look at how we incentivise people that can go into these particular fields, not just at an organisational level but also sectoral. There is a mention there about strengthening the skills framework to be able to recruit personnel with positions and benefits. I think one of the things that we have talked about in Parliament for some time, we also need to look at how we can attract people from other countries to come here. We need to have some sort of incentivization scheme because it will take a long time to be able to develop internally the kind of people that we need. So, hopefully the Ministry of Education and Higher Education Commission will start looking at that, how do we do that incentivisation so we can get people to fill up the skill gaps that we need across the country. I also congratulate CAAF, one of the things that we have in any country, when you start looking at your policies and laws, you tend to do it in a sort of a hotchpotch basis; you do something here and you fix it and over time you see you have all these little bits of legislation. I am glad to see that now CAAF is trying put all these into one legislation. This was something that was done in the Ministry of Employment a few years ago. We aligned about five, six, seven different laws to become one Bill and it becomes coherent, and it is in line with what is happening in international practice. One of the challenges I noticed in CAAF, when they started changing their Bills, by the time it went to the Solicitor-General’s Office and came back, ICAO had already changed some extra provisions. So, they were always one step behind. I think in all of these things in making sure that our Bills are up to-date, we have to also look at the Solicitor-General. We have seven drafters there, how can we</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 1977 fix that problem so that as entities begin to change their Bills, they are not delayed by the problems that exist in the lack of drafters within the Solicitor-General’s Office. All of these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is part of the process of making sure that we can continue to improve. Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to thank the Committee and congratulate CAAF for the excellent work that they have done over the years, what they have been able to achieve so far, it has been long way from 1976, from the time that they started and we hope that they continue to do well because they are absolutely critical for this country, not only for tourism but also for the country as a whole. I wish the organisation well and I endorse the recommendations of this Report. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a lot of deliberation on this issue in this august House and also on civil aviation for the implementation of our recommendations in moving forward. Sir, the Committee wishes to thank CAAF for anticipating and the successful implementation of the recommendations provided at an early stage which they are currently working on. On that note, Sir, I have no other comments on this motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
