<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements</h4><p>under Standing Order 40: (1) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; (2) Honourable Minister for Education; and (3) Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts. Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, we will then invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be the response from the honourable Leader of the Group of 9 –Bloc or his designate and may also speak for five minutes. There will be no other debate. Status of Timber Treatment in Fiji HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my statement on the status of timber treatment in Fiji. I am delivering this statement because the issue of selling sub-standard treated timber on the domestic market is a cause for concern and has become one of the critical national interest. Last month honourable Premila Kumar raised this issue in the media and so did the Consumer Council of Fiji, raising a crucial question on the role of the Ministry of Forestry in this regard. I must thank the honourable Premila Kumar and the Consumer Council of Fiji for raising this important issue</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1910</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 especially when we are faced with serious challenges relating to the incursion of the Asian sub- terranean termites. Mr. Speaker, as you may all know, the main purpose of treating timber with chemicals is to protect the timber from insects and fungal decay making it more durable and being able to last longer in service. Without treatment, many species of timber including pine will not be suitable for use in exposed and ground contact situations. Mr. Speaker, timber treatment therefore, substantially extends the service life of timber, particularly those with lower natural durability classes including a number of our native timbers and our main plantations species. It must however be noted that the treating of timber with chemicals is not compulsory. This is because some untreated timbers from species such as pine can be used without any problems for some specific end-users especially for non-load bearing and in fully protected situations and out of ground contact. Also, low grade timbers destined for boxing purposes are not normally treated. Mr. Speaker, at the same time, there are native species, the hardwood of which are naturally durable and do not need to be treated. So, in the market, one has a choice of purchasing either treated or untreated timber depending on one’s requirements. It is only when a timber processor elects to undertake timber treatment that the current legislations come into play to ensure that certain quality and safety standards are met. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Forestry currently regulates the operations of all timber treatment plants in the country as required under the Forest Regulations of 1992. As we speak, we have 29 registered timber treatment plants and so far, 14 are licensed to operate this year. These plants are licensed annually and are monitored on a quarterly basis. The monitoring of these plants focuses on operator competency, health and safety control where timber samples are located on a monthly basis for testing, looking at the concentration and penetration of preservative chemicals in the timber to ensure that these are within required standards. Mr. Speaker, different end-users have different levels of chemicals with assigned buildings including H2 which is used for interior use and is fully protected from the weather and not in ground contact. H3 for exterior use not in ground contact, H4 are posts which have low risk and in ground contact, H5 posts which are high risk and in ground contact, H6 posts and poles which are usually of marine use. All licensed timber treatment plants should have the appropriate branding gears which is low risk and ground contact; H5 posts which are high risk and in ground contact; H6 posts and poles which are usually of marine use. All licensed timber treatment plants should have the appropriate branding gears to enable them to brand their treated timbers, showing the treatment plant ID number, the chemical use and the hazard level to which the timber has been treated. One end of every piece of treated timber should be branded as described. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Forest Regulations 1992 mandates the Ministry of Forestry to licence and monitor the operation of timber treatment plants but does not authorise the Ministry of Forestry to ensure that timber users only buy timbers which are treated according to the legally prescribed standards. We can only advise and offer our assistance in the proper specification of timbers and in the inspections to ensure that the specifications had been followed. The Ministry of Forestry had been working tirelessly over the years carrying out awareness and training with timber retailers and hardware shops and using the radio talkback shows and the Nai Katalau television programme to educate and raise awareness to the general public. Mr. Speaker, Sir, consumers need to know and understand what they are buying for and what they need to ask retailers as well as seek in the specifications, the level of treatment and what hazard</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1911 level that timber is suitable for. As this issue of substandard timbers continues to be a challenge, especially in the face of incursion of the Asian subterrain termites, the Ministry is at the moment exploring the possibility of developing a timber marketing regulation to also oversee the operation of timber retailers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that treating timber with chemicals is not only part of the solution. Proper design of buildings and proper specification of building materials go a long way in ensuring that we are better protected, especially against the termites. I thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- I think the advice is very important, as we are trying to find a way in the timber market for the solution to enable us to get good timber. There is some advice, we from the islands, use coconuts a lot. Coconut is oily and it does not need to be treated. We have a senile tree that is 60 years to 70 years old, that is a good enough timber to take care of your timber needs for a new building. Maybe people are not used to it, but those are some of the sound advice coming from the honourable Minister for Forestry. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her deliberation this morning and highlighting the facts surrounding timber treatment. I think when we look back in the olden days, timber treatment was not available then. I remember correctly back in my village in Kadavu, the technology and the idea of timber treatment was not readily available during my young days. I remember even in buildings of Fijian bure, the villagers used to use the sandalwood tree as their posts. These posts used to be the one that lasts longest, yasi and vesi, because of their natural strength and hardness in the fibre that is made out of these. I thank the Honourable Minister for highlighting these facts because there seems to be confusion within our local population on the laws regarding treatment. I know that non-treated timber mostly are rejected by people in the rural areas thinking that the life span of untreated timber is much shorter than the treated one. But her explanation this morning basically means that there are other ways, as you have alluded to, Mr. Speaker, the traditional way of treating timber to make their life span longer. I remember in the rural islands they have been treating pine by soaking them in seawater for a week. The only difficulty in that is when they bring out to construct it is very hard to put nails through it. The timber pine basically hardens, and it is very difficult to use nails. It basically will need holes to be drilled and the use of bolts and nuts. Again, Mr. Speaker, she highlighted the different and the various types of treatment of timber. I think out of the eight types of treatment the main treatment is to treat against insects and termites. In my trips around Lautoka I found out the attack of termites and the destruction that is caused. I think, honourable Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and honourable Sashi Kiran have been in charge of a group that actually looked at this. I was in a wedding in Girmit Centre two weekends ago. It is amazing to see these termites when the light goes on 6 o’clock in the evening. They almost clog the lights that are hanging around the Girmit Centre where the wedding was held. But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed that by 9’oclock all the termites have gone. None to be seen. Now, I would like to ask, honourable Sashi Kiran if she can explain to me the fiasco on this habit of termites that not only in the Western Division but now it has moved to the Northern Division around Labasa. I understand from honourable Assistant Minister Sashi Kiran that they actually go underground. They creep to about 15 metres and then can come up in cane fields and actually eat into standing cane. So, it is a huge problem, but I thank the honourable Minister for highlighting the issue so that we can at least learn and be more informed of the different aspects of treatment of timber and the termites and insects that attack timber.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1912</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- It is very interesting, honourable Member. Maybe honourable Assistant Minister for Women can share what sort of oil she uses. I think that is a kind of repellent to those kind of insects. I now call upon the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the G-9 Bloc thank the honourable Minister for the very timely statement and advice on the issue and we have nothing further to add. TSLS Delegation to Sydney and Canberra HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members of Parliament and all those joining us live through the livestream across the globe and from the comforts of their homes; I thank you for the opportunity to present my Ministerial Statement on the recent Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Service (TSLS) delegation visitation which I led to Sydney and Canberra in Australia and the outcomes achieved. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be remiss of me not to mention that this is the first time that the Government, in this case, the Coalition Government has set budgetary allocation to visit sponsored students studying under the TSLS overseas scholarships in Australia and New Zealand and similar visit is done by other governments across the globe who sponsor students at universities overseas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the visit is to check on student wellbeing and welfare and have direct audience with university executives and students in order to work out solutions raised by students, or the respective universities and the visit coincided with strengthening and expanding partnerships with universities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS was established in 2014, and overseas scholarships started in 2019 under the organisation. There was no visit to the students until 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year I was fortunate to be part of the TSLS delegation, which included: (1) Ro Teimumu Kepa - TSLS Board Chair (2) Dr. Hasmukh Lal - Chief Executive Officer (3) Staff from TSLS and the Ministry of Education. The universities visited included the University of New South Wales, Western Sydney, University, The University, Newcastle and the University Canberra. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the intentions of the travel, the Coalition Government introduced a new scheme on, the current financial year, to have more citizens to access PhD scholarships to boost Fiji's human capital. This is the newly introduced scheme called Cost Sharing Overseas PhD Scholarship. Under this agreement the universities will cover tuition fee while TSLS will pay stipend, airfare and any other cost associated with the study. As such, the taxpayers of Fiji will save around $300,000 tuition fee for a four-year PhD programme and will have graduates of top quality. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 3rd July, 2024, the University of Newcastle was the first university to come on board for the cost-sharing overseas PhD initiative. During the visit, I witnessed the signing of the cost-sharing overseas PhD MOU between TSLS and the University of New South Wales and Western Sydney University and I thank these two universities for development perspective towards Fiji.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1913 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also had the opportunity to visit the world class Brumbies sport facility at the University of Canberra, where TSLS will send prospective students to pursue qualifications in sport science and sports medicine. This is a model where the university has a partnership facility for learning, teaching research and sports excellence with ACT Brumbies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the visit of the four universities, the delegation emphasised to the universities the intentions of the scholarship investment designed in developing human capital, particularly on the introduction of a new overseas scheme called Scholarships for Merit-based Postgraduate Diploma Specialisation, In-service, overseas training and the increased quota in the scholarship for merit-based undergraduate overseas scheme from 40 awards to 80 awards. The universities were also requested to ensure pastoral care is provided to assist students in adjusting to the fast-paced environment of learning they are in, whereby peer mentoring services to students is emphasised to assist students in coping with their academic requirements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the meeting with the students, they were notified of the TSLS policy changes, such as increasing bond services from 1.5 times to 2.5 times. Increase in termination penalty up to 50 percent for students who default their bond services with special emphasis on scholarship academic obligation since the probation period has decreased from three probations to two probations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after visiting the sponsored students at the four universities I was overwhelmed with the response that was received from the students. The sponsored students commended the Coalition Government for providing them with the opportunity to undertake programmes at an overseas university. The students also commended the support services provided by the universities and TSLS in achieving their educational goals overseas and assisting them in adapting to the new environment overseas. And the sponsored student showed commitment towards completing their programmes and returning to serve the country. I assured the students that the Coalition Government will continue to assist and invest in the youths as they are the future of a country and as such it is a responsibility of the sponsored students to serve their scholarship bond. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the student highly acknowledged the visit as it was motivational, and they saw Government’s seriousness and commitment to their studies. It cost Government around $300,000 to fund, one undergraduate student in the Overseas Scholarship Scheme when compared to $30,000 to $40,000 at a local university. To have commercial return of service to the country against the investment, the bonding of overseas scholarship is now 2.5 times the duration of the study. Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon meeting with the sponsored students at the universities, I was alerted on the need to review the Education Curriculum to allow students a smooth transition from secondary school to universities, specifically in the areas and subjects of mathematics, physics, and computer science. It was highlighted in the visit that there is a vast difference between what is learned in Year 13 in Fiji and what is taught in the universities in overseas. These sponsored students were assured that the curriculum innovation and transformation from ECE to senior secondary is one of the priority areas of the Ministry and as such the Ministry is working towards the reviewing of the school curriculum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Overseas Scholarship Scheme, TSLS funds the programme which are part of the national priority areas but not offered by the local universities. A total of 60 students are currently enrolled in areas such as cyber security, software engineering, veterinary science, data science, actuarial science, forensic science, architectural engineering, chemical engineering,</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1914</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 biomedical engineering, environmental engineering, mechatronics engineering, speech pathology and renewable energy at the New Zealand and Australia based universities. With increasing scholarship quota at the undergraduate level and the introduction of new scholarship schemes, more Fijians will be pursuing quality education in Australia and New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is faced with competing priorities and challenges and for Government to alone invest skilling people, to mitigate gaps in our workforce, is a challenge with other competing national priorities and therefore, during the visit I had the opportunity to lead the delegation to the bilateral meeting with DFAT where the delegation was joined by His Excellency Ajay Bhai Amrit, Fiji's High Commissioner to Australia who coordinated the meeting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has lost approximately around 2.5 percent of its population through permanent and circular migration. It is evident that Australia is the one highly preferred destination country. It is noted that the Australian Awards Schemes are also given to our citizens, which we highly acknowledge, but there is no monitoring in place, on how long the graduates effectively serve in Fiji after graduation. As such, our bilateral meeting with DFAT in Canberra discussed ways the students on the Australian Awards can be bonded by the Fiji Government through TSLS. This will ensure that Fiji does not lose Australian Scholarship Awards Graduates, and they serve at least minimum of five years in Fiji and be cleared from the bond services by TSLS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst other discussions with DFAT, the delegation acknowledged the Australian Government in its budget support to the Fiji Government and made recommendations that the Australian Government considers providing targeted funding for specific job skills, training under the Vuvale Partnership. The proposed budgetary supports towards vocational programmes and degree programmes which are offered by local universities in the areas where Fiji lacks the discipline and skills shortages. Mr. Speaker, Sir, curriculum innovation and transformation from ECE to senior secondary school is one of the priority areas discussed DFAT. The Ministry is working to develop a concept of curriculum innovation and transformation. We are pleased to inform this august House that DFAT has assured support for Fiji's curriculum review, which will be assisted in parallel with the Australian curriculum review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as curriculum review is enhanced, it is expected that teachers’ skills will need to be upgraded, and this was also discussed with DFAT to set up a teacher upskilling platform on digital training assessments. The Ministry of Education, Mr. Speaker has started dialogue with other bilateral partners on assistance for online learning for both, teachers and students, and DFAT along with the World Bank and ADB, and some other agencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be celebrated that Fiji on the education front is spending scholarship on its own and through partnerships with the Australian universities for example the PhDs. The intentions whereby TSLS is the driving force along with the Fiji Higher Education Commission and our stakeholder tertiary providers. We wish to inculcate a culture of research-driven policies that encapsulate innovations and entrepreneurship for development resolutions, and in doing so, the Ministry of Education is driving the establishment of a Fiji National Research Council or a proxy to allow researchers to receive grants to conduct research on Government policies and challenges. The proxy can be a model to begin with research grant based at TSLS and then full scoping to establish entity on its own. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the visit by the TSLS delegation, we were able to secure the pro- bono service of two distinguished professors who are from Fiji to help in the establishment of a Research Council. They are Professor Dharmendra Sharma from University of Canberra and</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1915 Professor Satish Chand from University of New South Wales. We are very grateful to the gentlemen for their support towards the development of Fiji’s research capabilities and we will look forward to the support of our other esteemed sons and daughters of Fiji in the area of education research to join us in this noble development intention. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to report that DFAT has assured the assistance of the Australian Research Council to help in the setting up of Fiji's National Research Council, which had been agreed by law to be set up in 2017 under the National Research Council Act of 2017, which, however, is yet to be implemented. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude the investment that Government is doing in quality education and in research degrees; Fiji will reap benefits in three to four years’ time and beyond and we need a strong and bold vision in education to ensure that we build an inclusive nation that empowers our citizens. The Coalition Government’s commitment to education, we will definitely make a measure in roads in our development intentions accordingly and we thank all stakeholders for working with us to make these aspirations happen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just before I take my seat, may I also extend my sincere appreciation to His Excellency the High Commissioner to Australia, Mr. Ajay Amrit Bhai, his hardworking staff and the amazing Fijian diaspora for the warm traditional welcome accorded to us as we visited Canberra. The usual Fijian hospitality and fervour was on display, and I wish to say vinaka vakalevu na veivakataukeitaki, na loloma kei na veikauwaitaki. We trust we were able to satisfy those queries especially on the education sector sufficiently. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu honourable Minister for Education for that very thought- provoking tour that you have undertaken and your discussions with your counterparts in Australia. The Legislature is pushing for some recognition of how best it could endeavour into more research to be undertaken, especially when the honourable Attorney-General has highlighted that there are only six drafters with the Solicitor-General. Most of the time they are tied up, there is delay in the work not only for the Committees, even for private motions from honourable Members. That is still to be seen. We would like something similar to the Ministry of Health where they do a Public Health Master’s and that should encourage and then given a budget allocation. But the concern raised by the Australian Government, I think, needs to be noted very seriously, honourable Members and honourable Ministers. Please, see the concern that is coming from graduates, we do not know where they are, they are provided with some scholarships and then they vanished. In this regard, we are just registering our interest here, honourable Minister for Education, the legislature. We need drafters and we are pushing very hard for an in-service training to be conducted by the various officials here who are highly qualified and stand ready to pursue further education in law. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Education for his Ministerial Statement on Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Services and the recent visit by TSLS team to Australia. TSLS gives scholarships to Fiji students to go and study abroad. My questions are: (1) Who decides which programmes to be funded? Is it only TSLS making this critical decision or Higher Education Commission Fiji is also involved in this decision-making? (2) Does such decision have regard to the new National Development Plan, meaning, professional needs of the country?</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1916</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tertiary educational loan scheme was introduced in 2014 by the Bainimarama Government, with the focus on achieving the best educational outcomes for Fiji and ensuring that funding spent on scholarships and loans, which would result in contribution to the Fiji’s economy growth, workforce development and livelihood. The TSLS has spent $1.44 billion from the budget to assist around 70,000 students in last 10 years of operation. The total amount of taxpayers’ money spent has indicated huge contribution to Fiji that is prioritised through tertiary education and training programmes. Previously, all students meeting the educational requirements at any tertiary institution, were given loans but that is not the case today. There are many students who have received admission into programmes at universities but are studying privately because they did not qualify for the scholarship or loan. That is around 19,000. The previous government established a sustainable funding model for tertiary education, creating a revolving fund for future students intending to study in tertiary institutions. Unfortunately, this Government has created an unsustainable financial model, where every year taxpayers fork out around $150 million for tertiary education. The Government has imposed 50 percent penalties for forfeiting bonds if they wish to seek opportunities offshore. How does this help our graduates or the economy? Remittances sent by unemployed students working abroad can contribute positively to our foreign exchange. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government decision to write off student debts in the last budget has cost over $600 million directly equating to the current budget deficit. Converting the student loan scheme to a scholarship is not sustainable for a small economy like ours. Even larger economies like Australia, continue to maintain a loan scheme for tertiary education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, $150 million would have gone towards other important developments. The Government is given budget support by Australia and New Zealand. Students in these countries are on Higher Education Contribution Scheme. We hope that the TSLS team that visited Australia have learnt the sustainable financial model of funding tertiary education which reduces financial burden on taxpayers. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Group of Nine or their designate. (Chorus of interjections) You just stand up and continue.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I was waiting for the yellow card to come out:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the very informative statement on their visit. I wish the students who are studying under the Scheme well. I urge them not to waste this wonderful opportunity and finish their studies. We have nothing further to add. MR. SPEAKER.- I acknowledge the presence, honourable Members, of Ms. Malimali in the Chambers. It is hard to miss her, honourable Members. She has been the centre stage of attraction all these how many weeks. All the best, Ms. Malimali. National Museum and National Art Gallery HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this august House, ladies and gentlemen who are here in the gallery and those listening from their homes, ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a Ministerial Statement to share with you the progress the Ministry is undertaking in the effort to strengthen a transformed culture sector for Fiji. One such is</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1917 the national museum, a statutory body established through the Fiji Museum Act of 1929 to manage, protect and provide our national collection of objects and treasures which relays stories of Fiji’s rich culture. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over and over again we learn from diplomatic and international visitors alike that more than often the best place to learn Fijian history, people’s heritage and culture is at the Fiji Museum. Our new National Sustainable Tourism Framework highlights the importance of our cultures, traditions and creative industries in promoting a holistic experience for our tourists. Now this begs the question, are we doing enough to support our national museum, the iconic cultural institution that has been in existence since the 1900s? Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I acknowledge past governments and their efforts to support the museum progress, it has always been an ad hoc and piece meal assistance. In addition, these efforts fall short of addressing the serious neglect that the institution had endured in the past years. However, tangible changes are progressively manifesting in the form of innovative exhibitions and infrastructural expansion at the National Museum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Members of this august House and the general public have been to the Fiji Museum in recent days, what you see is the result of hard work put in by staff, management, and its Board of Trustees past and present. These are the real people that work behind the scenes, to ensure that our people, our international visitors, our senior citizens, our youths and our children get to see the renewed Museum offering an interactive experience that has been stagnant for the last 30 years. Through fundraising efforts of the Tokani - friends of the Museum, sponsorships, mini-donor assistance from embassies, cost-cutting measures carried out by the Museum board and management during and post COVID- 19 assisted in the expansion you would have seen. I would like to extend my vinaka vakalevu to these individuals and institutions for your kindness and assistance which came in when the Museum most needed a shoulder to lean on. And this new look National Museum, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not the end to efforts by this Government and the Ministry to ensure that it gets the support it needs to transform itself into a national standard museum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the old history gallery has been rebranded to focus on our creative communities. Its main objective is to engage visitors to learn and appreciate the artistic and creative excellence of our iTaukei communities and other communities who call Fiji home. It looks at techniques and making of cultural treasures such as masi, woven fibre materials, pottery including associated rituals, ceremonies and governance. In this new financial year, the Government is providing the Fiji Museum $970,000 for its Operational Grant and $700,000 for Capital Upgrade Works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we want such independent statutory institutions to stand on its own, the Government must first take lead in making serious investment so that the Museum can become sustainable in the near future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased funding will complement works that have already progressed at this stage. The installation of solar panels promoting energy efficiency had progressed to phase two which will reduce electricity bill for the Museum and alternate as main source during power outages in Suva. Having a steady supply of water through the installation of water tanks and pumps at the Museum will alleviate issues of unplanned water cuts especially when there is a high visitor entry numbers.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1918</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 Mapping out a comprehensive and aligned waste and sewerage system in and around the Museum infrastructure is critical and works have also begun. The Museum will also commence with groundwork necessary to build its new state-of-the-art collections storage facility which will cost $2 million. This will replace the current old building which was built in the 1970s and has not been renovated ever since. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my sincere gratitude to the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for facilitating our request in amalgamating the property lease area for the Fiji Museum. Since the building of the current Museum in 1955, the Museum lease space has always been relegated to the existing length and width of the building. Now this has expanded to include the two former Nawela Hostel Building which housed the Museum administration and staff offices. This lease expansion has allowed the Museum to expand its facilities and ensure safe and security of its premises. The renovation of the Nawela Hostel Building will be completed in this financial year. The office will allow open space working environment for staff and dedicated rooms for specialized units to carry out their work such as the Archaeology Laboratory and the Exhibition Workshop. The setting up of a robust IT system for the Museum includes fire alarm, protection and CCTV camera system is being planned and will be fully installed before the end of this financial year. This will ensure the security of our national collection and premises from hazardous threats that could lead to loss and ruin of our National Museum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our National Museum is continuing with an implementation of its in-house activities to ensure that it fulfils its mandate. The development and rolling out of the museum education material is aimed at promoting interactive learning for our young people when they visit the Museum. It is a 360 degrees archaeology project which is an ongoing digital initiative that will ensure that the general public, diaspora Fijians, developers and visitors are able to see heritage sites and monumental features that are located in remote or inaccessible places around Fiji. The Fiji Museum collections’ project funded by the United States Embassy Cultural Preservation Grant has commenced and will soon recruit cultural youth interns to help in the documentation and community engagement aspect. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the increasing activities and development necessary for the Fiji Museum, it has its fair share of challenges. Management is currently working on recruiting qualified and experienced individuals to fill vacant positions so that our National Museum can deliver its mandate to the Fijian people. The Fiji Museum is also looking at having a sustainable funding source to complement the annual grant given by the Government. This is key to business continuity and independence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the care needed to protect 10,000 objects, textiles, archaeological materials, natural historic specimens, photographs and documentary heritage need to be amplified if we are serious about safeguarding our cultural heritage. I ask our fellow Members of this august House and the general public to rally around supporting our National Museum in its effort to create an inclusive space for everyone. Our collection effort will foster the new direction that the Fiji Museum is undertaking with the focus on the celebration of our history, our identity, our heritage and our culture. MR. SPEAKER- Vinaka vakalevu, honourable Minister, for that very important information of the collection of artefacts that belongs to Fiji. Just a word of advice, it will be interesting if you</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1919 pay a visit to the University of New South Wales Museum, in the heart of Sydney, as well as the Harvard University in the United States of America and even in Cambridge University. They have a lot of artefacts that are very important to us. It can be part of your collection that you are going to undertake with your budget allocation, but honourable Members that is a genuine concern raised by the honourable Minister. Honourable Members, it is now 10.30 a.m. I intend to adjourn the House now and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.31 a.m.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1920</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>30 th September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.06 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, we will move on and I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make their response. HON. J. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for a very comprehensive statement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know that the vision of the Fiji Museum is to inspire, promote and to respect all cultures in Fiji, with its mission is to become a world-class museum. We understand that this will enhance its reputation by working locally, nationally and internationally to maintain and strengthen its focus on the diverse cultures of Fiji. It will be a place where the tangible and intangible heritage of these cultures is safeguarded and made accessible to communities, community members and researchers. This innovative and imaginative exhibits and programmes will serve local communities and be a significant draw for all visitors and it will also make a difference in people's lives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are aware that the Fiji Museum is to install and set up displays inside the museum galleries, using objects that are kept in storage, and I understand this is being currently done. The idea is to create a theme based, storyline display with associated captions and short narratives based on archival materials including photographs, illustrations which may tell a story about the object. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that displays are done externally by various institutions and the museum should encourage that any set-ups should be done inside the museum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, mobile exhibits can be done, and all care must be taken to protect these exhibits. We hope that the Fiji Museum will put all its efforts into the realising that all cultures and ethnic groups have a piece of history. Currently, there are many histories, stories, artifacts, songs, cultures and traditional aspects that are not well documented. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly recommend that the Ministry set-up a taskforce to move around the nation and acquire the artifacts and expressive arts and have it recorded and documented. This may mean that we go beyond our shores and acquire from people of our diaspora who have settled elsewhere. I understand that the Ministry will be venturing into this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before it is too late and our piece of history will be lost forever, I urge the Ministry to forge ahead with this. There is also a need for the Government to consider a building and funding a second small museum set-up in Nadi to cater for the tourism industry and get much needed revenue. There are many artefacts, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that are not displayed due to the lack of space in the current museum and these artefacts can be used in the second museum, let us say, supposedly to be built in Nadi and there is a request for that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the museum for their restorative work done so far and hope that people of this nation will use it to their advantage. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or their designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement this morning. The important value, the important aspect of the museum preserving the history of our nation. In addition to the preservation of our cultural and heritage history, Fiji, a small nation has got</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1921 a big war history. From 1917 during the Labour Corps days, World War I, World War II, those that went to the Malayan campaign and so far, even now the Peacekeeping era. I am urging perhaps, if those that are looking after the museum, the renovations and the enhancement that is happening now, if we can also look at the idea of having a section or accepted building as a war museum like all the other countries do, to capture that part of Fiji’s history in the various campaigns that our ancestors went and participated in bravely, a fair number of them resting in those far away countries, for those that have passed. I certainly support the work that is being put towards the enhancement of our museum. We hope that Government will continue to support the enlargement of the area and also perhaps think about the idea of preserving our war history and looking a war museum. MR. SPEAKER.- Your suggestion is a noble one, it would be interesting to see how the former soldiers who were given a spade, a fork and a knife after giving their life for the country. It is sad, but that is reality, and I do not know if they still have those around as if mooted by honourable Naupoto, you need to have a war museum as well, it will be very interesting.</p></body>
