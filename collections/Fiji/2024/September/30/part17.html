VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Rakiraki Town Council Annual Report for the year 2019 which was tabled on 4 th September, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Social Affairs was referred the Rakiraki Town Council Annual Report for the year 2019 on 4 th July 2023. Pursuant to Standing Order 38(2), therefore, the Committee was referred to the review of the Annual Reports as pursuant to its mandate, as stipulated in Standing Order 110(1)(c). Rakiraki Town was legally declared on Thursday, 4 th July 2010. The Public Service Commission approved the use of an office space in the Government rented complex at Vaileka House, where official operations commenced on Monday, 6th July 2010. The Committee, as part of its deliberation, conducted a site visit to the new Rakiraki Market Complex and held a public submission with the CEO and the Administrator. The Council officially raised concerns with regards to extensive flooding that has occurred in Rakiraki over the years. They requested that this be addressed through regular dredging. It was also highlighted that the Council was moving towards digitalisation of their services through initiatives, such as the new website to keep track of applications and the introduction of QR payments via MPAiSA to enhance customer convenience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also discussed with enthusiasm was the Council’s proposal for a satellite town in Waimicia, Nalawa, Ra, and the proposed extension of its Town boundaries. As part of the Committee's recommendation, the Committee had highlighted the following: (1) An urgent need to support the regular dredging of rivers to mitigate flooding in Rakiraki Town. (2) The Government to reconsider providing annual grants to small municipalities like Rakiraki to carry out their service delivery within time of request. (3) Support the establishment of the proposed state line town in Waimicia, Nalawa, Ra and carrying out all necessary feasibility studies. (4) The Ministry of Waterways to reinstate the annual grant to maintain the dangers within the municipalities. (5) The retention of the Fiji Sport Council ground for sports and other recreational purposes for the people of Ra. (6) To expedite the process of converting the first floor of Rakiraki Market for commercial office space, and SMEs operators to generate additional revenue for the Council.

Thank you, once again, to the Ministry of Local Government for providing a timely response</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 1959 to the Committee’s recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this Review Report, the Committee highlighted the various areas that need to be strengthened by the Council, and relevant recommendations were formulated for resolution. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to inform you that I have a list supplied by the honourable Whips. There will be three speakers from each side, who will be speaking for 10 minutes. The batting will be undertaken by: (1) Honourable P. K. Bala; (2) Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; (3) Honourable V. Lal; (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (5) Honourable S. Nand; and (6) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my brief contribution to the deliberation in this august Parliament on the Review Report of the Rakiraki Town Council 2019 and I would like to thank the Chairman and the Members of the respective Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am deeply concerned by the continuous failures of this Coalition Government to deliver on the most basic needs of our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we continue to face increasing urbanisation and raising cost of living, this Government is content to sit on their hands offering nothing but empty promises and delays. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this neglect is hurting the very people they are supposed to represent. The poor, the working class, the small business owners who are struggling to make ends meet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us talk about this Rakiraki Municipal Market. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- What have you built? (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- You do not have to pay! What are you talking about? The Prime Minister and your Ministers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, let us talk about Rakiraki Municipal Market. When it was first designed, there was a clear vision and provision for a concrete mezzanine floor so that that can be converted into office spaces for commercial use and for small businesses. So, I would like to ask, because we, the Committee met with the management of Rakiraki Town Council, and they said to us that they have asked for the funds but the funds has not been given. I want to thank him. He is a very honest Minister. He is shaking there, because he knows it! And I want to thank him! As the line Minister he is responsible for responding to me! I do not want to hear from others. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the vision for a better infrastructure and to help Rakiraki Town Council to generate additional funds. The smaller Councils can say whatever they want to say, but</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1960 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 they are struggling, crippled by the lack of funding. And I was surprised that, unfortunately, he is not here. The honourable Minister for Finance has just said, that he has provided funds to the respective departments or the Ministry, Ministry for Waterways. So where is the money? Because, when we went there, they basically said there is no more Challenge Fund. So, where is this Challenge Fund that he is talking about? Maybe tomorrow you can answer. But the message that we got from the management of Rakiraki Town Council that, that Challenge Fund had been stopped by the Government. Simple as that! So, the Minister can respond to me.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, another glaring issue is the Government's failure to formalise the FSC ground which includes the golf course and settlement areas which were basically granted to the Council some years back. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this delay is unacceptable to the Rakiraki Town Council and the people of Rakiraki. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask Government to direct FSC to immediately formulate the agreement that was reached by the Rakiraki Town Council and the FSC some years back, as I have mentioned. Apart from the Sports Council’s facility in Rakiraki, there is no other ground, that is the only one. We were very successful in our negotiations with Fiji Sugar Corporation at that time and they gave that ground, golf course, and there were few tenants residing in that area. I hope the honourable Minister will definitely look into this issue. Someone told me that the honourable Minister for Sugar has stopped it, he should worry about sugar, not the grounds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government's non funding for our towns and city is worrying and growing challenges in our urban areas. While the people of Fiji tighten their belts and suffer, the Coalition Government is unable to focus on what truly matters, that is, the delivery result for the people. The honourable Minister for Trade, whenever I speak, he always says swimming pool, swimming pool, swimming pool.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is where all the money is going:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> You better go and swim there, then you will know.</p><p>(Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians were promised before and during Elections for a Municipal Election. The people trusted them at that point in time and voted them that the Municipal Election would be held in the first 100 years or within six months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 100 days or within six months, I ask, where is that promise? In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was a total lie, and it is also against the Electoral Act 116(4)(c). I will put that matter to rest. Maybe the honourable Attorney-General can look into that. HON. K. K. LAL.- Which one?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Sacked one:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I call on this Government to immediately provide the necessary funding so that the Rakiraki Town Council can complete these capital projects that I had mentioned.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 1961 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time for this Government to start addressing the real issues affecting the lives of the ordinary Fijians. Rakiraki Town Council has identified a dumpsite which will be used by Tavua Town Council as well because the municipal councils have common issues and problems. So, they have identified a dumpsite which will be used by Rakiraki Town Council and Tavua Town Council. But what they need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because they do not have funds. They are requesting the Government for funds to carry out the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and therefore I call on the Ministry of Environment to assist this small Council’s request. I believe the Ministry of Environment comes under the honourable Prime Minister’s portfolio and I know he will definitely listen to the request of Rakiraki Town Council. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during our visit, we also went and talked to the market vendors. They do not know the rule and the laws, but they asked us if we can remove the market stall fees and charges to which we said as a Committee, we do not have such powers, it is only the honourable Minister. I said to them what was right that it is the Government's call and the line Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask the Government to consider, based on the high cost of living and the long spell of drought that the people of Rakiraki has faced, to remove the market stall fees and charges for a period of time, so that these poor people can be assisted. The people of Fiji are watching and they are tired of waiting, waiting and waiting. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate that is before the House. I will provide my recommendations, as well as my input to the key recommendations as shared by the Chairman of the Committee this afternoon. Before I do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to respond to some of the comments that were shared in this august House by the former Minister, honourable Bala. The first is on the Rakiraki Market. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he does not read his Budget Book. If he had read the Budget Book properly, he would know that Rakiraki Town Council has been provided a budget of $342,044 to upgrade the first floor of the Rakiraki Market. The next comment is on the municipal elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has the audacity to come and ask this august House about when we are going to have the Local Government Election. In the last Sitting, I was waiting for him to ask me that question, but he was not here. I presented my response on when the Elections will be held. The other comment is on the dumpsite. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has now been telling this House that they have already identified. No, they have not identified the site, so he is lying in this House. Both Councils are still trying to locate a dumpsite. HON. P. K. BALA.- The Management is saying here and is written in the Report that they have identified a location. So, who is telling the truth? I do not lie! HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, they are still looking for a dumpsite around Tavua and Rakiraki areas. I was there, they showed me the site, but I still have reservations because some people are still farming around that area. So, that is something that I want to share in this House, they still have not actually confirmed the site because a lot of review is going to be done before we can give confirmation in this august House. The other comment is on the market stall fees. What we are trying to do now is to move away from that mentality of giving assistance to Councils, like Rakiraki Town Council. That is something</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1962 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 that I have been driving at my Administrators, as well as Executives, and is something that we also want to share with you, the importance of maintaining whatever things that we do, we must make sure that the operations are carried out at a very sustainable way. I think that is something that you need to understand before a Council suggests this type of ideas in this august House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the Committee for coming forward with very good recommendations. These are very pertinent and very important for the development of Rakiraki Town and the surrounding areas, as well as to the committers and those who visit Rakiraki Town. One of the things that has been a recurring issue, Mr. Speaker, is the need to dredge the two Rivers, which is the Penang River and the Nakauvadra River. That is something that I have also shared in this House in the morning, that we are also having consultations and collaboration with the Ministry of Waterways to assist the Council in coming forward with a strategy, not only to address this in a short period of time but, at least, provide a long-term solution on the issue that the people of Rakiraki are facing. The central government to consider providing annual grants to small municipalities like Rakiraki to carry out service delivery. These are some of the things that we are also trying to do now, to bring back some of the services that used to be provided by the Councils, to assist the Councils in providing the services better to the ratepayers and also the people of Rakiraki. Another very important issue is on the establishment of a growth centre or a satellite town like Waimicia in Nalawa, Ra. I think this is very important because you are not only trying to promote economic activities around that area but also bringing services closer to the people of Nalawa and also districts that are close to Waimicia as it is quite far for those tikina in the inland of Ra to come to Rakiraki to do their business as well as shopping. At the moment, the Ministry is also doing a feasibility study on this aspect and hopefully when we next come to Parliament, we will confirm on the progress of the growth centre. Another issue is on the FSC ground, as alluded to earlier by honourable Bala, something that we are also in consultation with the with the Minister for Sugar on the possibility of the Council to lease the FSC sports ground. As we speak there is an event happening on the same ground. The honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was there last Saturday to open the Rakiraki Carnival. One of the plans of the Council is to upgrade, given the contract and the lease by FSC to upgrade that place to a good sports ground that will be used, not only by Rakiraki as well as surrounding areas and the people of Ra. On the upgrade works on the first level of the Rakiraki Market, in my response in the morning, it is not only that, but there is also an issue of water leaking from the roof when there is a heavy downpour going down to the ground floor that affects those market vendors who sell products at the ground floor. That is part of the project that the Ministry and the Council will be carrying this out in this current financial year with an allocation of close to $342,000. He also said it correctly, that is also one of the avenues of the Council to create more space for SMEs as well as small businesses be able to operate from. This also adds additional revenue to Rakiraki Town Council. On the issue of road upgrades at Rakiraki, something that we have also been having consultation with Fiji Roads Authority on the need to have continuous regular upgrades of the road that service town as well as surrounding areas of Rakiraki. Another issue on the Council, if you go to Rakiraki now, on the coastal side there are more hotels coming up. This is one area that the Council hopes to explore and provide better services</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 1963 because a lot of tourists are coming and going to those hotels around the coastal areas closer to Rakiraki Town. It is really growing and booming right now, and we also anticipate having more tourists visiting Rakiraki Town. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I must thank the current administrator as well as the administrators for Rakiraki Town Council and the staff who have been working tirelessly in delivering services to the people of Rakiraki. The Ministry also work hand in hand with the Council as well as the administrators while looking forward to the Local Government Elections to ensure that the Council continues to provide better services to the people of Rakiraki and also to the people that use Rakiraki Town. Mr. Speaker, I support the motion before the House. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the Review Report of Rakiraki Town Council 2019. Rakiraki is a small town with just over 500 ratepayers and the town is located beside a river and is a flood prone area. On average, Sir, Rakiraki Town gets flooded four times a year and we have heard this from the honourable Minister earlier. Flooding occurs when there is continuous heavy rain in the Nakauvadra Range and its valley. During any flood, the Fiji Police control the town, and they close the main entrance and their exit to control movement in the town. Public service transport gets affected during flooding and traffic flow only resumes when flood water recedes. Apart from the main town area, other nearby areas like Naqoro Flats, Qalau Road, Waimari Road, FSC Road, Korotale Road and Rewasa Road also gets flooded. Sir, you can see the number of people affected and also there are some schools nearby and when it starts raining in the afternoon, teachers have to release the students early so that they can reach home in time. I have experienced that, that as a student and also as a teacher where students have to be released early because of flooding. Sir, while talks in regard to the river realignment is ongoing, the Council has proposed to the Ministry of Waterways for regular de-silting and dredging of rivers especially the Nakauvadra and Penang Rivers. However, this is not happening, Sir, as the machines have not reached Rakiraki. The Rakiraki Town Council have requested for this for a number of years, and the Council has been told by the Ministry of Waterways to clean the drains and the chamber. The sad thing is, the Ministry of Waterways has stopped giving grants to smaller municipalities to look after drainage as they used to receive before. Sir, I strongly urge the Ministry of Waterways to reinstate the annual grant to maintain the drainage within the municipalities. Sir, to increase revenue for the Council, I suggest the Council should expedite the process of converting the first floor of Rakiraki Market into commercial offices. I request the Government to move its other offices in Rakiraki to the market building in order to help the Council increase its revenue so that it is able to better serve the people of Rakiraki. Initially when the market was built, the first floor was kept as accommodation for those women who come from afar to sell their produce at the market. Currently, only two to three women are using the accommodation on a weekly basis, especially on Thursdays and Fridays. Since there is a lot of space available on the first floor, this space can be used to earn some revenue for the Council. This space can be rented out to the Government or other businesses or MSMEs to generate additional revenue for the Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of dumpsite, a lot of complaints have been received from nearby residents and the management of the Naria Primary School. This school is sitting just beside the dumpsite and the school faces this problem of flies buzzing in the school buildings and the compound all the time. The school management spends a good amount of money to buy sprays to keep away</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1964 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 the flies. When there is a dump fire, the school buildings get covered with smoke, making it inconvenient for the children and teachers to focus on their work. The school management and the residents have, on numerous occasions, complained about these issues Health Department and a petition was also signed and sent to the District Officer Ra some years ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But nothing was done about it, and instead of relocating the dump, the Tavua Town Council has also started dumping rubbish from Tavua at this site, from last year. I think it is a burden on the taxpayers of Tavua, taking their rubbish all the way to Rakiraki and I am surprised the Minister has just said that the dumpsite has not been identified, but it is clearly written in the Report! The Report clearly says that a dumpsite has been identified in Rabulu and I urge the authorities to speed up the process and relocate the dump from Naria, so that there is no destruction to the students of Naria school and the residents of the nearby areas can live in a clean environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this, I support the motion before the Parliament. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I rise to speak in support of the motion regarding the Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just reflecting on the comments by the other side of the Parliament, by the esteemed honourable Members, there you can kind of sense a bit of forgetfulness perhaps, or an inability to remember what they were doing in the last 16 years. If you look at all these issues, if we were in Government for 16 years, we would not have these issues. When you think about it, this is a 2019 Report, so between 2019 and 2022, nothing was done and the honourable Minister has already mentioned that he has started doing all these things within 18 months or maybe 22 months. Well, converting the first floor of the Rakiraki Market Extension, just as an example. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my purpose today, I think the honourable Minister has covered the Report quite comprehensively. So, I thought I should share some thoughts around a couple of things in. One of them I have mentioned before, and that is of course, another sort of gift from the other side of the Parliament, the untimely nature of the Financial Reports in the Town Councils. We talked about Nadi Town Council Report, and that was in 2016. This report here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 2019 and I know for a fact that the honourable Minister is working very hard to try and get everything up to date. That is fundamental, when you want to govern - the timeliness of financial information! That is fundamental, and so you know whilst the reports are noted, I am hopeful that by the time we finish this Term, we will actually get a lot of these Reports up to date. So that, we can move forward on a more timely basis. And everybody knows when we start talking about history, it is pretty much valueless. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing I thought to share was, I agree with honourable Bala and also the other honourable Members that have spoken, that Rakiraki has a challenge because it is a small town. Just reading through the statistics, there is only 403 ratepayers in Rakiraki. But the question is, as a Government, are we doing about it? What we are trying to do in this economic diversification exercise is to create more economic activity around the country. Fiji Water is talking about commercial agriculture, they are based in Ra. The honourable Minister for Agriculture is about to do a research centre in Caboni in Ra, that will significantly activate a lot of economic activity. We are talking at the moment about rehabilitation of cocoa in Ra. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- How will you increase the base?</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 1965 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is exactly what I am saying, that will increase the base of the economy. That increases the economic activity in the economy, and the revenue comes in, which they can use in the in Town Council. What the honourable Minister talked about hotels is, there is a hotel at Wananavu being re-built at the moment. On completion, it will be a very highly valued hotel. Again, a lot more activity, a lot more spending in the towns, and a lot more money for the Town Council. So, what this Government is all about, it is not only about lamenting about the number of ratepayers but trying to do something about it. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought of touching very briefly on another matter. I know I have raised this before, and I hope that at some point, we can just really revisit this issue on the Report. As I said, whilst I do know that legally we are obliged to debate every single report, the value of debating reports that are dated is somewhat in question. But other than that, I congratulate the honourable Minister for starting to action the items. The other thing I thought I would just note very quickly, and I am sharing this with some of the honourable Members on the other side of Parliament in terms of the flooding. I will tell you about the example from Tailevu at the moment. The honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways decided to restart the Drainage Board. Mr, Speaker, Sir, it is a significant change that has happened in Tailevu right now. The effectiveness of the Drainage Board and how it is actually starting to clear the waterways, I get constant compliments now on the clearing of the waterways. I am sure, the honourable Minister has similar plans for Ra. In terms of, again, as a Government that is trying to action items and provide solutions, we are doing a lot on this side of the Parliament. I thought I would just end on that note and support the motion before Parliament. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the honourable Committee Members for presenting this report. To start off with, I would like to request the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises &amp; Communications, to be slightly original.16 years, saying it over and over again, is now immune to the ears. Come up with something original! I would say, it is almost two years now, start taking ownership! It is almost two years now! Always giving it away to someone else is not taking ownership. Be original! If you cannot say anything good, I think it is better to keep quiet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also just a quick one. He said that the Drainage Board is being started and it will make a lot of difference. I schooled in Rakiraki during the 1990s, the Drainage Board was still there, and flooding still occurred. So just shifting the thing from Waterways to Drainage Board, will not change things. Doing work will change things! You have to get the work done! Name change does not make things happen. Mr. Speaker, small municipalities, such as Rakiraki Town, play an important role in the overall operation and health of a society or the communities attached to it. One of the findings in the Report is the occurrence of flooding. A lot has been discussed this morning during the question raise by honourable Niudamu. A lot of discussions has happened in the last number of years, but the problem still persists. Blaming the previous Government and current Government will not get things done. It is time we take ownership. It is time we look at the plight of the people. It is time we put our foot down and make it happen. Let us get the work going. And the issue needs to be holistically looked at, only the Ministry for Housing and Local Government cannot solve the issue. It has to be holistically looked at. The Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Sugar, all these Ministries need to work together. We need to find the cause of siltation to address the issue. Why is it happening? Probably the agriculture system is not correct, the cultivation methods are not correct, or the forestry methods are</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1966 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 not correct. That is why the silt is getting into the river. We need to address the holistic thing. Stop the siltation from happening and then dredge the rivers. Honestly speaking we cannot totally blame the Ministry of Housing. Everyone needs to work together. Every Ministry needs to work together, and it is time that we stop blaming that this side of the Parliament did not do their work or that side of Parliament did not do their work! Get your tools together and start doing the work! Blaming is cheap, doing the work is a hard thing. The frequent flooding in Rakiraki, the effects of it is not only to the town. The consequence of flooding is beyond the municipal boundaries. It affects the people. When the town has been flooded it affects not only the shop owners it affects the market vendors. It affects the service station operators. It affects people who want to go to the hospital on the other side. We need to start looking after our people. We need to do the work. It is affecting people’s lives, and we cannot take it lightly. Every time we raised the issue, oh, these people have not done it for the last 16 years! Fine, they have not done it! But you are not doing anything, so what makes you any different? Get the work done! Riverbed erosion, I have seen in Rakiraki one of the building’s foundation has been washed away. Those things need to be looked at. That is the safety of the people that is in line. Again 16 years, try to be different. Stop blaming! Get the work done! And being a small municipality, it does not mean it can be ignored. And I find this Government is ignoring it and he is talking about all the agriculture projects that is going to be held. We need to get commercial projects happening in Rakiraki so that the economy improves. We need to look commercially! We need to activate Rakiraki! And the FSC Mill, yes, correctly pointed out! It is a promise by the Government. Put your money where your mouth is, get the mill going. Stop playing with people’s emotions! Oh! We will rebuild the mill. If it is not possible stand up and say we cannot do it! However, if it is possible, get the work done! Build the mill! Churn the economy! Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge everyone in this Parliament, stop blaming each other. Get your tools, get the work done! And 16 years, try to be more creative, Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises &amp; Communications! It is really sore to the ears – the 16 years. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Firstly, I would like to thank the Chairperson and Members of the Committee for the compilation of the Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report. Mr. Speaker, I would like to, particularly, touch on one of the key findings in the recommendations of the Committee, which is the proposal for a satellite town in Waimicia, Nalawa, Ra. As development expands and moves away from the town area, the proposal to have a satellite town in Waimicia is welcomed, especially for most of us whose villages are very far from Rakiraki Town. This is an opportunity for us to have our own little town closer to the districts of Nalawa, Saivou and Nakorotubu. Currently, there is a service station there, there are a few shops there and also an established Police Post, which makes the area very safe. I think in a few months’ time, there will also be a newly constructed supermarket and a shopping mall in that area. I would like to take this time to thank the Chairman, the Special Administrator and staff of Rakiraki Town Council for having the foresight in identifying Waimicia as a proposed satellite town for Ra. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that once all the feasibility studies have been conducted and the satellite town becomes an established commercial area, the Council will think of renaming Rakiraki Town</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – CAAF 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 1967 Council to Ra Town Council. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe a lot has been said in this august House on this Report. For most of the deliberations, we believe there is work to be done and as we have heard in this Chamber the importance of getting the work done and the implementation of the work by the Council. Hopefully, from the Committee’s perspective, the eight recommendations from this Report will be taken into consideration and the Ministry of Local Government, which is the arm of the Government, will actually look at how best the implementation has to go through, the monitoring aspect of it, so that at the end of the day, the holistic debate that we did this afternoon will benefit our nation. We thank, once again, the Ministry of Local Government for providing a timely response to the Committee’s recommendations. On that note, Sir, I do not have any other comments on the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
