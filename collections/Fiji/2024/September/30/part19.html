I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report which was tabled on 3 rd September, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports is a fully owned Government Commercial Company that was established on 12th April, 1999. Fiji Airports has an obligation to deliver the 10 percent return on shareholders fund to Government. The company has a dual reporting system where it reports to the Minister for Public Enterprises for its commercial performance and to the Minister for Civil Aviation on policies relating to the aviation industry. Fiji Airports has the ability to rebound from the setback of successive lockdown during the second wave of pandemic in Fiji which demonstrates the organisation’s resilience in the face of extreme challenges ahead. Fiji Airports might have to complete major runway maintenance works in half the usual time due to the longer working windows caused by the absence of international and domestic flights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was informed of the extension of the Nausori Airport Runway. The $60 million project will allow the opportunity for increased flights, on both domestic and international routes. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends Fiji Airports on its commitment to the SDG on the Great Airport Initiative attaining Level 3 Airport Carbon Accreditation in having their solar farms and the introduction of their electronic vehicles.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>1978 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee’s recommendation, the Committee had highlighted the following: (1) Fiji Airports to continue to improve their flights to achieve their strategic objectives and maintain business continuity; (2) That whilst Fiji Airports is reviewing its Master Plan 2018 – 2043, proper feasibility studies for Nadi and Nausori Airports land sites is to be carried out; (3) The Fiji Airports to consider increasing its contingency/reserve fund to meet future challenges; (4) The Fiji Airports to work in collaboration with the relevant agencies to produce a cyber- security framework as required by ICAO; (5) That Fiji Airports maintain and improve the standards that is required for the next level of accreditation for the Great Airport Initiative; (6) That further consultation be done between Fiji Airports and Fiji Airways for Nausori Airport to be used for more international flights; (7) That Fiji Airports explore avenues to make the non-profitable airports more commercially viable. The Committee commends the support of Fiji Airports for its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) and anticipate positive outcomes in the forthcoming reports. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee acknowledges the significant record and achievement of Fiji Airports and the challenges posed by the pandemic. The recommendations provide the aim to further enhance the strategic objectives, operational resilience and sustainability of Fiji Airports. By continuing to improve business continuity plans conducting through feasibility studies and creating contingency fund, developing a robust cyber-security framework, at the same time maintain high standards for green initiatives. Fiji Airports can ensure its readiness in future challenges. Additionally, fostering collaboration with relevant agencies and exploring financial viability for non-profitable airport will contribute to the overall growth and success of the organisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee looks forward to seeing these recommendations implemented and the positive impact that they will have on Fiji Airports’ operation and the broader aviation sector. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I also have a list before me now and the order is as follows: (1) Honourable F. S. Koya; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (3) Honourable V. Pillay; (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; and (5) Honourable K. K. Lal. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will actually be quite brief. I want to thank the Committee also for the Report, this Report comes out of 2021. This would be a Report coming out of, just on the back of COVID. So, there are a lot of things that may have hindered Fiji Airports’ progress in that particular period prior to 2021. I understand also that Fiji Airports always had a master plan and this was a plan that went from 2018 to 2043, but the pandemic had hindered a lot of</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 1979 things that Fiji Airports needed to do. So, I think there is a revised plan that is actually being done or already done. One of the good things that the Report spelt out, and it shows us the power of having a good organisation, or an institution, is that Fiji Airports actually maintained a contingency fund in that particular time of around $85 million. This was kept in order to address unexpected events, and that included pandemic. So, it is a testament to all these institutions that survived right throughout. There were certain projects that were held back. I think the Nausori Airport Runway also. The upgrade of that was approximately $60 million project actually was going to face financial losses due to Fiji Airways halting all its international flights in and around 2022. The decision to cease the operation was based on commercial viability concerns. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is great to see that Fiji Airports is actually compliant and committed to Sustainable Development Goals, and actively tracks its progress in those particular areas. We have an academy that provides air traffic control training. Again, this is another place where we need to make sure that we keep them in Fiji rather than losing them to other countries round the region and the world. I see they also are a big champion in terms of climate change, accreditation, and decarbonisation issues that surround all of that. Fiji Airways is an active component in all of that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they operate 15 airports, which is no small feat. Their significant focus is on safety, maintenance, data capture, et cetera. I also understand that they have now gone into Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with respect to improving its monitoring and efficiency. There always is a need for us to balance our technological advancements with needs of similar island states in the region. I think the recommendations came out, and it said that they would have to consider future developments with the integration of our local capabilities with international standards. I also understand that the Nadi Airport masterplan is under review with respect to future development and tourism-based things. All of these things can only bode well for an institution that actually hands over a considerable amount of money to the State. I think on average they have given back about $20 million in terms of profit to the Government. The Airport itself has implemented strict protocols with respect to COVID whilst it was on and I think they continued to monitor all of those things. One of the other things also is that there is an energy conservation exercise that the Airports Fiji Limited actually went through. They reduced their bills to quite a considerable less amount that they would have to fork out on a monthly basis. We understand now that Fiji Airways is able to operate its 737 out of Nausori Airport which means better service capabilities. Mr. Speaker, I think one of the most important things is the green initiative that was undertaken with plans for a different level of accreditation by 2024. I think the necessary upgrades that actually need to happen at Fiji Airports Limited is being looked at which is an important issue. The employment contract issue, I think also was changed. The airport has modernised its plans with respect to the arrivals, et cetera. Arrivals area and the overall passenger experience is actually being looked at and with the numbers being bended about by the honourable Minister for Tourism of a million people, we need to ensure that our airport is one of the best in the region, if not in the entire Southern hemisphere. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Traffic Management Systems had actually been looked at, the upgrade of all of that, I think one of the other important things is just as the stuff that we talk about with CAAF, Fiji Airports are actually leads ICAO meetings in terms of its commitment, et cetera. So you</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>1980 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 can see that Fiji is in a different space when it comes in. We looked at it very differently and we are held in very high regard with respect to even Fiji Airports Limited, not just CAAF. From an energy perspective, as I said earlier on, we are using less power, using more renewable energy, et cetera, and I think it is important that we continue on that same vein. Mr. Speaker, we must also look at how we can it more profitable. I think there are other issues that some other speakers will talk about, but we must always continuously look at how Fiji Airports Limited can actually be more and more profitable wherein their handing out bigger checks to the Government. With those few words, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support motion before the House as the Minister for Public Enterprises. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Mr. Mark Halabe, a member of the Board of Fiji Airports and the CEO of Fiji Airports, Mr. Mesake Nawari. I thank the Permanent Secretary for allowing them to come, in fact telling them that we are going to be debating this Report from the Standing Committee on Social Affairs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Koya has mentioned most of the things that I have prepared. But I will not, unlike him in his previous contribution, say I did this, I did that, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the company came into being in 1999 when I was Prime Minister, but it was not something I did. We were moving along with the rest of the world, we were going into corporatisation and then privatisation of various government departments. We were very glad and very proud that what we had formed then, it now becomes a very, very important entity in the corporate world in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights that there was a slight loss because of COVID but the entity made a big comeback with a $49 million profit. I must congratulate them, and I request Mr. Halabe and Mr. Nawari convey our appreciation to the board, the management and the workers in Fiji Airports. We have heard, as the honourable Koya had mentioned, they have had a corporate plan and they are well on their way into complying with the various things that they have put into that plan. Mr. Speaker, I will now like to go straight into the recommendations. Recommendation 1 The Committee recommends that Fiji Airports continue to improve their plans to achieve strategic objectives and maintain business continuity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Master Plan and the carrying out of the plan, the various things they are doing are in line with the recommendations and in fact they have already been adopting the recommendations. In January 2024 (this year), they embarked on the 10-Year Strategic Plan Initiative and the plan is expected to be finalised the month beginning tomorrow. So, they are really moving as they have said in their report to do. Recommendation 2 That Fiji Airport is reviewing its master plan with proper feasibility studies for Nadi and Nausori Airport landsite to be carried out. It is noted that the plan to initiate feasibility studies for the land sites for Nadi and Nausori are already in process, in fact Fiji Airports is currently progressing with engaging a consultant for the development of the Nadi and Nausori landsite masterplan.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 1981 Recommendation 3 To consider increasing its contingency; reserve funds to meet future challenges. The Fiji Airport is currently hazardous of $85 million as contingency as recommended. In fact, they had already been on to that recommendation before the report of May. Recommendation 4 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Airports Fiji to work in collaboration with the relevant agencies to produce a cybersecurity framework as required by ICAO. I am glad to say that honourable Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister is responsible for that area, has been working very closely with Fiji Airports to upgrade our capabilities in policing, cybercrime interference with our operations. Recommendation 5 Fiji Airports maintained and improved the standard that is required for the next level of accreditation for the Green Airport Initiative. The recommendation is noted, the airport had level three Carbon Accreditation by Airport Councils International (ACI) and they are continuing on that programme and hope to achieve Level four, Optimisation Airport Carbon Accreditation as well. Recommendation 6 The Committee further recommends that further consultation be done between Fiji Airport and Fiji Airways for Nausori Airport to be used for more international flights. The Committee recommendation is noted. Fiji Airport has already put in the infrastructure at the Nausori Airport to support international movement out of Nausori. They are also aware that it is a commercial decision for Fiji Airways regarding any future plans for flying international flights from Nausori. The last recommendation Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that Fiji Airport explore avenues to make non- profitable airport more commercially viable. The Committee’s recommendation is noted, and Fiji Airports is going to be engaging a consultant this month to develop a comprehensive landside masterplan as I mention for Nausori Airport. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I as the honourable Minister responsible for Public Enterprises, I am very proud of what Fiji Airport is doing. In closing, I would like to congratulate Fiji Airport for their vision and leadership in establishing and improving its services and revamping its airport to world class facilities. This has been a source of pride for our nation and a clear indication of the potential that lies within our people. I urge all of us to continue to work together to build a brighter future for Fiji, where opportunities are abundant, and our people can thrive in a rapidly changing world. The Government is to continue to pursue partnerships and collaborate with international and development partners to improve Fiji’s aviation sector and to further strengthen Fiji’s position as the Pacific’s regional aviation hub. I am sure my honourable Deputy Prime Minister and colleague will agree with that and one of his missions is very, very, much committed to that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to concludes, again, I thank the Standing Committee, the Chairman and all those involved. I thank the Board, Management and staff of Fiji Airport. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to discuss the Standing Committee on Social Affairs presentation on the Fiji Airport 2021 Annual Report. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the operations and performance of Fiji Airports, particularly in the context of the challenges faced during the pandemic. However, as we reflect on the past, it is crucial to identify the weaknesses in our current strategies and to look forward to the newly launched Masterplan for 2024 - 2033.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>1982 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the significant weaknesses highlighted in the 2021 Annual Report is the impact of COVID-19 on passenger traffic and revenue. The pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in our airport operations, leading to a sharp decline in the international travel. This decline not only affected our financial performance, but also highlighted the need for a more resilient operational framework. To address this, we must prioritise development of contingency plans that can be activated during future crisis, ensuring that our airports remain operational and capable of meeting the needs of travellers and cargo transporters alike. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we transition to the new Masterplan, it was lost in June 2024, we must acknowledge the ambitious projects outlined within it. The plan includes 18 projects aimed at upgrading existing facilities and infrastructure, such as new gates, a domestic terminal, and improved firefighting services. While these developments are commendable, we must ensure that they are implemented efficiently and within the proposed timelines. Delays in project execution could hinder our ability to accommodate future growth in passenger and cargo traffic, which is essential for our goal of becoming the regional leading aviation hub. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another area of concern is the implementation of the Fleet Replacement Plan which includes the delivery of electric vehicles to Nadi Airport. While this initiative is a step towards sustainability, we must ensure that the transition to electric vehicles is supported by the adequate charging infrastructure and maintenance facilities. Without these essential components, the effectiveness of the Fleet Replacement Plan may be compromised. Therefore, I urge management to prioritise the establishment of a robust support system for these electric vehicles to maximise their potential benefits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Masterplan also emphasises the need for improve communication, navigation and surveillance systems. While these upgrades are vital for enhancing operational efficiency and safety, we must also consider the training and development of our personnel to effectively utilise these new technologies. The establishment of Fiji Airports Aviation Training Academy is a positive step in this direction, but we must ensure that this is adequately funded and equipped to provide comprehensive training programmes for our staff. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look at the ambitious projects outlined in the Masterplan, such as the construction of a transit hotel and a commercial retail building, we must also be mindful of the environmental impact of these developments. The inclusion of the Photovoltaic Solar Farm is a commendable initiative, but we must ensure that all new projects adhere to sustainable practices. This includes conducting thorough environmental assessment and engaging with the local communities to address any concerns they may have regarding the impact of these developments on the environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, while the Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report provides valuable insights in their operations, it is essential that we learn from the weaknesses identified and embrace the opportunities presented by the new Masterplan. By addressing the challenges of the past and implementing the propose with diligence and foresight, we can position Fiji Airports for a successful and sustainable future. Let us work together to ensure that our airports not only meet the demands of today but are also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, on the Review of Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Reports.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 1983 Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Steering Committee in reviewing the Annual Report. As kindly being appreciated Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2021 was a very difficult year for Fiji Airports and indeed Fiji. I commend the Board, the management and staff of Fiji Airports for their dedication and resilience in 2021, despite the risks of COVID-19, Fiji Airports staff worked tirelessly with Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Fiji Airways, Airport Stakeholders and the Tourism Industry to facilitate repatriation flights, medical evacuations, essential cargo including supplies such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and vaccines. We all remember these days Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole world was closing down and we were proud of our aviation people, Fiji Airports and Fiji Airways. During the year, Fiji was working behind the scenes with Fiji Airways, other airlines, airport partners, essential service providers, and ground operators, dealing with international borders whilst most parts of the world was crippled with the pandemic. There is always this belief by the other side of the Parliament that they are the ones who discovered Airports Fiji and Fiji Airways and all that. No, no, they have been doing very well all these years, before their sorry law came into picture. (Honourable Opposition Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Microwave, it is microwave.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, if I could highlight some of the stuff, reopening the international borders in 2021, Fiji Airways reopened its borders at the Nadi International Airport to travel partners from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, UAE, United Kingdom, USA, and most of the Pacific Islands. This was more than after 600 days of lockdown and made possible with the decisive decision and extensive planning, people were re-employed and our people returned home and reunited with their loved ones. This shows the significance role of Fiji Airports played in the aviation sector and Fiji’s economy. I think the honourable Prime Minister just said, during his administration, Fiji Airports was created, so can we not lose sight of that please. That is how it was created. You were fortunate there was this very vibrant organisation that was there during COVID-19. It was not the work of FijiFirst Government, please, and then the reaccreditation of the Airports Council International (ACI), so Fiji’s now international airport was accredited in both 2020 and 2021under ACI Health Accreditation Programme for providing safe airport experience for travellers. This meant that Nadi International Airport is the first airport in the Pacific region to receive this accreditation is a test of Fiji Airport’s commitment to service delivery. I am highlighting this, because it gives us the confidence, as I am the Minister for Tourism. It gives me confidence of the potential for tourism going forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am like the strength of the organisation here! The upgrading of the Air Traffic Management System, commissioning of the new Aurora Air Traffic Management (ATM), honourable Koya was referring to this based in Nadi. The new system integrates, oceanic approach and tower control capabilities and includes a new traffic control simulator to train air traffic controllers in an Automatic Dependence Surveillance Broadcast (ADSB). Today, Fiji uses the latest ADSB technology in the domestic airspace and is the first in the world to transition from procedural cost control to surveillance control without radar experience. This is truly phenomenal and a game changer for Fiji. Fiji Airports attained level three airport carbon accreditation and remains the only airport in the Pacific to have attained this certification. The EFL bills were reduced by 70 percent with the Committee noting that Fiji Airports used to pay $0.5 million monthly on electricity bills and has been reduced to approximately $150,000 a month. Fiji Airports remain committed to managing</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>1984 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 environmental impacts, even during the difficult times. Of course, the upgrade to the extension of Nausori International Airport is a $60 million project, ensuring that improvements in safety, and all- weather operations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by the honourable Prime Minister, like any business that suffered during the pandemic, Fiji Airports was not spared. Fiji Airports key indicators fell, that is, passenger movements declined by 80 percent and aircraft movement declined by 31 percent. The decline in these two factors resulted in the decline in the total revenue by $24 million with a net loss of $4.3 million in 2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has a vision to make Fiji a thriving international gateway, not just for tourists coming in, but for investors and businessmen and women. We want to be an entry point to the region, to the Pacific Islands and a transit point for Australian, New Zealand and the US travellers. In this regard, the partnership with our national airline, Fiji Airways is important, as they carry 70 percent of our visitors and passengers. We want more international flights. In order to make this happen, we need to continuously invest in our airports, both above the average and below, where non-glamorous work takes place. Fiji Airport, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue keeping its finances and revenue in check in order to invest back in the core functions and infrastructure. The Fiji Government will provide support in this endeavour. In closing, I once again thank Fiji Airports management and staff for their continued hard work and dedication. I support the Report of this Committee. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to voice my deep concern regarding the operational decision of Fiji Airports and the impacts on the people in the Northern Division and other airports. It is commendable that Parliamentary Standing Committee has recommended that Fiji Airports explore avenues to make non-profitable airports more commercially viable. However, I question the approach being taken and its implication on the livelihoods of our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most pressing issues is the steep car park charges imposed under the park and fly option. These additional costs has affected those travelling to our Northern Division and the surrounding islands, especially our families who already face high airfare costs by Fiji Airways or Fiji Link. For many Fijians, these charges make travelling not just inconvenient but unaffordable. I ask the Government and the Fiji Airports, where is the consideration for our ordinary Fijians? The people who are the backbone of our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the excessive car park charges are not just a financial burden, but a testament to the disconnect between the management decision and the lived realities of our people. For Fijians, from Vanua Levu and our outer islands, every dollar counts. These charges, instead of making travel smoother, have created yet another hurdle for our people. I urge the Government to revisit these charges and find a solution that works for our people and not against them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must also highlight the state of our airports in the Northern Division, specifically Labasa, Savusavu and not forgetting our Garden Island of Fiji, Taveuni. Since, the new Government came into power we have yet to see any intangible improvement in the maintenance of infrastructure of these critical facilities. How can you talk about regional development, particularly the Northern Development Programme and the Look North Policy if we continue to ignore the very infrastructure that connects our people and our tourism sector in the Northern Division? Mr. Speaker, Sir, we speak so often about the Northern Development Programme, the Look North Policy, yet where is the action? Where is the commitment to upgrade and maintain the very airports that serve as lifelines for our poor people in the Northern Division. If we are serious, Mr.</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Fiji Airports 2021 Annual Report 1985 Speaker, Sir, about promoting the development of Vanua Levu and our surrounding islands, then we must prioritise making these airports operationally efficient while maintained an accessible. But I thank my kai Savusavu and the Turaga na Prime Minister for pushing for the National Development Plan (NDP) which will benefit our people of Vanua Levu and the surrounding islands. But honourable Prime Minister, tai Savusavu, all I ask you, and the people ask you and they demand, if you push harder so that we can achieve this before the new Government comes in 2026. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our words must be followed by action. We cannot be repeating the same rhetoric of development for the Northern Division without actually implementing the necessary changes. The people of Labasa, Savusavu and the surrounding communities deserve better. They deserve airports that reflect the same standards as those in Suva and Nadi. They deserve fair and reasonable carpark charges that do not add to their financial woes. And they deserve a government that listens and acts in their best interests. At the same time, I urge the Government to revisit the Airport Plan for Nasarawaqa in Seaqaqa. It is time to change the narrative that they promised, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is time to show their real commitment to the Northern Development Programme, not just words but in action that transforms the region and uplifts our people. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe a lot has been done in deliberation of this Fiji Airports Report. There is a lot of constructive and destructive issues we hear this afternoon, and we leave the onus on the Government to actually implement the positive aspect path of Fiji Airports. On that note, Sir, we thank the Fiji Airport Board, CEO and the team for the well-articulated reports that was presented to the Committee. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no further comment on this motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. I thank you all for your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 7.04 p.m.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>i.</p></body>
