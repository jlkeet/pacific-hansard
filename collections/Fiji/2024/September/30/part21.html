Radrodro) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reply to Question No. 227/2024 is as follows: (a) Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS) administers government scholarships, grants and study loans. TSLS has continuously been working on strengthening the policies to ensure transparent and efficient management of taxpayer funds for scholarships and study loans. In 2023, there were 13,860 students funded by TSLS under scholarships and study loan schemes at various Tertiary Education Institutes while in 2024, there are 15,666 students currently being funded by TSLS. The breakdown of students funded under scholarships and study loans at various Tertiary Education Institutes are: Tertiary Education Institutes Fiji National University University of the South Pacific University of Fiji Sangam Institute of Technology Fulton Adventist University College Corpus Christi Teachers College Advance Aviation Training (PTE) Limited Pacific Flying School Centre for Applied Technology Development Keshals Business Education Institute Montfort Boys Town Navuso Agricultural Technical Institute Pacific Polytechnic Pivot Point Service Pro SPA Academy Fiji Vishan Infotech Overseas Universities Total Number of Students 2023 2024 7,826 4,662 848 299 102 70 - - 19 - 2 - - - - - - 32 13,860 8,333 4,280 902 319 142 100 7 13 123 32 13 10 1,192 57 10 14 56 63 15,666 TSLS has disbursed tuition payment to various Tertiary Education Institutes as follows: (i) 2022-2023 Financial Year - $56,875,980</p><p>iv. (ii) 2023-2024 Financial Year - $62,414,805 The breakdown of funds disbursed to Tertiary Education Institutes are: Tertiary Education Institute Disbursement 2022-2023 ($) 2023-2024 ($) University of the South Pacific Fiji National University University of Fiji Sangam Institute of Nursing Fulton College Advance Aviation Training (PTE) Limited Centre Technology Applied for Development Corpus Christi Teachers College Keshals Business Education Institute Montfort Boys Town Navuso Agricultural Technical Institute Pacific Flying School Pacific Polytechnics Pivot Point Fiji Institute Service Pro International Tourism &amp; Hospitality Institute SPA Academy Fiji Overseas Total Disbursement 15,537,414 30,565,249 5,729,074 1,905,438 661,136 54,500 492,700 16,000 1,914,469 56,875,980 13,143,401 30,758,717 6,695,178 1,933,200 485,128 350,000 473,700 420,200 53,400 16,835 6,080 608,189 3,926,699 656,952 45,500 70,000 2,771,626 62,414,805 The above do not include the allowance disbursed directly to students. (b) Students who were awarded scholarships and study loans in 2023 and 2024 are still in their active bond term as they are first and second-year students respectively. From 2014 to-date there are 21,685 students who have either absconded, are inactive or are yet to graduate and their bond term has expired and equates to around $160 million of investment. Breakdown by institution cannot be released as it will cause reputational damage to the Tertiary Education Institutions. Trend recorded is that students who had very low marks and were provided with a study loan to do degree programmes prior to 2021, attracted high attrition rates from technical colleges, adding to the high non-completion of programmes of study. (c) TSLS has various strategies in place to address the issue of non-completion. TSLS provides: (i) Learning Enrichment Services to all our sponsored students to assist in their academic pursuit to improve retention and completion rates. (ii) Students with scaffolding support to enrich their learning journeys. (iii) Weekly Learning Enrichment Sessions. These sessions are provided to students at flexible hours which includes essential topics such as time management, preparing for</p><p>v. exams, managing the coursework, allowance management and the importance of mental health amongst others. (iv) An At-Risk Student Intervention strategy, that has been put in place through the recent amendment to TSLS Act during the 2024-2025 budget. As per amendment to TSLS Act, it is mandatory for Tertiary Education Institutions to provide reports on “at-risk” students. This is to ensure that Tertiary Education Institutions have learning support and remedial programmes to improve retention and completion rates. Tertiary Education Institutions are required to identify and provide reports to TSLS on all students who are at-risk of failing their courses by mid-term. TSLS has strengthened its policies by implementing intervention strategies for students who are at-risk failing and necessary assistance is provided to the students to avoid the risk of failure as a proactive measure. This is the initiative of the Coalition Government. (v) Confidential Personal Counselling. TSLS provides a safe space and conducive environment for all students who may be in need of confidential one-to-one counselling. Students who are facing any issues that is affecting them academically can reach out to TSLS and the necessary counselling services are available to assist them. (vi) On Campus Visits to meet students and create awareness of the support available to students. (vii) Online Flexible Interactive Sessions where students can join in and talk about issues that may be affecting them, and at the same time begin conversations on the best solutions to face the challenges ahead. Students can join these sessions from the comfort of their homes, or schools as online sessions are a lot more convenient. Session times are early mornings while they commute to school, or in the afternoons and evenings when the students are done with their classes. (viii) Work Skill Development and Industry Mentoring to sponsored students where TSLS connects students to professionals from the industries such as Accounting, Engineering and Teacher Education. This allows students to hear from the industry professionals on what to expect from the profession they have chosen post-graduation. (ix) Support Sessions for Suspended Students to maintain effective communication with all suspended students throughout the term of their suspension, providing guidance and ways on how best to improve academically and get supported on how to re-enter the Tertiary Education Institutions. (x) Learning Enrichment for Overseas Students who are studying abroad. (xi) Post-Graduation Care and Employer Connect Services. Through this, TSLS provides assistance and guidance to its sponsored students post-graduation. The TSLS Post- Graduation care services equip graduates on the basics while searching for employment such as resume writing and preparing for interviews. (xii) Employer Connect Portal (ECP). This is an in-house developed portal that connects new graduates with potential employers. Employers can sign up for the portal and post their vacancies, and the same will be visible to all graduates that have signed up. Graduates can upload their resumes and interest towards positions and employers carryout shortlisting on the same portal. The Coalition Government will work with TSLS on further strengthening the policies to ensure high completion rate and ensure transparent and accountable management of government funding and there is maximum return from taxpayer investment in higher education.
