<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE - REVIEW REPORT ON THENADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE - REVIEW REPORT ON THE NADI TOWN COUNCIL 2016 ANNUAL REPORT HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute on the motion before the House. I would like to commend the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for a detailed report. I have noted from the Report that the Committee has come up with key findings and some very good recommendations. I fully support the recommendation of the Committee that Nadi Town Council should identify a suitable dumpsite for the ratepayers of Nadi which will save cost in terms of transportation to Lautoka. Currently, rubbish is transported all the way to Vunato, Lautoka which is very costly; hundreds of tonnes of rubbish are taken to Lautoka from Nadi which means extra cost to ratepayers. I urge the Ministry of Local Government and the newly appointed Special Administrators to put their thoughts together and address the issue at the earliest. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other important area which cannot be overlooked is a recreational area. Recreational area plays a very important role in enhancing the quality of life in an urban environment by providing residents and visitors with spaces for outdoor activities and relaxation. There is need for more recreational areas for the people of Nadi and visitors to Nadi, including the tourists. There are only a few recreational areas in Nadi which was done some years ago and that needs upgrading. The Special Administrators and CEO should come up with innovative ideas and share ideas with the Council and the Ministry of Local Government, upgrade and also come up with more recreational areas in Nadi for the people of Nadi. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another finding of the Committee is outstanding rates. All efforts should be made by the Council to collect the outstanding rates. The Councils should come up with better</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1951 strategies so that a huge number of outstanding rates can be collected and utilised for important developments and maintenance work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many important places in Nadi which needs maintenance. I will talk on only one, I have identified one important place which needs maintenance and upgrading and that is Nadi Bus Stand. During my recent visit to Nadi, in fact, when I was coming to Suva yesterday, I went to the Nadi Bus Stand. The reason why I went to the Nadi Bus Stand because some concerned citizens of Nadi raised concern regarding the state of the bus stand. I saw that the Nadi Bus Stand is in a very bad condition. The bus stand is outdated and rusty, ceiling and boards are falling apart. I took photos and will send them to the honourable Minister, benches at the bus stand needs repairing. It is a health hazard; we are putting our students and people at risk.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations and the honourable Minister for Local Government to look into this without any delay. We do not want to see people getting injured or losing their lives from the hazard, which I have just highlighted. I am sure the Nadi Town Council Special Administrators and CEO are fully aware of the very bad condition of the Nadi Bus Stand. I do not know what is stopping the Council from carrying out maintenance work. Is it finance? Priority should be given to this important area and maintenance should be carried out without any delay. Nadi Bus Stand is used by thousands of people daily, which also includes thousands of students, visitors and tourists. At the moment, it is an eyesore. Nadi Town Council is known for actively contributing to the tourism sector in Fiji, but this poor condition of the bus stand reflects badly on Nadi Town Council and also on the Ministry. MR. SPEAKER.- Do you have an area in mind for this dumpsite in Nadi? HON. H. CHAND.- I went to the bus stand yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I have taken some photos which I will be sending.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Dumpsite:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> Dumpsite, no, I have not. I will leave it to the Administrators and the Ministry of Local Government. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion. I do so as a resident of Nadi for eight years, having lived in Waqadra, Bountiful and, of course, CAAF Compound. One of the issues that I wish to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need for acknowledging the landowners. There must be close collaboration with the landowners in terms of policy discussions. It has happened in the past when there are new policies and when there was a meeting held at the town hall, it is the other ratepayers that attend. As for the iTaukei, they do not go and attend these kind of forums. What is important is the veitalanoa. Council should go and visit the villagers. We have the Gone Turaga na Tui Nadi, Momo na Tui Nadi, Marama na Tui Saunaka, and likewise the Tui Nawaka. Three chiefs and, of course, for the Namaka Area, na Momo na Tui Sabeto. There must be acknowledgement and collaboration between the Councils and the Vanua. It is very important. We can all go - talanoa tiko wherever we go, but it should start from home, and this is something that we have lacked over the years. I hope that under the Coalition Government, with the reform being done,</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>1952 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 we see a major improvement in terms of closer collaboration between the Vanua and the Local Governments. The second issue which I acknowledge and has been made by the honourable Minister and also by honourable Koya, is the lack of landfill. It is a pity that we are in this state, but the issue has been recognised. The former Minister sitting there, but it has been recognised. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you approach the landowners, there are potential sites where this can be done. It is just a matter of sitting down to address this issue because Nadi, being a premier town closer to the Airport, it must have an incinerator on its own.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You need to open your mind and open your eyes as well:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) Project, I understand that the Japanese Government has funded the 3Rs Project, in partnership with Nadi and Lautoka Town Councils, to reduce waste. There was a team that went to Japan, until now, we are yet to see what has been implemented. They need to pick on these issues, and I guess one of the problems is the constant change of the management. It is noted in the Town Council. So, the question goes back, who appoints them? Why sack them? Why do people have to retire? There is a tendency of appointing people and sacking them. Obviously, there is no forward plan for that, and that is one of the problems that we saw at the Nadi Town Council. On the Nadi River Diversion Project, this is a constant issue that I had actually faced. I experienced three major floods in Nadi, Waqadra Area, Vesi Street. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the houses were actually up to the roof level. We urge the Town Council and all authorities to address this issue. Also, on the issue of how can they be assisted financially? In some cases, all household belongings were damaged and some of them just within the poverty line. There should be a policy to assist these people. I speak on behalf of the people who live in Nadi, in Waqadra and the downtown area, most of them are just struggling to live, so this is an important issue. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Do you not know the work of the Local Government? MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- On the issue of drainage which the previous Government did not address it in the last 16 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue is the need for cemetery. Enamanu Cemetery is an eyesore. Sometimes, it is opened three or four times. You can even spot who owns these graves. So, the Town Council needs to look for new sites. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go overseas to Australia or New Zealand, they have high respect for those who have gone before us. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1953 HON. S. D. TURAGA.- But this has not changed in the last 16 years. Under the leadership of honourable Nalumisa, this will be done, I can assure you that. (Honourable Members interject) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Sixteen years, you cannot compare that to two years, not even two years. Poor execution! That is what I call. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been great work on the review of the Local Government Act and, again, I encourage a close collaboration with the vanua. Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is only the people who are the people whose voices are heard. What about those who cannot be heard? This is the reality in Fiji. O koya ga e domo levu, e levu na nona i lavo, e rogo. Ia, o ira na ka lalai, e sega soti. Ena sega ni rawa ni vaka tiko ‘qo na veivakatoroicaketaki e Viti. Meda rokovi ira tiko o ira na i taukei ni qele, meda rogoci ira talega na cava era sotava. We must listen to them. This Government will listen to them. We promise, we deliver, and that is the change between this Government and the other side. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an issue that is noted and it is across the board, the poor collection of rates. It has been addressed, and the Government will strive to work with the new Council. We have an upcoming election so people can take ownership of their town, they pay their rates on time, so there will be lots of money for infrastructure. HON. K. K. LAL.- God is watching, my friend! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one thing that touches me when I go to Namaka is the pirate taxis. Why does it thrive these days? Because those who have taxi metres do not operate after 6.00 p.m. So, the question is something that the Council has to deal with. How can this be tailor-made? How can we address this? A lot of people actually make a living out of this. I know it is unlawful, but then the question again is, what about those who are licensed to operate at a certain time, but they choose and pick and at what time? This is an issue that the Nadi Town Council has to address. It cannot ignore that. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- LTA matter, you should know that! MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need to establish a one-stop business licence shop. There is a need for a centralised one-stop-shop for applying for business licence, to eliminate the inconvenience of residents travelling to Suva, or multiple offices for document verification for approval. There is a discussion within my Ministry in terms of placing one of our officers from the Registrar of Titles, at least, two days in a fortnight, so that it can address the request from landowners in terms trust deeds. So, they do not have to come all the way to Suva. We are also going to place them in other towns. They will come for training to the Registrar of Titles Office so they can do these services. Before, in the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you come to Suva to do that. If you are living in Koro, you have to come and get your registered birth certificate in Suva. That problem has been resolved. Done! Soon, qaravi. The Ministry of Justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, does not go out to do awareness. So, basically what I am saying is that the people living in the maritime, are left out. That is the change we promised</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1954 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 this country, led by the honourable Prime Minister, and of course, these are my colleagues. This is the change we promised. We are actually empowering the people. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the motion. I thank the honourable Minister and honourable Vanawalu for their hard work. We hope that there will be some good governance in the near future. When I look at the statements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, paragraph 5 of the Auditor-General’s Report says, “The Council was unable…”; paragraph 6 says, “There was unreconciled…”; paragraph 7(a), “The Council was unable…” So, the question is, who appointed these people? Why was no action taken? But with the Coalition Government, we hope we are going to set new standards. I support the motion, Sir. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House. As we dig into the findings of the Report, it is imperative to acknowledge the weaknesses that have been identified within the Nadi Town Council. The financial health of the Council is a pressing concern, with outstanding rates approximately amounting to $3.4 million. This figure includes both, the current dues and arrears, with only about $243,000 collected in the financial year, representing a mere 11 percent of the total owed. Such a situation is untenable and poses a significant barrier to the Council's ability to finance essential services and infrastructure projects that our community desperately needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights the Council's struggle with rate collection, which has led to reliance on legal action to recover outstanding dues. The Committee has rightly recognised that pursuing these matters in court is necessary to deter non-compliance and ensure that all ratepayers contribute their fair share. This approach, Sir, while essential, underscores a deeper issue - the need for a more proactive and engaging strategy to communicate with the constituents about their responsibilities and the importance of timely payments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to funds and challenges, the Report points to depressing need for improved infrastructure in Nadi Town. Residents have voiced their concerns regarding the poor road conditions which has not been adequately maintained. The Committee has engaged discussions with the Fiji Roads Authority to address these issues, seeking their assistance in upgrading the roads that are vital for the safety and mobility of our community. It is crucial that we continue to advocate for these improvements, as they directly affect the quality of life of our residents. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has emphasised the importance of partnership in addressing these challenges. Collaboration with organisations such as JICA and the Australian Government are essential for the successful completion of the ongoing projects. The Committee is actively working to finalise these projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nadi Town Council faces significant challenges that require our collective effort and commitment. The weaknesses identified in the Report, particularly regarding financial management and infrastructure, must be addressed with urgency. The solution proposed by the Committee, including legal action for rate collection, improve communication and strategic partnerships are steps in the right direction.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1955 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the hard work of the Council and would like to thank the current, CEO, Mr. Muni Gopal Reddy and his team, for working tirelessly to meet the expectations of the ratepayers and other stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the outskirts of Nadi Town, there is the Saunaka Land Purchase Co- operative Society Limited, but it still has issues pending with the Nadi Town Council and other stakeholders. This Co-operative was established in 1970 with 15 members, and later with additional members, increased to 30 in the years 2009 to 2010. In 2018, instead of full subdivision, a piecemeal subdivision was carried out and titles were issued under the land depository period. Due to this, Sir, most of the members, stakeholders and beneficiaries refused to pay their town rates. According to the Co-operative, members’ multiple emails have been sent to the Nadi Town Council and no response has been received to-date. Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of 56 acres, 14 acres has been purchased by the members, with the remaining allocated to access roads. Moreover, for some reasons, 18.5 acres of members’ land has been misappropriated by the previous Saunaka Land Cooperatives Board, and that has been labelled as balance spent. This issue has been raised with the Nadi Town Council and the Titles Office, but no response has been forthcoming, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Nadi Town Council to look into the plight of this Saunaka Land Purchase Cooperative Limited so that proper development can take place, and outstanding rates can be recovered by the Council. I also urge the honourable Minister responsible to conduct an investigation into the affairs of this Saunaka Land Cooperative Limited and its previous Board so that the current members can move on with their allocated lots for the development of the Nadi Town Council and improvement of Nadi as a whole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to support the recommendation put forward in the Report and advocate for necessary actions to implement the solutions. Together, we can build a better future for Nadi Town and its residents. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for afternoon tea. When we return, we shall be inviting the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to make his contribution as well. The House adjourned at 4.40 p.m.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1956 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 4.37 p.m. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for his motion and also thank all the honourable Members, including the honourable Minister, for his contribution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just confine to two issues that were raised by honourable Members, one, of course, is with respect to solid waste management. In the National Development Plan (NDP), one of the sub-chapters 7.4, has been devoted to the solid waste management Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), policies and strategies. Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is dealing with a significant solid waste management problem now. Obviously, increased economic activity, changing consumption patterns, even in the rural areas, consumption patterns – products that were not used are now being used and there are different kinds of activities, which generate a lot of solid waste – informal settlements, increasing urbanisation, so at the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, only 0.2 percent of the total waste is, kind of, recycled in Fiji. In the NDP, as part of the KPIs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, solid waste disposal through collection and disposal by Municipal Councils is about 182,000 tonnes nationally. The target in the NDP for the next three years – 2025-2027, needs to take it to 250,000 tonnes, and between 2025- 2029 to about 350,000 tonnes. We are also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at how we can increase recycling plants and the target key indicators. The targets in the plan are one in the Western Division and one in the Northern Division. The Western Division in the next first three years (2025–2027) and landfills again target for one in the Western Division, Northern Division, we have talked about rubbish dump in Nadi. Those are immediate short-term targets, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for solid waste management. For Nadi, it is a serious concern because the nature of waste has also changed in rural areas, for example the use of diapers. People use it in the rural areas because there is no provision to dispose of them, we are not encouraging disposal methods. They bring it to the urban areas, hoping that the town and city Councils will collect and dispose. It is an ongoing issue for many of the municipal councils. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue is the Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project. This project is one of the most critical long-term initiatives underway. This project which aims to reduce the flood risks that have historically impacted Nadi, continuous to be a priority for both the Nadi Town Council as well as the for the Government. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reference was made to the support by international partners such as Japan. As I said, the project is designed to mitigate flood risks that have long threatened that area’s infrastructure and economy. So, while significant progress has been made in improving drainage systems and reinforcing riverbanks, additional resources will be required to review those further. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can inform Parliament that we have received the final Technical Report by the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility Programme (AIFFP), and I want to thank the Australian and the Japanese Government for working together. There were some concerns about the original design, the way in which the first and second phase was going to be conducted. The Technical Report that has been submitted by AIFFP addresses that and one of the donor partners has already committed grants. So, this project is going to be a big project and it is going to cost us significant resources. At the moment, within the Ministry of Finance, we are looking at policies and strategies, to ensure that we look for more grant financing for this project because under</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>30 th September, 2024 Review Report – Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report 1957 climate resilience projects, these types of projects are very, very important. I am confident now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that given the completion of the Technical Report and given the support that the Japanese Government is already providing, we should be able to move on this project as soon as possible. Other supportive infrastructure by Government around Nadi, is the dredging works at Denarau in which we had allocated about $5.5 million in the 2024-2025 Budget. As we know, Denarau is one of the key areas that contributes to the tourism economy. It is part of the Government's broader effort, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to mitigate the cost of flooding and strengthen critical tourism infrastructure. These dredging works will protect Denarau shores, improve drainage and safeguard this infrastructure against rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions, which is quite frequent Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project, we have also prioritised the allocation of funding to upgrade drainage systems to reduce the impact of the kind of flooding that we would have seen in the past. So, in the 2024-2025 Budget, we have allocated additional resources to the different Ministries - the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and Ministry of Sugar and Multi-Ethnic Affairs, because we believe that some of the drainage works that need to be done beyond the town boundary is having an ultimate impact when there is a lot of rain and cyclones. Because of those works not being carried out beyond the towns and cities, they ultimately end up in those areas, so as part of the overall projects by Government, both in the 2023-2024 Budget, but more significantly in the 2024-2025 Budget, we had provided additional funding for drainage works throughout the country and I think some of the work has already begun. Some were done last year, and we can see the positive impact of that kind of drainage work beyond the town and city boundaries and is having a positive impact on towns and cities as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, the other issue that the honourable Minister for Justice raised was that their rate collection was a big problem over the last many years, and we are addressing that now. We are also saying to vendors and those using the services of towns and cities that a certain level of user pay is required because everyone, and those who live in the cities and town boundaries but more importantly those who live outside of these boundaries, use these services on a regular basis, so town and city councils must have adequate resources. Government cannot continue to inject funds to run these town and city councils, and we are hopeful that after the elections, more understanding and campaign amongst the ratepayers where this culture of self-financing and the ability of town and city councils to provide services to the people will be enhanced. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for a very constructive deliberation from the honourable Members this afternoon and we believe most of the issues raised have been addressed by the honourable Minister. On that note, Sir, once again, the Committee would like to thank the Ministry of Local Government for their timely submission in response to the Committee’s recommendations in this august Parliament. The Committee looks forward to the successful implementation of these recommendations in which we significantly contribute to the growth and prosperity of Nadi Town Council. On this note Sir, I have no other comments on this Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1958 Review Report – Rakiraki Town Council 2019 Annual Report 30 th September, 2024 Question put.
