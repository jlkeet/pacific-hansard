<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> The following honourable Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40: (1) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; and (3) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. The honourable Minister may speak up to 20 minutes. After the Minister, I will then invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the leader of Group 9 Bloc, or his designate, to speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate. State Visit to the People’s Republic of China HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I present my Ministerial Statement in relation to the State visit to the People’s Republic of China, may I offer words of condolences to Maoridom on the passing of His Majesty, the Maori King, last week. He was a great friend of Fiji. He made a special request to visit Na Turaga Bale na Vunivalu of Bau when he visited and responded favourably to the invitation of the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and to be present at the Council of Chiefs Meeting in Deuba. Also, he made himself available and responded positively to the kind invitation from His Excellency the President, to be at a dinner at the State House, which I was honoured to have hosted.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1671 Our condolences go to the Maori people of New Zealand. I would like to also record our appreciation to the Maori people in New Zealand for their role in the development of sports in Fiji, particularly, the days of the Maori All Blacks. We have a special place also in our relationship with the Maori people. In that, one of our late chiefs, Ratu Tiale Vuiyasawa, who found it difficult to join the Colonial Forces of the time, applied to join the Maori Battalion. But he had to have an English name, so by deed poll, he added “Wimbledon” and they gave him the qualification to join the Maori Battalion that fought in Palestine at the time, until the end of the war when he returned to Fiji. Sir, we have that special relationship, and we would like to honour him with our letter of condolences, and you will probably be getting an application from the honourable Minister of iTaukei Affairs later on, to be excused from a day’s sitting to represent the Government at his funeral later this week. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our visit to the People’s Republic of China was a great demonstration of the friendship that we enjoy with this great power, not only economic, but also in military and political power in the world. I acknowledge the presence of His Excellency, the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China here in Fiji. Honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and those listening in, ni sa bula vinaka and a very good morning to you all. My friend, His Excellency Zhou Jian, thank you for your very kind invitation in facilitating the visit to your great country. I also greet those who are watching us on television, livestream or listening in to the radio. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have addressed your Chair, your position in addressing our condolences to the people of New Zealand, the late King, and dispatching a condolence letter to our High Commissioner in New Zealand – Ratu Inoke Kubuabola. There was an earthquake in Tonga on the day he died. We felt it, I thought there was going to be some siren, but they are so used to it in Tonga. I said, “no siren?” The honourable Prime Minister said, “no, we only get a siren when there is a tsunami warning.” “What about the buildings crashing?” He did not have an answer to that. As I have said, he was a dedicated leader and a friend to the leaders and chiefs of Fiji. He also joined the chiefs of the Pacific in their gathering in Hawaii. Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the Ministerial Statement and acknowledging the presence of His Excellency the Ambassador this morning, I also watched the television programme last night, where our representative, Robert Lee, spoke on Chinese TV. I was proud to describe our Ambassador to China, His Excellency Robert Lee, to President Xi Jinping as an ethnically Chinese descendant from Fiji, one of the many successful Chinese families we now have in Fiji, who are now Fijian citizens. The bilateral relationship we have with the People’s Republic of China is founded on mutual respect and co-operation, and we observe the "One China Policy" which has been a key pillar of our bilateral relationship since 1973. Since assuming office in 2022, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my primary goal has been to strengthen relationships with Fiji's bilateral and multilateral development partners. The ultimate goal is to restore Fiji's position on the global stage as "friends to all, enemies to none", and fortifying our foreign policy principles of sovereignty, security and prosperity. I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that these are also the principles that guide the leadership of His Excellency, President Xi Jinping, of the People’s Republic of China. In that spirit, I have been keen to deepen ties with the People’s Republic of China and was honoured to accept their very gracious invitation extended by Premier Li Qiang for the Official Visit to be conducted from 12th</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1672</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 August, 2024 to 21st August, 2024. The visit marked a significant step in strengthening bilateral relations and we also explored new avenues of co-operation to benefit our nations and people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Fiji recognises that the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government of China in line with the United Nations resolution on the “One China Principle”. China’s longstanding relationship with Fiji as a true friend who stands firm, particularly when we face difficult periods of isolation from traditional partners following our own political upheavals here in Fiji. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that after 1987, when everyone turned away, China stayed on. That is when we started the Look North Policy internationally. Locally, we have our Look North Policy for Vanua Levu. Sir, for my delegation and I, the Official Visit was both, humbling and very thought-provoking. The visit gave me the privilege to witness for myself, the remarkable progress that had been achieved by China in just three decades since my previous State visit in 1994. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 30 years, China had experienced an unprecedented transformation. Since 1994, China’s Gross Domestic Product has increased from just over US$560 billion to a remarkable US$18.5 trillion today. This is a testament to China’s strategic vision, innovation and pursuit of economic development. In the same period, China has elevated its GDP per capita from a modest US$470 to now at around US$13,000 per capita. This has translated to a significant improvement in the standard of living of the Chinese people. This achievement is even more impressive, given China’s population which has grown from approximately 1.2 billion in 1994 to over 1.4 billion today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, China has significantly reduced its poverty rate, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty, from poverty alleviation to poverty eradication. I was given a book written by the man himself, President Xi Jinping, “ Up and Out of Poverty ” - great reading for all leaders and aspiring leaders. China has significantly reduced its poverty rate, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty in that programme. In comparison, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while Fiji has also made significant strides in its own economic development, it is on a much different scale. Fiji’s own GDP has grown from US$1.9 billion in 1994 to approximately US$5.8 billion today. He has not looked angrily at me to say that I am wrong, so I believe it is correct (referring to HE Zhou Jian, Ambassador of China). Our GDP per capita has similarly improved, Mr. Speaker, Sir, increasing from around US$2,500 in 1994 to over U$6,200 today. These figures reflect steady progress in a country with a population that has grown from just under 750,000 in 1994 to around 980,000 today. While our progress is notable, a comparison to the People's Republic of China highlights that significant difference in scale and speed of development between our two countries. This highlights the importance of recognising our unique challenges, and the need to continuously adapt and learn from global success stories. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my delegation and I witnessed once impoverished villages become communities where residents have grown healthier and wealthier through strong leadership and commitment in the implementation of policies. The remarkable development progress of China is largely attributed to a fundamental shift in the mindset of its people. Seeing the great progress made to lift these communities out of poverty, I was reminded of the Chinese proverb, and I quoted this to them, and they smiled, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and he can feed himself for a lifetime."</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1673 Mr. Speaker, what we witnessed in China is that the Government provided the necessary enabling environment, while it was the people that truly drove development progress. The Official visit to China's Yunnan, Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces, started with a visit to those three remarkable into China's Provinces. ongoing development efforts and facilitated deep and considered analysis of our own development history, our own development journey. three Provinces provided valuable Our visit insights the to I travelled by bullet train, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We were almost running late, and I thought, has someone contacted the driver? They told me, “No, there is no driver.” I said, “Oh!” Mr. Speaker, Sir, each Province showcased unique strengths and innovations that can serve as lessons for our small island economies, particularly in areas such as poverty alleviation and sustainable development. In Yunan Province, Mr. Speaker Sir, I was deeply moved by the infrastructure development and connectivity that have been established to uplift rural communities. Yunnan Province is the most ethnically diverse Province in the People’s Republic of China with 51 ethnic groups. The achievements made in alleviating, and in some cases, eradicating poverty, is impressive. It is instructive and commendable that the Government of China has endeavoured to ensure that really no one is left behind. My delegation and I witnessed this in the minority ethnic villages in Yunnan, who have been lifted out of poverty in a steady, focused and tailored programme of interventions over the last 30 years. Our visit to Malipo County in Yunnan was eye-opening, and we witnessed first-hand how modern infrastructure has transformed the once poverty-stricken county - helping to lift its residents out of poverty. Basic infrastructure such as roads, housing and healthcare facilities are not just symbols of progress, but also links that connect the rural populations to opportunities for a better future. That experience reinforced my belief in the importance of investing and in revitalising the rural, interior and maritime economies in Fiji, to ensure a level playing field for economic prosperity for all citizens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our visit to Fujian Province showcased the innovative technological advancements that are driving China’s economic growth. State-of-the-art logistics, software and automation systems at the Xiamen Port have made it one of the world’s busiest ports, ranked in the top 20 in the world at 13 th place, receiving an average of 45 vessels daily. Again, I saw cranes and all these machines on the wharf, and I was looking to see if there were any operators. Then they took me to the room where young men and women were operating those cranes and things that were working on the wharf. No one was on the plant itself. Given its advanced infrastructure and strategic location, Xiamen Port plays a critical role in fostering economic integration across the maritime Silk Road trade between Asia, Europe and Africa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my delegation and I witnessed first-hand how China is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. It is a lesson, not only for Fiji, but for the rest of the world. I have been hijacked by time, and I will stop here. I would like to pay my respects again to His Excellency the Ambassador, the political and community leadership of China, and I would like to commit to them the friendship and also the understanding of the Government and the people of Fiji to assure the future of peace, security and development. MR. SPEAKER.- I also acknowledge the presence of His Excellency, the Ambassador from China, in the gallery. I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to make their response.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1674</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I quickly respond to the honourable Prime Minister’s Ministerial Statement, I also wish to echo our condolence and sympathy to our Maori brothers and the people of New Zealand for the sad loss of the Maori King. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. May I also congratulate QVS for the Deans win last week. I am a bit reluctant to say this, but congratulations for the win, honourable Prime Minister. May I thank the honourable Prime Minister for finally making the visit to China. I know that it is long overdue. Unfortunately, there was an incident last year that prevented the honourable Prime Minister from making his State visit to China, but thank you, Prime Minister, Sir, for finding time, despite the busy schedule that you have to make that important visit to China. You have highlighted it, Sir. China is strategic, China is important for us as a small country with very less influence, but we always want to make ourselves relevant, particularly within the Foreign Policy that we have. Friends like China are the ones that support us, particularly being part of the permanent five - they are a voice for us when it comes to our very difficult time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let me go back to our Foreign Policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I know that it is important, particularly, for the honourable Prime Minister. You have talked about the guiding principles because Fiji will always follow a policy aimed at maintaining a stable and sustainable system of international relations based on international law and the principles of equality among States in respect of national sovereignty, independence, territorial sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs of States and respect for international treaties as embodied in the UN Charter. We have talked about the bilateral relationship that we have with China and, of course, this is something that we also respect China for, being an economic power, political power, as well as military power. They also, under this mutual respect and co-operation agreement, live to this, particularly with the non-interference, given the problems that we went through, honourable Prime Minister, Sir. Again, the underlying interest for Fiji’s foreign relations is formed by the principles of friends to all and enemies to none. I wish to deliberately bring this to the attention of the House because I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the process of reviewing our Foreign Policy and coming up with a White Paper. I have been part of the consultation, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I did attend to the invitation, and I have also spoken my heart out to the team, particularly when I was asked about the geo-politics. You have stated it, honourable Prime Minister, during our difficult times, that China was with us and that is why it is important that we maintain this strong relationship. I studied our relationship way back when I did an essay, honourable Prime Minister, as part of my Junior Staff Officers (JSO) Course and that is when I saw the “Look North Policy” that we stated way back in1987 that established the Kalabu Tax Free Zone. That was part of your Look North Policy. We have always maintained that. China is important to us and China has set so many good examples. On one extreme, it is a superpower, it is developed, but on the other extreme as well, it is still a developing country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have a lot to learn from them in terms of infrastructure development and the economic environment. May I end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the bell is ringing. You would recall, Sir, in Palau we saw a lot of tourists from East Asia. I know that we are flying to Dallas on 10 th December, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, but there are economic potentials, particularly in terms of tourists and trade as well with the four Provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi. I know there has been</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1675 recent visits by the previous government on these four southern Provinces within China and there are potentials, particularly for trade and, of course, tourism. I do not have time to go into it. There have been some discussions previously, but I hope that we can pick that up to ride on the visit that has been taken by the honourable Prime Minister. I wish to also thank China. His Excellency is in the House, and we still acknowledge China for their contribution to the development of this country. Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for your Ministerial Statement. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the leader of G-9 Bloc or his designate, I would also like to acknowledge the presence of Mr. Tevita Koroi and his good wife out there in the gallery. He used to head the, is it the Fijian Teachers or the Fiji Teachers?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBERS.- Fijian Teachers Association:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- He is back from the US. It is great to see our people coming back to their homeland:</span> Welcome, Mr. Koroi, and your good wife once again to your Parliament. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, good morning to you. I rise to respond very</p><h4>briefly to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister.</h4><p>I thank the honourable Prime Minister for a very comprehensive Statement on his State visit to the People’s Republic of China. For someone who has had the honour and privilege to have served and seen China in the manner in which they have grown and developed as a great nation, I can testify and admit that the Statement by the honourable Prime Minister is something that is not only inspiring, but something that we really can learn a lot from as a small nation like Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our relationship with China goes back a long way. The key pillar, as we have heard this morning from the honourable Prime Minister, is based on the One China Policy. Fiji has stood firm on this Policy since we established the relationship. I am made to understand that the primary purpose of this visit was to strengthen and deepen our relationship again with China. We have also heard from the two speakers that China was one of the few countries that stood firm with us in our days in which we had great difficulties and remained so as of today. There is so much we can learn from China to grow our nation. Reading the report by the honourable Prime Minister, he has visited key Provinces and that is a clear testimony of models that have demonstrated how China has grown and developed in the last 30 years. From Yunnan Province, we have seen a model of how poverty has been able to be turned around, but only through people focussed, people-driven strategy to change the Province around, but also through hard work, commitment and perseverance by the population. We have heard about his visit to Fujian Province and we have seen how technology has been applied to drive a great nation like China. There are many things that we can pick up from Fujian Province to grow and develop our small nation. Fujian Province is a key province in the development of one of our projects in the West on mushrooms. We acknowledge that, Your Excellency, for the great work that your team did here, and Zhejiang Province too on his visit to the great capital of Beijing. I think the key lesson that we can draw from after the visit by the honourable Prime Minister that we hope to apply when our National Development Plan is going to be released is how a nation like China, through its revitalisation programmes, its ability to turn things around from the resources</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1676</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 that it has; a people-focused, people-driven and above all, a very clear strategic vision in what a nation wants to achieve in the years ahead of it. I am excited of the great lessons that the honourable Prime Minister has picked, learnt and explored from China, and I look forward to some of these ideas that could be put into place in our attempt to drive our nation forward, especially in the implementation of our National Development Plan. Honourable Prime Minister, we support your report this morning and on that note, you have the assurance of the G-9 Bloc support to your initiative and measures to drive and move Fiji forward for a better future for our Fijians. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn the House for morning tea. When we return, we will offer the floor to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications to make his Statement. The Parliament adjourned at 10.20 a.m.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1677 The Parliament resumed at 10.52 a.m. Implementation of Commitments Under the IEPA HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, and to those of you who may be listening to this broadcast; ni sa yadra vinaka and good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to inform this august House of the implementation of the commitments under the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) and assure you, Sir, that your Coalition Government is acutely attuned to our beloved country’s trading and market access needs. In this case, we are securing our market access into the European Union. This was the reason we recently sought Cabinet endorsement for the implementation of the Market Access Commitment under the IEPA between the European Union (EU) and the Pacific States. This decision, Sir, reflects Fiji’s ongoing commitment to strengthening trade relations with the EU and safeguarding the interests of our key export sectors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, IEPA has a long history, and the previous government will remember this well. The EU has historically provided unilateral trade preferences to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States under the Lome Convention since 1975. Due to the pressure from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to bring in WTO rules consistent to the preferences that were provided by the EU to the ACP, these were replaced by the Cotonou Agreement with the objective of aligning EU’s trade agreements with WTO rules. Thus, the concept of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) were born. Each of the ACP regions began negotiating EPAs from the year 2000. Formal negotiations between the Pacific and the EU began in 2004. The WTO deadline for the EU and the ACP was eight years to conclude the WTO compatible EPA by 2008. None of the ACP regions were able to meet this deadline, including the Pacific. Given that preferences were coming to an end in 2008, those ACP countries with significant export trade to the EU had the option of initiating an interim EPA to maintain their trade preferences. Sir, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Fiji chose to take this route in November 2007 to protect sugar and fish exports respectively. The initial IEPA still had outstanding and contentious issues, which was the reason the comprehensive EPA negotiations with the Pacific continued. Fiji signed the IEPA in 2009 and with comprehensive EPA negotiations stalled due to differences in the position on issues of fisheries management in the Pacific, Fiji applied the IEPA in July 2014. This was done to ensure that Fiji could continue to export its products, particularly sugar, to the EU. The decision to provisionally apply was also made due to the EU’s decision to withdraw preferences for those ACP countries that had not signed nor ratified the IEPA. Whilst Fiji had provisionally applied the IEPA in 2014, Fiji had not implemented the provisions of IEPA, including the reducing and eliminating of duties as per Fiji’s market access commitments. The IEPA allows us to send our products to the EU without paying duties or tariffs. In return, Fiji has to make similar commitments or what is generally known, Sir, as “Reciprocity in Trade”. As part of an essential pillar of IEPA, Fiji agreed to allow certain products from the EU to be imported into Fiji duty free. Key items, however, were excluded from this commitment to protect Fiji’s revenue and developing industries or what is known as the “Exclusion Basket”. Since its signing, Fiji has benefitted from this arrangement particularly in the sugar sector where the EU member countries collectively accounted for a maximum of up to 90 percent of our total sugar</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1678 exports.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 Despite challenges, such competition and fluctuations in the global sugar prices, the EU has been a consistent and reliable destination for our exports, contributing significantly to our foreign exchange earnings and providing employment opportunities for our people. The IEPA has opened up opportunities to export goods such as tuna, ginger, mineral water and garments with exports to the EU reaching a peak of $132.4 million in 2022. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we do not reciprocate, there is a danger that preferential or duty free access into the EU for Fiji goods under IEPA may be stopped, threatening the present volume of exports. Thus, implementing our market access commitments under IEPA is crucial. This means, Fiji needs to open its markets to goods from the EU under the terms of IEPA. This involves removing tariffs and taxes on imports, on certain products, making it easier for goods from the EU to enter Fiji’s market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that the tariffs committed for elimination under IEPA are effectively removed, Fiji will take several very important steps. This includes establishing a dedicated team to oversee the implementation of these tariff changes, ensuring that they are correctly and efficiently applied. To support this, we will also develop a clear and straightforward set of guidelines that will help customs officials and businesses understand and follow the new rules. Additionally, we will review, and if necessary, update process documents to ensure it aligns with the agreement. We recognise the importance of awareness which is why we will conduct training sessions and workshops for customs officers, trade officials and other key stakeholders. These sessions will equip everyone involved with the knowledge and skills needed to implement the tariff removals effectively. To keep businesses and the public informed, we will also provide clear and accessible information through our Ministry’s website and with direct engagement with business groups. Mr. Speaker, as we move forward, we will continually monitor the process to ensure the tariff eliminations are having the desired positive impact on our economy. This will allow us to address any challenges that may arise promptly. Finally, we will maintain ongoing communication with the EU to resolve any issues that might come up during the implementation, ensuring that this transition is as smooth and beneficial for Fiji. Through these steps, we are committed to fulfilling our obligations under the IEPA while supporting the growth and development of our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to astute negotiations by Fiji’s Trade Team, Fiji’s market access commitment has been reduced from 80 percent to 75 percent through technical amendments made in the last few years. This translates to removing tariffs on 4,916 individual items for imports originating from the EU. Currently, fiscal duties on 32 percent of these lines are already at zero due to the More Favourable Nations (MFN) level, meaning that Fiji only needs to liberalise the remaining 43 percent. Implementing reduction in import duties on the remaining 43 percent is estimated to result in a revenue loss of approximately $737,000 per annum. This estimate is based on the average of import duties generated over the past six years, specifically on the tariff lines Fiji has committed for elimination under the IEPA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current benefits in trade far outweigh any revenue loss that may eventuate from the elimination of tariffs on EU goods. We presently export items such as tuna, ginger, mineral water, garments and kava to the tune of $132 million as mentioned.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1679 In addition, after our decision to implement IEPA, the global sourcing provisions for canned and processed tuna or fish will be activated by the EU as part of their commitment. These flexible rules of the IEPA will allow Fiji to source fish from approved foreign flagged vessels outside of the EEZ, process it onshore, and export duty free into the lucrative market of the EU as Fiji fish. Fiji will then enjoy similar success that PNG has experienced by using this global sourcing provisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership remains vital for Fiji’s economic growth and development. It aligns with our broader trade and development objectives, particularly in terms of diversifying our export base and reducing our reliance on a limited number of trading partners. The implementation of IEPA market access commitment marks a significant step forward in strengthening Fiji’s trade relations with the EU. By implementing these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji not only safeguards its existing markets access, but also opens up new opportunities for growth, particularly in the fisheries sector through the global sourcing provision. The Ministry remains committed to engaging with the EU to ensure that we continue to benefit from this very important partnership. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Opposition, or his designate, for their response. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and fellow Members of Parliament, I want to thank the honourable Minister for his regular updates on these very important Agreements that we are part and parcel of and continue on with the negotiations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as rightfully pointed out by the honourable Minister, the notification of the provisional application of Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA) took place in 2014 and this was, as you have rightfully pointed out, in order to protect our trade in goods and services and our quota and access exposed to the European Union (EU) and was really done to avoid disruption. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are cumbersome processes that are involved in getting all these done which is a barrier to our trade with the EU, especially with respect to rules of origin, et cetera, and this is one of the reasons why it has taken many, many years to actually complete, and in order to also be in compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements, et cetera, these things take a long time to complete. It is a good thing to see that these things are being done and the market access commitments have actually been approved by Cabinet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, tariff liberalisation will only help Fiji but, again, there is a word of caution on it - we must be ensuring also that we do not interfere in our policy space, et cetera, with this particular Agreement. I think there is a great team that is actually involved in getting all these done. The global sourcing issue that has been raised with respect to fish will also mean that more of our fish are able to enter into the EU, especially with fish that have been sourced from different foreign-operated vessels. But we must also be mindful of the compliance that we have to reach with respect to the EU market standards, Mr. Speaker, Sir. These are the things that are important to us. Much debate has been held over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the IEPA and this is something that concerns a lot of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. Now, ACP countries initially are very reluctant to get to the end of this EPA purely because they were considered to have too many bottlenecks, et cetera, and development also is centred at this particular Agreement with respect to most ACP countries. Also, with biosecurity regulations, we need to be updated and strengthened because it hugely has an important aspect of our trade with the EU.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1680</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 One of the aspects also that comes out of this particular Agreement is promotion of agriculture development and trading services, tourism development, et cetera, investment protection and promotion and goods and fisheries. These are hugely important parts of this Agreement, so there is a steady progress that has been made on it. We have also had a very devastating kava ban and I think the honourable Minister also mentioned this, that has been lifted in Germany and should be very good for Fiji and our kava exports. In terms of market access on trade and in goods, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the EU has always interpreted WTO requirements regarding the degree of liberalisation with these EPAs and the regions to liberalise. They are also coming back and saying that we need to liberalise about 80 percent of our trade with the EU. It actually said that it was supposed to be done within 15 odd years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given that they are giving us duty free and quota free market access, this is something that is really important that needs to be done quickly and I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister and the Ministry of Trade Team, in trying to get all of these done because it is very important for our goods and services. It opens up the massive market for us. Again, as I have said earlier, there are certain things that we need to strengthen, but a word of caution - it is something that we are, as a developing country, realise also a little bit along the way, that many of the ACP countries that had signed it were regretting it afterwards because it interfered with that particular space. It is a very delicate Agreement, but I am glad it is moving along at a particular pace where we are actually being protective of our own policy space. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it can only be good for Fiji, but we must learn from the examples that are being shown to us, especially by the Caribbean countries that have gone a little bit further than we have, as well as the African countries. So, the ACP is a good vessel for us to learn from and I wish the honourable Minister well in the further negotiations that needs to be completed. Thank you very much. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate. HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the outset, the G-9 Bloc sincerely appreciates the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications for his comprehensive update on the implementation of the Market Access Commitment under the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the European Union (EU) and the Pacific Island States. Notably, his extensive work in securing Cabinet’s endorsement for this implementation is also much appreciated. The partnership with the EU, which is one of the greatest GDP globally, is an important strategic move for Fiji and all Pacific Island States. This agreement promises an opportunity for diversified trade and potential economic growth. The implementation of Market Access Commitment could specifically lead to increase accessibility to numerous markets as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for our MSME’s possibly facilitating cooperation and economic prosperity for all parties involved. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to request further clarification on these specific measures and consistent updates for all stakeholders to be taken by the Ministry to ensure that this commitment will indeed bring adequate and tangible benefits for our domestic industries, ensuring that Fiji and Pacific Island States businesses, especially the MSME’s can effectively leverage this agreement which is crucial to realising the targeted economic benefits.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1681 Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we trust that the Ministry is also taking into account the potential challenges that are posed by such agreements with binding commitments on environmental protection, climate change and labour rights. It is well known that such economic agreements which poses potential benefits, they often require significant adaptation to the local industries. It would be helpful to understand more about this support and the transitional aid that is to be provided to Fiji and the Pacific Island States in navigating this process. Lastly, it would also be beneficial for us to understand the environmental implications to increase trade activities that could emanate from this agreement. Thank you once again to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his relented efforts in driving our economic growth and his adaptation to maintaining open communication about this development.</p><h4>On this side of the House that I represent, we look forward to engaging further on this critical</h4><h4>subject and I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement.</h4><p>Coastal Fisheries Development Programme HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a statement on the Coastal Fisheries Development Programme implemented by the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry through our servicing centres in the Central, Eastern, Northern and Western Divisions. Mr. Speaker, coastal fisheries resources are fish, invertebrates and plants, including associated habitats, which occur within customary fishing rights areas. These fisheries resources poverty economic provide alleviation, community resilience, and the empowerment of licensed fishers and communities. These resources and associated habitats are under stress due to threats of high fishing pressure, increased coastal development, sedimentation loading and pollution. and nutrition, employment, security growth food and Mr. Speaker, Sir, the estimated annual production of coastal commercial and subsistence fisheries is about 30,700 tonnes annually. This estimation is challenged by the hundreds of landing sites and the 850 coastal communities that depend on these resources for food and income. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coastal Fisheries Development Project's primary focus is to address these threats with clear goals and objectives - addressing overfishing in coral reef areas, supporting food security for our coastal and maritime communities, sustainably maximizing economic returns for our licensed fishers, and enhancing coastal fisheries management and conservation. Mr. Speaker, last year, the Ministry issued 2,816 inshore and 27 deepwater snapper fishing licences to support livelihoods and contribute to economic growth. Recognising the need for Fijians to access nutritious food and safe protein sources and support livelihoods, the Ministry provides accessibility to ice services from the 24 Fisheries Service Centres across the country, with training delivered to licensed fishers and fishing cooperatives on the post-harvest and the use of ice to preserve the seafood quality. Mr. Speaker, 30 fishing cooperatives have been registered, and appropriate training and equipment have been provided for the start-up. The primary purpose is to create investment and</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1682</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 financial stability for fishers, maximise their economic return from fishing, and give them access to any assistance provided through government or financial agencies. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry deployed 13 Fish Aggregating Devices (FAD) to address overfishing in coral reef areas, relieve fishing pressure on the principal reef fish, and promote pelagic fishing to support local demand for pelagic fish. Mr, Speaker, Sir, four community projects were established in the Western Division for sandfish ranching and mangrove crab fattening to support the growing market demand for these coastal commodities. On focussed activities for 2024 to 2025, Mr. Speaker, in this fiscal year, the Ministry will continue to support coastal fisheries and scale up existing projects and activities to improve outcomes and effectiveness. The Coastal Fisheries Development Project has five main work programmes that include the following: (1) Pathway to market initiative that provides essential support for licensed fishers to access better markets, including the improvement of processes along the value chains. (2) Exploring the pelagic and deep-water snapper fisheries will relieve fishing pressure on coral reef areas and maximise economic returns for licensed fishers and fishing cooperatives. (3) Scaling up the locally managed marine areas through species management, ranching, and the grow-out of cultured high-value coastal species such as sandfish. (4) Minimise illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing in Fiji's coastal waters through monitoring, compliance and surveillance. (5) Training and awareness are needed to improve coastal fisheries resource value chain and the management of coastal fisheries resources. Mr. Speaker, the project underscores the need to put less pressure on the coral reef area, particularly on fishing key coral reef fish, such as parrotfish, which has an important ecological role on the coral reefs. The focus is on exploring pelagic and deep-water snapper fishing to increase economic returns and create more opportunities for fishermen and fishing cooperatives. Equipping them with proper boats and fishing equipment and deploying FAD links them to registered fishing cooperatives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coastal Fisheries Development Project also addresses the needs of communities living in the highlands who depend on rivers and streams for food and income. It focusses on improving the value chain of the eel fishery in the highlands, which has an existing niche market in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry is also encouraging Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to develop high-value coastal species for sustainability and to meet market demand. Most of our high-value coastal species are heavily fished and must be developed and improved to create income and opportunities for our communities and contribute to export earnings. Mr. Speaker, the Coastal Fisheries Development Project will undertake fish collection trips in the maritime islands because accessing the primary market in urban areas is difficult. Fish collection trips will be conducted in Lau, Kadavu, Lomaiviti and the Northern Division, as well as the Western Division, to connect the fishers to the primary market. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry will continue to undertake more awareness and focus training in communities and engage in exhibitions to educate and increase awareness of the importance of</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1683 marine and fisheries resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to increase monitoring, compliance and surveillance in our coastal areas regarding illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and ensure that users comply with all fisheries laws and regulations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, much work is needed in the coastal area to ensure the management and development of coastal fisheries resources meet the daily needs of Fijians. Still, the Ministry of Fisheries is determined to deliver on what is expected. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry will ensure that proper fundamentals are set to support these projects, ensuring their longevity and effectiveness in relieving pressure on our depleted fish stocks. Mr. Speaker, last but not least, before I take my seat, I would like to acknowledge and thank the Queen Victoria School U18 Team for successfully defending the Deans Trophy. I would like to thank all the schools and their teams for participating in the 2024 Fiji Secondary School Rugby Season. Vinaka Saka. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu, Minister. You jumped from fisheries to rugby, so that is interesting fishing. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make their response. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the honourable Minister for Fisheries in her brief to Parliament this morning on a very important subject in regards to coastal fisheries. Mr. Speaker, I think the main issue and I thank the honourable Minister for bringing up this subject because most of our costal and island communities greatly depend on the income that is generated by this initiative. She has clearly articulated the various positive moves that have been carried out in helping these coastal communities. Mr. Speaker, if we think and consider the plights of our coastal communities – think of Yadua Island off the coast of Bua, Cikobia to the Northern Point of Udu Point, Wailagilala Island - a coastal community, a small island that consists of a few members who have migrated to Taveuni and have considered that now as their home because the resources have depleted and they could not afford to stay on the island anymore. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Yanuca between Rabi and Taveuni, and then you look at Ono-i-Lau, the most south-eastern portion which also includes Vatoa, there is nothing. If you look at agriculture, they do not even have land to cultivate. If you look at forestry, nothing grows on rocks, it is basically bushes, and if there are any birds that might fly around these islands and drop a few sandalwood seeds among the rocks, they will be able to cultivate sandalwood. Why I am saying this, Mr. Speaker, it is important to emphasise the situation that these isolated communities are being put in, not by force, but basically, this is the place they were born and brought up when they come to populate Fiji. My plea to Government is to provide the resources and assistance to the honourable Minister for Fisheries to be able to help these isolated communities. They have nothing else. The sea is their main source of revenue. We need to give them assistance so that they can do better. I think the honourable Minister has stated that the preservation of sea resources will enable them to trade these resources. The source to market also depends on shipping that connects these very isolated islands and communities which will enable them to generate revenue from these resources.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1684</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 I had created some semblance of trying to generate interest in the bartering system and especially in Lau and the outer islands in Vanua Levu. They trade with their relatives who live in cities and towns their resources, and their relatives buy things that they need which is loaded on to the ship. This benefits their daily living. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I plead to Government to look at this very seriously because if not, these small communities as I have stated, like Naqelelevu, they will leave their islands and move to towns because they need to live and look after their children and their families. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau, for that very thought-provoking statement that you have just made. There is a Fijian tradition known as veisa, where we prepare something of equal value to reciprocate when the other people from the mainland come to us. It is an organised visit, so that is how we trade – we barter. Looking at the Lau Seascape, the very mentioning of the islands that you have stated, honourable Koroilavesau, is something that leaves a question mark too for us who have open waters. Before we still have our qoliqoli out there in Wailagilala and the ones off Udu Point, but it is amazing that in the Lau Seascape, they have organised themselves with the support of the Ministry of Fisheries, and they have allowed them to exist. That is the Yagasa Reef, belonging to the Turaga na Tui Nayau. I am hoping if something could be organised along those lines, as you have suggested, through the Minister for iTaukei Affairs and the Ministry of Fisheries to, sort of, revitalise the usage of all the i qoliqoli there, as a way of ensuring that they get that steady supply of meat, or whatever, to be able to exchange or, sort of, barter, to keep things going economically. That is all I want to add to your statement, Sir, and I thank you. I now offer the floor to the leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement and I fully support the sentiments expressed by honourable Koroilavesau on the issue about coastal fisheries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just mention one upfront, it is said here that it is the Coastal Fisheries Development Project. I hope that if it is still a project, that it will be run as a programme because the funding for it is much better. When you run a project, at the end of the financial year, workers will have to go home, and they wait again for the new financial year to come back. But if it is a programme, they will stay and it provides them stability in their work and they will do their best because for Coastal Fisheries Development, management will be an ongoing thing. We are a maritime nation, we are a group of 300 islands, and it will be an ongoing work, and I suggest that if it is still run as a project that Government can, perhaps, look at it so that it be run as a programme and be funded as a programme. If we compare our coastal fisheries to the other fisheries that we have, which is the offshore fisheries, I think we can agree that it is our offshore fisheries that is managed better. I think the reason behind the better management of our offshore fisheries is because of the links that we have regionally, through the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), internationally through the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). Because of those organisations, there is good data that they get out of our offshore fisheries, and it is through the management of those fisheries, it is done very well because of the data that they get.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1685 The problem with our coastal fisheries, I think, is data. There is very little data that we have on the variety of resources that we have – fish, invertebrate, as the Minister mentioned, plants, and it is that lack of data that all of a sudden, we say, “Let us stop beche-de-mer. It is now over-fished.” So, because we cannot track and manage those resources well because of the lack of data, maybe that is an area that we need to look at and really, in trying to find development partners who can come in and assist us and provide us with good data on the various resources that we have in our coastal fisheries. If we look at coastal fisheries, inshore fisheries versus our offshore fisheries, I stand corrected, but I think it is our inshore fisheries that contributes more to our GDP than our offshore fisheries. Even though we have a lot more export from our offshore fisheries, but it is our coastal fisheries that provides more to our GDP. I remember when I was the Permanent Secretary for Fisheries and Forests, we did a very quick calculation and study on how much money spins locally just from coastal fisheries and it amounted between $30 million to $60 million in a year. That is the amount of money that circulates locally in our local economy because of our inshore fisheries from the commodities that we sell, the fuel that we buy for boats, so there is a lot that our coastal fisheries does to keep our economy alive by circulating that money locally in our local economy. There is always this balance between development and management and conservation, and I think that work - that balance in development and management and conservation is done well if we have data. I think that is an area that we need to, perhaps, invest in, and get good data for our coastal fisheries. I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement, and I certainly support the sentiments expressed by honourable Koroilavesau. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will proceed to the next item.</p></body>
