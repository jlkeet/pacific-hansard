The Parliament adjourned at 3.39 p.m.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>1710</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 4.05 p.m. Distribution of Solar Freezers – Rural Fishing Communities (Question No. 169/2024) HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry update Parliament on the distribution of solar freezers to rural fishing communities? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the distribution of solar freezers to Fiji’s coastal and rural communities is a programme that is designed to address the challenges faced by our isolated fishing communities, particularly, in preserving their catch and ensuring that fish products maintain their quality as they make their way to the markets. This initiative was a result of extensive consultation with these communities with the goal of preventing fish spoilage, reducing post-harvest losses and enhancing the overall value of their catch. It also aligns with our commitment to environmental sustainability, supporting the going green concept by utilising renewable energy resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Fisheries, other Government agencies and international partners, the Ministry has distributed a total of 33 solar freezers to rural fishing communities. This includes 21 solar freezers distributed to the Eastern Division, benefitting communities in Lomaiviti, Kadavu and Lau. The Western Division received nine solar freezers that were delivered to the coastal villages in Yasawa, Ra and Nadroga/Navosa. The Northern Division received five solar freezers which were provided to remote islands of Yadua, Kia and Cikobia. The Central Division received three solar freezers which were distributed to areas including Qoma and Yanuca Island. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues encountered was that the solar freezers were not only distributed by the Ministry of Fisheries and their donor agencies, but were also distributed by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection and the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development through the Commissioners as assistance to our rural communities. One of the issues raised was the different agencies that provided solar freezers and the back-up that was provided in regard to the solar freezers. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if she has faced this issue and if she can look into the matter so that the provision of these solar freezers are centralised so that it is easier to monitor and maintain. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the honourable Member that as of this financial year, the procurement of solar freezers is done entirely with the Ministry. So, the Ministry will procure the solar freezers and distribute it accordingly to the communities that ask for this assistance. MR. SPEAKER.- And the ones that were supplied by the other donors, the Ministry of Women is also involved in it? HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, like what the honourable Member mentioned, in the past, other Government agencies were also donating solar freezers which were then distributed to the communities by the Ministry of Fisheries. But as of this year, the Ministry of Fisheries has decided to take on the initiative to continue this assistance by budgeting for the procurement of solar freezers and distribution to the various communities.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1711 HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her answer. I am wondering, how does the Ministry calculate the impact of these solar freezers? Is it just ticking off the box that the solar freezer is in, or do you have some sort of a measure to ascertain the impact it is having on that community? What sort of things are you looking at? MR. SPEAKER.- I will allow that question to be answered, honourable Minister. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the distribution of solar freezers to our rural fishing communities, as mentioned earlier, the Ministry has distributed a total of 33. With respect to the impact, the communities are assisted with solar freezers because of their geographical location and accessibility. They do not have accessibility to ice plants where they can purchase ice and preserve their catch. There are four factors that the Ministry uses to determine who can receive this assistance: (i) Accessibility and isolation; (ii) Community readiness and organisation; (iii) Previous engagement and data sharing; and (iv) Donor and partner priorities. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the answers that she has provided. I had raised a question of other government agencies that distribute the solar freezers, more so with the divisional Commissioners. My concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is when we visit the different islands, the question arises, will the Ministry of Fisheries repair the solar freezers even though it is distributed by other agencies? Just because of the storage of fish, they think that the Ministry of Fisheries becomes responsible for those units that was distributed by other Ministries and agencies. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, with this initiative, we have seen considerable success and we are also aware of the challenges that have arisen with the distributed units. So, there have been reports of technical issues with solar panels, invertors and battery systems, particularly in areas with inconsistent sunlight and extreme weather conditions. So, the Ministry is actively addressing these issues by working closely with the suppliers to improve the technology and tailor- made systems to the specific needs of each location of each community. Outcome of the 2020 Meeting of PRC4CD (Question No. 170/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the outcome of the 2020 Meeting of the Pacific Regional Council for Early Childhood Development? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Even though I cannot update Parliament on the outcome of the 2020 Meeting because I was not yet a Minister then, nevertheless, the Early Childhood Development topic, especially the policy as it is now, has been a topic of discussion for some time and, therefore, I will share my experience and what has transpired since taking office.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>1712</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 In early February 2023, there was a regional meeting which involved Pacific Island nations that met in Nadi that endorsed the Early Childhood Development and all agreed that it be recognised respectfully in the region. That being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the current development of Early Childhood, what is Early Childhood Development? Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the first 1,000 days of life for an infant, and studies have shown that there is an investment case in terms of a dollar being invested into Early Childhood Development, there is a return of $13 worth of investment. Therefore, I can say that Fiji, within the region, is taking the lead and we are very grateful to the previous Administration for ensuring that Early Childhood Development is a priority of Government. The Ministry of Health together with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection and other relevant Ministries and stakeholders, have formed a steering committee and did consultation. Last month, Cabinet endorsed the National Early Childhood Development Policy and the Monitoring and Evaluation Accountability Learning Framework. Cabinet has also endorsed the Early Childhood Development funding under the respective Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women and Children and Social Protection, to be provided through the normal budgetary process. With that being said, I can also say that as part of the new National Development Plan that is also being factored into the Early Childhood Development Policy, as I have said, Fiji is one of the leaders in the region and we are very grateful to the previous Administration and the current Government on how it is prioritising Early Childhood Development. We are not only ensuring the first 1,000 days of life but we are also ensuring that maternal health is where development starts. So, we are looking into the development and welfare of our mothers during the early stages and in doing so, we want to ensure in our future generation in terms of combatting NCDs, in terms of combatting other current challenges we are facing now, ensuring that we start from an early age, ensuring that our younger generation get the support in terms of their development, they are able to make wise and good choices. Something I believe was not available to the current generation as we speak. That is the current status of the Early Childhood Development, it is a policy now and in the space of the meeting on PIFS in Tonga, I was very fortunate to attend a day, sponsored by UNICEF, to share Fiji’s experience. Fiji is grateful to our development partners, MFAT and UNICEF, for assisting us in this space. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister, I have a question. You have just mentioned UNICEF. In every early childhood workshop, meeting or whatever we may call it, one of the key items on the agenda is nutrition because for Fiji particularly, we have issues with anaemia, stunting and apart from those, under nourished. How is this being handled together with the key agencies involved? Again, I keep asking about Fiji’s Food and Nutrition Security Policy, where is it now because this is a key agenda when it comes to the multilateral partners. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his supplementary question. In short, yes, nutrition is part of Early Childhood Development Policy, as well as immunisation and education. The Food and Nutrition Policy links with the Ministry of Agriculture and I hope very soon we will meet and sit down and see how best that can be brought to the table so that it is adopted. But in short, yes, nutrition is very much part of the Early Childhood Development Policy.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 1713 Written Question Reported Fires and Casualties – July 2021 to July 2024 (Question No. 171/2024) HON.
