<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Current Status and Funds of PIDF (Question No. 161/2024) HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprise and Veteran Affairs inform Parliament on the current status and functions of the Pacific Islands Development Forum? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Naivalurua had a stint as Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs and is fully aware of the circumstances on the establishment and functions of the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF). However, in the interest of parliamentary processes and public information, I have the honour to answer the question. As we are all aware, the PIDF was established in 2013 and mirrored the foreign policy direction of the previous Administration. The establishment of the PIDF was part of a policy crafted to fill the void that emerged when Fiji’s traditional partners held Government then, accountable for</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1686</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 breaches of democratic principles and rules-based order that underpin the foundations of our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PIDF was recognised as an international organisation on September the 4 th of 2015 and was admitted as an official Observer to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in December 2016. The organisation signalled a desire by the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) to engage directly with development partners to address goals in areas such as: • • • Climate change; Food and energy security; and Ocean conservation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PIDF comprises of 12-member PSIDS, civil society organisations and private sector. Key achievements for PIDF, it benefitted Fiji and our PSIDS on a number of fronts, with key accomplishments that I will outline here: (1) The Suva Declaration which was used as a reference point for PSIDS lobbying at COP21 and contributed to the successful outcomes at the Paris Negotiations. (2) The Nadi Bay Declaration which voiced the Pacific’s deep concern for the “lack of comprehension, ambition or commitment by developed nations” towards the consequences of the climate crisis on vulnerable Pacific nations. (3) The Solarisation of the official residences and landmark sites for the Pacific Heads of States supported by UNDP, the UN Office of the South-South Cooperation and the Republic of India. Fiji had extended that to include the residents of the Head of Arab Government and the Prime Minister’s residents, not just limited to the Head of State or His Excellency the President’s residence. (4) Research and Innovation Ecosystems to Address the Impact of Climate Change in the Pacific (RERIPA) with the overall objective to strengthen the Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) ecosystem of small Pacific Island countries. The question also was raised at the recent Pacific Island Leader’s Forum in Tonga, but we managed to allay any fears of any breakaway with the response I gave to them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PIDF operates in a crowded space and is not immune to the challenges faced by regional organisations. Some of these challenges are: (1) Mandate issue due to the highly contested regional space and the evolving regional architecture, PIDF as the youngest regional organisation, continues to face the issue of relevance in the Pacific. (2) Leadership – PIDF continues to be branded as a “Fijian entity” and is negatively denoted to duplicate the existing regional body PIF Secretariat. (3) Financing – voluntary membership contributions impact on the commitment towards work programmes. (4) Governance Structure – the cost for maintaining the current structure is relatively high. (5) Capacity of the Secretariat – in the original design of the organisation, the Secretariat was not intended to be a technical organisation. The way forward for PIDF, in view of the context that brought PIDF into being, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the complexity and multi-layered challenges which PIDF faces, and the outcomes Government seeks from this entity, it is prudent to have an organisation that is in tune and responsive to the needs of Fiji and its people. As such, we are undertaking a review of PIDF with the support of partners to</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1687 repurpose and re-orientate to a “fit for purpose” organisation that will draw on lessons learned while furthering national and regional interests. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have received the views of some Pacific Island countries to maintain the PIDF’s raison de’etre (reason for being) regardless of the name of the organisation, as it serves their interests as well. PIDF has been plagued by some management issues, which we have corrected through prudent internal controls, oversight and improved governance and accountability structure. The PIDF is under review and is transitioning towards becoming an integrated entity that focuses on project delivery across sectors and geographical boundaries. Here, we are leaning towards a fully projectized business model to take this organisation forward. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has had dialogue with current donors who are pleased to continue supporting existing projects and moving into new ones. They are satisfied with the current interim arrangement where the entity is, for the time being, managed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs as its Interim Secretary-General, while ensuring independence of operations with sound oversight on a two-tier accountability and oversight process. An innovative role that donors can play in the governance structure under discussion is receiving positive feedback. Lessons from other regional entities are also being capitalised here. Thus, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new organisation will soon be recognised as an integrated development centre. Whatever name it will be eventually given is immaterial. The purpose and goals that it will pursue for Fiji and its neighbours is more important. It will be a project delivery organisation that is able to receive projects from across Ministries and sectors. It will focus on functional responses through Pacific-specific, nature-based solutions that focus on a model of green growth in blue economies that is in tune with the sustainable development principles. This will also institute incubators to boost sustainable development. An important focus of the governance structure will be in the monitoring, evaluating and learning components. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regionalism is an important development strategy in the Pacific and the soon-to-be Integrated Development Centre (IDC), for a want of a better term, will progress strategies that ensure the interests of relevant sectors including the Pacific family, are upheld. In the process, we envisage that the IDC will elevate support for local sectors and PSIDS’ agenda in partnership with Governments, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and the Private Sector. The IDC will be supported as a research and project-oriented organisation with a mandate that will complement regional and sub-regional organisations and actively support the 2050 Strategy for a Blue Pacific Continent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new IDC will reflect an organisation that is agile to enhance the delivery of our national and regional interests under the SDGs, 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and Fiji’s foreign policy pillars of Sovereignty, Security and Prosperity. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reviewed IDC will portray a development and program focus which will position it as the delivery arm to work across Government and non-government systems within Fiji’s neighbouring PSIDS. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Prime Minister, one of the objectives for PIDF was South- South Cooperation and in terms of South-South Cooperation, one of the major issues as part of that was to do with national capacity development. In light of the fact that we have had some serious migration issues, not just for us but also for our Pacific Island regional neighbours, has the PIDF somewhat erased the anti in terms of us getting more of that out of the PIDF?</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1688</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has been the perception, but I can assure the honourable Member that at the recent PIDF Leaders Meeting, we assured everyone that it is still a regional rather than a national entity, that is also taking very seriously the interest of the Smaller Island Developing economies of the Pacific. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is forwarded to the honourable Prime Minister for a point of clarification. The clarification is that, for the amendments to the PIDF Charter, including name change of organisation requires a two-thirds majority of the members of the Summit and the adoption of a special resolution of the Conference. So, in the light of this, how can Fiji alone change the name or function of PIDF or were other members consulted on this? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe, I have stated it wrongly. That is the proposed name that will have to be taken to the Member States next year. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know the reason as to why PIDF was created and over the years, Fiji Government has been giving funds to PIDF, and in the last budget, $1.2 million was given to PIDF. We have also read reports that has come out, there is an overlap in the work of PIDF and PIFS. In that situation, my question to the honourable Prime Minister, is the continued support to PIDF justified and whether that money should be directed to national development? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point raised by the honourable Member is very relevant or the points are relevant, and they are all part of the review that was being undertaken and will come up with recommendations and how we move forward will depend on how the voting happens when the members decide on the movement forward. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just to shed some light on the issue at stake here – PIDF, where it is heading, name change, et cetera, there will be overlaps. We will be organising a meeting sometimes next year and approval has been given by the honourable Prime Minister. They have discussed this in the Business Committee, to see how best the Pasifika is integrated in its development, it is fully represented, and at the same time, you Parliamentarians ought to be leading the fight there. You ought to be leading the work there. The decision should come from Members of Parliament (MPs), and we are trying to organise a meeting next year in Nadi, which was an outcome of the meeting in Palau. We can get ourselves better organised because the Pacific Islands Forum (PIFs) is already there, the only thing left now is PIDF. Some have branded PIDF as a Fiji outcome, dominated by Fiji but yet, with the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) under the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU), we are already chairing SIDs. The honourable Leader of the Opposition is chairing SIDS but when we try and identify SIDS as part of the Pasifika or the Blue Ocean, that is where the dilemma is. It is difficult because Indonesia would also like to be part of the Pacific. They have their borders fronting the Pacific Ocean, yet there is a bit of a controversy in how they have annexed West Papua. Then you have the decolonisation issue. These are issues that can be better addressed by us, Parliamentarians. You, honourable Members, can better address this, and you take it up through PIF, right up to the IPU, because we have a voice there. That is why we attend COP meetings, just to ensure that the outcome of all the meetings sink down to parliamentary level. Otherwise, bureaucrats will be running the show, and we are at a loss. That is why we are saying the gap exists, honourable Premila Kumar, because in putting forward certain organisations to be, kind of, a yardstick of ensuring that</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1689 we have a say in what comes our way through the very existence of those bodies, it becomes a misnomer again because MPs are not there. It is only the bureaucrats who are there. I am not pointing a finger at the bureaucrats, no! It is you, honourable Members, who should have a say in this. The honourable Prime Minister has raised this, even in the PIF meeting in Tonga, and also in trying to re-organise the PIDF. We are hoping that with the approval that he has already given, that this meeting that we will be hosting next year in Nadi, we will be inviting regional governments. We have about 13 or 14 regional governments in the Pacific and, hopefully, we can get something passed in that meeting that fairly represents the people who have been elected and given the mandate by the people to represent them in their parliament. That is all I want to share. Update on the Secured Transaction Reform - Reserve Bank of Fiji (Question No. 162/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Secured Transaction Reform, including the Personal Property Securities Registry administered by the Reserve Bank of Fiji? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, lending as we all know can entail significant risks and without acceptable collateral to secure the payment is a key issue for credit institutions, you know, who would largely rely on what we call immovable assets land and those entities on land and most Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises may not possess them. In addition, lending secured by moveable property was riskier particularly in the absence of legal and institutional challenges to protect secured parties’ interests in the event of a default. So, the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) with the technical assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) of the ADB led the secured transaction reform essentially to unlock movable financing for MSMEs. The project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was in four phases: • • • • Phase 1 - drafting the legal framework; Phase 2 - establishing the necessary infrastructure; Phase 3 - developing products and services tailored to MSMEs using movable property assets; and Phase 4 - evaluating the impact and promoting the uptake of these products and services by MSMEs. This initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, aims to support the creation and modification of lending products secured by movable assets. When you talk about movable assets, could be personal property, cars, et cetera, you know, to name a few. To date, several banks and credit institutions have developed or adjusted their products to leverage movables financing. This includes simplifying lending applications criteria, introducing value chain and invoice financing products particularly for women led MSMEs. The RBF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continues to maintain what we call Personal Property Securities Registry (PPSR). While working with the ADB and the PSDI to encourage banks and credit institutions in developing new and modified lending products to improve finance to MSMEs, in</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1690</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 particular, based on a baseline survey conducted in 2023, a sample of randomly selected 1,200 MSMEs are being considered for movable financing for the purpose of evaluating the impact of the reform. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, around 18 finance promotion workshops have been conducted across Fiji this year with banks, credit institutions and finance companies to encourage the adoption of these new products amongst MSMEs. The target is to reach 1,200 MSMEs randomly selected as part of a 2023 MSME Baseline Survey to measure the reforms impact. To date, at least 500 of them have agreed to share their data with lenders for potential financing. The RBF continued to promote further uptake among the remaining MSMEs. The PPSR, managed by the RBF, has recorded over 120,000 notices filed by more than 120 client accounts including banks, credit institutions, finance companies, other creditors and their agents such as law firms. So, the Registry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, essentially in an online notice board of security interests enabling lenders and the creditors collectively called secured parties to register notices at any time and place. It allows anyone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conduct public searches on property rights over collateral. This is particularly helpful for prospective secured parties as well as buyers of personal property in private transactions. So, for an example, if you want to buy second hand car or something and you want to check whether it is free of existing security interest. You could simply go to the Registrar and publicly search for that information. As of 31 st April, 2024, the PPSR hosted 119 client accounts including six commercial banks, four credit institutions, 45 law firms, four credit unions and a range of other secured parties, including finance companies, hire purchase companies and motor vehicle dealerships and individuals. The cumulative filings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by type amounted to $124,762 filings including initial 71 percent amendment 4.9 percent, termination 16.5 percent and continuation notices of 7.6 percent. So, majority of these filings are made by commercial banks, credit institutions including Fiji Development Bank. The PPSR services have remained free. For the initial two years following its launch the ADB and PSDI provided funding for the annual maintenance of the Registrar. In 2023, with the impending expiry of the fee period, the RBF Board resolved to continue to subsidise the annual cost of maintaining the Registrar for a further three years to 31 st May 2026. So, to avoid the need for iterative requests for amendments in future and given the potential for indefinite extensions for the fee-free period. It was agreed that the amendment reflect no fee to be charged unless as determined by the Registrar for the following reasons: (1) (2) (3) include the administrative burden for implementing fees; in the best interest of the RBF to continue to promote filings; and linked well with efforts underway to promote new and modified lending products. As such the Registrar is now amended to provide that no fee is to be charged from the date of commencement of the Act until such time has determined by the Registrar. The PPSR is the cornerstone of the Secured Transaction Reform providing an efficient and transparent mechanism for establishing property rights over personal property by lenders and other conditions. So, with the amendment to the Personal Property Securities Regulations 2019, the RBF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue to offer fee-free services to its clients and the public search function remains available free of charge, 24/7. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the groundbreaking</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1691 initiatives of FijiFirst and the Government then supported the Bill that was introduced in Parliament. Today, we can see the result of that particular new Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whenever I travel abroad, I always used to see these buildings carrying this small messages which says, “You can take loan for gold”, and I wondered how that was possible. Through this particular legislation, it is possible today. So, my question to the honourable Minister is, how is the Government ensuring that all stakeholders, including financial institutions, consumers and MSMEs, are fully engaged in benefitting from this initiative? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- As I have said earlier, there is active campaign, there are workshops, and as I have said, a lot of these institutions are actually finding it very useful and people themselves are also finding it useful. That is the reason why RBF is keeping it fee free, we want more people to use that, and more and more MSMEs are using moveable assets as security and it provides the lenders, including banks who are using that to be able to assess and provide loans. So, it is working.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Awareness is not there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> That is what I have said, that workshops and awareness campaigns are being held. You can do that as well, honourable Kumar. (Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for continuing the good work that is put in place to put that measure in place. I think this is something that is of interest to a lot of us, as you have said, micro, small and medium enterprises. So, specifically, the issue that was raised here about awareness, what specific measure are you making sure to get to these people? A lot of them do not probably access a lot of the normal mechanisms that we have, so how is it that we get to those who can really benefit from this? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, the RBF and the data on the register shows that we still need more awareness. We still need to get financial institutions to support this and buy in to the use of the register and that is why we have asked RBF, banking institutions and other institutions with whom we have meetings to discuss this, to go out and promote this. The RBF itself, will be conducting workshops, awareness campaigns so that MSMEs and the institutions are aware. It is just the people and those who are involved in MSMEs, they may not be aware of it, and that is the idea that we need to promote this more aggressively through various forms of campaigns that I have talked about. MR. SPEAKER.- Are you still not satisfied?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> No, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You will never be satisfied:</span></p><p>Status of the Upgrade of Nautoloulou/Cora Road (Question No. 163/2024) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1692</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the status upgrade work at the Nautoloulou/Cora Road in Wainunu, Bua? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Regarding the Nautoloulou/Cora Road in Wainunu, Bu,a Cora Access, according to information provided to me, is 4.2 kilometres inland from the main Kubulau Road towards the coast, while Nautoloulou is 810 metres side road from Cora Access. Most of these, are on freehold properties within the Tikina of Wainunu, Bua, and currently it is not part of the programme, but we have worked closely with the Ministry of Rural Development through the Commissioner’s Office in terms of addressing some of the concerns of the residents there. The access into freehold properties is an issue in terms of the various families who are there and some at times, have fenced off part of their portion and we are looking at further discussions on that. They will need to surrender portion of the land for the road, if we need to move it to make it a public access, so that is something we will need to discuss further with the freehold landowners, so we can have further dialogue on that. MR. SPEAKER.- At least, you are moving, you can have more dialogue on that. I thank the honourable Minister. I just want to say that in the last session of Parliament, I was complaining about the Hibiscus Highway, and I am glad to see that it has begun to improve over this past few weeks. There is still a lot more work to be done. However, on this particular road, when you ask for freehold land to be given, is there any thought of compensation or is it according to the will for them to give it as a gift, in this case, for it to be bequeath to FRA? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- It is part of compulsory acquisition in terms of public access, but we, as a government, it is always important to dialogue with them in terms of that. Personally, I know that there is compulsory acquisition, but we need to look at what needs to go back to the landowners, as we move forward, because if we extrapolate that into the future, there would be huge economic benefits for any public access, not only for this one, but speaking in general. MR. SPEAKER.- If I remember correctly, we have never done compulsory acquisition ever in Fiji. No, there is always this dialogue going on. That is why all the old Queens Road and the old Kings Road get reverted back to the landowners. So, it is an interesting topic, and that is why the honourable Minister is saying more dialogue, more talanoa, and then we take it from there. Vinaka vakalevu, we will move on. Fiji’s Plan on PACER Plus (Question No. 164/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on Fiji’s Plan on Pacer Plus? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, hopefully the way I have answered the question kind of provides the answer, Sir. Our involvement in PACER will rely fundamentally on whether it is good for Fiji. So, in terms of questions on market access and the like, it will be very much dictated on what we actually see.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1693 As I have said, the trade imbalance is quite significant. Some may argue that because of the tourism flows, that vary balance but that is another view. I think as a country that is seeking to diversify its economy, it is important that we actually try and do more in terms of exports to both, Australia and New Zealand. That is certainly one motivation that is motivating me to look at PACER closer. Also, in terms of direct investment into Fiji, we can see that there are a lot of activities in Australia and New Zealand, and it would be good to benefit from that as well. So, in response to honourable Koya’s question, Sir, everything that we will do regarding PACER, will be done as long as Fiji’s economic interests are protected and out of it, generally diversify the Fijian economy which I am sure the whole House agrees is long overdue and is something that we should try and achieve. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, definitely the deficit is huge and you have mentioned about the potentials to increase particularly more of trade from Fiji into Australia and New Zealand. One of the key constraints is the facilities that we have. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the negotiations and liaison with the other agencies because, to facilitate this, we have funded programmes – the Pacific Horticultural and Agriculture Market Access (PHAMA) Plus and Market Development Facility (MDF) because our development partners, Sir, are aware that we lack proper facilities, and we do not qualify in terms of their quarantine regulation. We have just talked about PIDF this morning. Based on the 1994 UNDP Report on Human Security People Centred Development and that is why I asked the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. We are very interested now in your National Development Plan. So, my question, honourable Deputy Prime Minister is the importance of these programmes and the continuation of it because some of these are temporary, how are you handling this and what are the prospects in further extending these programmes to facilitate this? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the honourable Leader of Opposition asked about those particular two agencies, the MDF and PHAMA Plus because certainly from the Ministry of Trade, if you like, using them as extensively as we can. Just to give you some examples, Sir, the discussions around the kava industry, we have used them in particular, because of the research they have done - PHAMA Plus, into kava. Also, we are now talking to MDF about scaling up a study on kava. I know I have talked quite boldly here about a billion-dollar industry, but it is always good to back it up with some analysis. Sir, MDF is actually going in discussion about them assisting with that. Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, one of the things I realised, was somewhat shocked when I went on the New Zealand Trade Mission, the Australian Government said, “you already have market access pathways for more than 20 crop products from Fiji into New Zealand.” Therein lies a bit of a challenge as well, which is why we are reaching out to MDF and PHAMA Plus, talking about pineapple and some other products like that. The medicinal cannabis study was actually done through MDF. In fact, Mr. Speaker, to be quite honest, from the short time I have spent in Government, MDF and PHAMA Plus are two very good agencies that are actually helping with what we are trying to do in terms of economic diversification. They are responsible for helping expand the BPO sector. I was on the other side in the outsource industry executive committee and we actually used MDF to do a scoping study on BPO and then assist the BPO to set up its structure which is now currently running on its own.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1694</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 So, in a nutshell, Sir, in response to the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s question, those two agencies are quite effective in my view in terms of what they do and certainly now from our position, we will continue to use them as best as we can to ensure that we explore opportunities and pathways for further economic diversification. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a $1 billion trade deficit is rather huge and I know when I was the former Minister for Trade, a lot of work was undertaken by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. They conducted impact assessment just to understand that if they sign up with PACER Plus, what would be the impact on the country itself? Mr. Speaker, Sir, my biggest concern at that time and it remains now is the fact that Australia and New Zealand are not accepting our produce from the Pacific. In Australia, you will find uto (breadfruit) in abundance and it is coming from Sri Lanka. The distance is big, whereas from here, it is a short distance. So, we need to, sort of, create a pathway to get more of our produce into our Pacific Island countries, particularly when it is fresh, not frozen. It is a huge challenge because we know protection is one way of survival and, perhaps, that could be one of the reasons why some of our produce cannot reach these markets. So, I would like to ask the honourable Minister, are you talking to these two countries for them to help us to allow this produce to enter their markets? Thank you. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the short answer is, yes. We do recognise that it is called the non-tariff barriers and because of the sovereignty of the two countries, they do have barriers in terms of biosecurity particularly, and other requirements, and there has been an active discussion with them. One other positive outcome during the FijiFirst time was when they actually managed to create a pathway through the ports just recently because of working together with Australia. I am trying to remember the type of treatment that was used, I think, the “hot air treatment”, so that is the type of collaboration that we will need to continue to be able to try and get our market access through. Very briefly, Sir, you probably would have heard me now and again talk about Fiji Water creating agricultural export commodity and some other potential exporters. The very reason for that is, it is nice to have the market access, but we need to produce things at scale. So, the announcement around commercial agriculture is quite particularly driven to us ensuring that once these market access pathways are clear, we can actually maximise them. We are now discovering some very big interest in pineapple, for example, so we are working together with PHAMA Plus and MDF to, hopefully, try and create that pathway but underlying that is a private sector partner, who can be foreign or local, that kind of drives the opportunity, Sir. So, yes, it is going to be an ongoing challenge and in our active conversation, we have some very good people in Biosecurity who are pushing Fiji’s interests, and we hope to ensure that particularly, the non-tariff barriers, are continually addressed. Thank you. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a quick question to the honourable Minister. Honourable Minister, just post the conclusion of PACER Plus, there used to be an Office of the Chief Trade Adviser (OCTA) where appointments were done, et cetera to assist in all these negotiations. Now that we are moving forward in trying to see if we can finalise it with respect to Fiji, will we be appointing someone to provide that extra expertise for us as an independent person or are we just relying on our own expertise?</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1695 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, currently as the honourable Koya will know, there are some very experienced trade negotiators now in our trade team, and what we intend to do is supplement that with the external advice as appropriate, particularly with PACER. We will certainly go down the road of some external advice to just supplement what our local team can do. I think that will be adequate for now, but if there is need for further resourcing, I am sure the honourable Minister for Finance will reach out to you, if required, but certainly for now, there is a budget already for current support. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will suspend proceedings and we adjourn for lunch. We will return at 2.30 p.m. when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.31 p.m.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1696</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.35 p.m. Government’s Future Plan on the CBUL Programme (Question No. 165/2024) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament on the Government’s future plans for the Committee on Better Utilisation of Land Programme that was introduced in 2008? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise in response to the question raised by the honorable Leader of the Opposition regarding Government’s future plans for the Committee on the Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL) programme that was introduced in 2008. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has been providing an annual budget, through the Ministry of Agriculture, since 2008 for the operation of CBUL. This initiative was created to motivate landowners to lease their land for productive agricultural use, as opposed to leaving it unutilised. Landowners were given the chance to renew expired agriculture leases, if they lack the means to make use of the land. The subsidy for lease payments to individual landowners through the CBUL programme was increased from 6 percent to 10 percent over the last few years. Initially, the emphasis was placed on the sugar industry. However, it has gradually expanded into other agricultural commodities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CBUL programme aimed to motivate landowners to give quick consent to lease their land for agriculture purposes. However, there was a lack of feedback regarding the impact of the annual expenditure of $ 6.9 million due to poor monitoring and evaluation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet’s endorsement for the CBUL Programme had expired in 2022 and the last payment of $6.9 million was paid to landowners through iTLTB in the 2023-2024 financial year. Since the impact of the CBUL programme on agriculture production was not that clear, we did not have approval from the Ministry of Finance. There was no budget allocated for the programme in the 2024-2025 financial year. Some of the areas of concerns at the moment are: • • • there may be leases that are active but are not under agriculture production; there may be leases that have expired; and leases that have been rezoned for commercial development but may still be under the CBUL assistance programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the concerns on the CBUL programme, the Ministry recommends that consultations be carried out with iTLTB to agree on a way forward, and below are some potential strategies: (1) If the CBUL programme is to be extended, there needs to be active monitoring by the land administrators on its impact on agriculture production and development, as there is a need to show the impact and return on investments of public funds invested under the programme. The CBUL programme will have to be coordinated through the land administrators, preferably the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, which is the custodian of more than 82.5 percent of our land.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1697 (2) The ALTA Schedule of Values will also need to be reviewed to address the outdated land value which has been a concern to landowners over the years. This review and updating of the ALTA Schedule of Values should ensure that land is leased at a comparable rate to the current market rate, ensuring maximum benefits to the landowners. There is a draft Cabinet Paper that is being circulated to carry out a review of the ALTA Schedule of Values for feedback and support before taking it through DSC and Cabinet for endorsement. Mr. Speaker Sir, in conclusion, if CBUL is to continue, it is essential for the Ministry of Agriculture to supply the lists of agricultural leaseholders who require assistance, determined by the productivity of their land. The main emphasis should extend beyond the lease renewal subsidy. It should also encompass financial assistance for farmers to enhance their productivity further. HON. I. B. SERURATU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. I think the key question that I have is, you have talked about the ALTA Schedule and, of course, the possibility of the continuation. If it is going to be reviewed, particularly on the performance as well, how will this be distributed amongst the key stakeholders that are involved in the CBUL work, particularly on the performances and with the landowning units that are responsible as well in ensuring that leases are available? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in answer to the question, the honourable Member is fully aware because during his time as Minister for Agriculture, we were handling CBUL in the Ministry. The Ministry of Agriculture was simply like a post office; we received the funds, it comes under Head 30 as part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget, we request for the RIE, and we take the whole funds and pass it on to iTLTB. The impact of the programme was not monitored by the Ministry because we simply were the post office for the funds. It appeared under our budget, but we passed the whole sum to iTLTB to administer and dish out the funds to the list of landowners that they provided. The gist of the whole matter is, as custodian of taxpayers’ money, we need to keep account of how those funds have been used and what has been the outcome, what has been the impact of the funds when given out. That has not been very clear under this programme. Should we revisit the programme, which I think was noble in its original intent to fasten the approval of landowners for leases, to have their land leased out rather than having it idle, that was a very noble intent by the government at that time. The Ministry of Agriculture and iTLTB failed miserably because we did not come to terms with the monitoring and evaluation part to see what the real impact of the programme was using some parameters, like agricultural production, and we can go on into crops and livestock. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his reply. I am glad to see that in CBUL too there will be more of an emphasis on making sure there is a measurement of outputs that come out of it. When CBUL was first put in place, it was largely done in relation to sugar. In CBUL too, will this also be looking at a greater extent at the dairy sector? MR. CHAIRMAN.- Is that just a general statement or are you asking a question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> A question, Sir, on the dairy sector.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.:</span> The simple answer is, yes. Since it has now gone from sugar into non-sugar, dairy is part of non-sugar. Yes, honourable Member.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1698</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, honourable Minister for the answer that you have given and the need for review of CBUL. Four years now, landowners have been requesting if there could be an increase from 10 percent, and more. Even the Unimproved Capital Value (UCV) we have is only at 6 percent and CBUL has come in with an additional 4 percent and has given some value to the return of leasing out of land, given landowners in most cases are passive land providers and land is always locked in for a very long time. If that could be considered in the review, and increase of that percentage more towards the market value and also more proper coordination too with iTLTB, given that they are now pushing that landowners are to utilise land or to lease land, to move into entrepreneurship rather than only giving out leases. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for raising that concern from the landowners because that is a real concern regarding native land. It is quite unfair when you look at how the two parcels of land sitting side by side (freehold land and native land). Same kind of multi-million dollar view but when it comes to the value of the two parcels of land, the native land is always of a lower value because of what the honourable Member has raised. So, we will have to consider that. MR. SPEAKER.- May I ask a question, what is now the fate of ALTA? Honourable Usamate is talking about 6 percent to 10 percent increases. These are well explained in this particular legislation and that legislation overrides the Native Land Trust Act. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have clarified with CEO of iTLTB, and this is one of the reasons why I raise this. Sir, ALTA is in existence but that provision on CBUL is just to fast-track things but I think the key question now is the review of ALTA. I think iTLTB is working on it. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the rates is based on the provisions under ALTA and that still continues, but one of the hiccups we had in the Ministry was when there was a decision to wipe out the Land Resource Planning Division. The Director of that Division is the gazetted officer under ALTA. So, when we wiped out the Division, that is why we do not have a review. When I came in as Minister, I brought back that Division. Now the process of reviewing the rates under ALTA has already started. MR. SPEAKER.- There are beautiful clauses in there, bad husbandry that is usually executed by a Permanent Secretary for Agriculture or a Scientific Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture. These are all wonderful parts of the law that in most cases protects the interest of our Indian descent farmers. We have the veto powers in the Bose Levu Vakaturaga in the past. The Indian descent farmers, ALTA was their protection. It is great to hear that you will be reviewing that but again, what baffles me is that it is still in existence, and you brought in CBUL. Where does that leave ALTA? It cannot be in existence somewhere, that is part and parcel of the day to day life of farmers under ALTA. You have got Toko Town lands, those are 999 year leases. Tribunal decisions have been made there because of the predominant use, including the marginal lots in the cane areas of Qeleloa, et cetera. I am just raising that as a point of interest for me because I work under the iTaukei Ministry for 30 years. It is hard to try and put that under the carpet and leave it there when it is very much still in existence. 30-Year National Review Report - Beijing Platform for Action (Question No. 166/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1699 Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection update Parliament on the Beijing Platform for Action 30-Year National Review Report? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, THE honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, and honourable Members of Parliament; good afternoon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the leadership of our Prime Minister in 1995, Fiji endorsed the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. It was a comprehensive global agenda for the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls. Since then, the UN Commission on the Status of Women has taken stock of progress on this platform for action every five years and for Fiji, I am pleased to update this House that last month, Cabinet had endorsed the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) 30-Year National Review Report. So, it has been 30 years, and 30 years, we are again under the able leadership of our honourable Prime Minister to bring this event which will be celebrated next year. The BPfA process provided an opportunity for Fiji to undertake its national review of the 12 critical areas highlighting significant achievements and challenges of women and girls over the past five years. These critical areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are clustered into six dimensions which includes areas such as: inclusive development; social protection; freedom from violence; stigma and stereotypes; (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) gender responsive institutions; and (6) environmental conservation. The Fiji BPfA Plus 30 Review Report drew extensive insights from the Fiji Country Gender Assessment (FCGA) which was approved by Cabinet in 2023 and the work that was conducted by the previous government to get to that point. I acknowledge the contribution of my two former women Ministers. The FCGA was undertaken over the course of two years and realised through a Whole of Government and inclusive consultation process with various stakeholders. In this context in building upon the extensive consultation process for the FCGA and other key recent national strategic initiatives, the BPA Plus 30 Report also benefitted from further consultations and input from civil society, women’s rights organisations, whom I would like to also acknowledge. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the preparation of the report for next year was made much easier with the FCGA. It is important to underline that despite the gendered impacts of the global health pandemic and the continued effects of the climate crisis, Fiji has made strides in advancing gender equality over the last five years. These achievements, as you know, are attributed to the development and implementation of key Whole of Government Gender Equality Policies. These strategic national efforts involved partnerships as I had mentioned with the civil society, NGOs, faith-based organisations and women’s right organisations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, the Report underscored Fiji’s commitment to a Whole of Government evidence-based and transformative approach in rolling out these initiatives and this was commended very well at the Women’s Ministers Meeting and Triennial Meeting in the Marshall Islands where our counterpart women Ministers around the Pacific would like to get more information and also help them to develop such policies in their own countries. As you know, this</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1700</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 includes the National Action Plan to prevent gender-based violence and the upcoming Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment National Action Plan, and Phase Two of the Gender Responsive Budgeting and Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity Development Initiative (ICD). I would just like to at this point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, clarify to members of the public that there is a difference between gender transformative (the use of those words) and transgender. There were some confusion on social media about this and of course there were a lot of criticisms about the initiative, but I would like to clarify that this is not such the case. Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity Development Initiative looks at rolling out or gender mainstreaming across ministries and agencies in terms of planning, budgeting and having policies to that effect. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights significant achievements in critical areas including our social protection policies. Of course, we know all our six programmes that we currently run, looking at specifically supporting women in the areas of Family Assistance Scheme, Care and Protection Allowance for Children, Social Pension Scheme, Rural Pregnant Mothers Programme, Food Voucher Programme as well as the Transport Allowance and, of course, the Disability Allowance Scheme as well. The Report also highlights the challenges that remain, that whilst we celebrate our educational achievements and robust legal and policy foundations, there is a need to ensure these translate into real impacts. What does this mean? That is equal participation in the formal economy. Even though we have over 50 percent of women graduates, we still see a very low participation in the formal economy on the labour participation of women. What is the disconnect there? Mr. Speaker, this is all part of the development of the Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan and that is to look into that. It also includes access to financial resources, there are efforts being made and I thank the line Ministries involved including the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises where women are becoming the focus of the provision of micro-finance for them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also lack of leadership roles in both public and private spheres and we all need to do better to commit to more women participating in these roles. The Report also highlights the high incidents of gender-based violence including technology facilitated gender based violence and also in the area of women’s health. I thank the honourable Minister for Health and his team in their commitment in hopefully developing a policy to deal with cervical cancer in Fiji which is the number one cause of death for women in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, going forward, following the submission of this Review Report, we now anticipate Fiji’s participation at the Regional Review at the Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference in Thailand from 19 th November to 21 st November, 2024 which Fiji has been nominated to be the Vice- Chair. In preparation for the Conference in November, we aim to bring together CSOs, our faith- based organisations and women’s organisations as well to present the report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN Women and I thank the UN Women Fiji Multi-Country Office for collaborating with our team in the Ministry to prepare for this and our Government delegations which Fiji will be part of. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we approach this remarkable 30 th Anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action in 2025, the Beijing Platform for Action +30 Review Report will showcase not just statistics but the resilience and successes of our Fijian women and girls in all their diversity. Fiji stands as a leader, stands at this pivotal juncture, one we will not only celebrate our achievements but also confront the challenges that continue to persist in the struggle for gender equality and an</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1701 urgent call for action. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, where there is support for the BPfA but in relevance to gender equality inclusion, gender based violence and women protection, I would like to give the honourable Minister a reality check because the Fiji Police statistics states that 25 percent of crimes against women increased in June, 39 percent increase in July, a young lady died from a ferris wheel incident and we have a child that got injured at the Hibiscus Festival as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of talk about a better future, policies, events, that is fine. What about the present? While there is support for BPfA and the Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan, what action is your Ministry taking to take care of these women who are victims of these crimes in Fiji? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Sharma for the question. I want to start off by stating that it is not just the Ministry’s responsibility to deal with gender-based violence. It is the whole of Government, whole of society approach that needs to be undertaken. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is correct, in the last ten years, the statistics have not changed where two out of three women continue to face violence in their lifetimes. So, it has not changed under the previous government and so with the development and implementation of a National Action Plan, the key words are “prevention of violence before it starts”. We do need to take a different approach to actually address the root causes of violence against women and girls and that is patriarchy, it is currently being implemented …. HON. P. K. BALA.- Be yourself! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Yes, it was actually 10 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that under the previous government as well…. (Honourable Opposition Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> What is happening now….</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- If honourable Sharma, honourable Kumar and other Members were paying attention, we are now looking at key settings under the National Action Plan.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Microwaving:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> In fact for the very first time, our traditional leaders have said that they have even come together to be called by Government, by our Ministry to even discuss gender based violence. It has never been done before and for the very first time, our Great Council of Chiefs as well as our provincial chairs have come together to discuss this matter, Mr. Speaker, because we need to address the root causes of it and that is patriarchy. With these settings, it also includes the health setting as well as the education setting. We are working with our line Ministries to be able to address this in the education curriculum to educate our children about gender-based violence, about violence against children and developing healthy relationships between boys and girls. Values based education, this is something that they did</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1702</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 not address in the past, Mr. Speaker, and this needs to be inculcated in the education curriculum which is part of the education curriculum review. Also in the health setting, Mr. Speaker, children do present themselves as too late or even women, the abuse has happened but how do we support the health system in terms of educating our people, educating our children and women as well as boys and men? Boys and men have not been engaged in the past, Mr. Speaker. This is something we will be doing differently this time; to talk to our men and boys. They cannot be left out of the equation. Mr. Speaker, as we implement this National Action Plan, we will be conducting a survey, and this survey will inform a communications campaign and the messaging to members of the public on how to prevent violence before it starts and that is within the four-year plan. It has already been, yes you are right, one-and-a-half years and we have another two-and-a-half years to go. We thank the Australian Government for supporting this initiative as we continue to roll out the implementation of this plan. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I want to thank the honourable Minister for bringing this topic into this Parliament. Just to let the honourable Minister know, whatever you say now, were all done during our time. However, we have to move forward. Now, there are certain things that are not being covered, not even in Parliament, not even by laws and it is of great concern. We can learn from other countries like, for example, coercive control. Coercive control is now taken very seriously in other parts of the world, and we would like to see that this is also included in your plan, change the legislation and make it criminal so that we can protect women who suffer in silence. (Honourable Government Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not for you too. I will ask when I want to ask:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need champions in the area, we need champions in this area, we need more men to stand up and protect women and we need more champions in this Parliament. Women issues should not be left to women to solve because it is not created by women. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- We know that! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- You know it but what are you doing about it? Do something, knowing is not good enough, do something about it. You are in the Government, change the laws, enforce the laws, just do not work on the surveys, plans, implementation and consultation. We have to move away from it; action is what we need.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> Sorry, Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond to honourable Premila Kumar.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, there was a statement she made that was actually incorrect and I would like to correct her. In the last 10 years, they have not conducted a survey to men and boys and women and girls. In our survey that we will be conducting, we will be conducting to … (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1703 MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- … question men and boys as well, and this has never been done before. We are doing this under this National Action Plan. We need to include our men and boys, and honourable Kumar brought up a very valid point, thank you. We do need male advocates for gender equality, and I thank the honourable Member’s initiative that will be coming soon, thank you, through the CWP that we may be seeing that kind of initiative here in Parliament where we do address the issue of coercive control as a crime. So, we are working on that also as a Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Group. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the honourable Minister. Thank you for talking about women empowerment, but two of our senior diplomats just got sacked from our Foreign Missions and they are now pursuing their cases. One is the Deputy PRUN in New York and one is the Counsellor in Australia. Is your Ministry going to investigate this?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, our Ministry has not received any formal complaint about these sacking. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- I will live it to the line Minister concerned to address that. If any complaints comes to the line Minister’s desk, that is, the honourable Prime Minister, and if there is any issue about them on the basis of being a woman, then we may or may not be involved. I will leave it to the discretion and the decision of the line Minister concerned. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, five about minutes ago you responded to honourable Rinesh Sharma, where you said that the root cause of gender based violence is patriarchy. Is that evidence-based, honourable Minister, and could we see it? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of literature proven by statistics on the basis that patriarchy is a root cause of gender inequality and that is the unequal power between men and women in decision making. I exhort Members who have questions about this to, please, have a read on it. We have conducted the evidence-based, all of government and society approach in the National Action Plan, which is already documented and the survey conducted by thousands of Fijians identified patriarchy as the root cause. This is the first Government document, first official document to actually state that patriarchy is the root cause. That is actually an achievement in itself, Mr. Speaker, coming from the thousands of Fijians who were consulted and surveyed for the National Action Plan to prevent gender-based violence. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I had asked gender-based violence not equalities because she mentioned the root cause of gender based equality now. I was actually talking about violence. MR. SPEAKER.- She has responded by saying that the survey they conducted brought out this continuance of gender based violence, based on patriarchal position because we are a developing</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1704</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 country. Everything we will try and strive for, we have to come to understand or first of all, try and understand fully where we are; we are a developing nation. We are tied by traditions and cultures; ours is better even though its patriarchal. Then you have the ones that exist in very extreme situations like the Talibans, et cetera. That is a different kind of world altogether that they live in, they do the worst of the worst and as such, I kind of agree with that finding that at least that has come up - the patriarchal influence. In Fiji, that is the way it is, the culture and tradition are mostly patriarchal. In other parts of the Pacific, you go up to Micronesia, it is matriarchal. That is in our world. At least, we are kind of moving ahead slowly, but compared to some other countries in the region, it is quite difficult. Tonga, for instance, they could not ratify that because their Commissioner of Police punched the wife, so tradition and culture still very much operates in that area. I hope I am sharing that to bring some light into what we are discussing here. Benefits of PPP for the Healthcare Sector (Question No. 167/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the benefits of the Public-Private Partnership approach for the healthcare sector (and I am sure he is not going to tell us it is going to depend on the survey)? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Usamate for asking the question on behalf of the honourable Maharaj who is not here with us. Nevertheless, I will try and answer with the best of my ability. Are you referring to PPP in general or in particular to Aspen Lautoka Hospital or the GP Scheme?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- In general:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> He has fired the question, the bullet still has not landed, so he is making some adjustments again. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I will answer the question based on what we, as a Ministry faced, not from any survey done. There are benefits of PPP, as you are well aware. As previous government you should be well aware of the PPP arrangement and how it was brought in during COVID-19 and the PPP arrangements with Aspen Medical so basically, you would know most of the answers to this question. As we would say in Taveuni, taro va Wainikeli - you ask when you already know the answer. That being said, Mr. Speaker, I will try and answer it first from the perspective of PPP with GPs and what the Ministry is also doing in terms of the new arrangements and the programmes that are in place, then touch a little bit on the issue with Aspen Medical. Before touching on the benefits, since taking office, we have noted the challenges in trying to ensure that PPP goes ahead and, at the same time, in terms of monitoring and evaluation - the impacts it has on why it was made in the first place. We are well aware that it was done during COVID to assist with the busy schedule of public hospitals but then, it moved further. So, there are numerous PPPs, together with the Ministry of Health and the private sector. That is to do with laundry, security and other services like radiology, et cetera, which are being outsourced when the need arises.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1705 In terms of the benefits of the PPP arrangement, as we speak, we have the: • • • • Free Medicine Scheme. So, 59,000 individuals have been registered under this Scheme to date. Kidney Dialysis Subsidies Scheme where 419 individuals have been registered and are doing it. PPP for GPs where 17 are engaged as of 2021 and currently, 59 GPs are engaged in the Scheme todate. 54 Hospitals have outsourced security services and five Hospitals have outsourced housekeeping services - CWM Hospital, Labasa Hospital, Nadi Hospital, Sigatoka Hospital and Navosa Hospital. With any agreement, there are also risks and if preparatory work is not done right, then what we are currently experiencing are the risks from those issues. Some of the risks include: (1) Poor understanding and application of the concept of Public Private Partnership (PPP). (2) Weak institutional capacity in the public sector agencies. (3) Donor-driven PPPs that lose momentum and the interest die down. (4) Lack or weak monitoring which is an area we are trying to improve on. (5) Limited sustainable resources. (6) Political affinities and inability to sustain the PPP arrangement. (7) Peace and order at PPP site. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, the arrangement between Government and Health Care Fiji, which is the concessionaire, on how it manages Aspen, as it is, they have brought in new services that has improved the quality of services at Lautoka Hospital, such as the: • Modern Accident and Emergency Department; • • • • • New radiology equipment; a theatre; a Cardiology Unit which tends to look after, I can say, low risk cardiac cases; open cardiac surgery; and other areas within the Lautoka Hospital and also the new Ba Aspen. Again, the benefits are there but in terms of how planning was done, I believe it was not done properly. Since taking office, it was the first time for me, together with the Permanent Secretary and our Senior Executives at the Ministry of Health, to be looking at the Concessional Agreement. I believe, if anything that has to do with health, it should involve health from the initial stages of partnership. Nevertheless, it is something that Government is trying to look at how best we can come out of it because as it is, they are employing our former staff, and they are providing much needed services within the Western Division. I have mentioned some of the benefits in both, the PPP arrangement between the GPs and the current one we are having with Lautoka Aspen and Ba, and I am willing to take questions with regards to any clarification. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I want to thank the honourable Minister for informing this House that there are benefits on Public Private Partnership (PPP). Thank you for the honest answer.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1706</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the Budget Debate, I did raise this, but the answer was not given or provided that before Aspen took over the Ba and Lautoka Hospitals, what was the cost of the operations at that point in time? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, honourable Bala, for your supplementation question. As I had alluded to, the Ministry of Health was not involved in the initial arrangement or the concessional agreement. Therefore, I cannot answer the question that he is asking. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just asking what was the cost of operations for Ba and Lautoka Hospitals before Aspen took over? (Honourable Government Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> I am not asking you, you are not the Minister for Health.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- It is much less than what you are paying right now. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I have a supplementary question. We thank the honourable Minister for the answer, especially, on the benefits of keeping the PPP. He has also mentioned about the monitoring and evaluation of how this programme has been rolled out. With all the PPP agencies that are available whether it be Dental, General Practitioner (GP) or private hospital, there was accreditation done by the Fiji Medical and Dental Council for the facility, the specialist licence, et cetera. There has been a lot of deaths lately in our public sector. So, we must keep the PPP, enhance it and improve it. My question to the honourable Minister is whether accreditation was done with the public sector, as well in carrying out their healthcare services. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- By law, accreditation is a must before you are allowed to practise. For doctors, accreditation is done by the Fiji Medical and Dental Council. I am sure he knows this very well. For nurses, accreditation is done by the Fiji Nursing Council, as well as other cadre. To answer his question, yes, by law, accreditation is a must before anyone is allowed to practise locally or coming in from overseas to try and practise in Fiji. FRA Plans for Road Extension – Tawake to Wainika Village (Question No. 168/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on plans by the Fiji Roads Authority to extend the road from Tawake to Wainika Village in the Udu Peninsula in Cakaudrove? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for that question. In terms of the route from Tawake to Wainika in the Udu Peninsula, that is part of the Rural Roads Programme in terms of the programme of Fiji Roads Authority (FRA). As of now, there have been progress in terms of the survey works. It is about 10 kilometres within the District of Tawake, Cakaudrove, and currently progressing with final design, including alignment detail, et cetera. There are also due diligent processes to be undertaken in terms of the land, environment and also social safeguard requirements before the project begins. So, it is crucial that these are all covered</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1707 in order that the project progresses smoothly and meets the needs of the community, of course, with their input into the project. In terms of design, as I have mentioned, we are looking at the completion of the complete design and technical specifications, that due diligence, as I have mentioned, and also a tentative budget. It is not in the current budget, but once that work is complete, we envisage to include that in the 2025-2026 Budget. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for informing us of the plans for this road which has been talked about at the end of 2022, and we were looking forward to it. I am just trying to confirm with the Minister whether the road from Lagi down to Tawake that will connect with the new one, is that road in working condition, and if it is not, is that something that you will also upgrade? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, according to Manager North, that has been part of the current maintenance programme but I will have to double check with him. We will need to crosscheck with him again. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just clarify because in 2022, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics visited the area and that was about Wainigadru to Wainika. You have talked about Tawake to Wainika. The problem with Lagi to Tawake is the hill. You have to do a big cut on the hill from Lagi to Tawake, so that it becomes accessible. That is the big challenge. So, is it Tawake to Wainika or Wainigadru to Wainika. Thank you. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- He is sharing his experience from up there in the North. (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The question is Tawake to Wainiika and that is the information that has been provided to me. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question. Honourable Minister, one of the problems in the past but I am not sure about now, after the road has been designed and constructed, is trying to get the PSV vehicle to service those roads, especially the heavy ones. The aggregation part of the road to be able to accommodate heavy PSV vehicles such as carriers and buses, is that part of this project, or is it only like a one stop shop for the construction of road? I noticed that the one in Cakaudrove, especially in the Wailevu area for the Vuadomo Road, Natua Road and Vunidamoli Road, they have been constructed but they are having the problem of trying to get PSV vehicles on those roads. What measures are you taking to ensure that roads are being constructed and accredited to service heavy PSV vehicles? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, definitely, if we construct roads, of course, they should cater for PSV vehicles. From my understanding, that should be done accordingly as per the specifications and technical requirements when we do roads. So, when it is done, it is according to those specifications which will definitely cater for all vehicles, including PSV vehicles, such as public buses and carriers or taxis.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1708</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2 nd September, 2024 I accept that there have been issues after roads are done and the maintenance, but that is something we are working on to ensure that, that programme maintenance is monitored and done as and when it is needed rather than being left there to deteriorate, like in the last 16 years. In terms of what had happened with the withdrawal or closure of PWD, it has impacted on the programme maintenance because they were based on location in various areas in Fiji with the required equipment, such as graders, rollers, deep truck - the basic equipment. That was withdrawn and, definitely, that created problems because you withdrew that public service and replaced it with private contractors. Unfortunately, that standard has not matched, or the efficiency does not match with the operations of the depots. I suppose, moving forward, that is something as a government, you and us, it is not us against you, we need to work together and have the right mix in terms of moving forward. So that is something we are looking forward to in terms of acquisition for the depots to supplement the programme maintenance side. MR. SPEAKER.- He wants the right mix. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, just leading on the supplementary question about PSV access to these villages. The base permit for these PSV vehicles from the village to towns need to be considered as well in the specification. I just want to ask the honourable Minister if that is part of it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> We are moving from PWD, FRA to LTA.</p><p>(Laughter) I will not answer that because there is a question on that tomorrow to be asked by honourable Tuinaceva. Before I finish, we had discussed land acquisition, that is clearly specified in Section 27 of the Constitution, I mean your Constitution, necessary public purpose. So, it is clearly specified there in terms of the owner who will be promptly paid an agreed compensation for property. There is also a framework which had been developed by FRA regarding that. There are various steps in terms of that acquisition including the various social economic analysis which needs to be done, including proper consultation before any project is started, that needs to be all paid for and dealt with. So that is the process being followed. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this junction for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
