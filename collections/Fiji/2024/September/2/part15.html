<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT ON THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES ANDOTHER ENTITIES’ 2019-2022 AUDIT REPORTS</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT ON THE PUBLIC ENTERPRISES AND OTHER ENTITIES’ 2019-2022 AUDIT REPORTS HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review of the Audit Reports on Public Enterprises and Other Entities for the audit year ending from 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 which was tabled on 8 th August, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion .</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I, as Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts do move the motion and take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the review of the Audit Reports on Public Enterprises and Other Entities for the audit year ending from 2019 to 2020 and 2021to 2022. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as one can see from the Report, they were for the audit years ending 2019 to 2020and 2021to 2022, that is, during the previous Government’s reign and there are few important points to note. The 2019 to 2020 audit accounts were sent over to the then Speaker on 17 th September, 2021and referred to the Committee on 23 rd September, 2021 and was not looked into before the Government changed hands. So, there were 11 financial statements, 11 audit opinions, 10 qualified or unmodified and one qualified. In 2021-2022, the audit report was sent over to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 30 th March, 2023 and referred to the Committee on 6 th April, 2023. It covered 30 financial statements, out of those, 25 were issued with qualified opinions and five were with modified opinions which included Walesi, Fiji, Food Processors Fiji, Fiji Rice PTE Limited and Yaqara Pastoral Company Pte Limited. Sir, I have already highlighted some of the common findings identified by the Committee and I wish to reiterate the significant matters that needs to be brought to the attention of the House for 1 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 171/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure I.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1714 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 2 nd September, 2024 consideration includes the delay. Public enterprises and other responsible Ministries to address significant delays in submission of quality draft financial statements for audit. They have to be carried out by those respective Boards and those in the Ministry of Public Enterprises and those Ministries responsible, including the Permanent Secretary and the Minister. We believe that the previous Government did not carry out its supervisory role on this. As an example, we note a lot of delays, the worst is Fiji Investment Corporation Limited which has not provided its accounts for audit from 2006 and also Viti Corporation’s last audit was in 2007. Apart from that, there were system issues, staff issues and continue to other issues as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second is qualified opinions that needs to be rectified as soon as possible by the current administration. The third is the auditor needs to be an external auditor or a certified one for all State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and should have the powers to carry out audit. Their financial or performance on those organisations that receive funding from the Government directly or indirectly to ensure that the findings can be reported to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few that are still outside the ambit of the Office of the Auditor- General and they are Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Sugar Corporation. We wish to thank Fiji Airways, they have already produced theirs last month, Air Terminal Services, Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited and Fiji Ports Corporation Limited. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the findings, there were recommendations as well based on those findings and we wish that the Ministry of Public Enterprises carried out most or all of those recommendations including one that I probably assume is important which is all these Public Enterprises to be well supervised by the Ministry of Public Enterprises, as well as Ministries responsible. Even better, to have a separate ministry of its own with the Minister, so as not to fall back into what happened in the last Government, where a Minister was responsible for a lot of portfolios. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and for that, I also have a list of speakers supplied by the two Whips, as follows: (1) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (2) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprise and Veteran Affairs; (3) Honourable H. Chand; (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Aviation; and (5) Honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this motion. Before I begin, I want to acknowledge the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for their thorough Report and for presenting practical recommendations, which is cost effective that we must consider seriously. Mr. Speaker, Sir, State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are vital to our nation’s economic growth. They manage crucial infrastructure such as, ports, housing, transport utilities, financial services and agriculture. They provide services that are not just essential for our daily lives, but also for the functioning of businesses across the country. Many of these SOEs operate as monopolies, and we know, EFL, Fiji Airways and many more, which means there is no competition to drive innovation, improve efficiency or deliver better services to the people.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 1715 While SOEs are meant to serve the interest of the people and the private sector, their track record is often marred by inefficiency, bureaucracy, corruption, lack of competition and mismanagement. These are recuring issues that demand immediate and serious attention. We all know that when SOEs fail to be profitable or break even, they become a financial burden on the Government, draining resources that could otherwise be invested in crucial sectors like, health and education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot allow our economic progress to be held back by inefficiencies within the SOEs. Reform is essential and we must continue to create opportunities for private sector engagement or Public-Private Partnerships. The Committee made eight recommendations, and being a Member of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, we also received some of these reports on SOEs, not all, but few reports come to us. Based on our experience, working with these reports, I fully support the recommendations made by the Committee. Recommendations 1 and 2 suggests that smaller public enterprises with similar nature of businesses or synergies should be merged. This is to be done to enhance strategic direction, governance and improve cost efficiency. For example, shared services, this can allow entities to pull resources such as accountants, HR personnel, internal auditors, and even accounting software, a similar arrangement we had introduced with the Ministry of Local Government with all 13 Municipal Councils. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a clear example is Fiji Meats Industry Board (FMIB) and Yaqara Pastoral. These entities are struggling with no clear direction, both operating at a loss. Yaqara Pastoral is engaged in cattle farming to produce high quality beef, while FMIB is in the business of slaughtering animals. The FMIB is finding it difficult to keep its abattoirs operational daily due to low throughputs. Let me just emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that FMIB has land worth around $31.9 million, which is not producing any results, it is just there. They are not using it to create revenue. A single board could oversee both operations more effectively and we know that when the boards are separate, they become territorial, but if you have a single board, there will be a single vision, and they will be able to drive the process to success. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when SOEs consistently fail to submit annual reports or operate commercially, it points to a deeper issue - the appointment of Board of Directors. Are we appointing fit and proper persons to look after these entities? We must stop appointing Permanent Secretaries and CEOs to other Boards when they fail to manage their ministries or companies. We need merit-based appointments, selecting individuals with strong financial or commercial expertise. If board members are not delivering, the Government must be prepared to replace them. It is concerning that some SOEs are unable to submit timely Annual Reports. They rely on private accounting firms to prepare their financial statements and strategic plans. This raised a serious question, why are we paying the CEOs and financial officers if they cannot perform this basic function? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also recommended that the Ministry of Public Enterprises be established as a standalone Ministry. This Ministry would focus on modernising processes, strengthening institutional capacity, developing a corporate culture, implementing the Public Enterprise Act and monitoring SOE performance to ensure efficient service delivery and better returns for the Government. I just want to highlight that not all SOEs are commercially based. There are some which are created to perform basic functions for the public, they are not expected to generate any massive revenue.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1716 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 2 nd September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SOE portfolio has a total asset-base of over $9 billion in 2022, yielding only $30.8 million in dividends during the COVID period. The Government is expecting a lot more in dividends from these SOEs, now that the situation has normalised, we are back into business and so forth. However, even considering that, this return is far too low for the scale of assets involved; $9 billion is a lot of money. It is evident that a dedicated Ministry is justified to oversee and optimise the performance of SOEs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government initiated the reform process with the enactment of Public Enterprise Act in 2019 to improve SOE governance and commercial frameworks. The legislation places a single Minister in charge of overseeing SOEs. This clearly defines Director duties, sets out governance practices, simplifies SOE legal structures and clarifies the processes for community service obligations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Asian Development Bank’s Finding Balance 2023 Report which I understand, honourable Gavoka was the chief guest, Fiji’s SOE portfolio was among the best performance in the region from 2015 to 2020 largely due to the various reforms. However, the Report also identified gaps in the Act. There are no specific deadlines for the SOE to submit their accounts to the responsible Minister nor is there a requirement for these accounts to be presented in Parliament. This is the finding of ADB. However, in my personal view, individual legislation guiding the entity has provisions on the submission of Annual Reports to Parliament. In 2015, the FijiFirst Government established for the first time a government company called Asset Fiji Limited to allow divestment of shares to the private sector without selling Government assets, as we saw with the past government. The honourable Prime Minister is very well aware of the sale of Government Shipyard and the National Bank of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government divested shares in Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Limited and the Government Printery and when that was done, there was a lot of noise being made that we had sold the assets. In fact, the assets were invested into Asset Fiji Limited and the shares in business were divested to private companies. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that the Government remains committed to improving our SOE to deliver better results for our people. We have a duty to all Fijians to ensure that these enterprises fulfil their intended roles and contribute meaningfully to our nation’s development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion before us. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not normal for this thing to be brought up during one of these debates as we only have 10 minutes. I have a prepared text of 103 pages and most of the things that I will say will come from both sides of the House, and I thank the honourable Member who has just taken the floor, for highlighting some of the issues that are also highlighted here in this contribution. On the general recommendation, she has spoken on some of those. I will very, very generally and quickly go over the first one on public enterprises should merge for better strategic direction as reported by the Committee. The comments are noted, and the Ministry will explore the recommendations further and the entities themselves and the stakeholders. I was just thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that, perhaps we can relook at the procedures in our parliamentary processes, particularly with the Public Accounts Committee and the various</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 1717 recommendations they make, particularly also in the case where we are looking at almost generational reports that cover so many years and all the enterprises. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to that, perhaps it would have been better if we put all our comments from the Ministries and the Accounting Officers and CEOs of those entities to have their recommendation put back to the Committee in a matrix. They make the matrix and look at those and see if they can recommend to Government a series of actions that can be taken to better the systems, improve the awareness of Government of what is going on in the public enterprises and also inform the people about the performance of their enterprises. That is, perhaps, something for the Committee, and I do not know which Committee, we will put that recommendation to. Strengthening its monitoring, that is also taken into account and your response in the recommendation is that some of these are aligned to the Companies Act 2015 and support the modernisation of operations within our public enterprises and the various recommendations that touch on that aspect will continue to be improved. On the fourth general recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is, all public enterprises accounts are updated by 2025. That is noted and the Public Enterprises leadership will be encouraged to complete the actions in accordance with that recommendation. On the fifth general recommendation, on the size, strength and opportunities and potentials, et cetera, the response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the Ministry of Public Enterprises is a standalone Ministry under the leadership of the Prime Minister at the moment. It could be reallocated to another Minister. It is a big responsibility. When the Prime Minister is looking after Foreign Affairs, as well as the Public Service, perhaps, it warrants the commitment of a dedicated Minister to look at those. The Ministry has a total of 31 positions with 22 filled. There are nine Technical Officers and 13 Administration and Accounts Officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the technical positions are understaffed. However, the Ministry is currently in its recruitment phase. The sixth general recommendation, the enterprises should focus on their core business and ensure they achieve the 10 percent return. The response to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is noted and prior to 2019, public enterprises were required to provide the 10 percent return as required on equity to Government. However, given the unique nature of their respective operations, this may not be the most equitable course of action. Certain public enterprises, particularly those in the agricultural sector, operate in a very competitive environment, while others are doing remarkably well. Furthermore, following the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these entities suffered losses and were not obliged to provide any form of returns and were scrutinised to utilise whatever profits they generated back into their operations. The seventh recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministry to follow-up those public enterprises’ accounts that are not up to date, the Ministry will work in very close collaboration with the relevant stakeholders. On the eighth recommendation that all public enterprises should thoroughly review their current accounting systems and consider implementing an accounting system that would provide accurate and timely financial reporting, including a uniform system that can be used by all and consolidate all as well, the comments are also noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir. However, it is very important to note that each public enterprise differs in nature of operations and sizes, as having a uniform system may not work for all entities, as they are part of different sectors and industries.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1718 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 2 nd September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the Committee findings, the Fiji Hardwood Corporation’s audit was completed, and Financial Statement was issued for signing on 23 rd June, 2022. The company is yet to return the Financial Statement, and the Committee asked, why? The Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, delayed the signing as there was a change in the Board composition. The matter has been addressed and the Board has signed the 2018-2019, and the 2019-2021 Audit Report is in progress and now with the Office of the Auditor-General. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Viti Corporation Limited’s response to the observation there, Viti Corporation delayed the 2008-2009 signing as there was also a change in the Board. The matter is currently in the process and being addressed. On the re-organised entity of the Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, the audit is yet to commence and also the Committee asked, why? This matter has already been addressed. Audits from 2014 to 2018 have been completed and signed and 2019 is in progress and with the Office of the Auditor- General. On the Yaqara Pastoral Company’s 2016-2017 Report, the Statement was sent for signing in 2020 with a qualified opinion. The opinion was requested to be amended for signing in 2021 but was not signed when the audit report was finalised and sent to Parliament on 17 th September, 2021. Now, the account has been finalised but with the modified opinion of 2018-2019 and the question from the Committee was, why? The response to that is that they have been completed and signed. The 2020 audit is in progress with the Office of the Auditor-General. The Food Processers Limited is another problematic enterprise with the 2010 Audited Financial Statements finalised in January 2023, while the 2011-2019 audit is completed and will be coming in the next audit report. The question was, “why?” The response to that is that the preparation of financial statements was delayed as current management had limited information from the previous years which hindered the drafting of the statements. Furthermore, during the finalisation of the audit of the respective years, the Office of the Auditor-General completed its exercise at its discretion which the company did not have control over. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will round off here and leave the rest of the issues with the Government Members contributing to this debate. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion. Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity. First and foremost, I would like to thank the Committee for a very detailed Report. I would like to thank the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and Committee Members for the detailed Report. My contribution to the motion will be very brief. I have noted from the Report that most of the public enterprises are not doing well in terms of profit and service delivery. Some of the public enterprises would not survive without Government financial support. It is high time that public enterprises should strategise and do well to make profit and provide better services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of financial reporting, sound financial management is needed for both quality and timeliness by many of the entities. I have noted from the Report that except for Fiji Public Trustees Corporation Limited, Fiji Development Bank (FDB) and Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC), all other entities have major problems with timeliness.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 1719 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the idea that some of the smaller public enterprises which have the same nature of business should merge for better strategic direction, governance, management and cost efficiency. Looking at the financial reporting, all the public enterprises, with the assistance of Ministry of Public Enterprises, should thoroughly review their current accounting system and consider implementing an accounting system that would provide accurate and timely financial reporting, including using a system that can be used by all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Standing Committee on Public Accounts met, the Fiji Coconut Millers Board in May this year, the Committee came to know that on 14 th February last year, a boiler experienced an internal tube leaking which resulted in an explosion. I am not really sure whether the honourable Minister for Employment is aware of this issue or not. Management should ensure that our employees are protected and provided with an environment which is safe for our workers. Incidents of this nature can be avoided, and workers are not put at risk if the directors and management are proactive. During our physical visit to Fiji Coconut Millers, we saw that it needs urgent attention and upgrading. While some public enterprises are not doing well, one entity stands out and that is Fiji Airways. Fiji Airways has performed extremely well both, in profit and service delivery, and they have won many awards recently and this is mainly due to the previous Government’s commitment to keep our Airline from collapsing during the COVID-19 period. Today, we can see the huge contribution Fiji Airways is making to our tourism sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it was for some of the honourable Members sitting across, who suggested that we should return the planes or let Qantas with minority shares manage our airline, it would have resulted in disaster. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity, I support the motion and thank you for the time that you have given me. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will speak briefly on the State Enterprises, which according to my colleague, honourable Premila Kumar, play a vital role in our economy, given their vast asset base which is $9 billion, plus, their contribution to GDP, employment generation and provision of public services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, today’s headline in The Fiji Times says that our debt is now $10 billion and growing. I am one who is not worried about our debt when I see the asset base of our State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). There is only one part of the equation. I believe the fundamentals for Fiji’s economy is very strong and we can pay off our debt without any fear that we would fail in doing that which has plagued other counties. I had a bit of time in the banks in my younger days and a fundamental in lending money is to ensure that the borrower has the ability to pay. For Fiji, we have the ability to pay our debt and I just wish everyone not to spend too much time worrying about our debt. It is manageable, Mr. Speaker, and that there should be no fear as some people like to create. Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is 2 nd September. We came into power in December 2022, and we were telling you, “Wait, the economy is going to grow”. Right now, Sir, the dialogue on the economy, the tone is bullish.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1720 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 2 nd September, 2024 Westpac, on Friday, upgraded their forecast on our economy. They initially said, “Look, we thought it was not going to go this way”, but you read the papers on Friday, Westpac said, “There are strong fundamentals in the Fijian economy”. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, ANZ has upgraded their growth to about 3.4 percent. We were telling you to wait for it, it will come, and it has come. The economy now is on a very strong platform, and it is now very bullish. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was looking at other possibilities for the SOEs. I was at the listing of the Sun Insurance at GPH about a week ago and the last time we had a public listing was with the Denarau Marina in 2019. So, it has taken all these years for another company to be listed publicly. We will be the new regime. The people in charge now are going to be aggressive, and we will see more companies listing in the stock exchange and some of them could be from SOEs. There is huge opportunities to list the SOEs and bring in that liquidity into our system. In the case of New Zealand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SOEs were privatised and help pay off their debt. New Zealand today, I believe, their debt to GDP is about 24 percent, and it is through the privatisation of the SOEs. So, people of Fiji, do not be worried, you are in good hands. We have very strong fundamentals here and our SOES is part of the confidence going forward. All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the recommendations of the Committee and I repeat what I have said, that the fundamentals are good, SOEs have a bigger role to play and the people of Fiji should be comfortable for the fact that the economy is in good hands. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good that the Government has seen the light and converted as well. Sir, I base my short contribution on the ADB Country Partnership Strategy. It talks about the performance of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Thank you, honourable Minister for Finance, for smiling because it talks about the improvements, particularly the profitability that the changes of the 2019 reforms have brought. So, these are the backgrounds that we need, apart from the work of the Committee. I thank the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for such a good Report. It forms the basis for this discussion, particularly for the way forward as well. So, apart from the ADB Country Partnership Strategy Report, Sir, every now and then I keep referring to the World Bank Country Private Sector Diagnostic Report because it also has specific reports on the performance of SOEs. As alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar, Sir, it has an asset base of around $9 billion, probably something that is more than what FNPF has for now. So, if we can use this well to our advantage, again, this will be good for Fiji. Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation for talking about the economy, this is what we have been saying all along and this partnership needs to continue. Debt is not a new thing, as long as it is well managed and our ability to repay, it is good rather than just focussing on per capita debt to GDP ratio previously. So, this is good, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 1721 I have read the Report, I will not repeat what has been stated previously, but perhaps share some of my thoughts on some of the recommendations given, what has progressed over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly with the few agencies that are highlighted in the Report. I wish to say this because it is important that I probably raise this issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Coconut Millers, Pacific Fishing Company, Fiji Rice, Food Processors, Yaqara Pastoral, Fiji Meat Industry Board, but I want to say is although the recommendation by the Chairman is for us to have a special dedicated Ministry to look after our public enterprises, I fully support that and if Government can afford, of course, it can seriously consider that. However, what I want to stress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the link between the Ministry of Public Enterprises and the line Ministries, given the role that these SOEs provide and the services as well. For example, Yaqara Pastoral. The honourable Minister for Agriculture knows the frustration that we went through and as a result, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, the team that is in Papua New Guinea (PNG) avoided Fiji and went to PNG, but Fiji was their preferred destination. There are two issues with Yaqara Pastoral that led to some of the developments. One issue, Sir, is the reason we brought this new beef breed. What I am trying to say is, although it is with Ministry of Public Enterprises, there must be some arrangements in place in terms of the operational and working relationships between the Ministry of Public Enterprises and the other line Ministries. The limousin breed is with Yaqara Pastoral but we cannot access that breed because it is with that other Ministry. That is why we brought Senepol, Droughtmaster and Wagyu as an example, For your information Sir, Yaqara Pastoral has a lot of funds now from Fiji Water, but what are we going to do with it to expand and improve Yaqara Pastoral? This was raised to us when I was in the Natural Resources Committee by the team in Yaqara Pastoral and this is the opportunity to raise it here with you, Sir. The funds are there, but when can we make the decision so that it can be implemented? This linkage is very important. One of the previous speakers has talked about biosecurity. Again, agriculture has an interest in the work that biosecurity does. When we brought these new breeds, we had to fly the animals again to Melbourne and then fly it over to Fiji because biosecurity cannot allow it just to come through Sydney and then picked up by the airlines. I have talked to the honourable Minister for Finance already about some of the frustrations from the past and I am sharing this, Sir, because this needs to be addressed. If you may have a separate a ministry to look after Public Enterprises but the link between the service providers and the line ministries still needs to be maintained and there must be some clear guidelines and working relationships established because it is important for the economic growth and so forth. That is one of the issues that I wanted to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the recommendation about merging some of the entities Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues I know previously that sort of stopped most of these was the decision to convert loans into equities, because some of these agencies have loans from God knows but still have not been written off or whatever the decision to be made. An example was Food Processors and Fiji Rice Limited. The honourable Minister for Education would know all these because he was in the Public Accounts Committee back then with Mr. Manu Korovulavula. These loans were there from those days but yet no decision was made, particularly conversion of these loans into equities so that we can move on. Perhaps just a comment on the governance, this is one of the key issues, but I am optimistic, these things can change, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There has been some significant improvement in some of these entities - AMA, Rewa Rice, Fiji Hardwood, et cetera, it can change. Let us bring in fit for</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1722 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 2 nd September, 2024 purpose appointments in the board and, of course, in the management as well and very important is the scrutiny, the monitoring. Thank you, Chairman of the Committee apart from Public Accounts, this led monitoring processes will be very useful in terms of the way forward and particularly the role that this Parliament plays as well. We do not only allocate resources, but we have to ensure that we monitor effectively and efficiently, so that we can have the return, because that return will provide the employment, will reduce our import levels and then raise our export levels and bring the much needed dollars to Fiji as well. I also wish to conclude by stating that Government, I have also read the factsheet by the Ministry of Finance, I am quite worried by what you listed under “Challenges” honourable Minister for Finance, because the main thing is, you are in Government, fix it! It can improve and of course there are huge potentials, but if Government can seriously look into this because that will help us in the long-term. There are so many things, time is limited for the debate, but of course let us continue with these healthy dialogues because it is important for the country and of course the way forward. I fully endorse the Report and look forward to more dialogue on it in future. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister and all the honourable Ministers and honourable Members from the other side who have spoken on the motion. I want to thank the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, my Assistant Minister for Finance for producing, with the help of his Committee Members such a good report. The history of State ownership in the economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an old one. We started during independence, the imports substitution strategy and State involvements. State ownership of entities was the best way to take the economy forward, to build infrastructure, to set the economy on a path of sustainable growth. As the honourable Prime Minister stated, the Ministry of Public Enterprises, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is responsible for public enterprises. It is a bit amusing to hear some of the honourable Members from the other side, when they talk about appointments, when they talk about governance, if I could say this, I know they will not like this. For 15 years to 16 years of a kind of dictatorship that we had and the appointments, the opportunities that, that government had to do, the reforms, they did not do that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is this Government, a democratic one which has provided the transparency, the accountability and the freedom for public enterprises to now actually undertake some of those reforms after 16 years. In the last session, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we presented the Annual Reports and the accounts of Fiji Airways in which Government owns majority shares. We understand the issues because State ownership is pervasive in Fiji’s economy. I agree with the Committee’s recommendation on some of the ways in which we can move forward. Fiji’s state footprint appears to be much larger than perhaps some of our peers within the Pacific. Business of State, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we put it in another way as well apart from State- owned enterprises is done in a variety of ways. We have different sectors, different types of presence, different shareholdings, different models and it make sense sometimes to have those different models so that we can do things differently in different sectors. You might have to have a different model in the communication sector for example, in the airline industry, in the tourism industry. So, these are important considerations for any Government to ensure that State owner enterprises are functioning well.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>2 nd September, 2024 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 1723 It is true, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from an economic point of view, sometimes as I said, the role of Government in the business sector especially when Government owns commercial entities can be quite pervasive, it can crowd out investment from the private sector. It may stifle competition in certain sectors because of Government’s presence and Government comes out in every now and then there is an issue to provide subsidies, to provide support so all those variables, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do have an intake on how State-owned enterprises do and how they affect the private sector. Obviously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations that the Committee has made, I have foreshadowed some of those in the last two budgets. We said very clearly that SOE reforms are necessary for us to unleash some of the economic potential in the economy. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism is absolutely right, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The fact that we have a very bullish, country laden with confidence in the economy is a direct result of the Government’s leadership by the honourable Prime Minister in the area of reforms, openness and freedom, but also in the last two budgets, we set a reform agenda Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has now showed results. We are now a Government which is properly funded, our revenue base for the first time (honourable Kumar was saying that our revenue forecast is too optimistic), surpassed our forecast for the last financial year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I did not say that:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- And this is the first time ever that the Government has collected that kind of revenue and our forecast is on target and beyond target. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is also right when he is talking about the confidence of the private sector in terms of businesses because we have shown that we are managing our deficit:</span> Our debt to GDP ratio in two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is from 90 percent down to less than 80 percent and that is a direct result of what this Government has done in the last two budgets and setting up the confidence. So, SOEs that we are now dealing with, if I can just show honourable Kumar and others on the other side, just by reading some of the timelines. The worst Government ever in the history of this country where annual reports did not come on time, where audit reports did not come on time, the honourable Attorney-General today presented reports from the Attorney-General’s Office from 2006. If I read the audit is not completed as at 31 st October, 2023, there are audits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that are pending prior to 2018 and I do not want to name all these entities. There are a whole list of public enterprises that have not produced reports and when the Assistant Minister and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee makes this recommendations to say, we need Ministers and Permanent Secretaries to think about getting the reports on time, this is exactly what he means and he has provided this list of entities with the report that have not completed the audit reports. And that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually should shame some of the honourable Members from the other side who are saying we did this, we did that when we were in government. Because if entities cannot produce annual reports on time, if they cannot get the audits done on time, obviously, they cannot manage those entities well. We, as a government, or the Ministers on this side, we are determined to get that right! We are determined to get audit reports on time, we are getting annual reports to Parliament on time and that is going to improve the accountability of SOEs and as I have said in the budget, we are open to reforming further, looking at possibilities of privatising, looking at models where we can work with the private sector, looking at models where we do not distort the competition in the economy. We were not doing that. And there are many instances and examples of people who were appointed that rigged off nepotism, there were senior civil servants from</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1724 Review Report on Public Enterprises &amp; Other Entities 2019-2022 Audit Reports 2 nd September, 2024 ministries sitting on the boards and creating all kinds of distortions. We are changing that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are making sure that our governance, the freedom that the Government is giving to SOEs, Boards, and we are not interfering in those Boards. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that gives the confidence that creates the confidence in the economy among the investors, and that is what honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation was referring to when we were seeing good signs, bullish signs, confidence in the economy and it is showing in our revenue and the projects that are starting. That is part of the reform that we are also doing in our public enterprises. That is the leadership that the honourable Prime Minister and this Government is providing in managing our economy better. HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the honourable Members who have contributed to the debate, and look forward to these public enterprises and other entities to improve their overall performance, and most importantly the implementation of the audit recommendations. As stated before, these reports are from 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 and they are old reports from the previous government. However, we came up with most of the recommendations to move those enterprises forward to improve further. Firstly, on the audit reports and the governance; secondly, the timeliness of those audited reports; and thirdly, is the lesson that can be brought in from those public enterprises and SOEs with the reform that this Government is doing. It is good that we are deliberating on these reports now, Sir, because as I stated earlier, this is an area that probably was sleeping, there is potential. The performance should increase further hopefully after this as we put in strategies to improve from the recommendations. Just an example, if we have $4.2 billion assets with 4 percent return, that is around $168 million; and if it is 8 percent, that is around $336 million; if it is $9.2 billion worth of assets, that is around $368 million at 4 percent and $736 million at 8 percent. So, there is potential, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the agenda for today. I thank you all for your contributions and Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 5.23 p.m.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>i.</p></body>
