<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Regularisation of Private Vehicles for Public Service Activities (Question No. 195/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. N.T:</span> TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on how the Ministry plans to regularise private vehicles that are engaged in illegal public service activities? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question regarding regularisation of private vehicles. The Ministry with Land Transport Authority (LTA) has recognised the growing concern of private vehicles unlawfully operating as Public Service Vehicles (PSV). The proliferation of these operators who provide transport services without receipts, permits or adherence to regulatory standards presents a significant challenge. While these unauthorised services may temporarily meet certain transportation demands, they function outside the legal framework, resulting in compromised safety, unfair competition and with legitimate operators, a loss of revenue. However, we should recognise that the demand is there, and some are genuinely serving, for example, after hours and for emergency situation. The LTA together with the Department of Transport is looking at regularisation pathways of these vehicle owners in order to transition into the legal PSV framework which may involve creating specific criteria and incentives that will allow them to meet the regulatory requirements. Therefore, fostering a more inclusive and compliant transport sector. So it is something which is still under discussion, we are considering it and given the growing number of illegal operators, I emphasise that there are various public service permits which are open, for example, the lifting of the freeze has enabled the applications for rental (LR) and mini-buses (LM) and carriers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these categories, for example, LH, authorises the use of a motor vehicle licensed as hire vehicle with a driver provided, subject to the Act and licence and permit conditions, on a route and for a fare negotiated between the permit holder or his or her driver and the passenger carried but shall not authorise the vehicle to ply or stand for hire for the carriage of passengers. Of course, the LR (Rental) use of a rental vehicle and there are minibuses and carriers. These are options available for them to regularise and the LTA is working closely with stakeholders in order to move them away from their current situation of unregularised operations. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, the issuance of LR and LH has also meant that those LR and LH plates are being used as taxis. Will you be looking at strengthening the laws and the punishments that currently exists with respective PSV drivers and those that try and be PSV drivers within this particular boundary? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not sure if I heard you correctly, whether LR used as taxis, but in terms of the question of the laws, that is what we are currently reviewing - the various aspects of the law that needed to be reviewed. For example, the sale of sale permits, and looking at the review of the current regulations regarding taxis, open taxi rank, et cetera. I think there is another</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1832</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 the review of the current regulations regarding taxis, open taxi rank, et cetera. I think there is another question coming up on the availability of bases in the Municipal boundaries. Those are various challenges we face but generally, we are encouraging more participation in the transport sector, but also to spread it out, not only in the urban areas where they are currently based, but also to the rural bases. For example, in villages, they are working with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and iTLTB to create bases there or where they could operate from. I noticed, even in my area, there is quite a number of cars parked there and they are looking forward in terms of the development towards the issuance of taxi permits which we are currently working on. Farm to Fork Initiative - Ministry of Tourism (Question No. 196/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the Farm-to-Fork initiative that is currently being spearheaded by the Ministry? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the question. The Farm-to-Fork initiative is an important collaborative programme led by the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation. It is unique because we have multiple partners across Government, private sector and development partners. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, the Ministry of Trade and Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, with the support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO). The Farm-to-Fork initiative was launched with a primary objective of fostering stronger relationships between our tourism and resource-based sectors - agriculture and fisheries. The initiative aims to integrate local agricultural and fisheries products into the tourism supply chain, thereby, promoting local produce and reducing dependency on imports. Mr. Speaker Sir, since entering the partnership with the UN FAO in 2023, we have conducted two workshops - one in Sigatoka and one in Savusavu. These workshops brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including Government Officials, farmers, cooperatives and clusters, middlemen and caterers and makers from the hospitality industry such as chefs, food and beverage managers and hotel purchasing officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative is overseen by a Steering Committee which has representation of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Trade, Fiji Hotel Association, Fiji Chefs Association, Culinary Federation of Fiji, Tourism Fiji and UNFAO. Collectively, we have had over 100 participants in these workshops. We are covering key areas such as supply chain management, fish handling, hotel purchasing requirements, market access, funding opportunities and health and safety standards. As part of the workshop, participants also had the opportunity to visit an on-site farm at the Outrigger Resort, Sigatoka, and Namale Resort, Savusavu, to see the variety of crops and vegetables grown, the sustainable farming practices, and how the farm contribute to the resort’s commitment, of offering fresh locally sourced meals.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to share that there was a good representation of women</h4><p>with close to 50 percent participation. We had one who attended the Sigatoka workshop with her</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1833 two-year old child. This really attests to the commitment and the hard work of women. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key issues that we have seen from these workshops include a significant lack of communication and coordination between farmers and key Government stakeholders, including our Ministry. There is also a need for more training, technical support and better access to farming infrastructure, equipment and water. Farmers are often unaware of tender bids from hotels and struggle with understanding the procurement process. Other challenges include: labour shortages; their perception of farming as a non-lucrative and labour-intensive business; (1) (2) (3) difficulties related to market access; (4) high input costs; and (5) the unavailability of seeds and materials. The workshops also noted problems with inconsistent supply and quality of produce, delayed payments from hotels and the need for better information on seasonality, suppliers and quality control. The lack of coordination is a critical missing link, that if established, could significantly drive demand and supply for both industries. Strengthening this connection is vital for ensuring a consistent and high quality supply of local produce to the tourism sector, while also creating a reliable market for farmers. Establishing strong synergies through policies, taskforces and better communication channels will enable these sectors to work together more effectively, boosting the local economy and enhancing the sustainability of both agriculture and tourism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, a third workshop will be held in Suva later in the year, where we hope to present solutions on the types of arrangements needed to build stronger, healthier and more sustainable links between the food and agriculture sector and the tourism sector. We are also looking to extend our partnership with the UNFAO, so that this initiative becomes a core part of our Ministry’s outputs. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Farm-to-Fork Initiative is a testament of our commitment in promoting sustainable tourism and supporting local communities. By strengthening the linkages between tourism and resource-based sectors, we are not only enhancing the visitors’ experience, but also contributing to the economic development of our rural areas. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, does the Farm-to-Fork Initiative actually have an organic portion to it? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yes, it does. Organic producers, as we know, are high on the list of most people, especially our visitors. So, it is very much dominant the way we are developing this. The beauty about it is that these are local farmers who are adjacent to where the resorts are situated. As I have highlighted, it is the way for them to grow on demand, to know what the hotels want and to grow accordingly. It is working quite properly, and it is very promising for both our tourism industry and the local community of farmers. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, I think I have mentioned this during the Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants (FICA) Conference. There are two obstacles in this Farm-to-Fork Initiative, one is the procurement officers, and two, are the middlemen. These are the ones who come in between the initiative and the farmers.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1834</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 So, with this training and discussions that are ongoing, how is this being handled by the Ministry? It is a good initiative, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme includes the middlemen, they are also part of this initiative because we need to secure the supply chain. In cases where you have businesses between the farms and the buyer, you do need the ability of the middlemen to consolidate producers for purchase by the hotels. It is something that is always there, but the way to go around that is to secure a price between the farmer and the hotel and then involve the middlemen. I think it is here when the middleman decides on what the prices should be. So, it is a matter of close coordination and building a relationship that is forward looking and one that can live on for a long period of time. The problem with middlemen is that they come in, take what they buy and come back another time and are not able to sustain the relationship between the farmer and the hotel. The Ministry is trying to find a way to sustain this relationship between the farmer and the hotel. The hotel should know what is available in their vicinity. That will be key to all these. On procurement, I know as a hotelier, my purchasing manager, it was easier for him to pick up the phone and call New Zealand, as opposed to going around the market to go and find out what is available. So, that is what we are going to do, for the hotels to take interest in what is available locally. Do what we call, a market survey. Hoteliers normally do this to find out what is available. So, procurement is key, and our farmers need to know how the purchasing manager works. They need to be related to the chef, what the chef wants to have on the menu. So, the food and beverage manager, the chef and purchasing manager is also part of this dialogue. And in that, the middleman will also be there, but if these people can work closely together, the fee of the middleman, manipulating prices can be addressed. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Tourism is how is the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) assisting in this initiative? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are also part of the dialogue. It is all hands on board, but the Farm-to-Fork Initiative is more the local community and the hotel. They must develop their relationship, and with that relationship, it is more a direct one between the farmer and the hotels. AMA would be more on distributing to far flung areas, areas that are away from the community. So really, there is so much good land available in the hotel areas and this is what we are trying to encourage, that the land to be put to good use based on what the hotel needs. You know, we should farm on demand, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Non-Provision of Town Base Permits for LMs and LCs (Question No. 197/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D:</span> BULITAVU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament on the reasons why the Municipal Councils are not providing town base permits to vehicle owners applications which have been accepted by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) for the processing of their Public Service Vehicles (PSV) permits in particular for LMs and LCs.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1835 HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. It is a very important question because of public interest and a lot of people have also been coming to my office asking for assistance in relation to the town or city base permit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today before you to address a pressing issue that has come to the attention of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government concerning the challenges faced by PSV owners in obtaining town based permits from our municipal councils particularly for Licensed Minibuses (LM) as well as Licensed Carriers (LC), despite having their applications accepted by the Land Transport Authority as Public Service Vehicle (PSV) permits. The situation has caused concern among our constituents, particularly those whose livelihoods depend on operating these vehicles. It is, therefore, our duty as the Government to ensure that as regulatory processes are efficient, fair and supportive of economic growth while maintaining necessary standards of safety and order in our urban areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have identified a gap in coordination between the LTA, FRA and municipal councils. This is the absence of a streamlined integrated process for handling Public Service Vehicles or PSVs and town-based permit applications has resulted in conflicting requirements, duplicated efforts and confusion for applicants. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difficulty in obtaining permits has led to an increase in informal and sometimes illegal transportation services. This not only poses safety risk but also results in loss revenue for both local and our national governments. The Ministry of Transport, together with LTA, is closely working with my Ministry to obtain baseline data from the councils on the bases and what areas can be aligned as bases. Over the past months, we have observed a growing number of complaints from vehicle owners who have successfully navigated the LTA’s rigorous process for obtain PSV permits. These individuals and businesses have invested time, effort and resources to meet the LTA’s standards demonstrating their commitment to providing safe and reliable transport services to our communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to understand the internal role of our municipal councils in this process. Municipal councils are tasked with managing the urban environment, ensuring ordinary development and maintain a quality of life for residents. In the context of public transportation, they play a vital role in ensuring and allocating appropriate spaces for PSV base and stands, ensuring the number and type of vehicles operating within the municipalities are aligned with the areas infrastructure and needs and collecting local fees and charges that contribute to the maintenance and improvement of urban facilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after extensive consultation with municipal councils, vehicle owners and other stakeholders have identified several key factors contributing to the current bottleneck that create challenges for permit issuance. It is important to note that municipal councils have expressed concerns about the increasing traffic congestions in their jurisdictions with limited provisions to bases to accommodate these requests. They view the limitation as of new town-based permits as a means to control the number of vehicle operating in urban centres. While this concern is valid, it often results in a blanket approach that fails to distinguish between different types of public service vehicles and specific impacts on the traffic flow. Municipal councils face general challenges related to the existing infrastructure, limited parking spaces, narrow roads and inadequate public transport facilities contributed to hesitation in issuing new permits. The council is of the view that allowing more vehicle to operate without corresponding improvements in infrastructure would lead to chaos and deterioration of services.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1836</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 In collaboration with the Ministry of Public Works, we will work with the municipal councils to develop comprehensive plans for upgrading urban infrastructure to support an efficient public transportation system. This will include dedicated lanes for public service vehicles, improving parking facilities and enhanced traffic management systems. We recognise the need to support our municipal councils in building their capacity to handle the complexities of modern urban transportation. The challenges faced in harmonising our public service permit processes are significant. By working together across different levels of government, between agencies and in partnership with the private sector and our communities. Municipal councils are prompted to work closely with FRA and LTA in implementing these reforms. I urge patience and cooperation from our vehicle owners and operators as we work to streamline these processes. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for what he has mentioned about the town base permit for LM and LC. If someone on day one lodges their application, how long will it take – weeks or months?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I thank the honourable Member for asking a very good question:</span></p><p>This is like a challenge not really a new….. MR. SPEAKER.- He is using the case in Navua. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- One river, one bus! HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- It is like a legacy issue that we are reviewing at the moment. I remember first time in Office I was asked by some carrier operators on how long it will take to approve an application for a base for a municipality here in our country. They said that their application has been sitting there for more than two weeks. That is something that we are trying to review now. Realistically, it should not take more than a week because information are there by all the Councils unless fees updates, then it should be processed within a week. MR. SPEAKER.- Less than a week, honourable Member. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- The Minister will agree that there is a disconnection between the municipal councils and LTA. Before I mention my question, there are many areas that are no longer serviced by buses, either no longer serviced or reduce fleet in a given day. These are people who are living around who want to help their own people by buying trucks or minibuses to help them. My supplementary question to the Minister, how will the Ministry address the concordance of streamlining the process to improve the compliance, also a timeline for opening up of, the honourable Minister for Works mentioned about the open ranking system, something similar to that? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, that is a very important question because I also been receiving this same issue from the public on some of the areas that even have been serviced by the bus providers, but due to some issues, maybe road conditions, the service are affected. They have been applying for LM applications, I think I have said earlier that we are also having consultation with the Ministry of Public Works, FRA as well as LTA on the way forward for this, because it is affecting our people, especially those who are living in the rural areas. They also need our assistance. One thing that I also want to share, I was looking at some of the information that had been given to me regarding some of the applications, the base permits that had been given by Municipal Councils, it is very interesting to note that in some cases, some Councils have issued more bases, but these bases do not end up with the process which is formalising of the permits, this is in relation to</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1837 LM with LTA. These are some of the issues, I think there needs to be a holistic review process so that the general public understands the process and also agencies are involved in processing applications for LM, LC as well as LH. (Question No. 198/2024 withdrawn) Reasons for Virement and Redeployment of Funds (Question No. 199/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D:</span> KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament on the reasons for the virement and redeployment of funding from the capital and operational expenditures allocated in the 2023-2024 financial year and its utilisation? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for asking the question. The virement and redeployment processes have always been a feature of our budget system, not just in this budget and provides the operation flexibility…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is the not the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- …I am coming to that for budget execution but within a proper legal framework to ensure proper management including Cabinet approval for redeployment of funds. The reason why I am saying this at the beginning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because what the honourable Member has done by giving statements outside of this House suggests that somehow this is not allowable. The virement is a process used for …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would like to….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C.

PRASAD.:</span> What is your Point of Order?</p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Misrepresentation. I would like to ask him to produce that statement</h4><p>where I had said that this is not allowed. I challenge him to produce that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- My ruling is that, he is still coming around. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impression that is created on what she said.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Now you are saying that, first you said that I said this was not allowed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Virement is a process used for the transfer of budgeted funds from one appropriation category …</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1838</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … to another appropriate account with the agencies had appropriation. They do not want to listen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because … (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> … it is important for me to explain to them.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The stupidity is coming from you like no one’s business, why not listen? Mr. Speaker, Sir, designation persons are provided the authority, it is important for the people outside of Parliament to also understand and also the people in this Parliament. Designated persons are provided the authority to transfer budgeted funds within the agencies Head of Appropriation. For example, under Section 16 of the Financial Management Act 2004 states and I quote: “If the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to vire, the Minister may in writing with or without further appropriation than this Act, authorise the transfer of an unspent amount in an appropriation category with a Head of Appropriation administered by a budget sector agency (other than a parliamentary body) to another appropriation category within that head of appropriation.” The Minister of Finance’s powers under section 16 of the FMA 2004 is delegated to the Permanent Secretary under section 10 of the Financial Instructions 2010 to transfer funds within an appropriate category as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from virement redeployment, this process allows the honourable Minister for Finance, with the approval of Cabinet, to authorise redeployment amounts appropriated by the appropriated Act, enforced for administration by the Ministry to the Heads of Appropriation and appropriation categories to be administered by one or more other budget sectors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is first time, unlike when they were in government, you never hear the Cabinet make a decision which was made public. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is the first time that when the redeployment goes to Cabinet, it is put out for public information by the honourable Prime Minister and they used that to say, “Aha, some kind of funny thing is going because funds are being redeployed.” There is nothing funny about redeployment, Mr. Speaker. I will give you examples of what happened during the FijiFirst reign. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1839 MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, for the 2023-2024 Budget, the first redeployment of funds amounted to $105.2 million was to meet the additional expenditure demands for the following agencies and ministries. We said very clearly, we did not come with a revised budget. We looked at the expenditure, we redeployed funds ($105.2 million) to meet the new priorities of the new Government. The deployment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, included the: (1) Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF); (2) Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration; (3) Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs; and (4) Water Authority of Fiji. These were entities where the funds went to. Fiji Roads Authority, a sum of $36.1 million is to cater for the following commitments, $21.5 million for additional restoration works on the road network which was not there when we came in. FRA’s budget, whole year’s budget was spent in six months and we had to come and redeploy funds from other ministries to capital expenditure to fix roads. Sir, $14.6 million from that deployment for the completion of capital projects designated for that year because they had not budgeted properly. That is why we redeployed. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because your question says why from capital to others:</span></p><p>The second redeployment, excise of $7.9 million was undertaken to meet the funding shortfall as we said quite clearly, and $1.8 million for the Ministry of Education was to cater for the cost of salaries and allowances for teachers in ECE. Similarly, the Fiji Police Force had encountered a funding shortfall of $6.1 million to meet the salary cost for our police officers and payment of allowances. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that the redeployment exercise that was undertaken in the 2023-2024 Budget, the overall expenditure is well within the total appropriation approved by Parliament. The actual expenditure stands at $4.1 billion, which is below the budgeted expenditure of $4.3 billion, so there is no overspending as a whole of Government as was the impression created. In fact, the overall net deficit is around 3.3 percent for the last financial year; lower than 4.8 percent as budgeted and this is underpinned by strong tax collections, revenue collections and Government meeting the revenue forecast for the first time. I would like to reiterate the fact that this is a Government which has brought in two budgets, which has stabilised the finances where Government is funding, Government is being funded well, where we have reduced the debt to GDP ratio from 90 percent in 2022 to 78 percent. This is what you call “prudent financial management”, not the kind of management that we had seen. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Let me complete this for our information because I do not like to go back, but the stupidity of the question requires me to do that. You look at 2018, $10.6 million was redeployed from Head 50 from ongoing rehabilitation and constructions of schools damaged by TC Winston; in 2018, 2019, 2021 and I can give you all the examples of redeployment or virement of fund from capital total expenditure.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1840</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statement the honourable Member put out, was all designed to create this impression that somehow, the Ministry of Education is not managing its budget properly, or somehow the Fiji Police is not managing its budget properly. They are always in a budget, every Government has that, and that is why those provisions are there in the Financial Management Act. That is why there is redeployment and virement Because, you can have a disaster, for example, you can have an unplanned expenditure, and you can have capital expenditure not being undertaken because of weather conditions. Therefore, Governments look at where they can reallocate funds within a particular year. They know that! But still, they are asking about why we are redeploying funds? Why we have virement of funds? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister needs to be reminded that this virement and redeployment is not new. But the question is, that $105.2 million was redeployed in July and 31 st July is the end of the financial year. You redeployed money out of the 2023-2024 Budget, the $7.9 million, and that decision was taken in August. That is what we are questioning.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Stop the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> I am questioning you!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It is a supplementary question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Because you talk about prudent management, you talk about transparency and accountability. This is the last financial year’s allocation but authorised in August, and that is the question. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Opposition.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is perfectly fine:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- You have given a very thorough reply to the question that was raised:</span> Now they are talking about the timing, coming in August, whether it is one in minute before time. You have the mandate to do that. So, let us move on. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Not fair! Absolutely not fair! MOU Between Ministry of Agriculture &amp; UN University (Question No. 200/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I:</span> TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry and the United Nations University for Environment and Security? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the question raised by the honourable Member regarding the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry and the United Nations University for Environment and Security. I begin by expressing my gratitude to the Cabinet for the decision to endorse the partnership between the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and the United Nations University for Environment and Human Security that has led to the formalising of the MOU between this esteemed organisation and the Ministry.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1841 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations University for Environment and Human Security plays a critical role in researching risk and adaptation related to the environmental hazards and global change. The United Nations University for Environment and Human Security is the hosting organisation of the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative and is a leading think tank on climate change and insurance, focusing on promoting policies and developing solutions to reduce these risks for vulnerable communities and the agriculture sector considering the interaction between environmental and societal factors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme (PICAP) was established to enhance the financial preparedness and resilience of Pacific households, communities, small businesses, organisations and Governments against the economic impacts of climate change induced disasters. The programme initiated in 2021, has successfully introduced the first climate risk micro- insurance products in the Pacific region covering countries such as Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga, and is jointly implemented by the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security through the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII). Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fiji’s context, the Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme has facilitated insurance payouts to farmers in the Western and Northen Divisions following heavy rainfall in 2023 and 2024. The upcoming project involving the Fiji Agriculture and Rural Statistics Unit in the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security, aims to conduct the survey to evaluate the impact of these parametric insurance payouts on the economic decisions of beneficiaries, specifically farmers in Fiji. The survey will involve both recipients of the payouts and a control group to provide comparative analysis. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the significance of this project lies in its multifaceted benefits to both parties involved, that is the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways and UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security. Socially, the project will provide critical insights into how climate risk micro-insurance can enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations, including women, farmers and individuals with disabilities who are disproportionately affected by climate induced disasters. Economically, the findings will inform policy decisions that could lead to more effective risk management strategies in the agriculture sector and improve the livelihoods of those farmers insured. Financially, this project aligns with broader efforts to promote economic resilience at the community level, by integrating market-based insurance solutions into National Disaster Risk Management Frameworks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the UN University selected the Fiji Agriculture Statistics Unit within the Ministry as the ideal partner to carry out this survey, due to its proven record of extensive experience in conducting fieldwork across Fiji and managing large-scale data collection on the agriculture sector critically impacted by climate change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the long-term implications of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are significant to both the Ministry and the UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security. For the Ministry, successful implementation and analysis of the PICAP payout survey could lead to a more resilient agricultural sector, better equipped to withstand and recover from climate</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1842</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 induced shocks. The insights gained could drive the adoption of similar insurance schemes across other sectors, fostering a culture of proactive risk management and financial preparedness in Fiji. Furthermore, the Ministry on the other hand will benefit from the technical expertise and global perspectives that UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security brings, enabling more effective implementation and evaluation of the insurance scheme and climate resilient work for the agriculture sector. For the UN University, this collaboration aligns to develop and implement innovative climate adaptation strategies. The data gained from this project will contribute to UN University Institute for Environment and Human Security’s global research portfolio in influencing policy and practice in other vulnerable regions worldwide. This project is a critical step in expanding the evidence base for the effectiveness of parametric insurance in Fiji and in the Pacific as a whole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry appreciates that this collaboration and achievements of this project may open doors and promote a sustainable partnership for future research and statistical partnership between the United Nations University and the Ministry dedicated to enhancing resilience against climate change in the agriculture sector. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Assistance to Farmers Due to Drought and Low Cane Production (Question No. 201/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V:</span> PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on how the FSC intends to assist farmers in light of the recent drought and subsequent low production of cane? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I actually sympathize with all the farmers in this country, I myself, am a cane farmer and I will tell you, I just had a viber message this morning that I am one of the first importer or harvester in this country, some 10 years ago. The cane production has dropped from 15 percent to 20 percent on every farm this year. The reason being, is not that the farmers have not done their part, it is because of the climate change and the rain patterns which not helping us in this country. So, the question is very relevant honourable Member. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I respond to honourable Pillay regarding the measures been taken to assist the farmers in consideration of the recent drought, resulting in low production of cane. As we are all aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar is not just an economic pillar but a lifeline for many of our rural communities and the challenges posed by the drought has been formidable but I assure you Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Ministry of Sugar Industry together with the Fiji Sugar Cooperation (FSC) and the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) are committed to providing comprehensive support to our farmers during the difficult times. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last financial year 2023-2024, we took proactive sustainable programmes by assisting 42 farmers with essential irrigation equipment, including water pumps and pipes. This is also critical in enabling farmers to irrigate their field and mitigate the impact of drought. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s cane production was always dependent on rainfed production. Whereas throughout the world, where patterns have changed, the relevant government have also</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1843 assisted the farmers to do irrigation and that is what we will be moving into in the coming months and years. Recognising the ongoing nature of these challenges, provisions have been made in the 2024- 2025 Budget to expand this assistance. We are now supporting an additional 300 farmers through the newly established Irrigation Support Programme and the Small Grant Programme. This expansion underscores our unwavering commitment to sustaining and revitalising the sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF has been at the forefront of our efforts to combat the effects of drought. Over the past few months, SRIF have intensified research in rainwater, harvesting and surplus water retention. In Drasa Lautoka, SRIF successfully harvested water for the their major drainage systems, trapping rain run-off from the surrounding watersheds. This harvested water is now being utilised to irrigate the research trial areas, demonstrating the effectiveness of small scale irrigation setups. The initiatives is part of a broader strategy by the Sugar Research Institute to enhance water resource management, ensuring that our farming practices remain resilient, even in the face of water scarcity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week SRIF mobilised heavy treatments to the banks of the Ba River to test the feasibility of deploying large irrigation systems which will be available on loan to farmers. The system being tested, featured high-capacity centrifugal pumps capable of delivering approximately 780 litres of water per minute to the sprinkler configuration design to cover significant areas. This development is a testament to our commitment to provide practical and scalable solutions to our farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our research efforts excel beyond immediate solutions, SRIF has been diligently working on the development and promotion of drought resistant sugarcane varieties as well. These varieties are more resilient to water stress and have potential to maintain better yields under the challenging conditions. This long term research is crucial in ensuring that our farmers are equipped with better tools to withstand future climate challenges. In addition to the research, SRIF together with FSC, had intensified their outreach and extension services, educating farmers on the best practices for managing crops during drought conditions. Workshops, field days and on-farm demonstrations are being conducted to ensure that our farmers have access to the latest information and techniques. Sir, SRIF is advising farmers on soil health management with the retention, mulching, and potential use of bio-fertiliZers to sustain growth during dry periods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry along with SRIF and FSC is leaving no stones unturned in our efforts to assist farmers during this challenging period. The measures we are implementing are not just an immediate response but are part of a broader long term strategy to build a more resilient and sustainable sugar industry. We will remain committed to supporting our farmers, shaping their livelihoods, ensuring the continued prosperity of the sugar industry for the benefit of all. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, supplementary question. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers have lost triple of their income due to drought and also they have commitments and loans with the banks and the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. For 25 seasons, the production, they will need more money to bring back the production. Also, I have seen around the ratoons are drying up, for the truck owners and truck drivers if there is less cane than less income. Cane cutters, less income as there is less cane to be harvested. Cooperatives also face less income because expenses have increased because of the fuel cost et cetera. My question is to the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry, will</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1844</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 the farmers be compensated to some level with some cash grants? MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Minister before you reply to that question. Who decides if the country is going through a drought? Why I am asking this, because during our time in Government, the Government has to decide, that is why we get this funds that is available… HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! Nothing has been done so far! MR. SPEAKER.- …to help the farmers, even giving loans. But here, who decides? Is it the farmer or Meteorological Services or the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>On the drought issue, of course, the Meteorological Office declares the drought and that is when the emergency strikes in but during the reply to the honourable Member …. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, the question that he is raising is part of the question that I am raising to you. If that decision lies with the Meteorological Service, the Government should be declaring that there is a drought. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I leave it to the honourable Minister for NDMO, once he declares then obviously everything else kicks in. But replying to the honourable Pillay, he should remember that in the midst of 1999, there was a major drought in this country. At that time when the SVT Government was there, they actually gave out massive grant to the farmers for replanting. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am coming back to that. The same Prime Minister is here today...:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Listen, you are not a cane farmer.</p><p>We are very mindful, I declare my interest because I am a cane farmer. The honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is also a cane farmer. (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Coming back to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we are monitoring it, we are very mindful and once we get some indication from FSC on what the farmers require, we will definitely act on it. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no assessment done so far. It is not only the sugarcane farmers who are affected, it is also the crop and livestock farmers those who are under the Ministry of Agriculture and those who have been assisted. So, I urge the Government if an assessment can be done because if there is no assistance given to the farmers, we will continue to see a decline in the production in the coming years. MR. SPEAKER.- He answers himself.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Yes, that is a statement.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1845 MR. SPEAKER.- The only thing now is you get that policy done.

SHARMA.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p>I would like to start off by saying, if one is smart enough, they will never say a question is stupid. The question to the honourable Minister for Sugar, he has spoken about the low production of cane audit has been seen a lot on social media that complaints are being raised about the long waiting hours at the FSC Mill to offload the cane. (Chorus of interjections) HON. R. R. SHARMA.- The question is coming. What is your Ministry doing in order to combat this issue of long hours drivers take waiting?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, that is a new question and I can come back to you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R. R. SHARMA.:</span> When will you come back?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- In the next session:</span></p><p>Proposed Bus Fare Increase by FCCC (Question No. 202/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.R:</span> VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, update Parliament on the proposed increase in students bus fares by the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) undertook a review of the existing bus fares. The review has been completed and FCCC has adopted a new fare calculation methodology in consultation with the Fiji Bus Operators Association. Currently, Mr. Speaker Sir, the regulated student fare is set at 50 percent of the adult fare at every stage. So, in other words, they were the bus companies which were kind of subsidizing the other 50 percent. This long-standing formula is based on the principle that adult fares cross-subsidise the lower student fares and in the past the Land Transport Authority allowed a relatively higher number of students to be accommodated in a school bus compared to the adult passenger limit. However, this policy has been changed and revised. Under the new methodology, the FCCC recommended that student fares be increased to approximately 100 percent of the adult fares. This proposed doubling of student fares, Mr. Speaker Sir, will have a significant financial impact on the Government because the Government will continue to subsidise them. So as part of the Transport Assistance Programme, the Government currently fully subsidizes the transportation costs for students from families with household income of less than $16,000 per annum. And apart from bus services, the scheme also covers for Rural Service License (RSL) operators and boat services in the rural and maritime schools. In the 2024-2025 Budget, the Government has allocated a total of $37 million to cater for the transport assistance. There are</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>1846</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 currently about 90,000 students benefiting from this programme. With the doubling of student fares, the additional cost exposure for subsidized students with blue cards is projected to be around $18 million. Apart from this, there are currently non-subsidized students with yellow cards paying the full fare of 50 percent of adult fares. With the bus fares doubled, the additional cost to these students will be around $5 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet has approved that no additional cost will be borne by any student or their families. Government will therefore subsidise the additional increase in the fares. The total additional estimated cost for transportation subsidy for students with blue cards and yellow cards is around $23 million for 2023-2024 budget. The current funding provision in the budget will accommodate the increased cost for approximately six to seven months of the new financial year and Cabinet has approved that additional funding will have to be sourced through a budget redeployment later during the year. Mr. Speaker Sir, it is also important to note that the RSL providers transporting students have also been asking for fare increases which have remained stagnant for a number of years like the bus fares. It was discussed during the Budget deliberations that the Ministry of Education will work with the FCCC on the fare determination for RSL operators. The cost implications can only be ascertained after the review. However, for the transportation subsidy for students with blue cards and yellow cards, this will continue until further notice. Combatting Surge in Drug Trafficking and Usage (Question No. 203/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S:</span> KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Given the 94 percent increase in illicit drug cases recorded in January 2024, can the honourable Minister of Home Affairs and Immigration state what specific measures is the Ministry implementing to combat the surge drug trafficking and usage but clearly concerning methamphetamine and marijuana? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. The issue of drugs continues to take the centre stage of our discussions on how it has affected our Fijian community, especially our children. Recently there has been a spike of drug cases being reported and arrests that have been made. If I might allude first to the percentage that is alluded to in the question the 94 percent between the period from January 2023 to January of this year, that figure has come about because the police have been able to arrest more people. That has been the reason for the numbers now. I had commented earlier in an interview that to me, that is a good thing because now we are catching a lot more people. It means that the police, despite in the past, are much more freer to do these arrests and do their work freely according to the law. As a consequence, they have been able to arrest more people perhaps in the course of their raids, they have been able to capture more drugs as we have heard of the cases in Legalega and also in Meingunyah in Nadi. However, we continue as a government to raise awareness on this issue and for the Ministry, we have two particular, at least all of the agencies that are under my portfolio, Immigration, Police and also the the Anti-Narcotics Bureau have been going out extensively to the public conducting awareness on drugs, not only by themselves, but also with the use of the community, that is, both the vanua, lotu and civil society in every way possible. I think there is a lot of debate out there now on</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1847 the social media creating awareness. This is the best thing we can do because at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker. I believe and if I might just steal one of the statements made earlier on by the honourable Premila Kumar with regards to her statement on AMR, raised earlier by the honourable Minister for Health, the whole campaign is about to help people how to make choices. That is the only thing really that we have in our control, so the police can go and raid, people can go into court and that is what is happening. Any case that comes up, we raid the houses like the case in Lautoka but the thing that we would like to achieve more and that is what we are doing right now in our public campaign is involve our agencies by telling our people, say no to drugs, do not do it, do not engage in it, do not sell it. If you know what is happening, then you must report it to the police or the appropriate agency. That is the only way to control it. Also at the same time, we are strengthening all of the units within the Police including that within Immigration and the Ministry to try and stop these drugs from arriving here. A lot of that is to do our work with our partners; Australia, New Zealand, Americans and the French to be able to halt drugs or gather information as they are coming to our shores because once they land here, it is very hard for us to stop it and the only way to stop it for us, is to motivate and inform our people to stop indulging in drugs. You must make the informed choice, do not use drugs and if you know of anyone who is peddling drugs, you come out and tell the police, you come out and tell the authorities, that really is the only thing we can do. We are a small state. I would like to thank the police in the efforts that they are making. They come under a lot of criticism obviously, they are being mentioned in this House many times before, but since lately, they have been able to up the ante. With the police reset, we should be able to do more and also with now coming up of the Narcotics Bureau; the police and Narcotic Bureau are now working together, sharing information with our partners and that way, we are able to work better, but we are always talking about our children and the youth consuming drugs. Our effort, the parents, I will say it again, parents, their children, it is not the state or the church or the vanua, it is first their responsibility to teach their children do not do drugs. The conversation is out there, the Government is supporting it, police is arresting people every day. This case in Lautoka the other day, the police went in to raid a house where they confiscated cocaine, a significant amount in US dollars. What did they do? They released their two Rottweilers, and the police were able to handle these dogs and these are killer dogs. This is something that they had been able to do. I would like to thank them because they are at the forefront of this work. But to help them, our community must tell the members of its community, parents must tell children, “Do not do drugs.” Police can only do so much; the rest is up to us. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do agree with the honourable Minister that security border control is a national priority. I would like to just highlight a case to the honourable Minister that 14.4 kilogrammes of methamphetamine had transited through Fiji from a 24-year old lady from Vancouver, Fiji to Brisbane, and those gaps of exploitation is corroding the DNA of our children, our society and our country as a whole. After this, honourable Minister, what has changed about the security checks at our airports that Fiji does not remain a point where transits of such drugs are caught in the future? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have addressed this matter over a press conference and some statements before. I think the procedure under international aviation, when you connect to a destination, your baggage goes straight from the aircraft that you came from to the next aircraft. I think that is kind of acceptable. It is only when they come inshore that they go through the checks before they land on the carousels, and that is how we check them.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>1848</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 But I think, it also suggests that maybe those in the aviation industry in the world, for those of us in Fiji who decide the policy on this matter, it is not only up to us, it is a global thing on how to try and detect things as they are going from one plane to another. I think under the current laws, it is from your destination of departure, your next check is your destination of arrival, and that is how it got captured. That is definitely something to consider, and hopefully, in the future, those who decide on the international policies to do with transiting luggage, would be able to make some good policy decisions to prevent drugs. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, have we engaged with our development partners, because this is a situation that requires assistance, especially with our borders being porous and the vast open seas that we have? Have we engaged with our development partners to see if we can get assistance to cover the sea in a better fashion than we do - to seek assistance for that rather than just relying on our own Navy, which we know may not be able to cover the whole sea that we have, maybe more ships or more coastal guards from that perspective? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the short answer is, yes. There is an elaborate partnership programme, and I had alluded to that earlier, with our traditional partners in this regard. In the Navy, it has always been an ongoing thing. One of the latest things is under the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). We now have the Pacific Regional Vessel Boarding and Searching Training facility in Togalevu. So, with the UN and Fiji we teach the regional people on how Australians and Americans come on board under IML and teach our guys how to board a ship and how to detect drugs. Also, at the same time, under the Transnational Crime Unit (TCU) and that involves all of our boarder agencies - we work with the Australians and New Zealanders, particularly with Australia under the Ministry of Home Affairs we shared a lot of information. In terms of the sea, we are limited in our capacity to be able to physically dominate the space. The short answer there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just completely impossible. One thing we can have is to coordinate the eyes and the ears that look at the intelligence and to track things as they are coming, and the Navy is very, very good and I had alluded to that earlier. They can tracks ships and boats out there, and we work with all of our other agencies and if we suspect that there is a ship carrying drugs destined for Fiji, we have our partners also, to help us intercept these boats as they come. But some actually come through, which is unfortunate as they give us trouble. Sir, because of our very nature it is difficult to dominate every space, but we do our best with our partners to gather intelligence and we have laws that allows us to board and arrest people together under INTEPOL, with Australia, New Zealand and the friends who are helping us mostly in the areas of looking after our waters. We hear funny stories of those that are dealing drugs have a funny way of changing their tactics. They come underwater, they fly over and they drop beacons in the water. Our communities in the Lau Group and Vanua Levu tell us all these stories about things that float out there in the ocean and they do not know where they come from. So, we cannot dominate it. We need our friends, and we are very grateful to them for helping and enabling us monitor and trying to keep our country and people safe. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question is, these drugs are not intended for Fiji. It is intended for other markets like Australia and New Zealand and we are just a transition point. We do the drug busting and while we do that, you know the shipment that should have gone to Australia and New Zealand are not going out and given our border control measures</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1849 that are here, most of these shipments are trapped here and that is how it spills over into Fiji. Also, when it comes to police custody, its tampered and goes out to the streets. It has become Australia and New Zealand’s drug strategy to dump it here, rather than having the bust at their end. What can be done so that this shipment goes to the intended destination and they deal with this problem? We do not have to deal with these issues and also the impacts to our citizens. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. It is a good question, but a perception at this point really, because we do not invite drugs to come here. It is an assessment that we make, so people assume that for some strange reason, Australia and New Zealand will want to allow the drugs to land here so that they do not land there. I do not know how credible that theory is. But one thing we do ask them though, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our interactions, in terms of the surveillance plans that we do, in terms of the information and intelligence sharing that we do with our partners, that is to try and track these drugs and in the sophisticated ways that they trying to bring it to the South Pacific including Fiji and Australia, we would like them to have a greater influence in the deeper battles in the areas that we do not control. At the moment we do not have the capacity to do that, they share this information with us. In the Navy, if you go there, you will see how they track ships and satellites, but that information is available out there, you can get on the internet and you can tell which boat is where. But these are the countries that have the ability to look beyond, right into the US continent or even into Asia. So, we are asking them, when you discover these vessels you should try and interdict as it is in the water. Do not give us the information when it is about to land on our shore. But it is all these drug paddlers, all these people who bring these drugs, it is more convenient for them to, and this is common sense, bring it here to a point where you can consolidate, you have a short distance to take, you work out your plan and then you take it across. Grid cannot see it unless we get the information. So, that is where the partnership comes in, and I do not think there is a deliberate intension Mr. Speaker, Sir, from our partners to allow these drugs to land here. I think we have vuvale for that matter, so I do not think they are doing that to us. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we move on, the only alarm that this whole scenario has provided for us, as a country, is we should be ready. They have released the fierce dogs to the police, very soon it will be guns against the police, against the people. It would not be in the too distance future, with all these hard drugs are here, all the way right to my village in Somosomo. We have all these meths and everything, so it is just a matter of time, and I think we should all be working together ensuring that instead of waiting for Australia and New Zealand to react, it is us. What will happen to our police? Our law enforcement? Even down to the Navy? When you go around the islands you see how open and vulnerable they are, but now we are dealing with sophisticated instruments and everything because every now and again a boat comes, something just pops out of the water and there you have it. If they cannot send it to their country or destination, then for sure they will be selling it here, and it is quick money! Given the unemployment and the poverty level that we are fighting strongly against, vulnerable people are quickly influenced and enticed in the usage of this. So, that is the only answer, only reply that I would like to continue to provide is, let us be ready. If there is a need for weapons, then we should have it! To help our people combat this.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>1850</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Update on Phase 2 of the National Housing Policy Review (Question No. 204/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.S:</span> VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the Phase 2 of the National Housing Policy Review? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by the honourable Member and I thank him for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government’s commitment is to transform the housing sector is in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, stands to create sustainable, safe, inclusive and resilience citizen communities. This commitment reflects Government’s priority to improve Fijian’s quality of life, enhancing access to essential services, infrastructure and by developing a housing sector that is resilient to climate change impacts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, urbanisation is rising both globally within our country. By 2050, it is projected that 70 percent of the global population will reside in urban areas, while locally an additional 30 percent of the population is expected to live in urban areas by 2030. This rapid urban growth necessitates adoption of sustainable practises that integrate land development, promote the legislative reforms in enhancing urban planning. Hence, the need to review 2011, thus, the Housing Policy to cater for the increasing demand in complexities of housing issues. On 1 st October, 2019, Cabinet approved the appointment of the Housing Sector Policy Advisor funded the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to support the Ministry of Housing in this critical initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 1 st May, 2024, the Ministry conducted a one day stakeholders consultation workshop. The purpose of the workshop was to discuss key housing sector policy changes, issues and gaps with key stakeholders and collectively identify strategic opportunities and recommend areas of priority or priority policy focus. Stakeholders present, which included 60 senior representatives from a broad cross-section of the housing sector, participated in thematic group discussions.
