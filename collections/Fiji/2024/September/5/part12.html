<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements</h4><p>under Standing Order 40, the: (1) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; (3) Honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport; (4) Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services who will deliver two Statements; and (5) Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations. Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes, and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response time from the honourable Leader of G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to also speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate. Anti-Scam Taskforce and National Scam Awareness Week HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Na Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, fellow Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the Hibiscus Festival Queens and the reigning Queen, members in the gallery and the people of Fiji who may be listening to this broadcast either through Walesi or on radio; ni sa yadra vinaka and good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, on various occasions, I get asked the question, how do we think the Government is doing? My response is always very simple, “we are rebuilding a house, a house called our beloved Fiji”. I rise this morning, Mr. Speaker, to inform this august Parliament on the progress that we have made in establishing the “Anti-Scam Taskforce”, something that the other side did not do, along with the recently concluded National Scam Awareness Week that is aimed at addressing the escalating threat of scams and the urgent need for a coordinated nationwide approach. This is very much in keeping with the attempt to rebuild Fiji. The rapid evolution of technology in Fiji has brought tremendous opportunities for growth, communication, innovation, bridging the tech digital divide and access to these essential financial services. However, it has also given rise to a dark side that we cannot ignore - the increasing sophistication and prevalence of scams and unscrupulous behaviour. For a fact, the global economy is increasingly shifting towards digitisation with 4.72 billion internet users that represents 60.1 percent of the global population. The Global State of Scams Report 2022 revealed a concerning trend in digital fraud where reported scams increased by 10.2 percent from 266 million reports in 2020 to 293 million in 2021. The amount of losses from scams surged by 15.7 percent, rising to 47.8 billion in 2020 and 55.3 billion in 2021, largely driven by investment scams. In fact, from our neighbouring shore, Australia, 96 percent of Australian have been exposed to a scam in the last five years with half of these contacted daily or weekly.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen a significant rise in online scams and fraud, with many Fijians falling victim to this deceitful tactics. For instance, the Consumer Council of Fiji has received more than 1,700 complaints in relation to all scams since 2019, worth over $3 million. We have witnessed various types of scams and fraud, including online scams that employ phishing emails and text messages, as well as impersonation of business owners, Chief Executives Officers, Industry Captains, to facilitate funds transfers via mobile wallets. Investment scams, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have also been on the rise, where fraudsters sell accurate and non-existent products or ideas to desperate investors looking to get rich quickly. The eBay shop online recruitment scam, one of the largest in Fiji’s history, has had a devastating impact on our people and brought national attention to this growing threat. The perpetrators preyed on the trust and hope of individuals, leaving them not only financially crippled, but also deeply disillusioned. The Consumer Council of Fiji and the Fiji Police Force reported that around $3 million was lost to eBay scams. However, I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the number is a lot higher and we are awaiting for the report from the Reserve Bank of Fiji, through the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), to properly report the extent of the impact of that scam in Fiji and I can tell you, Sir, that the estimates are quite staggering. As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government took a decisive action and established the Anti-Scam Taskforce. This multi-agency initiative is aimed at tackling the growing problem of fraud through enhanced scam surveillance, strengthening institutional frameworks and targeted awareness campaigns involving various stakeholders. The Taskforce also has long-term plans to focus on legislative enhancements (and I will speak about that a bit later) and continued educational programmes to empower vulnerable communities and create a safer online environment for all Fijians through vigilance and collaboration. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there may well be a need to create a scam agency on its own, given the way things are evolving.</p><h4>The Taskforce, chaired by myself, unites representatives from diverse Government agencies</h4><p>and private sectors, including the: Consumer Council of Fiji; Fijian Commerce and Consumer Commission; Online Safety Commission; Fiji Police Force; (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) Ministry of Local Government; (6) Reserve Bank of Fiji; (7) Fiji Rugby Union; (8) Office of the Solicitor-General; and (9) Telco partners. To effectively tackle the increasing prevalence of scams in Fiji, a comprehensive approach is essential. That is why telecommunication providers, such as Vodafone Fiji and Digicel Fiji, are very much part of this Taskforce, to address the issue of scams more effectively across the nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just last week, the most significant initiative spearheaded by the Anti-Scam Taskforce took place - the National Scams Awareness Week. This week-long campaign is a strategic response to the growing threat of scams, designed to educate, engage and empower the general public,</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1797 particularly our youth. The centrepiece of the National Scams Awareness Week was the national symposium held in Suva with over 200 participants participating for the three days. This symposium brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including Government officials, private sector leaders, representatives from international organisations, technical experts and civil society. I would like to acknowledge and thank the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the Pacific Digital Economy Programme (PDEP), and the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and the European Union, for bringing the National Scams Awareness Week to life. In the span of three days, a series of insightful panel discussions and presentations provided an overview of the challenges related to scam prevention in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we focused particularly on our youth on the final day, as we believe that they are front and centre in terms of advocating for National Scam Prevention because of their prowess with mobile phones and technology. The youth from three Universities participated in a debate and were considered quite successful. This is only the start, Sir, and we will continue this to ensure that our people protect themselves from this raging scourge. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative extends beyond National Scam Awareness Week, as the Taskforce actively promotes awareness through billboards across Suva right now, and we hope to move them around the country. Right now, we have billboards in Vatuwaqa Primary School and Nakasi roundabout. Additionally, in partnership with Vodafone Fiji, SMS blasts have been sent out and will continue to be disseminated to further enhance public awareness. The Consumer Council of Fiji has launched the National TikTok Competition. This initiative aims to engage our youth and encourage them to create and share more impactful content that raises awareness about the importance of recognising and avoiding scams. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to these national initiatives, the Consumer Council of Fiji has taken the lead in conducting community visits and workshops throughout the country. These face- to-face interactions are particularly in areas where access to digital platforms maybe limited. By bringing the message directly to the people, we ensure that scam awareness is not just a topic of discussion but is a lived reality. These workshops involve traders, schools, universities and local community groups. Mr. Speaker, Sir, community engagement is more than ever crucial in our fight against scams. By working with local leaders, community groups and the civil society, we can foster a culture of vigilance and mutual support. Partnerships with the private sector, particularly with industries such as telecommunications and banking, are also critical. These partnerships can help us deploy resources more effectively and ensure that our efforts are coordinated and comprehensive. While the Taskforce is creating a nationwide awareness on the ongoing scams onshore, I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that an important initiative to strengthen the legislative framework is underway, with the support of our donor agencies. This review will be benchmarked against international best practices, ensuring that the laws are not only up-to-date, but also effective in addressing the evolving nature of scams. The consultant who is going to be appointed, intends to provide key recommendations for areas of change, helping us to align our legal framework with global standards and enhance our capacity to protect our citizens.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Just to give an example of how weak our laws are, if a scam is identified and everyone in the country is aware, unless there is a Police complaint, there is really nothing that can be done. Thus, we are hoping that through these legislative changes, if the Reserve Bank of Fiji sees a scam, for example, and identifies it as a scam, they will intervene at that point which will mitigate significantly the impact of scams that we are currently experiencing. Furthermore, the FCCC has joined the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) and the Oceanic Chapter of the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, to enhance its capability to tackle scams more effectively. It is aimed to raise awareness, provide practical tools, facilitate knowledge sharing and conduct research educational events. Through this partnership, the FCCC has gained access to critical tools such as, the ScamAdvisor platform, which enables better direct detection and filtering of potential harmful online scams. Moreover, the wealth of shared knowledge and expertise within GASA will be instrumental in strengthening our defences against emerging threats. In line with these efforts, FCCC is also conducting a state of scams survey in collaboration with GASA. The survey is anticipated to provide valuable insights into the types of scams affecting Fijians and identify strategies for more targeted and effective intervention. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are well aware of what we are doing in terms of cybersecurity and you have, on occasions, mentioned it in this Parliament. The Government, of course, is actively investing in the safety and security of its citizens in the digital space. One of our major initiatives is developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. This important strategy will strengthen our cybersecurity posture, boost resilience, and improve our ability to respond to the ever-evolving cyber threats. Concurrently, Fiji has also deposited its Instruments of Accession of the Budapest Convention which was done on a bipartisan basis through this Parliament. In conclusion, we must acknowledge that the issue of scams is not unique to Fiji. In fact, many of the tactics used by scammers in Fiji are imported or inspired by similar fraudulent schemes that have successfully been executed in other countries. Countries like the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, despite their advanced technological infrastructure and regulatory frameworks, continue to grapple with the challenge of preventing and mitigating scams. These nations have seen a rise in various forms of online fraud, from phising, identity theft, to complex investment scams that have cost individuals and businesses billions of dollars. Through various means and advocacy on scams and fraud protection, I have always said, and would like to reiterate in this august House, that if the offer seems too good to be true, it is likely to be a scam. Proceed with extreme caution. Together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us build a brighter future for the general public where trusts, integrity and security is upheld. MR. SPEAKER.- It, kind of, brings home the fact that I was raising, honourable Members, on how we could utilise the parliamentary process which is now available, in shortening the long road to getting something done. Whether it is Cabinet, or the directive should come from honourable Ministers themselves to the House for Committees to scrutinise and do oversight roles to be enabled to do so.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1799 At this juncture, I would like to adjourn the House for tea, and in so doing, the Contestants have asked that they take a photo shoot with the honourable Prime Minister and you, honourable Members of Parliament, at our front steps of the building. Immediately after that, then you can share some tea with the Contestants as well. I am not forgetting you, Madam, the reigning Queen. The Parliament is adjourned. The Parliament adjourned at 10.37 a.m.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.19 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I will now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make his response. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications for his statement this morning on the Anti- Scam and National Scam Awareness Week. Mr. Speaker, it is easy to get into the digital space and there is a desire for complete digitisation, especially in Fiji, but along with it and as rightfully pointed out by the honourable Minister, there is a dark side attached to it and especially now, with artificial intelligence also, there is a lot that goes on that needs for us to attend to with respect to scams, et cetera. By and large, we seem to be also a very gullible population when it comes to these things. I think there are quite few measures that can occur, and one of the most important cornerstones of all of these would be, and I hope this is the case with the Attorney-General’s Office, that the laws need to be strengthened in order to ensure that these things do not take place. So, I hope that there is a Bill on the Attorney-General’s table that is going to take this into a better space for us. This is a worldwide phenomenon that has been looked at by everyone, and I think one of the trophy cases is actually what has been done in Singapore. I think we could learn a lot from it and I am sure the honourable Minister has seen what has actually taken place. Some things that are helpful to ensuring that we do not have scams, et cetera, is also trying to help and assist those that have been part of it, like anti-scam helplines, et cetera, and it requires also that different Ministries collaborate with each other. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, in Fiji, probably have more SIM cards than we have people, and I think this is something that needs to be looked at in terms of addressing how you can actually restrict the SIM cards so that we can keep a track of what is actually happening and this is a very important tool that has actually been used in other countries where you restrict the number of SIM cards that are actually issued to a particular person. Mr. Speaker, I think in light of the fact that it requires a lot of heavy involvement from all the stakeholders, I think the sector that needs to step up also in this is the banks, to ensure that the Ministry is able to do what is necessary and nationally speaking, it is a national problem. It is not a political problem, it is something that needs to be dealt with at a different scale, and there are three parts of the society that need to ensure that they are very well versed on this, the: (1) elderly; (2) youth; and (3) our parents. Digital education is one of the major things that can help us fight scams, et cetera, that actually occur nowadays. What I am actually saying, Mr. Speaker, is that improving digital literacy is an important tool in fighting these particular scams. I hope the honourable Minister will be ensuring that the banks play an integral part. There are massive profits that they actually make, so they can probably send some of those profits back to putting things into institutions that put us in a better space. The National Scam Awareness Week has actually worked well, and I commend the honourable Minister in actually making sure that something</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1801 is done regarding all of these. We look at, maybe, an anti-scam centre. I know there is one in Singapore, Mr. Speaker, that has been replicated already in Hong Kong. So, these are examples for us to use and, hopefully, Sir, we can actually get to the bottom of this and to ensure that we actually protect our population. We must remember, Sir, that it is not even about $100,000 scam. For Fiji, even the loss of a $100 through a scam is actually worth a lot to a particular person in Fiji. So, we must ensure that we get this right and the start point, as I have said right from the beginning, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that we must ensure that we have the proper legal framework done and it needs to be done at breakneck speed to ensure that we actually have that particular foundation for what we need to do to protect our people. I thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, for his response. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement presented by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. Mr. Speaker, before I go any further, I must acknowledge the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for updating this august House on the progress made by the Anti-Scam Taskforce and the National Scam Awareness Week which concluded on 30 th August, 2024. Mr. Speaker, in an era dominated by digital connectivity, the rise of cyber-related criminal activities has reached unprecedented levels. Therefore, I commend the Coalition Government for setting up the Anti-Scam Taskforce last year, and I hope and pray that the Taskforce will continue to function and uphold their roles independently. Mr. Speaker, scammers exist and have made Fiji their home, and I would recommend that more awareness must be conducted nationwide, especially in rural areas and in our schools from primary to secondary level. Our children must be involved in such awareness programmes so that they would be more vigilant. Mr. Speaker, from experience, I have come across Fijian youth being the target of cybercrime. Youth were promised with overseas employment by paying lump sum of money. With constant reminders by the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, youth and members of our society continue to ignore and were easily lured by the perpetrators. Mr. Speaker, a few times, I would be informing the Criminal Investigation Department of possible scam activities and twice, I had assisted the CID in nabbing the main suspect in the wee hours. It is a very sadful experience to see our fellow Fijians, especially our youth disheartened as most of these youth are unemployed and becoming victims of such evil activity is uncalled for. Mr. Speaker, I would strongly recommend that stricter laws and harsher punishments must be introduced that will deter scammers and future likeminded members of our society. I thank you, once again, for this opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this is my second time in stressing this, that this morning has transpired with some historic attachment to it because three Reports from Standing Committees all indicated, through initiatives made by the former government, that investigations be done, and it took all these time to land their report in this House. By the time the report reached us</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 this morning, the file has disappeared, very important people who were involved are no longer there, so we are talking about scams of late by the Deputy Prime Minister He was saying to strengthen the law, and this is because of the interconnectivity of the digital process that we have. In the last few days, we did not conclude the day by continuing with the agenda that has already been agreed upon because we were not connected to some digital thing that was linked to the Prime Minister’s Office, that is, the Govnet. When the power broke down, everything stood still. We could not function, and I thought Parliament was supposed to be independent – have their own server, et cetera. But, again, it beats me, and I got very angry that afternoon because this is not the way we are supposed to work here. Now, we have reports coming before us, and for me, it is the first time during my tenure as Speaker to come across cases where they have been initiated by government. That was from our former Minister for Housing, honourable Premila Kumar, who initiated that investigation be undertaken but it is only, kind of, a futile exercise that they undertook because the files went missing. Even the former Minister, honourable Bala, is arguing that he was not notified. Imagine, honourable Members, we are hearing that in this House. This is where we deal with all these laws – the repealing and amendment of laws. We can only do it if the processes are there, no matter how much you try to educate the young of Fiji today to learn more about digital and connectivity, et cetera, it still does not hammer home the fact that we tried, and we never succeeded. I understand that may be, Cabinet should be instructing the House, just like honourable Ministers do inform the House that this should be referred to a Standing Committee. Likewise, we should also take the opportunity that we have here. We have scrutiny and oversight role now available for you, honourable Members, to undertake this at a much more faster pace than what the Committee undertakes, and you are able to zero in straight into the cause of the problems that exist. I am only raising this out of concern. Honourable Prime Minister, we do respect you, Sir, and the honourable Members of Cabinet, we would like to see that more is done. Maybe, the Cabinet Sub-Committee make directions to Parliament that this should be investigated, scrutiny and oversight role should be done here, so then that will allow us to kick in, and we see that this is being done straightaway, like they do in various jurisdictions in Australia and New Zealand. It just comes automatically. As soon as the word comes from the honourable Prime Minister’s Executive Government, “We need some investigation to be undertaken here. How did this person get the job?” Now, the Ministry is in a mess, taxpayers’ fund, honourable Members, is being affected, and that is what we are all here for, to scrutinize. I was asked during the campaign of 2018 in Sydney, Australia, “You pray for a government to take over, now that the FijiFirst has taken over. You pray for Fijians to lead, now the Prime Minister is Mr. Bainimarama. What more do you want?” I said, “Yes. We have some democracy now, we have a government in place, half loaf is better than none. But that is all we have, we do not have full democracy.” We were kind of a democracy that in every step, it is like a locked step. It is being dictated by whoever was in charge at that time. But these are the things that we have to address, honourable Members. I would like to stress this once again, 60 cases were highlighted by the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. That is quite a number of cases. Then all of a sudden, you cannot do anything on it. It makes a mockery of all the systems that we have. I apologise on that, honourable Prime Minister and honourable Members of the Government, but that needs to be echoed</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1803 again. If it is coming from the Committees, it is coming from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Combating the Brain Drain Phenomena in the Tourism Industry HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; in the tourism industry, the challenge before us is to combat the issue of brain drain. This challenge is central to ensuring the sustainable growth of our tourism industry which serves as a cornerstone of our nation’s economy. We will note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the reality about our economy today is that it is bullish, which is very different from what detractors were saying that our economy was going nowhere. On Friday, Westpac Fiji reviewed its position on the Fiji economy which it had downgraded initially due to, and I quote: “Stronger than expected sentiments and growth in tourism. The tourism numbers are a lot stronger than we expected.” Further adding, and I quote: “The new Fiji Airways service to Dallas is a growth driver, it is a big positive.” The signing of the new Air Service Agreement made in Fiji and USA early last week in Tonga will open vast possibilities in the US as articulated by the honourable Prime Minister in his Ministerial Statement on Tuesday. In terms of banks, ANZ had earlier upgraded its forecast for Fiji, pegging it at 3.4 percent also riding on the back of tourism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are committed to creating world-class training facilities that will drive Fiji’s tourism industry forward. Our strategy includes collaboration with private sector stakeholders and the development of cutting-edge facilities that meet the highest global standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is blessed that a good number of international brands are operating in our country, and I can venture to say they have found a home in Fiji. These brands have their culture with their ethos, systems and standards that are global and available to our people once they become part of the brands in Fiji. Our people acquire skills that are marketable globally, that is, it is the easiest way to become a global citizen and after a few years with a brand in Fiji, you qualify to join any of that brand’s property globally. And brands are an indication to travellers that a destination has quality offerings. Let me highlight some of the programmes with the brands hotel. The Marriott Fiji Training Academy offers structured training in key areas such as Front Office Operations, Housekeeping Operations, Food and Beverage Service Operations and Kitchen Operations. They would have trained some 800 professionals of late. I was asking the honourable Minister for Education of the possibility of linking this Academy to the Higher Education Commission and thereby strengthen partnership with the Government. The Marriot properties comprise Sheraton Resort and Sheraton Villas, Westin, Marriot Momi and Sheraton Tokoriki. The Radisson Blu Fiji is renowned for its robust Train the Trainer programme designed to continuously enhance the knowledge and skills of its people, ensuring that they remain competitive</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 and well-prepared for the demands of the traveller today known for its high expectations. Hilton has its own Hilton University which is available online for every single position in the industry. The courses include programmes from Harvard, Lausanne and Cornell Universities, the three top universities in tourism in the world today. Hilton has a dedicated recruitment executive who recruits on “attitude” and “desire to learn” as Hilton can train the candidates with skills across most of their businesses. On three consecutive occasions, Hilton has been awarded the Great Place to Work Certification, a global recognition and says much for Hilton in Fiji. They also won the Regional Team Member Promise Award for Hilton Australasia and the South Pacific which include Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Fiji. InterContinental has seen staff members that departed Fiji return and take back their positions which is attributed to the culture at InterContinental. It has a robust training and development programme for its people and evident in all it is Fiji’s properties, that is, Natadola, Holiday Inn, GPH and Crowne Plaza. Shangri-La, the largest resort with some 700 staff members had seen high attrition rates for its people at levels 1 to 3 mostly to Australia and New Zealand. It has implemented robust hiring and retention strategies including partnerships with educational institutions for training programmes, cross exposure with sister properties and internal promotions for filling critical managerial positions. The training programmes in Shangri-La are tailor-made to suit Fiji are categorized at three levels: (1) Essential; (2) Functional; and (3) Leadership Trainings. The past two years have seen intense activities and many challenges post pandemic, they have done very well and known to be a top performer in the Shangri-La Group. The global brands are known for how well they look after their people, for instance, in the case of Sofitel: • • • • • • • minimum wage is much higher than the national minimum wage and within three months it increases by 5 percent; bonus scheme are tied to business performance and attendance, that is, if you are not absent for more than four days, bonus would be in the range of $1,200 net by year end; access to senior management training, including external placements such as in Australia and even France full medical family insurance for middle management and above educational assistance for courses that benefit both their career and the organisation dedicated learning and development division running a minimum 800 hours of training per month after six months staff can apply for internal cross training for other positions available within the Resort. Other brands such as Outrigger, Warwick and Wyndham are also operating in Fiji, all with well-established programmes to recruit and train to retain staff. And, of course, we have our very own Tanoa Group with properties in Fiji and the region. Independent operators have their own programmes and most are emulating what the big brands are doing.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1805 Mr. Speaker, Sir, a recent phenomenon is the conversion from Independent to Brand and many are going that way after COVID-19. Pre-COVID brands were growing their portfolios mostly through new properties and less on conversion at the ratio of 80:20 percent; 80 percent for new properties, 20 percent for conversions. But now, it is 40 percent new properties and 60 percent conversions. As recently announced, Vanua Levu will have its first brand through Wyndham in Labasa, owned by the Damodar Group. The hoteliers are all part of Fiji Hotels Tourism Association (FHTA), the pre-eminent tourism industry association that represents their interests. Sir, FHTA has a very powerful voice and plays a big role in combating the brain drain phenomenon. On Aviation Services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our aviation sector is a critical component of Fiji's tourism industry, and we have invested heavily in world-class training facilities. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the brain drain phenomenon is quite severe in aviation. According to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the number of passenger and cargo numbers will double by 2036. This will call for more pilots, more engineers, more air traffic controllers and other related aviation jobs. Countries will poach from each other. The Fiji National University (FNU) is gearing up to this challenge. At its Nadi campus, it trains our people for Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineering (LAME). It runs for three years taking in 30 intakes each year, the application is about 200 and 300 each year but they can only take 30. Sir, FNU will be adopting the New Zealand standards which takes two years and graduates can qualify for jobs in the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand. FNU is looking at doubling its graduates each year and the Government of Australia through DFAT is playing a huge supporting role following the visit of the honourable Pat Conroy a few months ago. Sir, FNU will expand into pilot training and is grateful that Fiji Airways has donated an A330 Maintenance and Flight Training Device (MFTD) flying simulator to help in this area. This expansion will cost some $10 million, FNU in Nadi, today is a centre for aviation in the Pacific with huge cost benefits to our neighbours, that is, it costs 10 times as much more to train in Australia than in Fiji, for the cost in Fiji is 10 percent of what they would pay if they trained in Australia or New Zealand. We are also in discussion with certain governments in underwriting a Master's programme in aviation through FNU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports Limited operates the Fiji Airports Aviation Academy, offering specialized courses in Air Traffic Management (ATM), Aviation Fire Fighting Services and Air Traffic Safety Electronic Personnel under the Aviation Training Institute Certificate issued by CAAF. All the courses are recognised by ICAO. The training equips its people to manage the Nadi Fight Information Region (Nadi FIR) which covers some 6 million square kilometres in the Pacific, managed from Nadi. Of course, such highly trained people are very marketable, and they continue to move to developed countries such Australia and New Zealand, requiring the Academy to continue to increase its intake of trainees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy in Nadi, stands as beacon of excellence. This fully integrated training centre offers state-of-the-art facilities, including full flight simulators and advance training devices. In the coming weeks, Fiji Airways will be commissioning two new Flights Simulators and two new Flight Training Devices. These resources provide unparallel training for Fiji Airways flight and cabin crew, as well as for the other global aviation entities reinforcing Fiji’s reputation as a leader in aviation excellence.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways is a high performing organisation employing some 2,200 talented employees. It has successfully navigated the challenge of returning its key skillsets through some key effective measures such as: remuneration strategy is based on paying competitive, market benchmark salary; (1) (2) best practises focus, (3) (4) harnessing the learning culture in the organisation. leadership development, with inclusive strategies to improve women in leadership, Our national airline is a source of pride, standing 14 th in excellence in the top 100 airlines globally. It was awarded the best airline in Australia and the Pacific for 2024. I believe all of us, when we fly with our national airline, we know what we are talking about here, the quality of the service is evident and very pleasing. On pilot trainings generally, we grow our own pilots through the South Pacific Aviation Training Institute (SPATI) at the Nausori International Airport, the Pacific Flying School and Advanced Aviation Training (Fiji) Ltd in Nadi. These institutions with their modern facilities and up to-date training aids are producing graduates who now hold significant positions in regional airlines such as Fiji Airways, Air Vanuatu and Airlines of Papua New Guinea. Some are flying huge jets in the busy corridors of the Middle East and Europe. Inbound Operators: Coordinating the ground arrangements of the tourist is a very challenging task and this falls into the domain of the inbound operators and the like, such as rental car companies. They also conduct their own training, and a leader is the Rosie Academy which has found the brain drain phenomenon as not at all bad, as it allows younger intakes into the industry. Some that have departed have returned as the grass is not always greener at the other side. Health and Wellness Tourism: As we continue to develop Fiji as a premier tourism destination, we also focus on emerging sectors like health and wellness tourism. This niche market offer significant opportunities for growth and requires a workforce trained in specialized areas such as health and wellness services, spa management and holistic therapies. A phenomena here, Mr. Speaker, is that people who have made their fortune are now saying, “Take my wealth, give me back my health”, this is a phenomena that we see today. A prime example of this commitment to Health and Wellness Tourism is the Pacific Specialist Healthcare in Namaka, Nadi. This locally owned facility offers world-class services, and the doctors and medical staff are mostly local trained in the local School of Medicine and Fiji Nursing Schools. For general wellness, a number of academies provide training such as: (1) Spa Academy Fiji-Essence of Fiji based in Nadi; (2) Lumiere Academy at Lautoka; and (3) FIT College working collaboratively with FNU, FNTC and Pivot Point all across Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also blessed with a good number of training providers under the watchful eyes of the Higher Education Commission who provides them with the accreditation, ensuring the training programmes align with industry needs. This requires close collaboration between educational institutions and industry stakeholders to develop relevant, up-to-date curricula that reflect the latest industry trends and demands. Training Providers include: (1) Fiji National University offering Diplomas, Degrees and Postgraduate Degrees in Tourism and Hospitality.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1807 (2) University of the South Pacific offering a wide range of courses and programmes in tourism and hospitality at undergraduate and higher degree levels. (3) Fiji National and Productivity Centre (NPTC), a division of FNU, providing vocational and skills-based training in hospitality, tourism management and culinary arts. (4) Australian Pacific Training Coalition (APTC). (5) Pacific Polytech which has taken over some of the campuses operated by Technical Colleges that have closed. They provide training and education in hospitality and tourism at the certificate Level. (6) Vishan Infotech provides hospitality programmes. (7) Pacific Technical Institute. (8) Service Pro, long in the business and has made a huge impact across the community. Most of these Training Providers receive Government grant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, affordability or money is a significant factor, and the Coalition Government is committed to providing substantial financial support through scholarships, grants and other incentives. These initiatives are designed to make education more accessible and to encourage our people to build their careers here in Fiji. These financial supports are not merely about reducing the cost of education, they are about creating opportunities for growth, development and long-term career success. Beyond traditional scholarship, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation has initiated targeted government grants aimed at fostering innovation and encouraging the development of niche tourism markets. These grants are available to entrepreneurs and businesses that are developing new tourism products or services particularly in emerging areas such as eco-tourism, cultural tourism and adventure tourism. By providing financial support to these innovators, we encourage a development of a more diverse and resilient tourism sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for tourism and civil aviation, it is not only about stemming the brain drain, but also to ensure that we do not have any gaps in terms of manpower in our organisations. We have to be able to find replacement from abroad and this requires an accommodative immigration system. The Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is committed to resolving the challenges relating to immigration. A Committee consisting of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics; the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; plus the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; meet weekly with the Growth Reset Team who are private sector volunteers and Immigration Senior Officials to resolve issues related to immigration. This involves a focus on all permit processes with a plan to speed up processing. Automation of work permits is the key focus presently which will lead to significant improvements and expected to go live on 9 th September, 2024. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comprehensive approach we have outlined today, highlight our commitment as a nation to addressing the brain drain phenomenon, ensure the continuing health and sustainability of tourism and civil aviation. Global Labour Mobility is here to stay, but our vision is clear to create a tourism industry that only drives economic prosperity but also serves as a model of excellence in training, career development and innovation. By working together, we can overcome the challenges before us, and build a brighter future for Fiji, a future where our people thrive, our economy prospers, and our tourism industry remains a beacon of excellence on the global stage.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate to give his response. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, this is actually a very important topic and I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for giving us a quick rundown on the brain drain phenomena. According to his own statistics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we lost close to 16,000 workers in the tourism sector in early last year alone. This left massive, massive labour skills gap and I think one of the solutions that was offered by the honourable Minister was that we would start hiring retirees and recruiting workers from neighbouring Pacific Island countries. This might not be sufficient, but it would help. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we must remember is that tourism is in every Fijian’s DNA and because our pride and passion is our people, which has always been so with respect to the industry, we have become a target for poaching our workers. All around the world, they know the skills that we have it is not just Australia and New Zealand, I know Dubai, et cetera, have actually been targeting our workers so that they leave. So, how do we address it? It is actually difficult, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember the Castaway Resort alone had lost about 70 percent of its kitchen staff. So, when you look at it from a resort perspective, that is quite a lot of staff that is lost, and these are trained staff that have actually gone. So, what do we do? There are only a few things that we can do, and I think it is because it is private sector driven, it is great to see that institutions that are within the industry are actually training all the different hotel operators but yet still, we must look at how else we can actually do this. One of the things that can be done is that we have to look at reviewing the pay for all these workers because we cannot compete with what he is being paid. But together with the pay, you have to look at what benefits can be given to our workers so that they actually stay in the country because you must remember, they are our prized possession. This is the biggest industry in Fiji, and it requires a concerted effort from everyone. When you look at the pay, it is actually twofold, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You have to look at the cost of living and how it is that you are actually going to retain these workers. Now, it is our opinion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in light of the fact that the tourism industry has grown beyond what we can actually service it, a lot of profits have been made so some of those profits need to be put back into the workers themselves. I think it is important, and we must remember that this is an industry that this is completely driven by the private sector. We have a fantastic relationship with the operators, and it requires a constant conversation with the honourable Minister, the Ministry and the Ministries that are involved, and it runs across the board with many different sectors but currently, we are looking at close to, if I am correct, honourable Minister, it is like $3 billion dollars of earnings. We are looking at growing this industry. If you want to grow the industry, you must show to those who want to invest in it, that we are able to service that industry by ensuring that there is a constant supply in terms of the workforce. Encouraging more young people to get into the industry, they will only stay, if they are paid well enough, Mr. Speaker.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1809 In terms of catering for their arrivals, Mr. Speaker, we also need to look at this, currently, we have had a drop in our service ratings. If we compare ourselves to Bali, et cetera, we are sitting at about 6.84 and as a comparison to Bali and Phuket, et cetera, they sit at 8.5. That service level has actually dropped. It has dropped not because we wanted it to, it has dropped because of the migration of our skilled workers. These other countries that we compete with are actually putting us on a knife edge, and I am glad to see that the honourable Minister has acknowledged this particular problem and he is working with the industry and also our other Ministries, especially the Ministry of Education, to ensure that we do not have a serious problem, also in light of the fact that his neighbour Minister sitting right next to him is actually encouraging more and more investment in that particular area. We want to grow the numbers, of course, we want to see a million visitors but more hotels means more workers. If we are not able to find a strategic way to keep these workers in our country, we will have a serious problem in actually growing up because investors will look at it and say, they are not able to. We must all remember this, Mr. Speaker, our pride of possession in our industry is our workers and our hospitability. I thank you, Honourable Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable leader of G-9 Bloc, or his designate for his response. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the Statement and thank you honourable Koya for those comments. When I look at the subject this morning on combating the brain drain phenomenon, I thought it was holistically in a sense. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister spoke on combating it within the tourism sector; a very important sector industry for Fiji. It cuts across the other sectors, even to our farmers and our fishermen, and it is important that we keep the industry alive and vibrant and trying to accommodate the increase that is anticipated in the coming years for tourism. As honourable Koya had mentioned, the big push factor for Fiji is that our wages pushes people up. We can engage in the training and train people to be qualified, and they become very marketable to those countries that pay better. It is not only for Fiji, it is phenomenal worldwide, and that is why we have international labour mobility and this is very fluid workers that are just moving around the world and really targeting those that pay better. I had mentioned this in the House before that one of the unique features for Fiji is that the very push factor that pushes people out is the pool factor for those in big population countries. The same wages that we do not like over here is attractive enough for those that come in from some other countries. Not only that, added to that pool factor of the wage that we have here is the fact that they come and work in one of the preferred tourism destinations in the world - in Fiji. So, outside of Fiji we will have this pool of people who are willing to come. I think that in order to tackle this brain drain issue, we have almost no other choice but to allow these foreigners to come in and work in Fiji, which then demands that it has to be looked at holistically, and that we set policies that really target getting foreign workers to come in and work, and more importantly also, is to ensure that when they come in and work in Fiji, that they are well looked after. I remember a story when I was Director Immigration, we got this guy that came in from Pakistan, I think. He was somewhere near Korovou. The job that he was doing was burning CDs and he was just surviving on onions, because there is always this tendency that foreign workers get exploited because they are held to ransom, “You mess up, I will chase you back to your country”. But they had sacrificed so much to be able to come over. They sell their properties in order to come</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 back. He said that if we send them back, we send them back to nothing almost. So, it has to be a holistic approach to tackling the brain drain. We know that in years to come, these people that go out, again, if our policies are right, we then, turn it into a brain drain gain. They come back as very well-off people, they have a lot more money, they are more educated and more experienced and maybe, they would like to come back and invest in our country. But I commend the service providers in our tourism sector and the effort that they put into trade - our workers, so that they can, at least, fill the gap, but it is this phenomenon of being pushed out and being pulled by the better wages that are offered by our neighbours who are well developed is the problem, I suppose. I guess it is worth looking at now, for Government to holistically just sit and look at how we manage this fluidity of international labour and turn it around into a net skilled game for Fiji as we managed the going out and those that are coming in. The problem with the coming in is that everyone comes in - the workers, the scammers which we have just talked about before, the traffickers who try and sneak in through this fluidity of movement of labour around the world. I commend the Ministry, Deputy Prime Minister, and the private sector and the tourism industry in working hard to try and keep this very vital industry for Fiji alive and thriving. National Update on the 2023-2024 Water Sector Deliverables HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address this august House on my</p><h4>Ministerial Statement.</h4><p>The honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians, ladies and gentlemen; I thank you for the opportunity to address and elaborate more on the Water Sector 2023 to 2024 achievements and 2024 to 2025 major plans and status update. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry and the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has made significant strides in both, infrastructural and institutional development, ensuring that the people of Fiji have access to reliable, safe and sustainable water and wastewater services, as constituted and mandated under the Water Authority of Fiji Act 2007. Allow me to highlight these achievements under two key categories: Institutional Achievements and Infrastructural Achievements. Institutional Achievements include the following: (1) Launch of the Water Sector 2050 Plan This is a landmark achievement where the Coalition Government launched the Water Sector 2050 Plan in April 2024, a visionary roadmap that outlines Fiji’s water sector and wastewater priorities for the next three decades. This comprehensive plan is designed to transform how water services are delivered across the nation. It addresses the challenges of climate vulnerability, renews aging infrastructure and aligns with the principles of the circular economy. Furthermore, it is a crucial step and clear roadmap in our ongoing efforts for clean and accessible water. (2) Introduction of WAF's e-Service Platform Mr Speaker, Sir, in our commitment to improving customer service, WAF launched its e- Service platform. This online service provides our customers with easy access to their accounts and allowing them to pay bills and report any queries with just a few clicks. This</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1811 digital transformation is a significant step in making services more accessible and efficient, particularly for those in remote areas. (3) Water Production and Non-Revenue Water (NRW) Reduction This is a key issue from August 2023 to July 2024. The WAF produced a total of 130,771 mega litres of water, demonstrating our capacity to meet the growing demands of our population. A key focus has been on reducing NRW. I am pleased to announce that, through diligent efforts, a reduction in NRW from 47 percent in 2023 to 45 percent in the first half of 2024 was achieved. This 2 percent reduction may seem modest, but it represents a significant accomplishment, resulting from extensive work in leak detection, infrastructure maintenance and customer engagement. (4) Increased Water and Wastewater Connections The WAF successfully increased water connections by 2,257 and wastewater connections by 96. This growth in connections is a direct result of the extension projects, which expanded the network to reach more households and communities. The increase in connections reflects the rising demand from customers to connect to reliable water and wastewater services and underscores Government’s commitment to expanding access to clean water. Infrastructural Achievements include the following: (1) Urban Water Projects Mr. Speaker, Sir, WAF has made significant progress in enhancing urban water infrastructure, to ensure more Fijians have access to reliable water services. During the 2023-2024 financial year, a total of 31.57 kilometres of pipeline extensions were completed, benefiting close to 47,350 Fijians. A key highlight of this achievement is the Sawani to Viria pipelaying project, which involved the installation of 24.5 kilometres of new pipeline, directly benefiting 6,500 Fijians. This project was made possible by the completion of the Viria Water Treatment Plant, a state-of-the-art facility that has a capacity of 40 mega litres. As a responsible Coalition Government, we shall continue to enhance and expand from developments of previous governments. As a result of this project, areas that previously experience intermittent water supply are now receiving a consistent and reliable water services. Another major accomplishment in the financial year was the completion of the Nabouwalu Packaged Water Treatment Plant, a 2 megalitre facility that is now serving over 5,400 Fijians. This represents a significant improvement in water supply in the Nabouwalu area, ensuring that residents have access to clean and safe water. We will soon see the commissioning of this project. In addition, WAF has successfully installed backup generators at 14 major pump stations. This critical infrastructure upgrade ensures that power supply is available during outages. (2) Rural Water Scheme Projects WAF has completed 10 Rural Water Projects, benefiting various communities that previously lacked access to a proper water supply. These projects involved the construction of new water schemes and the installation of standpipes and shower heads, providing communities with a reliable and safe water source. I should add that the Ministry continues to work closely with organisations such as Rotary Pacific Water for Life Foundation, Fiji Water Foundation, Vodafone Foundation, LDS Church, the Australian Government, New Zealand Government and other development partners, to continue to support access to safe</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 water in rural Fiji. These organisations have all made significant contributions in the access of safe and clean water. I commend them for their contributions to the nation, Sir. (3) Rainwater Harvesting Tanks Mr. Speaker Sir, as part of our commitment to ensuring water security in remote areas, 3,200 rainwater harvesting tanks was delivered across four regions, benefiting 15,755 households. Notably, the most recent deliveries included to the Tikina Yasawa areas which have faced drought-like conditions. We have also delivered to low pressure and intermittent supply areas, such as Sakoca, around the Tamavua area. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to our infrastructural and institutional achievements, WAF has also strengthened its presence on regional and international platforms, in particular in regional forums, in the 14th Pacific Water and Wastewater Association (PWWA) and the Water Ministers Forum. I am pleased to advise that WAF recently represented Fiji at the International Water Association (IWA) and World Water Congress &amp; Exhibition in Canada. This brought together global leaders in water management, and I am pleased to announce that WAF has been recognised and honoured with the Climate Smart Utilities Recognition Award 2024. Mr. Speaker Sir, achieving this award on an international level not only recognises the hard work of our staff at WAF, but also the stakeholders who support our organisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress made in the past year sets a strong foundation for future initiatives, as outlined in the Water Sector 2050 Plan. Challenges need to be overcome and opportunities seized to enhance the quality of life. I commend all stakeholders involved, particularly with our staff contractors who have all work hard in the mud, rain and at all hours during emergency situations with commitment and dedication to restore water supply when these are cut off through various reasons. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the significant initiatives and strategic plans that WAF has set in motion for the 2024-2025 financial year includes the $259 million allocated by Government in terms of the current Budget, which will ensure access to clean and safe water and these includes $135 million for capital expenditure and $123 million for operational costs. (4) Water Programme Mr. Speaker, Sir, WAF with a significant allocation of $82.07 million for its Water Programme, is to address supply challenges and improve infrastructure across the region. A key priority within this programme is the NRW initiative which has been allocated $5 million. This is to address water loss through leaking pipes, which remains a significant issue. WAF is engaged in a Performance-Based Contract for NRW reduction, specifically targeting the Suva-Nausori area. It also includes a series of essential upgrades and expansions. (a) Water Packaged Treatment Plant The programme includes the upgrades of: (i) Benau Water Treatment Plant;</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1813 (ii) Consultancy services for the Wainadoi Water Supply Scheme; and (iii) Construction of the Navua Packaged Water Treatment Plant. (b) Water Mains Upgrading Works Mr. Speaker Sir, we will be looking into the Central Division: (i) RKS and QVS upgrade works; (ii) Northern Division: Labasa Operation Upgrade; (iii) Nabouwalu Operational Upgrade; and (iv) Savusavu Operational Upgrade In the Western Division, the: (i) Dreketi Feeder Road Upgrade; (ii) Vuda Rider Water Mains Upgrade; and (iii) Wairabetia Water Mains Upgrade (c) Pipeline Extension Projects Mr. Speaker Sir, it is crucial to expand the water supply coverage, particularly in underserved areas: • Central Division: Korovou to Veinuqa Extension, Lokia Pipelaying Works and Sawani to Colo- i-Suva. This is especially important, especially as it will alleviate the water problems currently faced in the Tacirua, Sakoca, Tamavua and also into Delainavesi and Lami, and entail laying of 1.43 kilometres from Sawani Junction to a new pump station at Buresasa, then to Colo-i-Suva where two new 5 megalitres steel reservoirs will be built, and then down to Khalsa Road in Tamavua. You may have heard of the Bilo Extension. These areas have been without water supply for decades and the Coalition Government has taken urgent action to ensure that the water pipelines are extended, and it is currently underway. • Northern Division: Benau to Rara Pipeline, Nabekavu Mains Extension and Degau Extension. • Western Division: Sigatoka Water Coverage Extension (this include three sub-projects, that is, Vusama, Navisabasaba, Nadrala and Waibogi Villages involving laying 16 kilometres water mains. Some of these villages had suffered from water borne diseases due to contaminated water and we have taken urgent action to ensure that this extension do happen, and these works are currently being done. • The other major one is the Nagado to Nadele Pipeline from the Nagado Water Treatment Plant. This will significantly increase the discharge volume and sustain the growing demand for water in the tourism areas, Nadi, Lautoka. The Nagado Water Treatment Plant is an ongoing project nearing completion with</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 a more modern and automated water treatment plant and will add further capacity and redundancies. Mr. Speaker Sir, in terms of Asset Management Programme with an allocation of $8.54 million. This is designed for optimal functionality of our systems, and we will include matters such as the: (1) Lami-Nausori Wastewater Masterplan. (2) Feasibility study for a new water source and treatment plant for the Nadi-Lautoka region. (3) The development of a Masterplan for the Suva-Nausori Water Supply, ensuring the long- term sustainability. (4) A Masterplan for the Keyasi Water Supply and Wastewater Scheme. Mr. Speaker Sir, as I speak, tenders for the masterplans will be advertised in the coming weeks. Wastewater Programme, this is a current issue which will need to be expanded. Only 28 percent of our population currently has access to sanitation services and projects under wastewater include: (1) The rehabilitation of the Pacific Harbour Wastewater Treatment Plant. (2) The cleaning and upgrading of the Kinoya Wastewater Treatment Plant. (3) The installation of new diffusers at the Wailada Wastewater Treatment Plant. (4) In addition, the Coalition Governmnent has acted quickly in terms of the increased demand and deteriorating water and sewer reticulation systems at Denarau Island. We recognize the importance of Denarau to the tourism industry and to our national economy, especially businesses, employees, and of course, the landowners of Denarau. The wastewater and water systems for Denarau was built in the 1970s with minor enhancements to-date, for basically one hotel, that is, the Regent of Fiji Hotel. Today there are nine resorts with over 2,000 rooms, water park, golf courses, residential lots and a marina with shopping and restaurant complex. Hotel developments are ongoing with plans for substantial developments underway and the Government has prioritised this and provisioned up to $15 million with possible cost sharing in terms of the Denarau Island Infrastructure Design/Build Upgrade Works which has been put to tender. The project will involve the upgrade and replacement of existing sewer pump stations, sewer rising main, sewer reticulation and new water mains. Mr. Speaker Sir, we also note the critical importance of spares, and it is something that has been allocated for. Of course, in terms of rural water, that is again an area of importance to the Government: • Rural Water Carting in Non-Metered Areas: $4 million allocated. • Rainwater Harvesting: $1.4 million set aside and we encourage our Fijian people to continue to look at this option as a redundancy measure. • Rural Water Supply Scheme: $2.11 million has been dedicated to implement water supply schemes in the Central, Western, and Northern Divisions to benefit over 4,000 Fijians. These projects are vital to improving the quality of life in our rural communities. In terms of the dry weather recently experienced, I wish to update on the status of catchments. You may be aware, Sir, that we had issued a public advisory through a media release on 22 nd August advising the public to use water wisely. Thanks to the trough of low pressure and the rains on 24th</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1815 and 25 th, this has brought temporary relief where in the Central Eastern 14 sources have now recovered out of the 17. In the Lomaiviti Group, there are some areas which remain critical and for the Western Division, high rainfall was also observed and from these 13 sources, eight are now normal but three are still close to critical. So, I advise all Fijians to still conserve water and take the necessary measures for prudent use of water. The Northern Division also experienced low pressure, but rainfall was not as intense and there are still areas which need assistance. Sir, with the unpredictable weather we may face in the next months, we are working closely with the various relevant authorities such as Tourism, Health and Education in monitoring the situation, and of course, with the Divisional Commissioners, we are working closely with them in alleviating water shortages and providing relief and also through the Government Shipping Services for our maritime areas. The Coalition Government is expanding its risk for better water services internationally and we need to do that given the limitations of our national coffers. Water cannot be delivered without energy so when we talk about climate financing, the water-energy nexus is crucial, and in this regard, opportunities must be efficiently utilized. We must continue to be reminded that for Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) such as Fiji, availability and accessibility of basic utilities such as energy and water are of paramount importance in terms of daily survival, especially for our grassroots, not only that, but of course water, energy and roads. There is a great community grassroot need to champion these water-energy annexes to alleviate poverty and it is a catalyst for transformational impact on daily lives. So, we need to target that nexus in terms of climate financing in the scope of assessing natural spring or ground water resources using the latest solar voltaic technology, where the solar powered borehole pumps or even solar power desalination plants. This energy-water nexus, it is programme innovatively using smart national level frameworks which can truly provide transformational catalyst especially maritime communities. Sir, in this regard, we will continue to work towards this particular area. We are now intensifying Climate Financing Concept Papers and Proposals with the Ministry of Climate Change accordingly around the water and energy with great initial support from our development partners to-date. To conclude, as already alluded to yesterday by the honourable Minister for Lands, the Coalition Government has taken a significant step in its relationship with catchment landowners with the Cabinet approval for the development of a framework and policy for compensation of standing trees in catchment areas. We, as a government, will continue to listen to all stakeholders especially and to address landowner issues as appropriate within our current legal frameworks. MR. SPEAKER.- I think we will adjourn for lunch now. When we resume at 2.30 p.m., we will continue with the response from the honourable Leader of the Opposition and that of the Group of 9. I am also told that the honourable Minister for Justice has withdrawn his Ministerial Statement, as such, upon returning we will update you further. The Parliament adjourned at 12.24 p.m.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.32 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate to make their response. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his very extensive elaboration on the water sector, and in particular the achievements had been achieved over the past financial year. Water as we all know is one of the most important things that we have and in fact its importance is reflected in its listing as one of the SDGs and also that it has a very specific segment in the Constitution which calls for the Government of Fiji to make sure that all of our citizens have safe and clean water. For having served as a Minister for Water, I know the enormous challenges that are faced in trying to make sure that we deliver that. Nevertheless, we are bound by the dictates of the Constitution, in terms of making sure that we are able to provide the water that is needed. I have read with interest the Corporate Plan for the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) which lists all the issues that the WAF has been targeted in this last financial year and also the 2050 Strategy. I am glad that the 2050 Strategy has come into place. I know the discussions on this were taking place while I was still a Minister and I am glad that is borne to fruition, now we can see this firmly in place. I congratulate the WAF for having that long-term strategy because one of the problems that we have, when we do not have a long term strategy, we do things ad hoc. There are a number of things that I just wanted to focus in briefly in terms of the Corporate Strategy that the WAF has. There are too many things that are covered, so I cannot address all of them, so I just choose to talk on two. On the issue of non-revenue water, it is the water that is produced, we extract from the sources of water, but they do not get to their designation. They are lost along the way either they are stolen or because of leakages in the pipes that they get lost. We know that the figure that we know that we have for non-revenue water in this country is around 47 percent, almost half of the water that we extract from the sources do not get to their intended destination. This has been a long-standing problem in WAF largely because of the old infrastructure, I think that is the major issue. The target for the 2023-2024 Corporate Plan was to reduce this by 5 percent in this first financial year, although the target has not been achieved, the honourable Minister has highlighted that they have been able to achieve 2 percent, that is a good beginning when we get there. We need to be able to get to this, to make sure there is adequate water. Around this whole issue of the quantum of water being adequate or available to people, there are other issues that revolve around that, the conservation of water. Maybe one of the other things that I find in that corporate plan is the review of the tariff of water. This is something that is actually in this plan. One of the challenges that we have in any commodity that we have, when it is too cheap, people do not attach a lot of importance to it. This is obviously going to be one of the issues with water. We have one of the cheapest waters in the Pacific and when it is that cheap, people are not going to conserve it and I notice in the plan, there is a call for the review, and I would like to hear the Government’s intent on the actual review of the plan. The second thing that I have, since I only have a minute and 30 seconds, I forgot where I put my notes. There are some very important targets in terms of meeting of 100 percent of customers’ expectations in the customer charter. We did not have any feedback on that and there is one important target that we have. For the greater Suva area to return the 24/7 water supply. I think this is still a</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1817 challenge for us and I am hoping and congratulate the honourable Minister for what they have been able to do so far, but on those two particular areas on the non-revenue water and meeting that expectation of 24/7 water supply, it is a huge challenge. This is something that people continue to complain about, and I wish the Government well in trying to make sure that we can achieve that for the benefit of all of our people. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank honourable Usamate for his contribution. I am grateful to the honourable Minister for his comprehensive Ministerial Statement. I noted that the Minister has covered the broader subject on water sector deliverables, particularly the update on the execution under the 2023-2024 Financial Year and the capital programme for the 2024 – 2025 Financial Year. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the honourable Minister for emphasising on rural water access. He mentioned 11 rural water projects carried out in 2023. The issue of water is paramount to our people. During my recent visit to the voters in the Northern and Western Divisions and parts of Naitasiri last week, it was clear that water was their foremost concern. From our rural communities it was consistently clear and urgent that they need access to clean and safe water. Historically, Mr. Speaker, rural water supplies are often being overshadowed by the urban needs, but we are beginning to see a positive shift in focus because of what we believe to be, the provision in the Constitution guarantees the right to water for all Fijians and that means it will be the responsibility of the Government to see this right is observed. We have a commitment towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG6) that advocates for water accessibility to everyone. Most members of this august House recognise that the rural communities face significant challenges in accessing clean water. Issues such as contamination from agricultural runoff, improper waste disposal and insufficient sanitation facilities contribute to this problem. Contamination not only pose health risk but also leads to water borne diseases. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the remote locations of many of these rural communities means that residents often have to undertake long and strenuous journeys to collect water. That will affect women, children and even elders. One of the studies that was done by the World Health Organisation titled “Drinking Water, Sanitations and Hygiene” in emergencies indicates that individuals require between 50 litres to 100 litres per day to meet basic hygiene needs and physiological needs. So those with access to only about 20 litres of water daily face significant health risk frequently encountered by the rural population, including our maritime communities. We have lots of families, as we know, the households here in Fiji today who are vulnerable and exposed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a recent Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) Report in July 2024 highlighted that 96,000 Fijians or about 12 percent of our population primarily from the rural areas lack access to safe and clean drinking water. I want to sincerely thank the honourable Minister for his commitment in addressing these pressing issues. As the honourable Minister outlined, the rural water plan is vital to improving water management and ensuring sustainable development for rural communities. While we acknowledge the efforts by previous governments in this sector, it is encouraging to hear the honourable Minister with a renewed focus and determination to resolve these issues. I am hopeful that that progress will be a swift one. In the 2024-2025 Budget, the allocation of $82.3 million for water programmes, including $7.5 million for rural initiatives, this significant funding should facilitate substantial improvements</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 in water access for many rural communities in the coming months. Once again, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement in reassuring the people of Fiji, especially those in the rural areas. Your message, honourable Minister will surely bring hope and encouragement to those grappling with water crisis watching this Parliamentary session. Suicide Prevention HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of this august House, distinguished guests, members of the public virtually viewing this parliamentary session, a good afternoon to you all. Allow me to brief this august House on an issue that needs a coordinated and multi-sectoral public health response. Working very closely with the National Committee on the Prevention of Suicide, we will be commemorating World Suicide Prevention Day on Tuesday, 10 th September, with the launch of the Suicide Prevention 2024 theme: “Change the narrative with a call to action, start the conversation.” I am respectfully starting this conversation with you here in this august House and across the nation, with our viewers across the globe. We need and must work together. According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 800,000 people die by suicide every year, which means one person every 40 seconds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, the suicide and attempted suicide statistics gathered by the Fiji Police Force in six years from 2016 to 2021 revealed a total of 1,276 suicide and attempted cases; an average of 213 cases per year with about half the number leading to deaths. The highest number of suicide and attempted suicide cases were recorded in 2019, with 244 cases and the Western Division recorded the most cases every year for the six years. Changing the narrative of suicide is about transforming how we perceive this complex issue and shifting from a culture of silence and stigma to one of openness, understanding and support. A call to action encourages everyone to start the conversation on suicide and suicide prevention. Every conversation, no matter how small, contributes to a supportive and understanding society. By initiating these vital conversations, we can break down barriers, raise awareness and create better cultures of support in our churches, mosques, sporting fields, and kava sessions. Let us start this conversation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2030) underlines suicide as the second most common cause of death among young people between the ages of 15 years to 29 years across the globe. Every individual suicide has far reaching emotional, social and economic consequences and deeply affects the families, global communities and nations across the globe. I am inviting Members of this august House, your Ministries and everyone listening and watching this session, please wear a yellow or orange article of clothing, wrist band or hair band on Tuesday, 10 th September to indicate that you are advocating that life is for living, that a life lost to suicide is a life to many. I call on my colleagues on both sides of Parliament to get your staff, students, teachers, families and to all Civil Servants to wear orange or yellow on the day and on most days, to help advocate for suicide prevention and save a life. You can also join us from Tuesday, 10 th September, 2024, via livestream on the Ministry of Health and Medical Services social media page at 8.30 a.m. and also in the evening, a candle light vigil from 6.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. at Ratu Sukuna Park. Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate for their response.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1819 HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for enlightening the general public in Parliament on the importance of suicide cases and mental health and wellbeing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to know that suicide is a major health problem with far reaching social, emotional and economic consequences and as you alluded, more than 800,000 die every year and is the fourth leading cause of death among 15 to 29 year olds which is really worrying. In Parliament or even leaders outside, we always talk about the future generation. We are doing everything now for the future generation but the fourth leading cause of death among 15 to 29 year olds is suicide. Fiji is considered to have one of the highest suicide rates in the world and according to statistics, it has been revealed by Lifeline Fiji that a Fijian citizen will attempt to take their life every 36 hours, and the youngest victim was a seven-year-old child. The ingestion of pesticides, hanging and firearms are the most common methods of suicide globally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is why paraquat was banned in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, World Suicide Prevention Day on 10 th September, 2024, with the launch the Suicide Prevention 2024 theme, ‘Change the Narrative with All of Action: Start the Conversation’ is a great initiative. The more we talk about this, the more we normalise this in society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2015 was the first year when the Suicide Prevention Day was celebrated in schools. I think on a social media recently, a mother posted of her young boy who was in Year 9. It was a normal day, he went to school, by the time he came home he had killed himself already, and she is looking for reasons as to why he did so. Mr. Speaker, Sir, suicide shrouded in stigma, shame and misunderstanding. This means that people do not often ask or seek for adequate help. Prevention of suicide cannot be accomplished by one person, organisation or institution, and it requires support for the whole community. Here are the few recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir: (1) Restrict and monitor the sale and usage of fertilizers and pesticides which can be used as an attempt to suicide. (2) We need to restrict networks that are fuelling drug usage, social media bullying and threats. (3) We need laws that penalise those who bully, harass and threaten others on social media. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently there was a matter viral on social media where a TikToker had killed himself because he was being bullied on social media. In fact, what I see on Tiktok is people threatening each other, giving their addresses and say, “I am at this address, come and fight with me”. It is quite surprising that people do these things and children have access to this kind of content in Fiji. Corporations and businesses must be made compulsory to conduct wellness programmes and suicide awareness weeks under their corporate social responsibility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we can do as legislators is to increase financial support to St. Giles and various NGOs to equip them with more resources, aimed at substance use prevention, mental health, reduce risk, re-enforce protective factors by providing social support to vulnerable individuals, follow -up care, raising awareness, fighting stigma and supporting those who have deranged by suicide which, hopefully, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance can consider in the next budget.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, there needs to be more dialogue and discussions within households, religious groups, communities and a society as a whole, and I am glad the honourable Minister really emphasises on this point. It serves as a reminder that suicide prevention is a public health priority and urgent action is required to make sure that suicide mortality rates are reduced. By creating hope through action, I assure the people of Fiji that we are committed to this shared responsibility and that there is hope, and that we care, and we want to support them and through collective actions, we can achieve the desired outcomes of these pressing issues, leaving no Fijian behind. Vinaka. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate for their response. HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, the honourable Minister's words reflect a deeper societal concern that affects each one of us - the grim and saddening scenario of suicide in Fiji, and we appreciate his dedication to this cause and the launching of the Suicide Prevention 2024 initiative next Tuesday. The theme, ‘Change the Narrative with the call to action - start a conversation’, is not just appropriate but extremely crucial to our collective effort in dealing with suicide. I am reminded of two key scriptures from our Holy Bible. The first one, Deuteronomy 30:19,</p><h4>represents the sanctity of life where the Lord says, I quote,</h4><p>“I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live”. This passage sets forth a profound truth, every life is invaluable. In Galatians 6:2, he urges us to show empathy to our fellow beings. The Apostle Paul wrote, and I quote, “Bear one another's burden, and so fulfil the law of Christ." Both scriptures, Mr. Speaker, impress the importance of preserving life and lending an empathetic ear to individuals battling with the pressure of life. We have seen the ripple effects it sends in families, neighbours and in our communities. We ought to create an environment where our people can openly discuss their predicaments, how they feel, how they are valued, to be heard and be understood. Professor and Director of the Hamilton Counselling and Psychology Department, Dr. Karen Mason, is writing a note which says, “Why should a church observe the National Suicide Prevention Month, the month of September? As I read through his research, he said in 2018, (before the pandemic) that more people died of suicide than from drug-related death. According to the latest data from the Centre of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of suicide deaths in the United States continues to climb. Mr. Speaker, Sir, here in Fiji, the faith-based organisations are an integral part in shaping our society's moral, ethical and spiritual transformations. The influence of these organisations can be productive in creating a compassionate approach towards individuals experiencing distress. Moreover, they can contribute to creating a supportive environment for prevention efforts. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to be better looked after by the Government in terms of resources and capacity building.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1821 It is important to note that the faith-based organisations in Fiji has got the biggest reach in our local settings. They must not only be used as a rubber stamp in the consultations for new government initiatives but be seen as a tangible tool in dealing with the many challenging social issues that we face in our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Suicide Prevention 2024 Programme should not just be a campaign but a necessitated movement to preserve, to cherish and honour life. The ecumenical faith-based bodies in Fiji are frontline warriors in creating a society filled with understanding, empathy, and love. I firmly believe, if given recognition and the critical support by Government, we can be rest assured that our commitment geared towards the successful implementation of this initiative will be a success. In conclusion, Christians view suicide prevention as part of our call to love our neighbours. As we love ourselves, it is our duty to reach out to those that are suffering, extend emotional and spiritual support and start the conversation in changing the narrative sounding mental health discussion. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we can create that space in which those that are struggling with suicide can find hope, solace and most importantly, find help.</p><h4>We thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement from</h4><p>the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services this afternoon. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think the challenge offered by the Minister for Health and Medical Services needs to be taken up. He has asked us for our support. If I remember correctly, one of my predecessors here, Mr. Pita Nacuva, being a former Speaker, a former international rugby player, he excelled in his work front, right up to his career in politics. One day, it was a sad day one of his children took her own life and the Members of Parliament then were all badly affected from that tragedy. Even if the son or daughter of a well-off person, when you suffer this kind of fate, we all feel it, whether is to do with the suicide or drug problem, which is another upcoming case that is before us now. I take it that the offer given by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, I would ask for your permission honourable Members if the print on the Daily Hansard could be in bold letters, so as to remind us of the fate of Mr. Pita Nacuva’s daughter when she took her own life. It affected the whole lot of us in the House then because you never know when will this kind of tragedy strike you and make you part of that. It was difficult moment for us. The Rehabilitation Centre in Tamavua is still being talked about and I do not know when they will start building the rehabilitation centre. St. Giles is not a rehabilitation centre but here, we are talking about drugs and suicide. These are issues that are before us right now and we need to begin to start talking with other people who are affected seriously. You cannot understand these kind of people. They do not talk, they do not share their views but all of sudden, they take their life. When I was serving my jail time in Nadera for five months, I served my time with some of the people who were seen as delinquents of the Nadera area and the church looked after them. I shared my meals with them, and it was a sad occasion for me because it taught me a lot of lessons. How the churches, as alluded to by the honourable Ravunawa, went out of their way to try and help our society of different ethnic background yet they were there.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Some, we can tell the mind is not 100 percent there but, again, all they wanted is love, all they wanted is some attention to be bestowed on them. That is not coming from the parents, that is not coming from the family but we, as citizens of this country, can play our role there. It is not an easy one, it is not an easy challenge but again, the data as alluded to by honourable Ritesh Sharma and honourable Ravunawa will be on the increase all the time, it will never decrease. The population is building up, social problems are too many to address or to name, but I hope if you can agree with me that we ask the Secretary-General to, please, make that statement made by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services in bold statement so as to remind us in future that that challenge was offered to us, and either we did something about it or we almost did nothing about it. Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Platform for Labour Ministers HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament; I rise to update this august House on the Blue Pacific Big Oceans States (BPBOS) Platform for Labour Ministers with the focus on one voice for the International Labour Organization (ILO), Pacific Island Member States on Employment related matters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the BPBOS Labour Platform was established by the Government representatives of the 11 ILO Member States in consultation with their social partners. Fiji is the current Chair of the BPBOS while the Government of Cook Islands holds the role of the Secretariat. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the BPBOS is to bring together leaders and representative from the Pacific Island nations to discuss common employment challenges, opportunities and strategies for sustainable development. The BPBOS is a body for the Pacific Island nations to seek technical expertise and guidance on employment related matters. It will be the voice of the Pacific Island nations in: (1) Advocating or raising awareness on the impacts of Climate Change on employment and developing resilient societies. (2) Strengthening compliance and promoting decent work conditions in the maritime labour sector and assisting with trade agreements. (3) Strengthening the spirit of tripartism in the Pacific in line with ILO Convention 144. (4) Amplifying the voice of the ILO Pacific Member States within the International Labour Conference and the Asia-Pacific Group Forums. (5) Promoting decent work and advancing social justice. (6) Assisting Member States in meeting the obligations on ILO instruments. (7) Connecting with key stakeholders to assist with the unique challenges faced by the Pacific Island Member States relating to labour mobility and skills development, labour standards and compliance, labour law reform and progressive management of labour relations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to delve in the establishment of this Labour Platform. Sir, during the 2017 International Labour Conference, a tripartite meeting was called on Friday, 9 th June, 2017 for all Pacific Island Member States of the International Labour Conference (ILC) participants from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga and the Cook Islands attended this meeting. All expressed a common wish to have regular meetings at each ILC. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the 2019 Conference, a second tripartite meeting was called on Wednesday, 12 th June, 2019. The participants were Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Cook Islands. It was unanimously decided that a Terms of Reference (TOR) would be adopted by the larger</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1823 group of Pacific Island States during the Pacific Tripartite High Level Forum on Climate Change and Decent Work in the Pacific on 24 th to 27 th July, 2019 in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.</p><h4>At that Pacific Tripartite High Level Forum, the Labour Ministers requested a presentation</h4><p>on the Big Ocean States and further made significant changes to the draft Terms of Reference (TOR), amend the name of the platform to align and recognise our region under a single appellation as defined by our Pacific Leaders, and restructure the platform as the regional government platform, given that both, the social partners, that is, the workers and the employers, have existing corresponding platforms and to channel their voices accordingly. The two are Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO) and Pacific Islands Council of Trade Unions (PICTU). Mr. Speaker, on 25 th July, 2019, the Blue Pacific Big Ocean States (BPBOS) Labour Resolution was accepted and signed by the Ministers. This was to reaffirm our joint commitment in establishing the platform and finalising the content and adoption of the TOR at the 50 th Pacific Island Forum on 13 th to 16 th August in Tuvalu. Following the signing of the Labour Resolution, the Labour Ministers voted for a new Chair, Vice-Chairs and Secretariat for two years. The Fiji Labour Minister, my predecessor, was elected as the Chairperson while the two Vice- Chairpersons were from Kiribati and Samoa. The Labour Minister from Cook Islands was elected as the Secretariat. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2024 at the High Level Tripartite Dialogue on Decent Work and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent held on 23 rd to 26 th April here in Suva, the Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations was reconfirmed as Chair of the BPBOS and Cook Islands as the Secretariat. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regrettably, nothing had been done since 2019 for this course, for the reasons best known to the former Chair. In June 2024 at the 112 th Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, the Pacific Member States met at the PIFs office. In attendance were the tripartite representatives from Australia, Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa and Vanuatu. The Secretariat presented and distributed the TOR. All the members present at the meeting agreed to the proposal, thereafter as the Chair, I requested the Secretariat to meet to finalise the TOR and the way forward for the BPBOS Labour Relations platform. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the functions of the BPBOS Labour Platform are to: (1) Facilitate collaboration and building of synergies along ILO Pacific Islands Member States around the issues of social justice, decent work and good faith employment relations with coordinated efforts and mutual support. (2) Strengthen the visibility and capacity of participants to advocate and support a unified Pacific voice. (3) Provide and/or utilise relevant tools and information for advocacy, dialogue and awareness regarding Pacific issues. (4) Support the ILO Pacific Island Member States in attending employment related meetings and events. (5) Facilitate discussions on Pacific Labour issues and aim to increase resources towards the interest of the BPBOS from international organisations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the outcome of the ILC meeting in June 2024 and re-confirmation of Fiji’s chairmanship, swift action has been taken to revamp and advance the work of BPBOS Labour platform.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, a two-day meeting was held on 26 th and 27 th August, 2024 in Auckland to review the draft Terms of Reference for the BPBOS Labour Minister’s Platform. This meeting was held at the Fiji Trade Office. The Government as the Chairperson of BPBOS and the Secretariat represented by the Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Government of Cook Islands, and respective delegations from both countries. The two-day meeting was a success and it saw the completion of the review of the draft TOR for the BPBOS Labour Ministers Platform for circulation to the respective Labour Ministries at the ILO Pacific Islands member states for their perusal and feedback. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two-day meeting was fully funded by the ILO Office for the Pacific Island countries. The Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Labour Platform is the key to recognising and aligning the Pacific region under a single Pacific voice on employment issues and ILO agendas. This Labour Platform is crucial for the ILO Pacific Island member states on the emphasis of raising visibility and having a common voice in the Pacific at the international arena, where issues that affect the Pacific are to be heard, particularly decent work, employment issues, labour mobility and climate change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, the small islands states of the Pacific are always lost when we are lumped together with the Asia region because it is called Asia-Pacific. Asia has its own unique problems, which is more like conflicts and the rest of it, whereas, we, in the Pacific are small island states, and our problems are totally different from them hence the need for us to have a united voice as SIDS of the Pacific, so that we are able to amplify our voice at the international arena and make ourselves heard. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my sincere appreciation through the ILO Office of the Pacific Island countries for their continued support and commitment towards the ILO Pacific Island member states in advancing social justice, not forgetting the full support from the Fiji High Commission in Wellington and Fiji’s Trade Office in Auckland for hosting our two days meeting to complete the review of the TOR. MR. SPEAKER.- So that problem is not only existing in the parliamentary representation, IPU. Now I have heard it from you, Sir. You also have a problem with getting your group organised. As I have said a while ago, we had the same problem in IPU when it comes to recognising the Pacific as a regional body because Indonesia also wants to be part of the Pacific, because they share a common boundary in having their borders fronting or be part of the Pacific Ocean. In that way, some of the countries that come to our meetings go to that meeting because they are part of the Pacific, but the rest of us, we are completely lost and when it comes to staging or staking our plea, that the member countries of the 13 countries in the Pacific their problem be taken in by the international bodies, especially going into COP meetings, they refer us to the United Nations definition again. So we are simply at a loss, like you have just stated, Sir. Now we Chair SIDS, and you may have heard the honourable Leader of the Opposition asking the honourable Prime Minister of how best the situation could be addressed? That is a problem we are encountering, we do not know where we are. Are we part of the 13 or part of just five or six that comes up with the name “Pacific”, and the big countries (our neighbours) pick their sides where they go to because of the support they need. That is a very interesting point you brought up, honourable Minister. I hope the executive would be listening intently to the plea that you have sounded. I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate for their response. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for a very comprehensive Statement.</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1825 The Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Platform plays a critical role in identifying the Pacific Labour Region regarding labour and employment issues as well as the ILO agendas. This platform, as you all know, was established in 2019. We are proud that Fiji was the first country elected to Chair the BPBOS meeting and continues to hold the position under the leadership of the current honourable Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we hope that the honourable Minister will emphasise the importance of this labour platform in enhancing visibility and the ways of the Pacific nation and also within the Asia- Pacific Region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also need to strengthen the need for a unified voice in international discussions and issues affecting the Pacific, particularly concerning decent work, employment matters and climate change. We do hope that the Terms of Reference drafted will serve its purpose and start calling all Pacific Island States to raise a unified voice regarding labour and employment issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this labour platform is very crucial for the ILO Pacific Members States to raise visibility in the region. We anticipate that under the single umbrella, labour and employment issues will be top of the agenda. My plea to honourable Minister is for his Ministry to carry out an awareness programme regarding the Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Labour Platform so that our citizen and stakeholders are well informed. With this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister for being the Chairperson of BPBOS Labour Platform and we understand that Fiji will benefits a lot. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, while we acknowledge this effort and demonstration of leadership, we are compelled to seek some pertinent queries based on the facts at hand: (1) What tangible benefits have we derived from the BPBOS Labour Platform initiatives to date? (2) How would you assess the effects of all these efforts on better employment opportunities and workplace relations in Fiji? (3) What efforts are being made to make the voice of all member Pacific Island State</p><h4>represented and equally heard within the BPBOS?</h4><h4>(4) Given our present financial constraints, how sustainable is our present level of involvement</h4><p>and what are the plans to securing long-term funding for these initiatives? (5) How do these international commitments allow us to address both now and into future the immediate labour and employment challenges our people face around things like the creation of jobs and increasing wages? The BPBOS Platform offers a unique opportunity for us to come together and share good practices and promote policies that will improve employment opportunities, productivity and workplace relations throughout the Pacific. Together, we can make sure that our labour markets are resilient and inclusive, able to meet the changing needs of the global economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the honourable Minister’s leadership in this regard. It is only through such initiatives that we can collectively have a voice and be able to make meaningful progress for all Pacific Islanders. In saying that, however, we must not lose sight of the fact that we should not be complacent or deviate from ensuring those benefits that come with tangible and measurable outcomes for our people. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or their designate.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations for his Ministerial Statement this afternoon. I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to the big work that you have carried within the Ministry of Employment and also to your current term as the Chairperson for BPBOS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Blue Pacific Big Ocean States Labour Ministers Platform is an united commitment by all ILO Pacific Island Member States to advocate for the rights and welfare of workers across our Pacific Island nations. In the phase of global challenge, economic instability and employment, it is imperative that the Pacific present a cohesive and powerful voice to the ILO on employment related issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that our islands are not only rich in natural resources but also in human potential. Therefore, we must prioritise the creation of sustainable and decent work opportunities that empower our Pacific people, promote social inclusion and enhance economic resilience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by presenting a united front, we in the Pacific, can amplify our voices and ensure that unique perspectives of Blue Pacific Big Ocean States are heard and considered in global employment discussions with emphasis towards a future where every worker in our region enjoys the rights, protection and opportunities they deserve. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Blue Pacific Big Ocean States platform will reaffirm the ILO Pacific Island Member States commitment to advancing the principles of social justice, equality and sustainable development for our Pacific Islanders as one voice to shape a brighter future for the Pacific people. Thank you so much, Sir, for the opportunity. Antimicrobial Resistance HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not often that I get to deliver my Ministerial Statement but I thank you for the opportunity. I stand before you IN this august assembly today to address a matter of utmost importance - the relentless battle against Antimicrobial Resistance, commonly known as AMR, or as the media would like to call it superbugs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, AMR, as the World Health Organization (WHO) defines it, occurs when a bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. You may be aware of antibiotics which the doctor might have given you when you were sick, this is one type of antimicrobial medicine. It is the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials that is leading to AMR. In May 2015, during the 68th World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, the global community took a decisive step to adopting the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance. Since then, our collective efforts have gained momentum - a momentum that extends beyond Fiji's shores, encompassing our region and the entire world. lives today jeopardises Mr. Speaker, Sir, AMR is not merely a scientific concern, it is a threat to our very existence. It advancements of modern imperils the hard-won medicine. Antimicrobials, our medical cornerstone, underpin surgical procedures, infectious disease management, and fundamental patient care. Imagine a world where these vital tools lose their effectiveness due to resistance. A world where simple injuries could mean hospital admissions or a world where diseases such as Pneumonia can no longer be treated. We cannot afford such a scenario. and</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1827 Mr. Speaker, Sir, alarm bells rang in 2016 when a report chaired by Jim O'Neill called “Tackling Drug-Resistant Infections Globally: Final Report and Recommendations - The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance" predicted that by the year 2050, 10 million deaths will be attributed to AMR globally, surpassing the deaths from cancer and diabetes. The bugs are getting stronger, yet there are no new antibiotics to treat them. A report from the World Bank in 2017 titled “ Drug-Resistant Infections: A threat to Our Economic Future”, framed the economic cost of AMR and the impact that it would have on the world in the not-too-distant future, predicting that an estimated 3.8 percent of global GDP could be lost annually and push 28 million people into poverty. By 2019, the WHO had reported that 1.27 million deaths globally had been a direct result of AMR infections and contributed to the deaths of an additional 4.95 million people. The numbers are piling up as we face escalating challenges from micro-organisms, and Fiji is not immune. In recent years, we have faced outbreaks of formidable foes like the Acinetobacter baumannii and other carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs) within our major health facilities. these are what we call, and as I alluded to, as super bugs. These challenges remind us that the battle against this silent pandemic is far from over. Yet, we remain vigilant and resolute, steadfast in our commitment to protect our people. We have made significant strides in enhancing our capacities across the various aspects of healthcare, be it in surgical interventions, advanced dialysis, or critical care. However, let us remember that even the most sophisticated medical procedures can be rendered futile, if our patients fall prey to infections caused by resistant organisms. But this is not a cause for despair; it is a call to action. It shows us the importance of our ongoing efforts and the need to strengthen our resolve. Together, we can ensure that our advancements in healthcare are not undermined by the threat of antimicrobial resistance. We will continue to fight, innovate, and protect the health of every Fijian, ensuring that no life is lost to preventable and treatable infections. In Fiji’s mitigation strategy, we are not passive observers in this fight. Fiji has a robust mitigation strategy -the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP AMR). Launched in November 2022, the NAP AMR outlines key goals, milestones and collaborative partnerships. Our path forward lies in unity - knowing our adversary and acting collectively. The One Health approach to mitigating AMR mandates that we work collaboratively across, not only human health, but also with our animal health and partners in the environment space. This cross-sectoral approach recognises the importance of data sharing, cooperation and the multi- disciplinary approach, and the importance of the ecosystem we all share. One Health is not only a method but also a powerful tool in our arsenal against AMR. I invite my colleagues in animal health and environmental health to work together to stop this global threat. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the National Action Plan on AMR in hand, strong cross-sectoral collaboration and good governance mechanisms in place, there is hope yet for our people. Fiji’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Committee (NARC) has led the way in the Pacific and globally on the path of AMR mitigation strategies, and I commend the tireless efforts of the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, awareness plays a pivotal role in our shared fight. It is not confined to healthcare professionals alone, but for every citizen, whether child or parent, holds a stake. We must</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 educate, empower and engage. Our battle against AMR begins with understanding what we are fighting against. We all learnt a valuable lesson during COVID-19, the need for proper hygiene practices such as hand washing, the use of masks to prevent the spread of diseases and germs, and the need to protect ourselves from old and emerging diseases using vaccines. The message must go out there that together, we can prevent needless deaths and suffering. Since 2015, NARC has consistently organised World AMR Awareness Week from 18 th November to 24 th November. This is an important global occasion during which we recognise the threat of AMR and the importance of spreading awareness on how we can protect ourselves. Mr. Speaker, Sir, awareness is our weapon, and together, we shall prevail. Take heed when doctors and pharmacists tell you to finish your course of antibiotics and do not ask for antibiotics when your healthcare professional says you do not need it. Do not share antibiotics with friends and family. Every little bit helps, and we must listen to professional advice when it is given. Get vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases and eat a balanced and healthy diet to boost your immune system. Use antibiotics and antimicrobials rationally, whether you are a healthcare professional or a member of the public, we all have a role to play. Educate other members of your family and your friends on the importance of preventing AMR, remember, we are all in this together. In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us remember that our fight against AMR transcends borders. It is a shared responsibility, one that unites us in safeguarding our health, our future, and the generations to come. Our actions today will determine the future we live in tomorrow. Let us come together, from all sectors and walks of life, to fight this common enemy. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, for their response. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir and I want to thank the honourable Minister for his very interesting presentation. Not all of us are familiar with AMR, but I want share my experience when I was with Consumer Council of Fiji. It was 2015 that we conducted a survey with the help of the World Health Organization (WHO), just to understand the perception people had about AMR. We found that barely 27 percent of our population knew what this AMR was. So based on that information, with the help of WHO, awareness materials were prepared. So, I am quite familiar with the area of work that was done at that time, and I am glad that the honourable Minister is continuing with this work. It is not one time work, it is going to be lifelong, and we need to continuing working in this area to raise awareness. At the end of the day, it is the people. It is the choices they make. And if they make the right choice, it will only help in controlling AMR. As he highlighted, AMR is not a matter to be taken lightly, that is what we have heard, and it is a silent but a deadly threat which is looming over Fiji. He had shared the examples of superbugs found in the hospital. Obviously, it is a sign that we are very much into this issue, and we need to address that. I also agree with him that many household believe a doctor is no good, or dentist is not good when they visit them and they are not given antibiotics, and that thinking needs to be out of our</p><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1829 minds, and some messages needs to go in that area so that people are more attuned to the fact that you do not need antibiotics for every illness, like cold and flu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it not a just cultural norms that we have that we start blaming the doctor for not giving the antibiotics, but the spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria is driven by doctor’s prescribing antibiotics when they are not needed, they are also situations of that nature. Patients not completing the antibiotic causes, they will not complete as soon as they feel better, they will stop, and whatever they have saved they will pass it on to any other relative who is not well. They will say, “See, I took this medication, I feel good now, you should continue with it”, so that becomes a problem. Purchasing antibiotics over the counter is a huge problem. You do not need a doctor’s prescription. You can walk into a pharmacy and the pharmacist will give you antibiotics. That is how easily antibiotics are available. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this overuse of antibiotics in agriculture, as he mentioned, also fuels the spread of resistance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we lack adequate infection control measures in hospital, also in clinics, especially in rural areas where resources are limited. While the 2023-2024 Budget allocated around $12 million for diagnostic equipment, and as you told us during Committee of Supply, procurement failures have left these clinical tools were not bought around that time. This poses doctors to rely on a very broad spectrum of antibiotics and accelerating resistance. The overprescription of antibiotics without proper testing is transforming a once treatable infections into life threatening conditions, without proper diagnostic tools our medical professionals are left blindfolded in a battle against resistant bacteria. Mr. Speaker, Sir, antibiotics are misused in agricultural sector as well. Livestock are routinely dosed with antibiotics, not just to treat infections, but to prevent them, creating fertile ground for resistance bacteria that can spread to humans. Where are the Government’s efforts to enforce responsible farming practices? We should be encouraging best practices and disease control, such as proper housing of animals, better disinfection procedures and isolation of sick livestock. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one area that we seriously need to look at is the imported meat products that comes to our shore. We need to check for antibiotic resistant contamination. Our current surveillance systems are inadequate, riddled with data gaps, as the honourable Minister highlighted, and that is also contributing to the AMR crisis. So, strengthening the systems and imposing strict regulations around antibiotic use is not a choice, it is a necessity. If we do not fail to address AMR, there is going to be high mortality rates, longer hospital stays, increased treatment cost, economic losses as he highlighted because people are forced to take extended time off work due to prolonged illnesses and AMRs spreading across borders carried by international travellers and through global trade. So, all in all, Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Minister is trying to address the issues, and I think we all need to help him, including the public who are listening. They need to take care of their own health so that we can all collectively assist with this battle against AMR crisis. MR. SPEAKER.- It is quite interesting what you have stated, honourable Kumar, that is the Ministry of Agriculture on the meat. I remember the Assistant Minister for Agriculture telling me that they also provide antibiotics, I think to the bulumakau. So, his role is not much different from</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 the medical doctor. I like your response there, they need to be properly and thoroughly checked. Thank you, Madam. Before we go further, honourable Members, for housekeeping purposes and for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
