<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report - Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on Investment Fiji 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 Annual Reports. Investment Fiji was established in 1980 under the Economic Development Board Act 2017. It serves as Fiji’s Trade &amp; Investment Promotion Agency, with the primary goal of promoting, stimulating, and facilitating economic development in the country. Investment Fiji operates independently as the marketing arm of the Fiji Government, providing services to promote investment, develop industries and enterprises, and increase exports</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>1787 of goods and services. The agency plays a crucial role in creating employment opportunities, raising economic activities and bringing in foreign exchange, thereby, contributing to Fiji’s economic growth and prosperity. The Agency’s vision is to be a leading economic development agency by ensuring increased sustainable levels of investment and exports. Its mission is to create a positive economic impact in the lives of Fijians through premium investments, export, and employment opportunities. The Committee acknowledges positive developments in the Reports and identified areas that require improvements: (1) The Committee commends Investment Fiji for successfully developing a three-year Strategic Plan that aligns with its new role, as outlined in the new Investment Fiji Act 2022 (Act No. 25 of 2022), passed on 7 th April, 2022. (2) The Committee expressed its concern that the Annual Reports did not contain any performance matrix aligned with the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), making it difficult to thoroughly assess the performance of Investment Fiji. However, when the Committee raised this issue, Investment Fiji did provide the performance Matrix, which should have been included in the Reports from the outset. (3) The Committee also noted that Investment Fiji did not report on relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is a mandatory requirement for all Annual Reports presented to Parliament. (4) While the Committee recognises the progress made in specific activities such as number of trade missions and investments promotions conducted, however, the Report lacks detailed information on the level of interest these activities generated and how the interest is translated into actual investment. (5) The Committee observed that the Annual Reports stated the number of businesses without specifying names, making it difficult to assess how promotional activities are translated into actual investments or exports over the years. Upon inquiry, the Committee was informed that this information was withheld due to commercial sensitivity. (6) The Committee noted the paucity of tangible data and reliable statistics related to the operations of Investment Fiji, which hinders comprehensive evaluation. (7) The Committee expresses concern about their failure to report on the expected targets versus actual achievements, which is necessary to justify the budgetary allocations provided to Investment Fiji. (8) The Committee observed that recommendation 6 of the previous Committee Report on full disclosure of data and key information were not fully implemented. I wish to extend my gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Investment Fiji, Mr. Kamal Chetty, and his staff for their timely assistance in this inquiry on answering various questions raised by the Committee through face-to-face public hearing. At this juncture, I also would like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Member who were part of the team that produced this Report:</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1788</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 (1) Honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection – Deputy Chairperson; (2) Honourable P.

Review Report - OAG’s Special Investigation Conducted for Procurement of Goods and Services HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Committee’s Review Report on the Special Investigation conducted by the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) for the Procurement of Goods and Services during the 52 nd Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting. The Ministry of Civil Service was charged with leading Fiji’s planning and hosting responsibilities for the 52nd Asian Development Bank (ADB) Annual Meeting (the Event) which was held in Nadi from 1st May, 2019 to 5th May 2019. The Event gathered 3,582 attendees from 76 countries. Over 30 seminars, debates and other events brought together stakeholders to discuss key development issues in Asia and the Pacific. As the host country, the Fijian Government allocated $10 million to meet the costs for the Event. Upon completion of the meeting, the actual cost incurred was $10.9 million. The additional $0.9 million, which was the VAT component, was sourced from the Government’s Head 50 Budget. The (OAG) carried out a special investigation at the Ministry of Civil Service, focused on the hosting of the Event in May 2019. It came about subsequent to a preliminary audit carried out by the OAG that found that there could be a material misstatement of the financial statements of the Ministry of Civil Service for the 2019 financial year at the back of two Investigation Reports detailed below relating to the ADB event: (1) Special Audit: Voiding of Payments by the Internal Audit of MoF; and (2) Investigation Report by the Investigation Panel appointed by the Ministry of Civil Service. The OAG found that the occurrence of misstatement is high, hence the decision to proceed with the investigation. The Committee noted the seriousness of the issues found in the investigation, and after consultations with relevant stakeholders agreed for further investigation by the relevant law enforcement agencies on the findings that includes: (1) elements of fraud during payments;</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1790</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 (2) breach of relevant legislations, rules and regulations and policies in the procurement of goods and services; and limitations in the FMIS over the processing of payments. (3) The Committee, through its own investigation, found that with those findings: (1) There were delays by the Ministry of Civil Service and its then Minister to finalise this Report which was finally done on 2 nd December, 2020, and, apart from delays due to COVID-19, there were intentional delays to bring the Report to Parliament which was finally done on 27 th March, 2023, when the new Government came in. (2) There were delays as well by the Ministry of Civil Service to direct the Report to the appropriate authorities, including FICAC, for further investigations, which was finally done by the current Permanent Secretary and his Team after consultation around November 2023. Given the findings identified above, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the time that had lapsed and the move by those implicated, the Committee further recommends that the current Executive Management of the Ministry of Civil Service with the assistance of the Ministry of Finance tofollow up further with FICAC on the progress of those cases referred to them. While some or most of the recommendations have been implemented by the Ministry of Civil Service, the Ministry of Finance Internal Audit team or Office of the Auditor-General should carry out a follow up audit, especially on the breach of relevant legislations, rules and regulations and policies in the procurement of goods and services, as well as the limitation in the FMIS over the processing of payments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, both Ministries should ensure that the Standard Operating Procedure for hosting of events such as this magnitude that is being developed and put in place to be used in the future to include the recommendations by the Office of the Auditor-General and should cover every aspect of the event. Overall, I wish to thank the current Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Civil Service and his Team, as well as Ms. Susan Kiran, the former Permanent Secretary, for responding and providing clarifications on those audit issues that were highlighted. Also, I wish to thank the Ministry of Finance FMIS Team and the Internal Audit Team for responding positively to the Report as well to the queries raised by the Committee. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report namely: (1) Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister; (2) Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management; (3) Honourable A. A. Maharaj; (4) Honourable H. Chand; and (5) Honourable N. T. Tuinaceva. I also wish to thank the Alternate Members of the Standing Committee who took part in the consultations, namely, honourable Taito R. Matasawalevu who stood in as an Alternate Member, pursuant to Standing Order 115(5).</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>1791 Mr. Speaker, Sir with those few words, I now commend this Report to Parliament.

VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Consolidated Review Report on the Tavua Town Council 2016-2018 Annual Report. As mandated under Standing Order 109(2) (b), the Committee looks into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media. The Committee, through its mandatory role as stipulated under Standing Order 110, undertook a site visit to the Government grant projects administered by the Council, which was the Tavualevu Village Public Convenience Project and the Muti-Purpose Sports Court Change Room. The Council raised concerns faced by the Council which has been ongoing from the previous years. The Committee noted the various issues raised by the Council and provided possible recommendations as well. The Committee noted the importance of small Municipalities, like Tavua, in engaging with stakeholders to expedite various projects that are being planned to be undertaken by the Council for better service to the people. The Committee commends the Council for having a good rate collection, as compared to other Councils. I extend my gratitude and appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer and Management of Tavua Town Council for their timely contribution in this review process. Finally, I take this opportunity to thank the former Chairperson of the Committee, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, for her leadership and guidance; the former Committee Member, honourable P. K. Bala; the Alternate Members, honourable K. K. Lal and honourable P. Ravunawa, for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork; and the current Committee Members for the finalisation of this Committee Report. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament and request that all Members of this august Parliament take note of the Report. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. I. S. VANAWALU. - Mr. Speaker Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1792</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker Sir.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Review Report – Office of the Auditor-General Special Investigation on Housing Authority HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker Sir, this Public Accounts Committee Report is on Special Investigation on Housing Authority (HA) which was carried out by the Office of the Auditor- General in July 2020. The investigation centered on matters related to the illegal allocation of lots and abuse of the tender process which resulted in the controversial and inappropriate owning of lots by both individuals and employees of the Housing Authority. The case came to light after members of the public raised concerns in an uproar manner with the then Minister of Housing namely, the honourable Premila Kumar, who initiated a special investigation through the Board of Housing Authority with the Office of the Auditor-General who is empowered to do such audit under Section 6 (1)(d) of the Audit Act 1969. Honourable Kumar and Board Chairperson, Lorraine Seeto, must be commended for their effort in trying to improve the operations at Housing Authority. As expected from the Committee under the provisions of Standing Order 109, a thorough review on the Office of the Auditor-General’s investigation result document was carried out by the team and noted the following: (1) Corporate governance, transparency and accountability was extremely weak, bordering on being pathetic at Housing Authority. (2) Absence of Conflict-of-Interest Policy, lack of proper verification, poor record-keeping, abuse of power and corruption. (3) Not all tender documents were provided for the development of lots from 2010 to the date of this Report (2020). Critical records such as tender documents which were not provided during the investigation is a serious issue, especially when the Tender Policy was approved in 2005 which was used to process the tenders. The Authority should make every effort to locate these records for independent examination and verifications. (4) Cases of suspected fraud and collusion where staff and their relatives benefitted from the breakdown in the Authority’s processes should be referred to relevant authorities, since the audit of the Office of the Auditor-General did not focus on non-compliance with the law. These law enforcement agencies will also be able to access information on financial transactions which are held by other institutions and with that, I wish to advise that over 60 cases were referred to FICAC by the Housing Authority after the investigations. (5) The Office of the Auditor-General was unable to interview a former key staff member of the Authority and was also unable to receive responses for the interview questions provided to another key staff member, who were both accountable for overseeing the</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>1793 selection of applicants and for lot allocation. (6) Documentation relating to submissions for Ministerial approval regarding customers earning over $50,000 could not be provided by the Housing Authority. In addition, documentation and ministerial approval for lot allocation for customers earning over $50,000 could not also be made available by the Ministry of Housing and Community Development, for submissions made in 2015 and 2016. This restricted the Office of Auditor-General from determining if the appropriate processes were in place and were followed for approval of customers earning over $50,000 per annum. Another issue was the missing files. There were 12 customer files, including six files for Tacirua Subdivision and four files for Matavolivoli Subdivision which were not provided to the Office of the Auditor -General for review. Mr. Speaker Sir, the missing files meant that the officers or the Housing Authority staff were trying to hide from being investigated. The Committee acknowledges the remarkable effort and co-operation by the current Board and the current Executive Management of Housing Authority in providing clarifications on issues relating to the case raised with them. As, I have said before, they had resolved or implemented over 75 percent of the recommendations and are targeting to complete all the recommendations by the end of this year, 2024. The Committee’s ultimate objective is to see that the key outcome of the investigation is a system overhaul at Housing Authority that ensures full proof administrational and operational processes and practical governance policies are put in place to eliminate gaps that might bring to existence any violation that stimulates corrupt practices at Housing Authority. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker Sir, the Committee agrees that those implicated in the investigation should be taken to task as an act of employing strong deterrence and sending correct disciplinary signals to members of the public and employees of Housing Authority. As I have said before, currently there are over 60 cases with FICAC, with one being taken to court, and we would like to see that FICAC facilitates the remaining cases. Finally, Mr. Speaker Sir, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for their contribution and participation by putting this bipartisan Report together. The task was an enormous one. Apart from reviewing the Auditor’s Report, the Committee conducted separate interviews, studied relevant documents and general discussions, seeking to understand the case better. My sincere appreciation goes to the then Minister for Housing, honourable Premila Kumar, and the Housing Authority Board Chairperson, Miss. Lorraine Seeto, as well as the current Executives of Housing Authority, for being brave enough to be consulted by the Committee to share the experiences that they faced in relation to the production and finalisation of the Report. It is unfortunate that we could not get honourable Parveen Bala to be interviewed, who was one of the Ministers responsible for housing during the review period, in which he advised that he was not aware of the request, despite…. HON. P. K. BALA.- Just a matter of clarification, I was never asked to appear before the Committee, and let the Assistant Minister stop making a sweeping statement here. Thank you. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Restraining order!</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1794</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I have not finished with what I was about to say, but he advised that he was not aware of the request, despite the e-mail that was sent to him by our Secretariat and also, being advised through phone call by one of our Committee members….. HON. P. K. BALA.- He is lying! MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Appreciation is also extended to our Committee Members, the: (1) Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister; (2) Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management; (3) Honourable A. A. Maharaj; and (4) Honourable N. T. Tuinaceva. I also acknowledge our Alternative Members, namely honourable Hem Chand and honourable Taito R. Matasawalevu for standing in when required. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few words, I now commend this Public Accounts Committee Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we continue to the next item on the agenda for today, honourable Members, I would like to invite your views, especially when we have three Reports that we have just heard that are very serious in nature - files are missing and even Officials have moved on without being interviewed. Given the seriousness of the cases, we now have before us the oversight and scrutiny role that Parliament plays. All I am requesting, honourable Prime Minister, is, could we make use of that oversight and scrutiny role that Members of Parliament (MPs) now have, or will we continue with this? It is now in the Standing Orders. It takes a period of time before three years to four years, may be in the next general election, then it will come to some kind of finality. To avoid all that, I am seeking your views, as certainly I would be moving this in the next Business Committee meeting. I will be inviting your views, but I am just throwing this across since we now can jump straight into Standing Orders, get the oversight role or scrutiny, and then we continue with that. It is you, Parliamentarians, who are running this sitting. Instead of being referred to a Standing Committee and surely, the outcome we have just heard, it would certainly be the result that we would not like to</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1795 receive, especially, in our role as Government.</p></body>
