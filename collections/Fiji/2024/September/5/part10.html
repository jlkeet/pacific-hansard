<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and those watching proceedings on the television and the internet. As usual, thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. Hibiscus Festival Contestants Honourable Members, please, join me in extending a warm welcome to the 2024 Hibiscus Festival Contestants. (Acclamation) What a beautiful group of Contestants we have here, excluding honourable Ketal Lal. (Laughter) Honourable Members, really for a change, this needs to kind of spruce up this august Parliament by the presence of the Contestants here. This is just an effort, hopefully, you will agree, honourable Members, on our part as Parliamentarians to be part of this beautiful occasion in the capital of Fiji in honouring the Contestants, since they have also raised a few social issues among themselves in their interviews. Hopefully, they can come and mingle amongst you, honourable Members, and see how best you can raise your question on a one-to-one basis with the honourable Members of Parliament. I</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>5 th September, 2024 must say, on behalf of the honourable Members of Parliament, that we are also pleased to be part of this occasion since it has been quite a while after almost five years, then we have had this revival in the festivity again. Ladies, I hope that your experience here today will not only educate you, young ladies, but also raise your awareness on the Parliament institution, to aspire to, as well as to encourage more women representation and participation in Parliament. I am delighted to learn that in the course of your engagement with the media, business houses and the general public, you are amplifying the very issues that are pertinent in today’s society. For that, I congratulate you all and, at the same time, encourage you to continue to engage in opportunities involving participation at the decision-making level with the ultimate goal of becoming change makers of your communities. I also welcome Mr. Ravai, who is sitting amongst you, and who has been in the lead role right throughout this Festival. At the end of the final stretch only one will be crowned as Miss Hibiscus after this week’s sitting, dear ladies. And to the rest, remember this is not the end, you just need to keep pressing forward, because there are other roles that you will have to play to be part of the rebuilding of our society, especially in our communities all the time. With those few words, I warmly welcome you all to Parliament and I wish you our very best for the remainder of this week’s programme and for that you will be engaged in right towards the end of the hectic week. Back to Office Report For the information of the honourable Members, the Back to Office Report for the study visit that was undertaken at the Parliament of Victoria by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts Committee and the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is now available in the Library for your perusal and reference. Honourable Members, it is just the timing of the reports coming in. It is so quick to take the tour, but Reports need to be submitted on time as well, to ensure that the rest of the Members of Parliament are kept well abreast of what transpired during the tour. We will proceed to the next item, honourable Members, and there will be four Committee Reports tabled today.</p></body>
