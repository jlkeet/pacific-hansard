<body><h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED</h3><p>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE – FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the purpose of Section 145(1) of the Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move: That Parliament approves: (a) (b) the increase in Government guarantee limit for the Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited (FSC) borrowings of $95 million for the period 1st August, 2022 to 31st May, 2028 (Guarantee Period), by $105 million to $200 million; and that the FSC be exempted from paying the guarantee fee. HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not need to go into the background of FSC. It is a sugar milling company…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Tell us:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> …by an Act of Parliament in 1972 and the rest is history. Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, had been guaranteeing FSC’s domestic and offshore borrowings in the past. The most recent domestic guarantee cover was approved by Parliament on 23 rd May, 2024, whereby Parliament approved an additional Government guarantee to FSC of $95 million for the guarantee period 1 st August, 2022 to 31 st May, 2028. As of to-date, FSC has fully exhausted the approved Government guarantee limit. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government also guaranteed FSC’s offshore borrowings which was approved on 15 th September, 2017 whereby Parliament approved the extension of the Government guarantee period for the Exim Bank and Bank of India loan of US$50.4 million from 19 th September, 2019 to 31 st December, 2028. Both the Parliamentary approvals exempted FSC from paying the guarantee fee. For this guaranteed financing, the FSC has started with its repayment from August 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC as we all know has been operating at less than 50 percent of the 3.5 million tonnes of crop that the Ministry of Sugar has directed for inclusion in the Strategic Plan. Despite a concerted effort, the honourable Minister for Sugar has a number of times in this Parliament explained some of the difficulties within the FSC, the company’s operation and how it has been affected, factors attributed to structural and operational issues ranging from spate of natural disasters, volatility in the world sugar price, milling inefficiencies, resulting also from the failed mill upgrade in the past, deteriorating cane quality, et cetera that has affected not only production, but the performance of the FSC. Cane production for the last 14 years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the trend from 2010 to 2023, it has not picked up. It has fluctuated within a particular range of 1.6, 1.7 to 1.3. As of May 2023, FSC’s total operating cost is $60.6 million of which approximately 44 percent ($26.7 million) is disbursed as salaries and wages. There was an increase of about 8 percent when compared to $56 million as total expanding cost in the 2022 Financial Year, an increase mainly attributed to an increase in minimum wage rate, rise in the fuel price, post COVID-19 recovery and impact of significant loss of skilled employees.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1853 The FSC anticipates right-sizing the business and creating an environment for a skilled and competent workforce that will take the business forward. Sir, FSC also has continuously incurred net losses for the past 10 years. If you look at figures from 2014 from $6.9 million loss to $31.7 million in 2015, $53 million in 2016, $45 million in 2017, $80 million in 2019, $44 million in 2022 and $23 million in 2023. As of 31 st May, FSC incurred a net loss of $23 million compared to $44.3 million net loss for the 2022 Financial Year. The total liabilities for FSC has also been increasing. Its liabilities has exceeded its total asset base for the last 10 years, technically meaning it has been insolvent during this period and again, the figures are there. For the 2024 Financial Year which is 2023 cane season, FSC anticipates better results with cane production of 1.56 million tonnes and sugar make up of about 139,628 tonnes. Hence $238.8 million in total revenue is expected from sugar proceeds in molasses for the financial year; the highest in the last 14 years. The earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation for the 2024 Financial Year is likely to be positive $25 million. The world sugar price as we all know has moved into FSC’s favour, currently hovering around US$0.20 cents per pound compared to below US$0.40 cents per pound some two years back at the time of pricing; an increase of 43 percent. The price had increased to over US$0.25 cents per pound last year and is projected to stay close to US$0.20 cents per pound. The trend at the world market, looking at sugar production and the alternatives, they are being produced by many countries could see the price go further except for natural disaster, it is expected at the key performance parameters for the next five years as indicated will be achieved. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outstanding liabilities for outstanding borrowings guaranteed by Government stood at $293 million, of which, $216.7 million is covered by domestic Government guarantee and $76.3 million, which amounts US$32.7 million is covered by offshore Government guarantee. I do not want to get into the details of the respective outstanding balances that I have. The total Government guaranteed debt stood at $1 billion or 7.7 percent of GDP at the end of July 2024. With FSC accessing this additional guaranteed borrowing will increase the total Government guarantee exposure to $1.1 billion or 7.9 percent of GDP. Given FSC’s financial status, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is already exposed to $293 million of guaranteed debts both domestic and offshore, which brings FSC’s debt stock as at 31 st July, 2024 to $293 million. In the event of a default, which is normal for Government guarantee, the Government will be liable for the guaranteed borrowings of the FSC. Obviously, the Ministry of Finance is working with FSC, and I am sure the honourable Minister will talk about the FAO study that is being done, the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister is leading that. We want to ensure that we work with FSC and manage any fiscal risks, and if there are, that they are communicated to Government in a timely manner so that we are able to put in plans to mitigate any of those fiscal risks that may arise from the Government guarantee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion before the House. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and for that, I have a list with me. The batting order is as follows: (1) Honourable S. T. Koroilavesau; (2) Honourable Minister for Sugar Industry and Multi-Ethnic; (3) Honourable V. Pillay;</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>1854 Government Guarantee - FSC 5 th September, 2024 (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (5) Honourable K. Lal; and (6) Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to make a short contribution to the guarantee that has been mooted by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in support of FSC. The FSC and the provision of guarantee to its loans is not a new thing. It has been ongoing for some time since the withdrawal of the preferential prices during the friendship that we had with the European Union, and that has continued. There are issues that need to be dealt with. The honourable Minister for Finance has indicated about trying to relook at how we deal with FSC and try and assist. I think the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister has to be congratulated in the direction that he had taken in asking FAO to come and assist. I think overall, that will give a different perspective from an outside organisation looking into. We have been dealing with these outstanding issues for a very long time. There are issues that have been there since we took over from Colonial Sugar Refinery (CRS). I think without identifying those issues and dealing with them, it will be an exercise in futility. I just wanted to highlight some issues that I think we need to consider, and I think Parliament can look at and see how we improve going forward. It is apparently not a good advice for us to try and support the guarantee without discussing the issues that surround FSC and the production of sugar in Fiji. As highlighted by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Finance, FSC is basically insolvent and without the Government guarantees, the Corporation will be unable to continue to operate; cane production is slow, inconsistency of cane supply and decline of cane quality. One of the issues that has been raised when I was a member of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs was the non-existence of KPIs in all the agencies that support FSC. That needs to be looked at. There should be guidance of their performance and what they need to be able to achieve at the end of a financial year. That gives them a challenge to try and produce that at the end of the year. We know that there is a lot of territorial hold by the sugar stakeholders. There is a lot of differences and a lot of agencies are working in silos, they are not working together. I think that is the challenge for the honourable Minister for Sugar to try and coordinate, make sure that they work together. Most of these are agencies within the sugar industry. We had a suggestion that I think the honourable Speaker, Sir, is very well aware that we had suggested a Special Committee be appointed after FAO had done its review on the sugar industry as a whole. Again, I am pleading with you that we work with the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to select a special committee to look at all these intricacies that can improve sugar production and the sugar industry as a whole. The FSC needs to work closely, I certainly believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need just to grab the bull by the horns and actually direct it. The issues that I have suggested, there are a lot of landowners in Fiji that can be involved in the production of cane. They have the land. I urge the Government to put a system that can allow these landowners, especially in the Western and Northern Divisions. I had visited these areas, these land masses are available. It just needs Government assistance for the landowners and in actual fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the small farmers can become work they have</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1855 labourers and work this big cane estate because they have the experience, the landowners have the land and all they need to do is work together to lift the volume of cane that can be produced. Without talking about ethanol, which is a secondary product of sugar, there is an urgent need just to lift the amount of cane that is produced and supplied to the mills. Without that, it is very difficult to go through the system and make sure that FSC is commercially viable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before the House is basically asking us to provide the guarantee and increase it to $200 million. The Government is arguing that the funds are necessary to keep FSC afloat. There is no doubt, if we do not support the motion before the House, then it is difficult for FSC to continue. It is a catch- 22 scenario here - we do not do it, we are dead; we need to go ahead and do it, to keep FSC going. The situation is further compounded by the steady decline in the number of sugarcane farmers. Farmers have consistently dropped with the production year after year. Even if FSC were to make some operational improvements now, the question remains, where will the sugarcane come from to sustain its operations? We need to increase cane production. Additionally, the high cost associated with farming, milling, the timely renewal of land leases and persistent labour shortages in cane carting only adds to the challenges. We seriously need to look at bringing in labour from other countries like Bangladesh to keep this industry afloat. Without a comprehensive strategy, that include performance benchmark, modernisation efforts, the proposed increase in borrowing guarantees could very well lead to further financial disaster. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the survival of the sugar industry is crucial for our economy, simply throwing more money at FSC is not a solution. The government must demand accountability from FSC’s management, implant a clear plan operational improvements and address the broader issues affecting the sugar industry. Whilst these measures the increased borrowing guarantee risk becoming yet another failed attempt to rescue the company and is increasingly seen as beyond sale, we must act with prudence and responsibility, ensuring that our decisions today do not lead to greater problems for our nation tomorrow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament with reservations as I need the issues that has been highlighted in the House to be addressed. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning the honourable Prime Minister asked me with my other colleagues, “are we milking the wrong cow? Does the cow have sufficient milk?” I said, “the cow can produce milk but we have the wrong people milking it.” In the What happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you look at the decline of the sugar industry from 2006 when your party was there, what I am saying, the blame should not be put on us. What I am saying Mr. Speaker, Sir, the blame should not be put on us. HON. C. J. SINGH.- We are here trying to take up and improve, Mr. Speaker, Sir, HON. K. K. LAL.- You do nothing! HON. CJ. SINGH.- Now, there is another story to this. A farmer had a very scheming cow grazing next to the roadside and what happened… (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> ….this cow was grazing by the very dry grass.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>1856 Government Guarantee - FSC 5 th September, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Irrelevant! HON. C. J. SINGH.- So, what the farmer did, was the cow did not eat the grass as it was so dry. The farmer put green sunglasses on the because then the cow started seeing green grass. (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- That is what I am saying. You guys are putting on the wrong sunglasses at the wrong time. (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- So, what I am saying, the key area is to bring the sugar industry back, to bring FSC back on track. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Therefore, I rise to support this crucial motion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the foundation of this motion lies in our steadfast belief that the sugar… HON. K. K. LAL.- Huh! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Come on, go outside! (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the foundation of this motion lies in our steadfast belief that the sugar industry is moving steadily towards a stable and sustainable future. HON. RO. F. Q TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- This belief is grounded in a tangible progress we have seen within the industry in the recent months. Firstly, the Government has continued to bolster its support for the sugar industry. We have not only continued the programme initiated in 2023-2024 fiscal year, but we are also actively identifying areas where further funding is essential to ensure the industries long term viability. HON. K. K. LAL.- Wasting money! HON. C. J. SINGH.- This productive approach, reflects our commitment to securing the future of the sugar industry. Secondly, we have made significant strides in resolving the loans and issues surrounding land leases. By maintaining and spending the subsidies on premium payments, we are ensuring that the land remains accessible for cane farming. This initiative has been crucial in introducing the financial burdens on our farmers and securing their long term commitments to sugarcane cultivation. Moreover, our focus on attracting young farmers into the sugar industry and promoting minimisation continues to bear fruit. The integration of water agriculture technologies and engagement of our next generation of farmers are vital to building a resilient and future proof sugar industry. This efforts are not only ensuring continuity, but also driving innovation and efficiency within the sector.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1857 Additionally, we have reached a historical milestone with the 2023 crop, being the highest in payment recorded $101.08 per tonne. To the fifth payment, still from next month. This achievement is a that our dedication to ensuring the farmers receive a full compensation for their hard work, whereby securing their financial well-being and loyalty to the industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress we have made is undeniable and the path to recovery is clear. However, to ensure that this positive momentum is sustained, the approval of this motion is imperative in increasing the Government guarantees for FSC borrowing and exempting FSC from guarantee fees and our measures that will provide financial stability, confidence with that to support the Corporation as commitment.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Furthermore, this motion is not only a response to immediate financial needs of FSC but it is a strategic investment for the long term viability of the sugar industry. By providing FSC with the necessary backing, we are ensuring the cooperation can continue to support our farmers modernising operations and contributing to the broader economic recovery of our nation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q TUISAWAU.- Modernisation:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> In conclusion, I urge all Members of this esteemed Parliament to support this motion and reward a financial instrument. It is a corner stone of a broader strategy to rejuvenate and sustain the sugar industry which remains a vital part of our economy and the livelihood of Fijians. HON. RO. F. Q TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Now listen! Next week, I have been tasked to negotiate with Wilmar, you know what is Wilmar? (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Google it! (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Wilmar is the biggest sugar producer in Australia. Yes! Google it! They wanted to come into strategic partnership with FSC. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- And then? HON. C. J. SINGH.- And then? (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- What happened? You have been made a laughingstock, because we are trying to do something better that you could not do! HON. R. R. SHARMA.- You did nothing!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Listen, you are a small kid.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>1858 Government Guarantee - FSC 5 th September, 2024 HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, so we are trying our best and here, people sitting on the other side have done nothing for the last 17 years are trying to attack us. With these words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. RO F. Q TUISAWAU.- Stop wearing green sunglasses!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before Parliament.</p><p>As of 30 th April, 2024, FSC’s outstanding borrowings guaranteed by Government stood at $276.2 million of which $200.2 million is covered by domestic Government guarantee and $76 million is covered by offshore Government guarantee. We all understand that in the event of a default, the Government will be liable for the guarantee borrowings of FSC. Earlier on, it was indicated that gradually the Coalition Government will reduce the guarantee amount as FSC improves its services, however, this is nowhere to be seen as it has increased. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, had stated that the Government will work with FSC to monitor the restructuring efforts of the Board and Management of FSC to ensure any fiscal risks are properly communicated and mitigated to the Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do support this Government guarantee, as this will assist the farmers and FSC, so that production is increased and the sugar industry remains afloat. Having said that, the expectation is that all stakeholders must work in tandem, so that the overall objectives of the organisation in this case, FSC is achieved. However, this remains to be seen. For instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently we are experiencing a prolonged period of drought in the West which we have discussed earlier on, which translates into low tonnage of cane and overall production of the farmers have dropped close to 40 percent. So, they have lost about to 50 to 60 percent of their production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am being informed, and since I am a farmer also, no assessment has been carried out by the FSC or the Sugar Ministry. As I said earlier on, so far, on this drought and how it intends to assist or compensate the farmers who have lost considerable income as a direct result of this drought.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.:</span> So far there has not been any word by the honourable Minister for Sugar, on how he intends to mitigate this. Many farmers have contacted me, and I have personally visited the farmers and they have all echoed the same sentiments that there is a huge loss of production which means very less income for the families. Less income means that for the next season, farmers will find it harder to produce and harvest their cane as production cost will definitely increase.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Farmers will be forced to borrow or invest more to ease this. Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, another stakeholder in cane production and milling, are the hard working FSC workers who toil day in and day out to keep the mills running and also ensuring that harvested cane reach the mill on time. Recently, during the last Parliament session, the honourable Minister for Sugar belittled the FSC staff saying that instead of supporting farmers, FSC staff are consuming kava and chicken curry</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1859 at their expenses.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Shame:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. V. PILLAY.- He said and I quote, Mr. Speaker, Sir: “They would go around in their vans, have grog, have chicken curry and then will be back, unlike in the previous years, the farm advisors and the field officers used to go out to farmers to teach and support them” Mr. Speaker Sir, this is very sickening. Especially if this is coming from the Minister for Sugar, who is supposed to lead them and guide them. FSC staff are hardworking especially field officers, farm advisors, sector clerks, research personnel and so on. They have continued to support the farmers over the years and have even gone extra miles to assist the farmers, and here we have a Minister who is very good at putting the blame on these FSC staff for the misery and the failure of FSC or maybe to divert attention from his own failures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a common practice in the sugar cane farming community, that after successful harvesting season, farmers and FSC staff have a small gathering to celebrate the success of the harvesting season, which I find it very encouraging as this builds a better relationship between the farmers and FSC staff. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is the use of guaranteeing this loan if the persistent issue of the mill breakdown is not addressed. Year in and year out, we have the same recurring problem of mill breakdown, which delays harvesting. This, in turn creates frustration and loss of income amongst farmers, lorry drivers and cane cutters.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- All year:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.:</span> Also, farmers’ families suffer in silence as harvesting gangs will need additional food and supplies. So far, the Ministry has not been able to mitigate the frequent mill breakdowns and if this persists during rainy days, which is about to approach, will be an extra burden to the farmers as trucks will be bogged down in the field, and they will have no choice but to pay extra costs to hire tractors and heavy machines to pull the bogged truck load of cane. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the downward trend in cane production and poor performance of the current mills and change of mind from the honourable Minister for Sugar to install a second hand mill, instead of a brand new mill as promised earlier. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. V. PILLAY.- I bet my last dollar that the same problem will occur, which is mill frequent breakdowns. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we support this motion before Parliament on Government guarantee. I strongly urge the Parliament to appoint a joint Parliamentary Select Committee, to thoroughly look into the state of affairs of the Sugar Industry, its poor performance and how we can find ways and means to mitigate the challenges once and for all, so that there is improved mill performance and farmers are assisted and rewarded. This will bring back the</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>1860 Government Guarantee - FSC 5 th September, 2024 confidence in farmers and those that have withdrawn from sugar cane farming can see a glimmer of hope and return to farming. With these words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak very briefly on this very important motion. I thought I would just start by saying when the honourable Minister for Sugar, the started talking about the bulls or cows. I was wondering whether he was going to end up talking about the two tonne bulls that the honourable Minister for Agriculture tends to talk about now and again. But Mr. Speaker, this motion is very significant and I think it is good that it has come to the floor again this time around, because it talks to one of the issues that has been least talked about probably, but it is one of the things that this country and this Government will solve, and it will address one of the elephants in the room that has been talked about for some time. Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that the other side of Parliament now admits that there is a problem in sugar. I used to look at the reports that the Committees that were looking into Sugar. I used to look at their reports when I was outside Parliament, and there was never ever and admittance that there was a serious problem with sugar. HON. K. K. LAL.- Areh! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Now, never ever! I challenge them to show me one of the reports that says that there is a serious problem. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! (Laughter) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The second thing that I would like to say, you did nothing! Let us repeat it, you did nothing! The other thing I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I will leave some expressions in Tailevu, su raice ga su kila. When you see it, you know! (Chorus of interjections) HON. M S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sustained losses insolvency, production is down, yields are down, equipment is antiquated, obsolete, labour issues, no R&amp;B, not really any value-add in the sugar industry. These are the fundamental problems that that side of the house did nothing about. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.-But I am so thankful, that this is now a desire to fix the issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would just like to assure that side of Parliament and the people of Fiji listening in at this late hour. HON. J. USAMATE.- How about those two? (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Ultimately! Mr. Speaker, Sir, it comes down to political will. Which Government has the political will to face up to the challenge and do something about it.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1861 And to all of Fiji listening today. The People’s coalition has the will and we will fix this once and for all. Not for us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but for the future generation. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- And they failed to do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, on behalf of this side of Parliament, we wholeheartedly support the bill. We are putting in place, measures initiated by the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister. There is also a study into the FSC, that will actually ensure that we do come to this Parliament, the Government, the people of Fiji wants solutions, and there is only one Government that we can say in the last 20 years, is going to offer solutions to the people of Fiji. On that brief note, I support this motion, wholeheartedly. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to speak on an issue that is close to the heart of many Fijians. The state of our sugar industry. The honourable Minister for Sugar has recently provided reasons for the disappointing performance of this industry. He has pointed to the ongoing dry spell as a reason for the downgrade in our sugar production estimate from 1.8 million tonnes to now somewhere between 1.6 to 1.7 million tonnes. But, Mr. Speaker Sir, the FSC itself has forecasted even lower figures between 1.2 and 1.4 million tonnes. This raises a crucial question, why is there such a difference between what the Minister is saying and what the FSC is forecasting? Mr. Speaker Sir, while I understand that weather conditions like drought are beyond our control, the fact remains the Minister cannot use this as an excuse to explain away all the problems. The sugar industry has faced many challenges over the years. Challenges that go beyond just the weather, what we need from the industry, or the Minister is a clear plan, to deal with these challenges and not just excuses when things go wrong. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for farmers every year is a fight for survival. It is deeply concerning that instead of solutions, the Minister is resulted to blaming our hard working men and women in the sugar industry, referring them as muck-a-round workers… (Chorus of interjections) HON. K. K. LAL.- …this is not only disrespectful but also damaging to the morale of every person who are the backbone of this industry, and also recently has been criticising the field officers, blaming them of drinking kava and having chicken curry at the farmers house. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Minister is serious about improving the industry, he should be lifting up the workers and not tearing them down. The success of the sugar industry depends not just on structure, but on the morale and motivation. (Chorus of interjections) HON. K. K. LAL.- Listen, please! (Chorus of interjections) “When speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member.” He explained that the honourable Minister is undermining the workers. In fact, he is just pointing out some of the practices within FSC, which contributes to inefficiency, but he has turned that out that he is campaigning against the workers. So, stop imputing improper motives in terms of what he has raised.

TUISAWAU.- That is the problem:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Continue, honourable Ketan Lal. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when workers feel valued and supported, they are more likely to be productive and committed and serve FSC with their whole heart. Now, let us talk about the broader issue affecting the industry. The lack of effective fiscal policies which is putting more pressure on farmers who are already struggling with low yield and high cost. The Government promised to deliver a more efficient and less dependent sugar industry, but so far, we have seen very little action. Where are the measures to improve yearly outputs? What is being done to address the issues of the unsecured land leases? What about the decline in tonnage in production and labour issues faced by our farmers? These are the real challenges that need to be addressed not just the weather. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the elections, grand promises were made to fix the sugar industry. They talked about bringing new technologies (and still they are bringing in new technologies), improved milling system and supporting our farmers, but here we are with production estimates going down and down and down and no real solutions in sight. May I ask, who is accountable for this?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- You:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FSC has said that over 200,000 Fijians are associated and dependent on the sugar industry. The lack of fiscal planning is evident, and the fact that it was only four months ago in May, this House approved the guarantee for FSC, that is why we are calling for an investigation into the operations of FSC. This raises serious question abouts all the big talk in the industry on bringing about changes, and big plans in reviving the Penang Mill with no fiscal planning aside. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not that easy to run the sugar industry, because when we were in government, we had to go through COVID-19 and we were hit by major cyclones, but despite that, we were able to achieve 1.8 million-plus tonnes of sugarcane. However, all this while, travelling from one country to another at taxpayers’ expenses, and this includes the expenses of the poor cane farmers, what is the investment on return on every trip the honourable Minister is making? Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just an economic issue, it is a matter of survival for many of our people. While I support the Government’s loan guarantee from the FSC until 2028, we need to see real fiscal discipline and action from this Government. We cannot keep on bailing out FSC without seeing any improvement. The morale of our farmers and workers is just as important as running our mills. The two go hand in hand. We must remember that the sugar industry is not just about numbers and forecast, it is about our Fijian people. It is about the farmers waking up early in the morning to tend to their crops; the workers who labour in the mills and their families who depend on this industry for their livelihoods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to see real progress. We need to build an industry where these people feel respected, valued and motivated to give their best. The sugar industry is too important to be left in this state of uncertainty. The livelihoods of thousands of Fijians depend on it, and it is time that the honourable Minister stops blaming the weather and start taking responsibility. It has been almost two years now, and the fact the honourable Minister still has no plans, is shocking. Let us see real action and not just empty promises, honourable Minister.</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1863 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time to stop pointing fingers and start delivering results that will benefit our farmers, our workers and our country as a whole. Having said that, I support the motion on the floor. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion moved by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance on the increase in Government guarantee to Fiji Sugar Corporation from $105 million to $200 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I wish to mention that Ratu Kadavulevu School will be celebrating its 100 years anniversary for one week from next Monday. The school was established in 1924 by a high chief of Bau, Ratu Penaia Kadavulevu to educate and nurture young Fijian boys to be well rounded students. It focusses on developing excellence in character, academia and sports activities. We have eight former students in this House led by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and seven other Members. On behalf of the former students of the school and Members of this august House, we wish to congratulate Ratu Kadavulevu School for its excellent achievement in the first 100 years of establishment.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBERS.- Vinaka:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I think quite a lot has been said about this subject of sugar but I just wish to raise an issue with regards to who are the people who are directly benefitting from the industry. There has been a lot of numbers that has been raised; honourable Ketan Lal raised $200,000. However, this $200,000 was based on the 20,000 farmers in the 1990s when it was at its a peak where we were producing over 4 million tonnes. If you calculate 20,000 multiply the average farm members of five, you might get that number. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of farmers to-date has drastically reduced to around 11,000 who are quite active. On average families, we might have around 55,000 who are directly affected and include other FSC workers with around another 1,000, the numbers have drastically reduced. I think it is not fair for us to be saying that we are supporting the 200,000. I think it has been exaggerated to some extent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to raise that the previous government has continued in its attempt to revive the industry, with an average allocation of the budget of perhaps around $50 million to $60 million annually. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, production has continued to decline and most of these are just the subsidies that has been going on but has not addressed the fundamental problems now facing the industry. If you look at the industry, of the 11,000 farmers, only 80 percent of the farmers are producing 20 percent of the throughput going to the mill, with only 20 percent producing 80 percent of the throughput. So, these are some issues that we need to address and look at how we are going to facilitate 80 percent of the farmers. They had to move out if they were not efficient. So, the government programmes had to be targeted at ensuring that there were alternative livelihoods to support these farmers when moving out. One of the things that I wish to mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are depriving other agricultural industries of the assistance that they are supposed to be receiving when supporting one industry, which is not economical and unsustainable. As you go around there are so much lucrative opportunities in the agriculture sector and farmers are being deprived the support that they are supposed to be receiving. You name it, coconut which is out there in the outer islands, tropical fruits, livestock there are so much opportunities for the Government to support but instead we have been supporting only one industry. When you see the contribution of agriculture to GDP, it has continued to decline. In the last 30 years it was 25 percent and now we are just reaching 80 percent.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>1864 Government Guarantee - FSC 5 th September, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as was mentioned by honourable Koroilavesau when we undertook the visits in Fiji through the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, we noticed the drastic reduction in the area that was previously cultivated for cane. There are some estimates from the 50,000 hectares that has been allocated to cane, only 24,000 has been effectively utilised. Honourable Koroilavesau and I witnessed this, when we went to Lomawai, a big flat land not being utilised. I totally support what honourable Koroilavesau has just mooted; the empowering of the landowners to be done again through a more coherent targeted initiative to ensure the landowners, with the assistance of government to be strengthened and empowered so that we can try to train them in cane production. Previously, during the CSR days there has to be a training facility in Drasa; training people to go back into cane farming. I think that is what I wish to raise this afternoon. There are a lot of issues already mentioned, and of course, we are looking forward to the FAO study which will be produced in October that will map out the way forward for the industry. I totally agree with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives that if your study comes up with some recommendations that you are not comfortable with, we have no choice but to undertake drastic actions to ensure that we have an industry, without being continuously subsidised will benefit all the people of this country instead of a chosen few. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support the motion before the House. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Deputy Prime and honourable Minister for Finance to speak in reply. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I thank all the honourable Members for their contribution and support for the motion, though I was not sure whether honourable Lal was supporting or opposing with some reservations. MR. SPEAKER.- He supported. (Laughter) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Honourable Koroilavesau touched a very important point. He talked about the preferential prices and how those prices came to an end. As part of the strategy of the European Unit (EU) to support that phase-out or transition from guaranteed price under those conventions to more world market price, the EU provided substantial funding to all the sugar producing ex-colonies including Fiji. In 2006, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Qarase Government, $350 million was provided by the European Union for three aspects of the sugar industry. There were three components in that $350 million: (1) upgrade of the mills (milling part);s (2) farm level part to support more efficient and productive farms; and (3) alternative livelihood because the restructuring would have allowed smaller inefficient farms to be transitioned out into more alternative crops, et cetera. Obviously, we lost that $350 million because of the events in 2006 and subsequently, if you look at the statistics and I do not want to go back as to what happened, but I was just listening to honourable Lal and honourable Viam Pillay, perhaps, they need to reflect on the history of what happened in last 13 or 14 years and since 2006. We were producing about 3.2 million tonnes of cane. Mr. Speaker, as you would know, since then the decline was continuous, partly because we remained inefficient, we did not benefit from that very substantial amount of money that was lost by Fiji and</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>5 th September, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 1865 we could never put that amount of money back into the industry that was provided by European Union. The issue with respect to, I know honourable Lal raised this issue about workers. It is under this Government, 2,000 workers of FSC received a 5.3 percent pay rise. So, this question of Government not looking after the workers’ interest, I think what honourable Singh was implying was that some of the inefficiencies at the mill level and the attitude of those in the industry. We used to have a great partnership right in Parliament under the Prime Ministers before 2006; under the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara’s time, under Prime Minister Rabuka’s time and Prime Minister Qarase’s time. We used to have a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Sugar and there was a lot of bi-partisan approach in terms of taking the industry forward. MR. SPEAKER.- I was the Chair. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Sir, you were one time Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and a lot of good things happened as a result of that. So, the suggestion by honourable Viam Pillay, he forgot to say that it was the FijiFirst Government which refused, and I remember moving a motion in Opposition calling for an establishment of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to address the problems in the sugar industry. I know that the honourable Prime Ministry likes that idea and that is something that the Government will consider. What honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives said, I think for the first time, we as a Government are determined to look at the industry. I think the honourable Minister for Sugar, having inherited such a difficult proposition, and I do not envy his job trying to get to the workers, trying to get to the farmers, trying to address the concerns of what is happening in the mills with aging infrastructure, aging machines and spare parts. These are real problems within the milling sector then of course, we have the same issue at the farm level; issues of labour, farm practices. These things have not changed and that is why I kept referring to that period that we lost a very critical moment in Fiji’s sugar industry history which was not taken on. I think as the honourable Assistant Minister said quite rightly, once we get the FAO Report, we are talking to the consultant, I think he has consulted a number of people, a number of us in Government, once that report comes out, I think, as a Government, we need to as honourable Koroilavesau said “take the bull by the horns”. I think we are already moving towards a direction and looking at the sugar industry in a very critical manner. So, once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Members for their support and thank you for the opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. I thank you for all your contributions in Parliament. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 6.51 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83</p></body>
