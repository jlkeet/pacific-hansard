Mr. Speaker Sir, I write in response to the important inquiries concerning the: (a) number of farmers that were assisted in the dalo and yaqona farming programmes in the 2023-2024 financial year; allocation breakdown in terms of Provinces; and expected return on investment from each farmer. (b) (c) Mr. Speaker Sir, in 2023, the Total Value of National Domestic Export was estimated to be FJ$1.3 billion in which: • • • 69.4 percent (FJ$934.2 million) was the total share of All Agriculture Commodities to the National Trade including Forest products, sugar products and fisheries products. This was an increase of 0.7 percent, as compared to 2022 (FJ$927.5 million). 25.5 percent (FJ$343.4 million) was the total share for Only Crop &amp; Livestock Commodities (fresh, chilled and value-added products). This was an increase of 9.2 percent, as compared to 2022 (FJ$314.5 million). 10.7 percent (FJ$144.7 million) was the total share for ONLY fresh and chilled crop and livestock produce. This was an increase of 17.3 percent, as compared to 2022 (FJ$123.3 million). In 2023, Yaqona and Dalo continue to be in the top five agricultural export commodities: • Dalo: In 2023, the export value was approximately FJ$39.8 million (0.03 percent share to the National Trade) in which 5,608.2 metric tonnes of Dalo produce were exported. This was an increase of 19.2 percent, compared to the previous year. • Yaqona /Kava: In 2023, the export value was approximately FJ$38.1 million (0.02 percent share to the National Trade) in which 501 metric tonnes of Kava produce were exported - this was an increase of 0.6 percent, compared to the previous year.</p><p>ii. The main export destinations for the two agricultural commodities, that is, Yaqona /Kava and Dalo include Australia, New Zealand, the USA, and other Pacific Island Countries. (a) Ya q ona/Kava Farming Program me In the 2023-2024 financial year, under the Yaqona Farming Programme, 257 individual farmers and five farming clusters groups were assisted through the provision of planting materials, pounding machines, construction of farmhouses, drying facilities and nurseries. Details of farmers assisted under the Yaqona Farming Programme are attached in Annex 1. Dalo Farming Programme In the 2023-2024 financial year, under the Dalo Farming Programme, 674 individual farmers and three farmer cluster groups were assisted through the provision of planting materials, agro-inputs, infrastructure development, land clearing, land preparation, technical advisory services and training. Details of farmers assisted and supported under the Dalo Farming Programme are attached in Annex 2. (b) Yaqona/Kava Farming Programme In the 2023-2024 financial year, $500,000 was allocated for the Yaqona Farming Programme. To ensure the further development of Fiji's Kava industry, the Programme focused on the following strategic areas: • Provided direct assistance to proficient yaqona cultivators by supplying clean planting materials to guarantee the success of large scale plantations. • Strengthened the current yaqona growing areas to boost production through nursery support. • Provided infrastructural support to ensure proper drying and storage of yaqona to meet export standards. Improved the quality of kava production through timely technical support services. • Activities funded under the Yaqona/Kava Farming Programme include the following: • Procurement of Planting Material - $190,000; • Pounding Machines - $40,000; • Drying Facilities - $38,000; • Farm-House - $80,000; • Nursery Establishment - $32,000; and • Monitoring and Support - $120,000. Dalo Farming Programme In the 2023-2024 financial year, $450,000 was allocated for the Dalo Farming Programme. To ensure that Fiji's dalo industry remains successful, the project focused on the following strategic areas: • • To increase dalo production from 54,751 (baseline - year 2021) tonnes to 60000 tonnes by 2024; and Dalo farming aims to achieve SDP 4, which focuses on the establishment and</p><p>iii. enhancement of commercial agriculture. Activities funded under the Dalo Farming Programme included the procurement of planting materials, agro-input, infrastructure development, land clearing, land preparation, technical advisory services, and implementation and support services. The Dalo Farming Programme is a crucial program implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways where it supported the roles of men and women in the dalo farming. Through the Programme, it could was observed that dalo farming is a collective household member activity where men, women, girls and boys are all involved in the farming process. The process is that women and girls are involved in dalo suckers’ sorting, selection, and making bundles during harvesting. The dalo land preparation, land cultivation, harvesting, and transporting are done by men and boys. The dalo planting and weeding are often carried out collectively, that is, men, women, girls, and boys all participate. A detailed breakdown per geographical division and assistance provided are attached in Annexes 1 and 2. (c) Yaqona/Kava Farming Programme With the support provided to farmers under the Yaqona/Kava Farming Programme, the following are estimated to be the projected benefits and return of investment: • • • Economic benefits include an increase in income received by farmers. Environment benefits through best farming practices adopted via intercropping and integrated farming systems with agro forestry systems has been practiced. Social benefits for farmers include infrastructural development - house improvements (renovations), footpath, improvements on water systems, purchase of vehicle, et cetera. Furthermore, the projected Return of Investment for this Programme indicates that for every dollar invested by the Government, there is an anticipated return of $25, thereby, demonstrating the Programme’s viability. Section 1.01 Dalo Farming Programme The investment allocated to farmers through the Dalo Farming Programme was anticipated to yield the following projected benefits or returns on investment: • Increase in the sales of dalo suckers for suppliers. For instance, 20 dalo planting material (suckers) suppliers will benefit from the sale of 250,000 dalo suckers. • Farmers can meet their social obligations - income, education and health, social and religious obligations. • Economic benefits for farmers include infrastructural development, especially on house improvements (renovations), footpaths, improvements in water systems, et cetera. Increase in export revenue where potential and available arable land will be developed for agriculture purposes - dalo farming. • • Environmental benefits through best farming practices adopted via intercropping and integrated farming systems with agro-forestry trees will be practised. • The project encouraged full conservation practices through Sustainable Land</p><p>iv. Management to reduce soil erosion and land degradation. The Return of Investment for this Programme forecasted that for every dollar the Government spends on this Programme, a return of $5 only to prove the viability of the Programme.</p></body>
