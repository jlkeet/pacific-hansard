<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Meat Industry Board 2018-2022 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>1756</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 Affairs hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Meat Industry Board 2018-2022 Annual Reports. The Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB) was established under the Fiji Meat Industry Act 237 of 1970. In 1976, the Suva Abattoir was established at 9 Miles, Nasinu, to provide slaughtering services in the Central Division. In the same year, a rendering plant was established next to the Abattoir to make high-quality leather. The company ventured out into animal feed by using the by- products from the Abattoir and fish processing facilities. The Suva property sits on 35.4 hectares of State land. The land has a 75-year Crown lease granted on 1 st July, 1976. The Vuda abattoir was established later at Vuda Point in 1983. It caters for the slaughter services in the Western Division. The Vuda property sits on 6.35 hectares of Native land. The land tenure is a 75-year Native lease granted on 1 st January, 1982. The core function of FMIB is to provide slaughtering services for butchers in Fiji. It has now ventured into a magiti concept where it also provides services for social obligations to meet our diverse markets. The FMIB is committed to providing slaughtering and processing services in facilities that are of international standard to meet safety, hygiene and quality standards. The FMIB has also ventured into implementing a food safety programme that complies with the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles and conforms to guidance issued by the Food Safety Act 2003, Food Safety Regulations 2009 and Meat Industry Act 1993. Pertinent issues identified by the Committee are as follows: (1) The FMIB incurred losses from 2018 to 2021, except in 2022, when it recorded a small profit of $108,134. This profit is largely attributed to a reduction in the number of employees. The ongoing losses have been driven by low throughput and the rising cost of operations. (2) From 2018-2022, FMIB received an average of 8,542 cattle; 14,533 pigs; 347 sheep; and 1,548 goats, for slaughter annually. To break even, FMIB needs approximately 20,000 cattle per year and 30,000 pigs per year. Currently, the Abattoir is not working at full capacity due to a decline in livestock numbers, resulting in low number of livestock going through the Abattoir. (3) The livestock numbers have steadily declined over the years due to prevalence of diseases such as Tuberculosis and Brucellosis, and the decline in sugarcane farmers engaging in rearing livestock which has significantly impacted livestock population. Additionally, poor pasture management and the rising cost of feed, have further contributed to the reduction in livestock numbers and the lack of interest by farmers. This decline poses a broader threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry in Fiji. (4) There are several challenges affecting FMIB, such as: (a) Needed investment to modernise facilities to meet new requirements for food handling, hygiene and security; (b) A review of the Meat Industry Act 1969 is urgently needed to address the current issues facing the meat industry;</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>1757 (c) Bush slaughter needs to be curbed for health and commercial purposes; (d) Meat grading needs to be introduced to protect consumers and farmers; (e) Farmers are short changed where only carcass is weighed and paid and not the offal; (f) Sharp increase in production cost; and (g) Low livestock numbers. (5) Poor coordination and collaboration between FMIB and the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is one of the problems that we have also identified. (6) The incentives, particularly the grant of around $717,000(fencing kit support for beef, goat and sheep, beef stockyard, goat and sheep shed, goat rearing, pig farrowing crates and piggery pan development) provided to livestock farmers have not led to any noticeable increase in livestock production. (7) Committee also noted that the FMIB and Yaqara Pastoral Company Pte Limited (YPCL) are not collaborating effectively to boost livestock production and move Fiji towards self-sufficiency. (8) In addition, FMIB still relies on external service providers to develop 5-year Strategic Plan and to prepare accounts at a cost. (8) In addition, FMIB still relies on external service providers to develop 5-year Strategic Plan and to prepare accounts at a cost. (9) FMIB has $31.9 million worth of investment property, primarily consisting of land, which is yielding no returns for the company. (10) FMIB’s plans to improve profitability by setting up a restaurant, venturing into sausage production, and exporting pork and beef to the regional market raises concern. These initiatives are not the core business of FMIB, particularly when livestock production is declining. (11) The annual reports did not contain any performance matrix aligned with the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), making it difficult to assess the performance of the FMIB. (12) The Committee also noted that FMIB did not report on relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is a mandatory requirement of all Annual Reports presented to Parliament. (13) The Committee also noted that although FMIB depends on animals as its primary input, the Company has not considered the option of utilising land for animal rearing or producing young calves, kids, lamb and piglets for distribution to interested farmers. I wish to extend my gratitude to the Chairperson of the FMIB Board, Dr. Kenneth Cokanasiga, and his staff, for their timely assistance in this inquiry. At this juncture, I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced this report, the: (1) Honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection – Deputy Chairperson;</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1758</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committee</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 (2) Honourable P.

S. VANAWALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Review of the Nadi Town Council 2016 Annual Report. As mandated under Standing Order 109 (2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media. The Nadi Town Council, being one of the oldest municipalities and known for actively contributing to the tourism sector in Fiji, the potential for investment has been optimistic and these foreign investments have led to an increase in development and population as well. The Nadi Town Council is the, therefore, embarking on a proposal for an extension of its town boundaries to cater for the increasing population and to continue with the necessary processes of declaring Nadi as a city. The year 2016 was a great year that affected most people in Fiji, and Nadi was no exception, with widespread devastation and loss of life, on the infrastructure and the environment. The Committee noted concerns raised by the Council in its key findings, particularly the constant flooding of Nadi Town. I extend my gratitude and appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer and Management of Nadi Town Council for their contribution in this review process. Finally, I take this opportunity to thank the former Chairperson of the Committee, the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, for her leadership and guidance; the former Committee Members, honourable Parveen Bala, and Alternate Members, honourable Ketan Lal and</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1759 hoourable Penioni Ravunawa, for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork; and the current Committee Members for the finalisation of this Committee Report.
