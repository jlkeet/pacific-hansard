<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and those watching proceedings on the television and internet. I particularly extend a warm welcome to those of you in the public gallery and our friends in the media. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Official Event Invitation Honourable Members, with due consideration to the official event later this evening, you will receive your invitations too, I assure you that right now. But if you have not received it yet, I will make sure that you receive those invitations. Amended Order Paper Given that items on yesterday’s Order Paper - five Oral Questions, a Motion and Written Questions, have been moved to today’s Order Paper, I will allow only one supplementary question from the Opposition side during question time, and this is only for today. I thank you, honourable Members, for your understanding. We will proceed to the next item.</p></body>
