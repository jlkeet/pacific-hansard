<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Hon. A. M. Radrodro) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reply to Question No. 183/2024 is as follows: (a) Background 2022 Fiji became a member of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) in June 2022. As part of its membership requirements, Fiji needed to form a Local Education Group which includes Education Sector stakeholders. As such, the Education Partner Group (EPG) was established in 2022, co chaired by the MOE (PSE) and the Australian High Commission (First Secretary AHC). With GPE membership, Fiji received a System Capacity Grant (SCG) allocation of USD1.5 million with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as Grant Agent, and DFAT is the Coordinating Agent. An Enabling Factors Analysis (EFA) was produced by a core technical team, with active engagement across the Ministry, and, at key points, contributions from education stakeholders and partners to identify key priority areas for the Ministry that needs support. The Enabling Factor Analysis (EFA) identified the following priorities: • • • The Education Sector Analysis (ESA) which is an in-depth and holistic analysis of our education system. The objective is to ascertain and understand how the education system is currently working and how it can be improved. The ESA provides the evidence base for decision-making in preparing the Education Sector Plan. The drafting and development of the ten-year Education Sector Plan (ESP 2024- 2034), as well as the extensive planning and consultation process for the Fiji National Education Summit (FNES). The FNES was convened in September 2023. An MOE ESP consultant was engaged to start work on the MOE ESP in 2022, followed by a series of workshop conducted for MOE officials and its stakeholders. Article II. Programme of Work and Milestones 2023 The work on the Education Sector Plan came to a stop in 2022, following the change in MOE administration. The work on the Education Sector Analysis (ESA) began again in 2023. ESA progress in 2023, as follows: • An ESA consultant was engaged to undertake the development of the ESA report.</p><p>vii. The work of the consultant involved field work, consultations, research with MOE stakeholders and partners: Donor partners, faith-based organizations, teachers, Heads of Schools, students, community members, Teacher Unions, Teacher Training Institutions (TTIs), tertiary students. The ESA will provide an in-depth analysis of the current status of the Education S ector. ESA Report is in its draft form. • • Article III. Compact Document The compact document is the roadmap to transformation. It articulates how a GPE partner country intends to work with others around a priority reform with the potential to catalyse systemwide change. The partner country leads and develops its compact with the support of an inclusive local education group. The compact document is shared with the GPE Board, which uses it as a basis for decision-making for GPE funding. To develop the partnership Compact, the Ministry of Education, Fiji planning unit convened a broad technical group involving all its departments, ministerial advisors, partners, and pre-summit consultation workshops in Fiji's four geographical Divisions. The compact document aims to strengthen system-wide collaboration to enhance teaching quality, thereby, improve learning outcomes. The compact document has since been submitted to the GPE for which approval has been granted. The release of the compact funding is dependent on the receipt of the Programme Development document. A consultant has been engaged to develop the Programme Development document from the Compact Priority Areas as identified by MOE. This document is currently being drafted by the consultant and submission is due in the last quarter of 2024. • FIJI NATIONAL EDUCATION SUMMIT (FNES) 2023 Nationwide consultation conducted from April - September 2023, culminating with the FNES at Denarau, Nadi. The outcome of the Summit was the confirmation of the 2023 Denarau Declaration, a 10 year Policy Framework of the Ministry. The following documents will be used to inform and guide the MOE Education Sector Plan (ESP) for the next 10 years: • • • 2023 Denarau Declaration; Education Sector Analysis Report; and Compact.
