<body><h3>ANNEXURE IV</h3><h4>ANNEXURE IV</h4><p>MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS, METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES &amp; TRANSPORT (Hon. Ro F. Q. Tuisawau) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reply to Question No. 194/2024 is as follows: Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank Hon Naisa Tuinaceva for raising these important questions on the update of the crucial issues of road safety and traffic management in Fiji for the period from January to July 2024. The answers are as follows: (a) Road Accidents and Fatalities From January to July 2024, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has, unfortunately, experienced a concerning number of road accidents. There has been a total of 30 reported road accidents during this period. Regrettably, these incidents have resulted in 31 fatalities. There were two fatalities on 12th February, 2024. As for same period last year, Fiji recorded 57 fatalities. This statistic is 54 percent less, compared to the same period last year. These statistics underscore the need for enhanced road safety measures and continued public awareness campaigns. The Ministry of Transport, in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, is actively working on strategies to address this issue, including improved road infrastructure, increased patrols, and educational programmes on road safety.

(b) Traffic Infringement Notices The Traffic Infringement Notices (TINs) issued by the LTA and Police totals up to 182,615 TINs from January to July 2024. This includes TINS issued by LTA Enforcement, LTA Red light speed camera infringements and Police TINs. A total of 2,868 TINs have been issued for E-Ticketing offence. A total of 376 overloading TINs have been issued. A total 179,371 TINs have been issued for General Offences (speeding, Redlight speed camera, Police TINs, driver behaviour). These figures reflect the ongoing enforcement of traffic laws and regulations aimed at curbing unsafe driving practices. It is imperative that we continue to strengthen our enforcement mechanisms and ensure that all drivers adhere to the traffic rules to reduce accidents, fatalities and promote road safety.
