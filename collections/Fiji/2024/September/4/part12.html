<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Town and City Rates for Municipalities in Fiji (Question No. 177/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on what measures are in place to recover the outstanding Town and City rates in all the Municipalities in Fiji? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. It is, indeed, a pertinent issue for Municipalities around Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, rates are a significant source of funding for Municipal Councils. Municipal Councils can make investments in their communities and improve the service they provide to ratepayers if they are able to collect the rates. Madam Deputy Speaker, in Fiji, the number of ratepayers in towns and cities is around 44,749, with residential ratepayers making up 85 percent of that total. The Local Government Act 1972 makes it mandatory for residents living on rateable properties in towns and cities to pay their rates. Municipal Councils rely on the rates to fund a variety of services including: (1) waste management; (2) maintenance and beautification of public spaces; (3) (4) planning national events; and (5) sanitation control; carrying out regulatory enforcement duties related to buildings, transportation and</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1760</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 littering. The money received by Municipal Councils can be used to create and improve services, as well as foster an atmosphere that will attract investment, and stimulate the local economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, Suva City Council has the largest ratepayer base, comprising of 11,468 ratepayers, of which 83 percent or 9,441 are residential ratepayers. Nasinu Town Council has 11,377 ratepayers, of which 10,953 are residential ratepayers. In addition, with 8,169 ratepayers, 91 of whom are residential ratepayers for Lautoka City Council which has the third highest ratepayers in our country, whilst the 10 Municipalities make up the remaining 13,735 ratepayers. The Municipal Councils, Madam Deputy Speaker, have the ability to supply services in carrying out its major projects have been seriously hampered by the delay in payment of rates. I would like to reiterate that for cities and towns to be able to provide greater services and to have strong infrastructure, the ratepayers have a responsibility to contribute to those expenditures. Madam Deputy Speaker, as of 12 th July, 2024, the interest on rates on arrears has reduced from 5 percent to 11 percent, and will now be charged on simple interest on arrears rather than the compound interest that was being charged. This will bring some relief to ratepayers who are not able to pay their rates in a timely manner. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Municipal Councils in consultation with the Ministry, have prepared their Rates Collection Plan and that will assist ratepayers who are facing financial difficulties. We have witnessed job losses in our country due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, hence the Plan will accommodate those financially affected. On the way forward, ratepayers will liaise with the relevant Councils on how they will settle or pay up their rates, as well as outstanding rates. Madam Deputy Speaker, with the problem of rate arrears, the Ministry of Local Government has provided a rates amnesty period. One was given in 2018, two in 2019 and two in 2023. This was done to encourage the ratepayers to pay up their arrears, without having to pay the interest on the arrears. Every compound interest on arrears was eliminated during the amnesty period, provided that residential ratepayers paid their full principal amount within the allocated time. In addition, this allowed Municipal Councils to tidy up their books. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Councils have been making arrangements with struggling ratepayers - those ratepayers who have been facing financial hardships, to pay their rates in instalments or in small payments. Besides, the discount period for the current rates were extended by most of the Councils to encourage ratepayers to come forward and pay up their rates at reduced amounts. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, together with the 13 Municipalities around the country, have also conducted rate profiling exercises to ascertain the total outstanding, as well as aging rates, and identify the challenges in the rate recovery processes by the Councils. While these rate profiling exercises was done, one of the objectives also is to identify some of the things that are lacking. If you go to some of the Municipalities around the country, they do not even have the right postal addresses, phone contacts and emails of most of the ratepayers. So, this was one of the objectives of why the rate profiling exercise was carried out by most Municipalities</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1761 around the country. Madam Deputy Speaker, after going through these profiling exercises, Municipal Councils should be able to identify the right strategies that they are going to take to improve rates recovery, as well as how to enforce those who are defaulting on their rates. Madam Deputy Speaker, as of 30 th August, 2024, there is approximately $67.2 million in town rates arrears in all Municipalities and approximately 27 percent or $30.9 million of rates are in arrears for the past one to five years. Also note that 2,850 ratepayers are facing genuine financial hardships, whilst 10,869 can pay rates but are not paying. We are working hand in hand with Municipal Councils to ensure that the focus is placed where it belongs. On those who have the capacity to pay but have chosen not to do so, the Councils are committed to recovering every dollar owed so that they can reinvest into the communities that need it most. Madam Deputy Speaker, the strategy of this Government is to allow the Councils to improve rate collection, hence it is critical for the Councils to focus on those ratepayers who are in arrears for more than five years and those who are capable of paying their rates. This will also provide high returns on the efforts made. Madam Deputy Speaker, our strategy is clear and uncompromised. We have advised the Councils of the full extent of their regulatory powers under the Local Government Act and they are implementing a range of strategies to recover these outstanding funds. These include: • • • • • • extended discount periods; allowing payment by instalments; engaging with major landlords like Ministry of Lands, Housing Authority, as well as TLTB; enabling online payments like M-PAiSA and payments through banks; taking this up with the Small Claims Tribunal for all rates that are more than $5,000 and pursuing legal action where necessary to try and recover some of these rates that have been outstanding for quite some time; or even placing caveat on properties that have been there for some time. Also, one thing that I have been reminding my team is that in any collection exercise, it is always important that you start with the low hanging fruits - those that are less than 12 months and less than two years. Those are the ones that are easily collected, and we must focus on those rates. Then we focus on those that are more than two to five years, as well as aging or rates that have been extending for quite some time. This would have come about after rate profiling exercises are done. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to respond to the question. DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, I am looking at the time and I figure we have time for more than one supplementary question. I ask that we make the questions concise and keep within our times. HON. J. USAMATE.– Madam Deputy Speaker, I was on the verge of standing up to ask a supplementary question and to inform your esteemed position that we would not be asking supplementary questions as we thought it was extremely unfair and not in the spirit of this Parliament to limit the opportunities for Members of the Opposition to ask supplementary questions because we are representatives of the people.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1762</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 (Chorus of interjections) DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Order, order! We will allow honourable Usamate to continue. HON. J. USAMATE. - This has never been done before and I thank you for giving us that time. We have been having our speaking times reduced, the number of weeks in a year that we meet, reduced, everything has been reduced and now, remove that opportunity for us to ask questions. I am thankful for your decision, Madam Deputy Speaker. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR. - The so-called democracy:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Order! HON. J. USAMATE. - I was given the right by the Deputy Speaker to speak and I withdraw that statement that I was about to make. Thank you for your ruling. HON. P. K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, recently, there has been the revision of interest rates, from compound to simple. My question to the honourable Minister is, what are the many advantages and benefits to this change? How much town rate arrears has been written off? HON. M. K. NALUMISA. - Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for that question. I think I had mentioned in one of my responses in Parliament the reason why we are reducing the interest rate, from 11 percent to 5 percent, as well as the changes in methodology. I think he was absent during that Sitting. Now, if you look at the history of the town rates, one of the reasons why the interest rate compounds is the interest is being charged on these arrears because when you apply compound interest, then you are charging interest on the interest of that late payment. So, that adds more burden to the ratepayers. I think the main objective of why the Coalition Government is reducing or changing the way the interest rate is charged is to assist the ratepayers in the repayment of their debt. I have been to some of these communities in Suva and Nabua, they have rates of more than $11,000, $12,000 and $15,000, because they have been accumulating rates for the past 10 to 15 years. So, this exercise was done to assist the ratepayers in repaying their debt, to give them some incentive to come forward to pay their rates. HON. S. NAND. - Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Government is really interested in helping the ratepayers and recover all the rates, instead of reducing the interest rate, why not just do away with the interest and get the principal only, so it makes it easier for the ratepayers to pay the principal only? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, when I took office, one of the things I did was challenge the Councils to change the way they do business. They have been heavily reliant on Government to give them funds, especially the medium and smaller sized Councils, in order to fund projects and their basic services to ratepayers. If you look at the business aspects of things, someone in any institution, there is one way of enticing and encouraging people to come and pay their rates, like for them to avoid paying interest so they can pay their rates on time. That is one way of deterring the people from paying their rates late.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1763 For repaying their rates, we have provisions in place in the Local Government Act, for all those that are facing financial hardships, the Minister has the power upon justification and verification of all the documents to nullify their position to pay their rates, the Minister has the full powers to waive the interest on those outstanding rates. Fiji National Labour Mobility Framework and Strategy (Question No. 178/2024) HON. J. N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations inform Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the development of the Fiji National Labour Mobility Framework and Strategy with the International Organisation for Migration? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for asking the question. It is my pleasure to update Parliament on the MOU that my Ministry signed on 9 th August, 2024, with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coalition Government is committed to reviewing and modernising critical national legislations and policies related to employment, including labour mobility. These reviews include, the Employment Relations Act, our OHS Regulations, and the National Employment Policy 2018. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the context of these high level policy processes, labour mobility is unique, in the sense that it requires specific technical attention. As such, it is proposed to leverage the existing processes to develop a National Labour Mobility Policy, which would complement the National Employment Policy and other employment policies. The proposed Policy would outline the three key priority approaches, from the governance of labour mobility, both incoming and outgoing. The policy is to ensure that Fiji has a well-managed labour mobility governance framework that forces the socio-economic benefits of migration for individuals and communities and aligns with international standards and best practises. Madam Deputy Speaker, the signing of this MOU between our Ministry and IOM is a testament of our commitment to collaborative efforts in addressing labour mobility challenges and turning them into opportunities. It will enable us to benefit from technical assistance provided by the IOM towards the protection of migrant workers’ rights, conduct research and build capacity on gathering labour migration data. Madam Deputy Speaker, with funding from the Migration Partnership Trust Fund, IOM is already collaborating closely with the Ministry on the project: Labour Mobility for Sustainable Development and Climate Resilience in the Pacific. This initiative is being carried out in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Madam Deputy Speaker, as part of this project, IOM will help Fiji build its National Labour Mobility Policy and Strategy. I wish to thank the IOM for their assistance and dedication towards the Fiji Government in sharing their experiences and resources to improve Fiji’s Labour Mobility Programmes and efforts. Madam Deputy Speaker, this collaborative approach for having an MOU was also discussed during our stakeholders meeting. These stakeholders are the Ministry of Education, Ministry of</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1764</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 Finance, Office of the Prime Minister and the Office of the Solicitor-General, during the consultation process for Cabinet endorsement to develop the Fiji National Labour Mobility Policy Framework and Strategy for Sustainable Development and Climate Resilience. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that if you are navigating labour mobility, it is quite a difficult task. Can you please tell Parliament that in terms of the collaboration with the UN based organisation, has the country’s needs assessment being done already, and if it has been done, will we be seeing the outcome of that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank honourable Koya for the question.</p><p>That is part of the exercise, Madam Deputy Speaker. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, a quick question to the honourable Minister, we are hearing mixed messages about the benefits and, of course, the challenges we face as well. Will the work undertaken by IOM include the benefits to the economy of the receiving countries as against ours, because in some sectors, it would have been better if people remain here in Fiji, rather than go abroad? So, the benefits to the economy of the receiving countries versus the benefit it brings to us and the individual workers. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for that question. It is part of the statistics, the data that we are collecting and the strategies will be drawn up thereafter.</p><h4>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will move on now to the third of our 14 Oral Questions</h4><p>today. I now call upon the honourable Assistant Minister for Education to ask Question No. 179. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Thank you, Madam Speaker, I believe this question was withdrawn. (Question No. 179/2024 withdrawn) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- That question has been withdrawn, and I understand there might be a</p><h4>Ministerial Statement that will follow later on this week.</h4><p>Update on Velovelo Foreshore Land (Question No. 180/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K:</span> LAL asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament on the Velovelo foreshore land at Lautoka which was under development for industrial purposes? HON. F. W. V. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank honourable Ketan Lal for the question this morning. I, perhaps wish to begin by addressing a point of clarity that there is no such development that was undertaken by Government known as Velovelo Foreshore Development in Lautoka. What was undertaken by Government was an adjacent parcel of real estate which is called the Wairabetia Economic Zone Development. It is right next to each other, but they share the same parcel of foreshore. By way of an update, Madam Deputy Speaker, that development that was undertaken by Government in Wairabetia of which the Approval to Lease was issued in 2017, has now been</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1765 completed. The peripheral survey has been approved, and the dry part of the leased land had been approved in January 2024. We continue to liaise with the Ministry of Trade, who are ultimately going to be the organiser of the development around that piece of land. What may have been the cause of delay from this development, which was first hatched between then and now, was the time taken between Government and iTLTB negotiations with the iTaukei landowners, who are owners of the parcels of land needed to be acquired. A portion of the money that was set aside for this development, perhaps to the tune of a little over $640,000 was paid to iTLTB for the lease. With the preliminary work, such as the acquisition and the periphery survey of the land completed, we will soon be handing over to the Ministry of Trade the leases from iTLTB through the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, and once the leases have been registered, the Ministry of Trade will have their own plans on how to roll out that programme. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in terms of this Wairabetia lot, I know that FNPF was actually involved in this and they had moved that special economic zone to Navutu also. But this spot, will it also entail getting a foreshore lease done for that particular part, specifically because, from what I understand, it has one of the deepest seaports in that particular area for future development? Once it is all complete, will it include some foreshore with respect to that particular development, whether it is industrial or commercial? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think ideally when we are looking at that real estate in Lautoka, we are looking at expanding to real estate well beyond the dry land. It has always been the ideal, that at some point, we are going to acquire or move the development beyond the high-water mark because that is where the real development would be. There is a huge amount of State foreshore beyond that, so I think that is going to be the real prime estate in this whole development. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.-Honourable Minister, one of the sensitive and controversial issues as well when it comes to foreshore development is the risk assessment, particularly, considering the value of the properties. This is particularly from a risk reduction perspective. There has been a lot of discussions on this issue previously from the real estates and from Municipal Councils that the price of properties are affected because of the risk assessments that are done on foreshore developments and existing properties. My question to the honourable Minister is, how is this being taken care of or progressed, given the plan that has already been undertaken? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Is this in relation only to Wairabetia or generally as a question? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Wairebetia as foreshore development and for other foreshore developments as well. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- At the moment, Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have clarified, Wairabetia is not a foreshore development, it is a dry land lease development. It can progress to a foreshore development, but that part is not yet confirmed. 2021 Pacific Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (Question No. 181/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the outcomes of the 2021 Pacific Literacy and Numeracy Assessment?</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1766</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, just by way of information, the Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PILNA), is a three-year cycle, which was first administered in 2012 and subsequently in 2015, 2018 and 2021. The next assessment is due in 2024. In relation to the question, the findings of the PILNA Report for the 2021 cycle highlights that Year 4 and Year 6 students in Fiji perform above the regional level in reading. However, less than half of the Year 4 students reached the expected proficiency level. In numeracy, more than half of the students in both, Year 4 and Year 6, meet or exceeded the minimum proficiency level. Data from this assessment also revealed that girls out-perform boys in numeracy, reading and writing. Madam Deputy Speaker, I had shared the data from this Report with the Ministry’s Curriculum Advisory Services and the District Office of the Ministry, so intervention programmes are implemented which, in turn, are monitored from the school and at district level. One of the strategies is the improvement of reading and numeracy progress trackers in the Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS) dashboard. Currently, a coordinator for LANA phonics is working on these reading and numeracy progress trackers for the follow-up and feedback, which is an ongoing activity, with continuous monitoring done at the school and divisional level. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is important that Fiji continues with this programme, since this is initiated by the regional Ministers of Education. So, PILNA addresses the targets identified in the Pacific Regional Education Framework (PacREF) in Sustainable Development Goal 4 by analysing and measuring results that provide the evidence of education quality for national governments and regional organisations. HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure the Ministry has analysed the 2021 Pacific Literacy and Numeracy Assessment. I am interested in the performance of students schooling in remote areas. How did the rural remote and maritime students do compare to students in urban schools? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have said, the next cycle is due in 2024 and we can provide the information when the assessment is done. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the honourable Minister for Education for his response to the question. The PILNA findings also showed that teachers have insufficient time for slow learners. I just read recently in Australia, they need about 20,000 ECE teachers, so there is a high demand for ECE teachers. We know that at that initial stage, if children are taught well in primary, they will do well in Years 4 and above, which has been tested. So, my question to you, honourable Minister for Education is, how are you going to address this particular finding from the Report? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, this is an ongoing problem that has continuously been faced by Governments. In the Denarau Declaration documents, this has also been highlighted as part of the thematic areas that needed to be reviewed by the Ministry of Education and we are currently working on the implementation of the Declaration, addressing issues that you have highlighted. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Members. It is 10.27 a.m. and we will take a tea break. The second bell will ring at 11.00 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 10.24 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1767 The Parliament resumed at 11.00 a.m. Measures to Address the Litter Act 2008 (Question No. 185/2024) HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs inform Parliament on measures being undertaken by the Ministry of Environment to enforce the Litter Act 2008? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Protecting our environment from pollutants and waste is in the interest of everyone. However, we unfortunately continue to see the disregard for this important requirement. Our island and its unique biodiversity and ecosystems are our inheritance. But before I go on, I would like to just comment on the question answered by the honourable Minister for Education about education and what we do when we grow up. It is exactly the same as our educating the populace on litter and the evils of littering. When I came back from Tonga, I came back with a video recording of the trip we made to watch whales. I showed it to my great grandson who is in kindergarten, and he said, “What’s that papa?” I said, “It’s a whale.” He looked at it and said, “That’s not a whale.” I said, “What is it?” He said, “Orca.” And then went on to say, “That’s a killer whale.” Boy, kindergarten! What are we not doing right? Our island’s a unique ecosystem must be protected, unfortunately many of us have bad habits. In my trips to China and Japan and experiences of clean roads and roadsides, et cetera, I do not know whether I was driven through the VIP route which was clean before we drove through, but generally it is all clean. When we tried to enforce the Act, but the enforcement is not really discouraging enough, the fine is $40; whether you dump a car, dump a fridge or plastic bag and get prosecuted, it is $40. The Litter Decree or Act and its amendment is now being reviewed, including the container deposits for bottlers and those that use plastic containers. As I have said, the fines are only $40 and if you do not pay that within 30 days, you would be prosecuted. The Ministry had been diligently working on strengthening enforcement, which is really the issue, not the Act itself, it is the enforcement of the Act. There have been 18 training workshops for public and non-public authorities in Fiji, a total of 598 Litter Prevention Officers have been trained and appointed. In 2019 during the FijiFirst Government, all 14 Provinces sent Provincial Conservation Officers and Litter Enforcement Officers to be trained under the Act of 2008. There has been a training plan for new Litter Prevention Officers that has been developed for this fiscal year but despite the progress, we recognise that the Litter Act is now outdated. It lacks the definitions and differentiations that is needed in many cases to enable effective policing and enforcement. There is an immediate need to introduce regulations to further enable the Enforcement Officers for the enforcement of this Act. However, introducing the regulations under the Act, it</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1768</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 presents its own problematic issues due to the nature of the meaning of the provisions of that Act. For example, the Act does not create sufficient differentiation within its definitions to reflect the difference in scale, as I mentioned earlier, and the implications of the different offences. The fixed penalties, as I have said, is $40, whether it is a used refrigerator that is no longer serviceable or in use and dropping paper wrappers on the side of the road or on parks. Instead, the Act only differentiates between litter and dangerous litter. The definition of dangerous litter is focussed mostly on the immediate danger to people. It does not include consideration of long-term dangers to the environment, as it continues to rust and pollute the environment they are in, whether its water, sea or on hard ground. Furthermore, irrespective of those problematic definitions, there is no difference in the fines as I said earlier. Madam Deputy Speaker, the fixed penalty is $40, it is not a deterrent. It is important to note that the penalty for corporate bodies that commits an offence is $2,000, irrespective of the type and volume of litter that they deposit. It is wholly insufficient in the case of significant environmental offenses and the Litter Act only applies to lose definition of public places and the demarcation of boundaries for litter enforcement is not really clearly defined. The Act is being reviewed and consultation is now in progress to bring the reviewed Act to Cabinet. But the Ministry acknowledges the existing gaps in the Litter Act of 2008 and its amendment in 2010 and the need to strengthen the enforcement and implementation of the Act through the thorough review which is on-going right now. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, and I also like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his response. I do understand the problems associated with the Litter Decree and he has rightly pointed it out, but I find that there is a disconnect between what students are taught in the schools and what they practice at home. In rural areas there is no disposal waste collection services, so the parents usually say, “take this rubbish and dump it.” That habit continues when they come out in cities and towns and we need to also look at this issue rather seriously as to how we can roll out this waste collection service across the country, that might help in educating our young minds. Honourable Prime Minister my other question related to this particular topic is the enforcement. There is no money allocated for the enforcement of the Litter Decree. Do you think when you will be reviewing this legislation you are going to come to Parliament with a law and can you put a dollar value on it as well for the implementation of the Act? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, that will be done. I would like to comment on your remark on rural areas, maybe some rural areas, many of the villages have very strict litter laws according to the traditional leadership of the land. So, the answer basically is yes, that will be included in the review and the provincial councils enforce the benu ca rules in the villages. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Prime Minister every year we do the Leptospirosis, Typhoid, Dengue and Diarrhoea (LTDD) campaign for almost all the agencies of government. You have highlighted about the household litter but one of the big issues we have now, Sir, is old automobiles, cars including tyres as well. Tyres is a big threat. My question, Sir, is on recycling, part of the review, probably if I may ask, if it can be considered that we make advantage of some of these wastes, to convert it again into better use. The question is, has there been consideration on this in terms of the review that is being undertaken? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, that is also being taken into account</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1769 and there are already recyclers of rubber tyres who break them down into almost dust and that is shipped away to recycling factories overseas. However, we break them down and then send them overseas. Yes, that is part of the review. HON. J. USAMATE.- Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the things that I have noticed when you go overseas and people walk their dogs, they have little plastic bags. When the dogs do their business, it is their responsibility to clean it. As a person that does not own dogs in Nakasi, I noticed that people there when the dogs have to do their business, they open the gates, let the dogs around, do their business and come back in. So, honourable Prime Minister, would you put in the law that makes it mandatory for people when their dogs do business outside, it is their responsibility to go and pick it up or if not for them to be fined? (Laughter) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, would you like to answer that question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L.

VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament as to when the damaged hanging bridge in Bua Lomanikoro which was severely damaged in 2015 will be replaced? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Assistant Minister, for that question. I was just thinking about the questions relating to specific locations. I remember that in the last Parliament, we were barred from asking such questions on specific locations. I am not sure whether it was the previous government or the previous government working with the Speaker.

TUISAWAU.:</span> A feature of good, open government.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hogwash! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- For this one, it is quite an interesting one because we had originally planned for a modular bridge (vehicle bridge). A scope had been done but the Bose Vanua had a meeting with the Turaga Tui Bua and did not agree with the vehicle. If you go there, it crosses directly into the village. I suppose when you construct a road, and I had mentioned yesterday the framework for land acquisition and the need to look at social, economic and the various implications, it is commendable that they look at those implications, given the social issues we face today and the access of vehicles into our villages. Yes, we have noticed access of vehicles, it is good for the village in terms of transporting whatever is needed for the village for positive developments, but it can also give access for transport of illegal items such as drugs. The framework in terms of looking at before you construct a road, what you need to comply with, that needs to be strengthened as we move forward in terms of the challenging environment we face and what the vanua, the community or the village would see as what is good for them. For this particular one, that was the feedback. We are looking at instead of that, a walkway and the Ministry, towards the end of last year, had worked on the design and scope so it is a longstanding request. We have not specifically budgeted for it, but I have asked the Ministry for us to relook at that and also see what we can do in terms of the current budget. There are various stakeholders including our development partners who have expressed interest in funding walkways and bridges in terms of difficult areas such as this. In fact, there was a proposal I was reading regarding modular walkways and bridges which was done, but it is specified the various areas in Fiji, I think the former Minister is aware of it and that is something we also taking up in our discussions with our development partners. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask to withdraw this Oral Question that is under my name. Vinaka. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I apologise, yes, I understand that, that question has been withdrawn. (Question No. 187/2024 withdrawn) Fiji Aviation Academy’s Strategy in Saving Fiji Airways (Question No. 188/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on what strategy was in place by the Fiji Aviation Academy in saving Fiji Airways over $US10 million (FJD22.7 million) in training bills annually? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to provide an update on the strategic initiatives undertaken by the Fiji Airways particularly through the establishment of the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy. This Academy is not only an infrastructure investment, it is a testament to our national airlines commitment to self-reliance, operational excellence and sustainable financial management.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1771 In an increasingly competitive global aviation market, the ability to manage costs while maintaining high standards of training and safety is paramount. The Fiji Airways Aviation Academy embodies this vision by providing a robust solution to the airlines pilot training needs, yielding significant financial and operational benefits. At the heart of the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy’s success lies a meticulously crafted strategy aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in pilot training. This approach has enabled the airline to realise substantial cost savings amounting to US$10 million of FJ$22.7 million annually. Allow me to elaborate more on the matter. One of the most significant advantages of the Academy is its ability to conduct all necessary training internally. This includes initial type ratings, common type ratings, recurrent training, remedial training and licence conversion. By eliminating the need to outsource these training activities to third-party providers, Fiji Airways has avoided substantial fees that would otherwise be paid to external training centres. This move ensures that every dollar invested in training remains within the company, contributing directly to its financial stability. Traditionally, pilots were required to travel to international training locations such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Honolulu, Brisbane, Seattle and Bangkok. These not only incur training fees but also significant costs related to accommodation and subsistence. With the establishment of the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy, these costs have been entirely eliminated. Pilots can now undergo all necessary training within the country, reducing the financial burden associated with overseas travel. Beyond accommodation and subsistence, the costs with onward travel to these international locations were also considerable. The Academy has effectively eradicated these expenses, further contributing to the impressive annual savings achieved by Fiji Airways. While the financial savings achieved through the Fiji Airways are significant, the benefits extend far beyond cost reduction. The Academy has also introduced a range of operational efficiencies that are driving the airline’s success on multiple fronts. The Academy has also had a profound impact on pilot productivity. Previously, pilots were required to travel long distances to attend simulator training, which resulted in the loss of duty days and additional rest periods. In conclusion, the Fiji Airways Aviation Academy represents a bold and forward-thinking investment in the future of our national airline. The financial savings and operational efficiencies realised through this initiative are a testament to the strategic vision and leadership that guide Fiji Airways. However, beyond the numbers, the Academy symbolises something greater, it embodies our collective commitment to building a resilient and self-sufficient airline that can weather the challenges of a dynamic industry. It underscores the importance of innovation, not just as a means of survival, but as a driver of progress and excellence. Let this be a reminder to us all that that with the right strategy, we can transform challenges into opportunities, and pave the way for a brighter, more prosperous future for Fiji Airways and the nation as a whole. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I think at last count, we had about 120-odd local pilots engaged with Fiji Airways and some of them actually coming out of the Academy. In light of the fact that we have extended our fleet in terms of the A350-900s that we have, the Academy itself has flight simulators that are A330 and below the 787, I think it is, and then the smaller planes. Will the Academy be investing in A350 simulators, if there is a need to do so in terms of part of its expansion programme because I understand also that there is going to be accommodation, et cetera,</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1772</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 being provided? It is good to see that the honourable Minister is flying the flag of Fiji Airways. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Thank you honourable Koya. The simulators at the airport represent the entire fleet of the airline right now, and A350 is also part of it now, honourable Koya. I think in about two weeks’ time, there will be two more that will be launched at the Academy in Nadi. Fiji Airways has about 2,200 staff and the number of pilots has also increased quite significantly and the vast majority, more than 90 percent are locals. Just to add, the Academy is also hosting pilots from other countries to come and train in Nadi. So that is quite a significant accomplishment on part of Fiji Airways. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, this is again one of the great initiatives of the Bainimarama Government and as you have mentioned that the training is also provided to international and regional airlines. My question to you is, how much revenue has Fiji Airways generated from providing this training to regional and international airlines? We know how much it has saved but how much money has it generated? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Good question, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am afraid I cannot give an exact number right now but I can assure you, it is quite significant because some of these simulators are fully booked throughout the year as an indication of the revenue potential of these simulators. I can provide that later, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> That is what these Ministers say, they do not provide the answers.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Perhaps, a Written Question at the next sitting. (Chorus of interjections) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! Honourable Members, please join me in welcoming a delegation from the National Diet of Japan, Mr. Fujikawa Masahito, the Chairman of the Special Committee on Official Development Assistance, Mr. Ejima Kiyoshi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party with their delegation and they are in the company of the Ambassador of Japan His Excellency Michi.

NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on which sectors were assisted under the $2 million Commercial Agriculture Development Programme in the 2023-2024 financial year? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. In response the Commercial Agricultural Development Programme was created in September 2021 to address the establishment and improvement of commercial agriculture as highlighted in the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways’ Strategic Priority 4 under the Five-Year Strategic Development Plan.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1773 Madam Deputy Speaker, in the 2023-2024 Financial Year, a total of $2 million was allocated which supported nine exporters and eleven food processors. This support focused on expanding, processing and storage capacities through improving electricity supply with the purchase of generators, value adding machines, cooler rooms, upgrading of infrastructure and the purchase of solar machines. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the supported exporters Kaiming Agro Processing Ltd has managed to increase its storage capacity from 300 tonnes to 450 tonnes of matured ginger. The exporter was able to purchase an additional 150 tonnes of matured ginger from farmers in November 2023, and early this year, 2024. This has provided much needed market to accommodate the high volume of ginger crops on the ground, as I highlighted in Parliament. Following discussions with the Fiji Trade Commission in the United States of America, Kaiming Agro Processing Ltd has reached an agreement with the US importers to purchase matured ginger. This ginger undergoes value addition at their processing plants before export to the US market. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, through the CADP programme, also supported Juice Fiji Pte Limited with three ginger processing machines to increase the intake of ginger from farmers in Colo-i-Suva, Qiolevu, Lomaivuna and Tailevu areas. The company was producing 1,000 litre bottles of juice a week before the support, and it is producing up to 4,000 litre bottles a week to-date. They have increased their volume of ginger purchased from 200 kilogrammes a week to one tonne a week for processing. The New Valley Processors (Fiji) Pvt Ltd in Sabeto, Nadi has been supported with the three- phase power electricity unit to help the company process cassava, dalo, chillies and vegetables to meet the local demand, as well as for exports to New Zealand and Australia. The exporter has been working together with partners in community development and 2,000 ladies from eight districts covering Keiyasi to Nadarivatu in the highlands of Nadroga/Navosa to plant 200,000 bongo chillie plants. With the support provided to New Valley Processors, they will now be able to process weekly 340 tonnes of cassava, 100 tonnes of dalo, 10 tonnes of chillies and 10 tonnes of vegetables for the export market. Madam Deputy Speaker, support was also provided to Tavioka Organic Pty Ltd with the three-phase electricity power unit supplied to the factory to run the production of cassava flour using the cassava flour machines. With the support provided, the company is able to produce up to six tonnes to eight tonnes of cassava flour per day, as compared to two tonnes per day before the support was provided. As part of our ongoing commitment to help farmers access markets, the Ministry will continue to expand the support directed to food processors and exporters on agriculture export related produce that achieves sustainable economic growth and export competitiveness and boost value addition and diversification. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry remains dedicated to decreasing the importation of dairy products, which was valued at around $90 million in the last fiscal year. On this end, the Ministry has allocated $110,000 to assist in the commercialisation of dairy farming operations. Madam Deputy Speaker, 21 dairy farmers have been assisted with fencing materials and dairy sheds to expand their farms to a commercial level and supply milk to the formal market. Madam Deputy Speaker, the value of wheat imports was around $140.8 million in 2023, and the Ministry has supported Women’s Groups to the sum of $100,000 to purchase 30 machines for the production of cassava flour as a substitute to imported wheat flour. Support to the Women’s Groups have also been provided in the form of capacity building, training on the harvesting and</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1774</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 processing of cassava to produce flour. The broader objective is for the Women’s Groups to be formed into co-operatives and combine their flour production firstly to meet domestic needs then to commercialise their operations to supply cassava floor to the formal market. Madam Deputy Speaker, the $150,000 was allocated to support the commercialisation of high value crops. These include green pearl guava, dragon fruit, mango, avocado, bananas, coconut breadfruit and citrus which includes oranges, lime and lemon. Through their support, 420 farmers have been trained in fruit tree propagation techniques to rapidly increase the numbers of trees and yield. The support also include the establishment of nurseries and its associated capacity building trainings for farmers to improve their fruit orchards. There is a huge potential for these high-value crops to meet the hotel sector demands, however, the volume of production, consistency and quality of these high-value crops needs to be improved before the hotel markets can be accessed. Madam Deputy Speaker, $100,000 was allocated to support 10 youth farming clusters to raise their farm operations to a commercial level. This include the provision of infrastructure materials to construct farm sheds, water tanks for rainwater harvesting. The farm sheds and water supply was provided to assist with the harvesting, processing and storage of farm produce for the formal markets. Madam Deputy Speaker, considering the characteristics and nature of agriculture, it is anticipated that the result of these interventions will become evident in the not too distant future. This is an opportunity to shape the future of our rural dwellers in a new era of prosperity and progress for our beloved nation. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We have a supplementary question from honourable Koya. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, from the $2 million that was part of the development programme, I only heard you speak about one organic farmer that was assisted. Because it such a huge value-add to us in terms of getting more money to our farmers, was that $2 million or did part of that $2 million have a dedicated portion to our organic farmers or looking at creating more organic farmers? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Yes, I agree with the honourable Member that organic farming is a high value method of farming in terms of the demand for organic products worldwide and the Ministry has dedicated personnel working on organic farming. In fact, years ago we have already developed the organic standards through been farming with the help of Pacific Community (SPC), but I do agree with the honourable Member that there should be more done by the Ministry in terms of developing the organic production even though it is a niche market. HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I must thank the honourable Minister for a very comprehensive reply. Listening to him, I see a large chunk of the assistance has gone to the exporters and the processors of the agriculture product. Can the honourable Minister explain why a significant check was not used to assist the commercial farmers in leveraging their production so they can increase their production and then it goes to the processors? Development should be on the farm first and then to the processors. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for that question. It is really chicken and egg and egg and chicken; hen and egg, egg and hen situation. I had already informed the House previously, that we are facing problems in the export of fresh agriculture products to our traditional export markets. I had already stated also that this is the way we want to go. We want to develop agro-processing and value addition locally, so that, first of all,</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1775 we get our people to get used to consuming locally produce products first before we even think of exports. When we assist the agro processors going into value addition, the moment their capacity increases like I have made known this morning, it is the farmers that benefit directly. In commercial farming you have to produce for a market, it is either you produce for a market and you have a ready-made contract done or you will lose out and all your production will go to waste and it has happened. We are learning from history and trying to do something about it. In this case, as we have heard this morning, Madam Deputy Speaker, the agro processors that we have assisted have increased their capacity to buy local agriculture produce and that in itself is a big positive. I do understand where my colleague is coming from, but we have other programmes that assist production directly within the Ministry’s budget. Status of Standing Tree Compensation (Question No. 190/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament of the current status of Standing Tree Compensation for landowning units whose land were leased to the State for water catchment purposes? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank honourable Vanawalu this morning. Perhaps, may I be permitted within the time available just to explain this, rather interesting, but quite often misread and not a lot of accurate information is out in the public domain about this important topic. As we are all aware, standing trees are important, and play a very critical role in water catchment areas as they stabilise the soil and reduce erosion. Secondly, they regulate water flow to mitigate floods and droughts. Thirdly, more importantly, is they purify water thus improving the water quality that we uptake in our tanks everyday. By way of a legal framework, Madam Deputy Speaker, section 5 of the State Lands Act 1945, provides that any land taken on lease by the State shall be made out to the Director of Lands. Water catchment leases are currently leased under this provision as it is a lease for public purpose in the provision of water to all. On behalf of the Government, the Director of Lands negotiates with the landowning units as well as with iTLTB, whilst rivers and streams themselves, the ground upon which water flows from hills to river belongs to the State for public use. The catchment dry areas around the rivers and streams belongs to mostly all of these catchment areas that belong to iTaukei landowners. Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji has no existing policy on Standing Trees Compensation. Currently, compensation for Standing Trees is being guided by a Cabinet Decision of 1987 which provides that should any merchantable timber be removed, royalty is to be paid. I emphasise that the payment is upon removal of the tree. But since water catchment leases condition that lessee, that is, the Director of Lands, is leasing the catchment area shall not dispose or by sale take or injure any forest, trees or otherwise any forest produce growing upon the demised land without the written consent of iTLTB, and such conditions as to the payment of royalty or otherwise prescribed by the Forest Regulations as the lessor may direct, consequently compensation is only applied to trees or forest which have been fell or removed. But because the primary purpose of the catchment area is to maintain the quality of water therefore, all standing trees around it are not fell and therefore, not compensatable. At the moment, as I had mentioned before, there are no policies on Standing Trees</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1776</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 on catchment areas and as usual, as one would expect that payments can and will only be made if there is a Cabinet directive or, of course, if there is a change in law. Madam Deputy Speaker, recently, in a Cabinet decision in 2024, we have approved a paper on Standing Trees Compensation for Water Catchment Leases. The review will also include the development of a policy which is yet to be brought back to Cabinet and in the formulation of that policy, there is going to be strong consultations with the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, of course, the Ministry of Finance, the Lands Valuation Chief Valuer and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. After the formulation of this policy, we should be able to have a very clear pathway and an executable document on how to deal with Standing Trees that exist on water catchment areas. Curbing Drug-Related Offences and HIV Cases (Question No. 191/2024) HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on what measures have been taken to curb the surge in drug-related offences among young people and the doubling of HIV cases among our youths in recent years? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. The global picture of HIV is decreasing, in comparison to the last decade, and Fiji’s story is a bit different. Fiji is showing to be the second fastest-growing nation with new HIV cases in the Asia-Pacific region, and we are second only to the Philippines. While HIV cases have significantly increased over the years, in 2023, the Government has exposed the issue of Injectable Drug Use (IDU) as a significant issue in Fiji. In 2024 alone, Fiji has seen in the first six months of the year, we have had seen 552 new HIV cases in Fiji of which 15 percent were secondary to Injectable Drug Use and this is the first time Fiji has noted this increase. The question is asking what measures have been taken. I am pleased to highlight that the Ministry is committed to safeguarding the wellbeing of our youths by combining awareness, prevention and community engagement. In light of these challenges, the Ministry has taken steps to strengthen its HIV response and drug use through: (1) The development of national strategic plans, partnership with civil society organisations, and implementation of prevention, diagnostics, treatment and care programmes. (2) Leading the Harm Reduction and Rehabilitation sub-committee of the Counter Narcotics Committee in managing the activities of the Committee's action plans. (3) Efforts made to increase access to HIV testing and treatment services across the nation in a decentralised manner, promoting harm reduction initiatives and reducing stigma and discrimination against individuals affected by HIV and drug use. (4) Finalising the Fiji National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027 which will be submitted to Cabinet. That strategy has five key priority areas and support the development of the strategic plan which addresses the need to reduce HIV transmissions and expedite public health, treatment care, human right and social justice for HIV and drug use. For this financial year, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government has allocated a budget of $200,000 for the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Programmes and the Ministry will explore</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1777 additional funding option through donors and other relevant stakeholders who will contribute to the implementing strategic framework. As I had mentioned, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is an issue for Fiji, and it is something not only the Ministry of Health is responsible for taking care of it. It is a whole of Government and whole of society approach and what the Ministry is currently doing right now, and we are grateful with the development partners for assisting us in this space. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, with 70 percent spike in newly reported HIV cases from 2022 to 2023 is really alarming for our beloved nation. Will the Ministry of Health consider boosting funding to provide a range of testing options at community-based testing and early antenatal care tests for all pregnant women? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Testing for antenatal care has been there for some time now, in terms of testing for certain number of diseases, that is part of antenatal care. But nevertheless, as rightly mentioned, the point of care testing, that is something that the Ministry is trying to enhance or improve on when it is decentralising the point of care testing right down to the sub-divisional hospital and health centre, if it may be. What we are seeing with the rise in numbers now is mostly attributed to the increase in the number of testing. HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Minister, given that a lot of HIVs have been attributed to injectable drugs, is there any consideration of programmes around controlling the sale of syringes or Safe Syringe Programmes? Is there any consideration of things around that area? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, honourable Usamate. There are programmes through which the surge strategy will try and incorporate but it has to be contextualised in our setting. One is, as you had mentioned, the Safe Syringe Programme. It has to be seen to be not only reducing the transmission from injectable drug use but also from the perspective of, are we advocating for more drug use. So, it has to be done in the right context and it is also included in the surge strategy that will be a discussion that has to be done, with not only the Ministry or Government but with the relevant stakeholders. MOU Between Suva City Council and Pacific Polytech (Question No. 192/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding that was signed between the Suva City Council and Pacific Polytech? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. The engagement with Pacific Polytech is a strategic initiative that marks a significant milestone with ongoing institutional reforms at the Suva City Council. This partnership is not just about immediate improvements, it is a forward-looking collaboration aimed at positioning Suva City Council as a leader in municipal governance, climate resilience and sustainable development in the region. Madam Deputy Speaker, the initial engagement with Pacific Polytech was a result of proactive efforts by the Suva Council’s Special Administrator who recognised the critical need for institutional strengthening to meet the demands of modern urban governance. This MOU which was signed on 12 th August, 2024, is a product of thorough planning, consultations and a shared vision for</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1778</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 the future of Suva City. It is worth noting that the agreement is for three years since the execution of the Memorandum of Understanding. Madam Deputy Speaker, the MOU is a framework that outlines the responsibilities of both parties and sets the foundation for a long-term partnership. Engagement is a transformative initiative that will elevate the capacity of Suva City Council to deliver enhanced services to its citizens. The key areas of focus include: (1) Capacity building through tailored training programmes for SCC employees, particularly those in waste management and related services will receive upskilling opportunities that are aligned with international best practices. This will not only improve service delivery but also empower a workforce to contribute more effectively to the Council’s objectives. (2) Climate change mitigation, the partnership includes the development of innovative strategies to address climate related challenges particularly in waste management. This is aligned to the Coalition Government’s commitment on environmental sustainability and climate resilience, ensuring that Suva City is better prepared to face challenges of the future. (3) Operational excellence, the first implementation of the MOU ensures that training is timely, relevant and aligned with the immediate and long-term needs of the Council. Each phase will be followed by a review and evaluation to ensure that we are meeting the goals and continuously improving. Madam Deputy Speaker, the benefits of partnership are as follows: (1) Formal qualification - SCC employees will have an opportunity to gain recognised qualifications, enhancing their career prospects and contributing to a more skilled and motivated workforce. (2) Enhanced service delivery - With the improved skills and knowledge, staff performance will see a marked improvement, leading to a more efficient, and more effective service delivery. (3) More strategic and social issue - by outsourcing training to experts such as Pacific Polytech, SCC staff can focus on their core responsibilities ensuring that resources are used where they are most needed. This initiative, Madam Deputy Speaker, is a testament to our Coalition Government’s commitment to building a stronger and more resilient Suva City Council. It reflects a broader vision on municipal councils across Fiji, a vision of modern government cities that are equipped to meet the challenges of the 21 st century. Madam Deputy Speaker, the financial investment in this engagement has been carefully calculated to ensure that it delivers its value for money. The courses are within the allocated budget for SCC’s institutional strengthening initiatives that are supported by a combination of operational funds, grant funding and contributions from development partners. It is not just an expenditure, it is a strategic investment to the future of Suva City. Moreover, the Suva City Council is committed to sharing the knowledge and best practices gained from this engagement with other municipal councils across Fiji. We are actively planning workshops, seminars, distribution of operational reports to ensure the benefits of this initiative are felt beyond Suva City. Madam Deputy Speaker, this partnership with Pacific Polytech is complemented to the ongoing work by the Local Government in New Zealand, particularly in areas of waste management</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1779 and climate resilience. Aligned with aligned with Local Government in New Zealand standards, we are ensuring that Suva City’s cultural strategies are not only locally relevant but also meet international best practices. This is a clear indication of our commitment to Government’s excellence. Looking to the future, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Suva City Council’s long-term plan is built on three pillars: (1) Continuous improvement will ensure that staff receive ongoing professional development opportunities to keep pace with the evolving demands of open governance. (2) Strengthening of governance, enhancing internal controls and governance framework to ensure transparency, accountability and efficiency in all operations. (3) Strategic partnerships will continue to build and maintain partnerships with educational institutions, local governments and international bodies to remain at the forefront of innovation and best practices. Madam Deputy Speaker, while we acknowledge the challenges we face including staff availability, change management and financial constraints that tackle these issues at home, through careful planning, active stakeholder engagement and continuous monitoring, we are confident that the objectives of this MOU will be met and the future of Suva City Council will be brighter than ever.</p><h4>HON. K.K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I have two questions - part (a) and part (b).</h4><p>(a) Can the honourable Minister advise us if there is any monitoring involvement in this partnership or MOU between Pacific Polytech and the Suva City Council?</p><h4>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Is that the first of your two follow-up questions?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Yes, Madam.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> I think I had also shared in my response one of the key focus of this MOU, which is operational excellence where, in each phase, there will be a review as well as an evaluation, to ensure that the training meets the goals as well as the objectives of the MOU. If there is continuous improvement, that can also be reviewed by the Ministry, as well as the Suva City Council. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Your second follow-up question, honourable Lal? HON. K. K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my first question was basically if Suva City Council is paying Polytech for certain trainings, and if so, we normally have FNU levy that employers pay to NTPC. If I am correct, it is a one percent levy. If Suva City Council is paying that levy to NTPC, should not Suva City Council first give the chance to NTPC and utilise that levy? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- I think the question raised by the honourable Member is a valid one, but that levy is not only used by the city council, it is also used by ACCF as well as LTA. The objective of having this initiative is to encourage and facilitate the upskilling and capacity building within Suva City Council because there is an urgent need right now to upskill the workers, especially those who look after garbage collection, even waste management as well as other related services. Suva City Council sees the need for it and that is the reason why we have engaged Polytech to provide training to Suva City Council.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1780</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I can see him getting very angsty, thank you honourable Ketan, I will allow this one. HON. K. K. LAL.- My concern here, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Ministers raised concerns in terms of saving money for the Government and here we have Suva City Council going to Polytech and paying another set of funding for training purposes when they can utilise the same funding with NTPC and our other established universities like FNU. I hope the honourable Minister can reassure us that in future they will utilise that FNU levy that they have been paying or employees have been paying and upskill and train their workers and officers. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I do not think that was a question, that was a statement. Thank you, I am sure the honourable Minister has taken note of that. Criteria for Appointment of District Advisory Councillors (Question No. 193/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management inform Parliament, if the criteria for the appointment of District Advisory Councillors have been strictly adhered to in all appointments since January 2023? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the question was originally supposed to be asked by honourable Nath but I suppose his gone abroad, on a visit somewhere. The nature of the question has also changed a bit. The original question simply asked the criteria for the selection of the District Advisory Councillors which I had prepared for, but I will also answer the other question that has been asked by the honourable Member. I thank the honourable Member for the question, I think it is a topic that we are all familiar with. The main purpose of the District Advisory Council was to provide a forum for multi-ethnic and minority communities to participate in the discussion and decision-making on development issues in their respective settlements. The District Advisory Council is a crucial component of the rural development framework. It plays an important role in the identification of development needs, as well as providing support during response to natural disasters by the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management for communities outside of registered village boundaries in the rural and maritime areas. There are 302 constituencies in the 16 District Advisory Councils across the country. The number of Councils and constituencies by Division are as follows: (1) Central Division – four Councils with 71 constituencies; (2) Eastern Division – one Council with eight constituencies; (3) Northern Division – five Councils with 81 constituencies; and (4) Western Division – six Councils with 142 constituencies. Madam Deputy Speaker, the number of members in each Council varies with the lowest for the Eastern Division comprising only of eight members, and the highest number being for the Nadroga/ Navosa comprising of 30 members. The term of District Advisory Council members is two years, and the current appointments will lapse on 31 st July, 2025.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1781 The criteria for appointment, there is a guideline for administration of District Advisory Councils which clearly stipulates the criteria for appointment of District Advisory Council members. In summary, a Council should have members whose skills, experience and attributes together reflect balance, cohesion, and ability to contribute effectively to the district. It should also reflect a fair representation in terms of area, gender and ethnicity. Madam Deputy Speaker, as per the guidelines, the criteria for appointment includes the following: (1) Educational requirement: The candidate must have completed Year 12 education or an equivalent qualification to ensure they can effectively read, write and provide support on all Government policies and services. (2) Professional and ethical standards: The candidate must uphold high professional and ethical standards reflected in their conduct. (3) Character and legal standing: The candidate must possess good character, be sober minded and maintain a clean police record for the past 10 years. However, Divisional Commissioners may recommend individuals based on their good character and extensive community work after rehabilitation period. (4) Medical fitness: The candidate must be medically fit and of sound health as certified by a medical doctor. (5) Preference is given to candidates under the age of 60 years. (6) Service record: The candidate must have a proven record of service and commitment to the district or at the community level supported by a resume and character reference from credible community figure. (7) Residency requirement: The candidate must be a permanent resident of the constituency they represent. They must have resided in the community for at least 12 months prior to the consideration. This must be confirmed with a letter from the District Officer. (8) Employment status: The candidate may hold other employment except for civil service positions. (9) Political neutrality: The candidate must be apolitical and not actively involved in party politics. (10) Financial Standing: The candidate must not be declared bankrupt. (11) Tax compliant: The candidate must be compliant with tax obligations. Madam Deputy Speaker, these are the criteria for appointments to District Advisory Councils. I just like to note that the Coalition Government does not agree with having Ministerial Vetting Committee to review recommendations that are submitted from the Divisional Commissioners Offices in its efforts to ensure that it appoints members that are apolitical. There are some discussions that will be going on after this. In answer to the question regarding the criteria, yes. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I just wanted to assure the honourable Minister that the change in the question was because of the protest from Members of the Business Committee who probably went beyond the guideline to appoint some. My question to the honourable Minister is, in 2022 during the Opening of Parliament, the Government made a commitment, and that was part of His Excellency’s Address that Government will hold elections for Municipal Councils, Sugar Cane Growers Council and the Advisory Councils as well. Is that still under consideration and will Government ensure that that is done? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, that is still part of the consideration. There is quite some work to do because of the constituency boundaries that we have to draw up. We believe the lines of the constituencies that we have at the moment are quite outdated and they do not</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1782</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th September, 2024 reflect the communities that are there at the moment. There is a lot of movement and in some places the representation that has been represented by the District Advisory Councillors does not represent the numbers of the communities that are there. We believe that there needs to be a thorough study done and that is what we are doing at the moment to make sure that the constituency boundaries for District Advisory Council is done properly before we go into the elections which we had promised. HON. P. K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what my good friend had just said is totally different on the ground. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Are yaar! HON. P. K. BALA.- God is watching! (Laughter) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do? HON. P. K. BALA.- Let us remember that. I want to make it very clear that all those Advisory Councillors that have been appointed are all political appointments. I can get a list, you will find most of them were the campaign managers of different political parties. That is alright, it all water under the bridge. (Laughter) Madam Deputy Speaker, my real concern is… DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Sir, I am sorry to interrupt, do you actually have a question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, the bell has just gone, please ask your question? HON. P. K. BALA.- The Councillors that have been appointed are not from that respective areas. They reside in different areas and it becomes very difficult for the community to reach out to their Advisory Councillors. Can I suggest to the honourable Minister if they can find someone from that respective area to serve the community in those districts? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the concerns raised by my honourable friend is duly noted and we will surely take it on board. Just before I take my seat, I just like to remind our honourable Members on the other side that when we came in, we inherited a situation that is not ideal. In one particular municipality which I will not name, there was a representative of a political party who was also Chair of the District Advisory Council over there. He was issued a Government mobile phone and had use of Government facilities as well. According to the civil servants over there, they were quite afraid for their jobs because some civil servants in the past, because of the reports of that particular District Advisory Councillor had lost their jobs. I will leave it at that and I believe what we want to do is rectify that, so that will never ever get back to that kind of situation again. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I am aware that there are a few honourable Members who are having a lunch appointment with the delegation from Japan and I would like to keep us on time.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>4 th September, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1783</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Assistance Through Dalo and Yaqona Farming Programmes (Question No. 182/2024) HON.
