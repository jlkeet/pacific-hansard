RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I hereby second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Are there any speakers on the motion? As no Member wishes to speak on the motion, I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to speak in reply. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief because the Bill has just been presented and I am sure the honourable Members of the Opposition will have more than enough time before we debate this Bill after next week. Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the intention of the Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) Bill 2004 is to increase the time for FRCS to detain a good, instead of disposing a good after 10 years and at the moment, it is administratively cumbersome. So, essentially, this amendment to the Bill is to – (a) (b) (c) improve on that; allow any outstanding tax debt or penalty to be offset by forfeited funds, except for water resource tax and airport departure tax, given their separate methodologies for collection; and allow the CEO to request for bulk information and reinstatement of penalty for evasion of debt. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, the intention here is to – (a) (b) improve the administration of the tax provision; the continued rate of export income deduction for tax year 2025;</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>998</p><h4>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024</h4><p>28 th June, 2024 (c) (d) (e) removal of the deduction for pandemic reserves; revision of evaluation amount for fringe benefit tax on motor vehicles; revision of rules for the payment of advanced taxes; and reversion of withholding tax as final tax. As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will explain more when we move the motion after the Budget debate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024, again, the Act is intended to be amended as follows: • • • Requires individuals importing goods for personal use to pay VAT, ensuring a fair application of VAT; Exempt items under concession code 201C from VAT; and Removes the requirement for the filing of tax returns on an annual basis, while returning the monthly or the quarterly filing framework to streamline VAT collection and aid business financial management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, the Customs (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, the intention here is to: • • • • refine the definition of concepts such as ‘produce’, ‘producer’ and ‘manufacturer’; allow local producers to receive the same kind of concessionary benefits as others; create fairness and level the playing field for the local producers and providing them with the same opportunities and advantages as others, fostering a more equitable economic environment; and allow FRCS to remove the time to pay arrangement for the payment of duty for yacht imports above $2 million to ensure uniformity and prompt revenue collection upon importation, and also increasing the penalty rates. The Customs Tariff (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, as I stated in the Budget, is to: • • • • • remove the 3 percent export duty on sugar. This was never applied, it is on the books so it is a very simple amendment. increase an excise duty on alcohol and tobacco, as pointed out. increase fiscal duty on ships, boats and floating structures. reduce fiscal duty on prefabricated buildings. exempt hospital beds from fiscal duty and VAT. There are individuals who are also importing hospital beds and we want to remove fiscal duty and VAT from that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, the intention here is to: • • provide for a longer duty accounting period for manufacturers of certain excisable products which were issued a licence on or after 1 st January, 2024; and to impose a fine for the late penalty of excise duty. On Airport Departure Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had pointed out, we are increasing the Departure Tax from $140 to $170 effective from 1 st August, 2024, and a subsequent increase from $170 to $200. So, to give effect to that provision, this airport Departure Tax amendment needs to be made.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>28 th June, 2024</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>999 Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, as I have stated already, the Act is amended to: • • • • • allow the members of the FNPF Board to change and, that is, to have an employer and a worker representative. allow children to become FNPF members from birth, instead of a certain age and this should be done through regulations. streamline a timeline for employers to submit remittances and statements to the FNPF Board. adjust the penalty for non-payment of employee contributions from $100 for the balance unpaid each month, to 10 percent of the balance of unpaid contributions for an employee each month. allow FNPF members to transfer as gifts some of their entitlements or all, to another FNPF member within the provisions. So, I will explain after next week, Sir, that there are good reasons for doing that and it will help a lot of people to plan how they are going to use their savings and retirement funds in a much better way. On Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, as I have pointed out, the changes we are making is to ensure that those who are bonded where the Government is spending a lot of money, that they are able to serve the country as well. If they do not, if they want to live for greener pastures to other countries, then obviously they are required to pay the bond and the penalty. The Government is spending a lot of money as you have heard already, the volume of funds that goes there and the number of people who actually benefit from the new scheme, and we want to make sure that the Government, taxpayers and the country also gets the benefit. So, to affect those provisions, this Bill is introduced. MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate, honourable Members. Since there is none, the floor is given to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his reply, if any.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have nothing more to add.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to:</span></p></body>
