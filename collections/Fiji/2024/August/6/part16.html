<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION 2020- 2023 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION 2020- 2023 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports, which was tabled on 12th July, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILEVASAU.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to present the overview of the Fiji Sugar Corporation’s 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports on 12th July, 2024. The Committee is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar Industry for submitting the responses to the tabled Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020-2023 Annual Reports. While reviewing the FSC Reports, the Committee noted that FSC is insolvent and, without any Government guarantee, the Corporation will be unable to continue its operation. The Committee noted the deplorable condition of the railway system during the site visits as the investment made on those tracks has contributed to the deterioration of road conditions, traffic congestion and increased transportation cost to the farmers whereby, trucks are left idle during yjr non-harvesting period, wasting valuable resources. The Committee noted that the sugar industry stakeholders are territorial and working in silos. There is lack of information sharing and coordination that directly impacts sugar production. The Standing Committee should be empowered to conduct an inquiry to scrutinise all key stakeholders of the sugar sector to pinpoint the root cause of the Corporation’s continuous operating in deficit. The Committee will propose remedial measures to improve the financial position of the Corporation with the aim of reducing its heavy reliance on Government guarantees. The FSC must prioritize the development and implementation of appropriate policies, strategies and plans to improve sector productivity and achieve set targets and outputs. It is crucial</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 1457 for FSC to ensure that these policies and plans are aligned with the current challenges faced by the Corporation. The Committee identified several factors contributing to the decline in sugar production. These included the lack of interest by farmers who perceive cane farming as unprofitable; inconsistent cane supply to the mills, resulting in under utilisation of the mill capacity; non-existence of KPIs, and non-renewal and absence of a strategic plan to forecast the Corporation’s future targets and outputs. The Committee strongly suggests that the Corporation develops the KPIs for all sugar-related sectors to ensure the economic viability of the sector. There is an urgent need to review the sugar sector, in particular, FSC to improve its performance through a more enhanced co-ordination, commitment and accountability of all stakeholders. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion, honourable Members, and I have a list of four speakers. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, before I talk on the motion, I would like to make an observation about what honourable Koroilavesau had said about the stakeholders and co- operation which was lacking amongst all the stakeholders of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC). When I came in as Minister, I did realise that these five different entities, their officers, staff and CEOs were not in talking terms. I could see that there was a pull between all these entities, so we had to bring them in and give them a bit of a lesson, “unless you do not come together, the industry will fall apart.” So, we had our stakeholders meeting, we had some conferences, and I can see that they are now trying to co-operate. One of the problems that we also found was that the FSC workers on the ground were not supporting the farmers. They would go around in their vans, have grog, have chicken curry and then will come back, unlike in the previous years, the Farm Advisors and Field Officers used to go out to farmers to teach and support them. Again, I have been warning the current FSC staff that if they are not working hard, if they are not doing their job, they must leave the industry. Another reason why our cane production has gone down is because the farmers are not replanting on time. In Fiji’s history, the decline has come down from 100 tonnes per hectare to about 47 tonnes per hectare whereas in other countries, cane production is static at around 100 tonnes per hectare. We need to get the farmers, we do not need big land, and we need the production to go up within that hectare. For that, we are trying to get the mechanisation system, give support to the farmers so that we can increase production, if not 100 tonnes, at least, 75 tonnes to 80 tonnes. Our farmers, in the traditional way, they are so proud to have a 50-acre farm but the cane is only grown in 10 acres. We are trying to tell them, “you do not need 50 acres, you are paying unnecessary premium for that. Go back and produce more cane within smaller farms but with a higher hectare.” On the railway system, you are right honourable Koroilavesau, even the honourable Prime Minister had messaged me the other day that the FSC should seriously look at bringing the railway system back. One of the decisions that was made by the previous CEO, Mr. Abdul Khan, he was trying to get the railway system out. If you remember, they brought in about a hundred trucks at that time. Now, the railway system is still operational in some parts of Fiji, but as you may have realised that in the Sigatoka area, there is no railway system because of the bridge that was damaged. The honourable Prime Minister and I had looked at the bridge. While the bridge is being built, we can</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1458 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 go up to Sigatoka and then transport cane from there. You must realise, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the cost of transporting sugarcane from Sigatoka, a farmer pays about $50 per tonne. In that way, farmers will not be encouraged to plant cane in the Sigatoka area if we do not have a railway system there. For that reason, honourable Koroilavesau, we have started talking to a company in India called RITES and they will be coming shortly to Fiji to look at all the railway systems which are not currently in operation so that they can assist us to re-install all those rails. On the re-organisation of the sugar industry, as I had mentioned yesterday, through the help of honourable Tubuna, we have two experts who are currently in Fiji from the Food and Agriculture Organization. They will give a comprehensive study of the sugar industry in totality. That is how we will come to know which direction we will take from thereon. As I have said yesterday, the report will be handed over to us by October. Once it comes in, then we will have a very clear picture. Of course, the sugar industry is here to stay, but how and which direction it will take, is something that we will decide after the report is given to us. Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the motion on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Sugar Corporation’s 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. It was from my intervention that I got FSC to present all these Annual Reports because if you see, in any business, you cannot have reports that are four years old. You must have report for every year so that you know what direction the company is heading. When we saw the final report of 2023, that was when we realised that FSC is in financial trouble. Madam Deputy Speaker, this Report, tabled as Parliamentary Paper No. 76 of 2024, provides a comprehensive overview of the Corporation’s performance for the past four years. It serves as an essential platform that offers insights into FSC’s financial status, operational achievements and areas that require improvements. First and foremost, I must express my appreciation for the dedication of FSC and its staff in compiling these detailed Annual Reports. Their tireless efforts have culminated in this Consolidated Review Report, which reflects the Corporation’s ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability. Despite the challenges and demands of the sugar industry, FSC has tried to operate within the constraints of its own resources - a testament of resilience and adaptability, despite many challenges ahead. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is crucial to address a significant challenge highlighted in the Report - the decline in cane quality. This issue has adversely affected the sugar production over the years, primarily due to increased volume of burnt cane, aging mills, infrastructure and impacts of climate change. The practice of burning cane cannot only compromise soil health and environment, but also escalates operational and processing costs. The Ministry, in collaboration with FSC, is actively working to educate farmers about the detrimental effects of this practice. The FSC Field Officers are regularly engaging with those across various sectors in partnership with the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji. It is crucial to provide farmer education, conduct trial plots, implement education programmes and enhanceimprovements. Madam Deputy Speaker, moreover, the Report emphasises the need to improve soil fertility to enhance sugarcane production. The FSC Field Officers are actively promoting the integrated nutrient management practices. After the long span of time, the grant programme has included application of lime to neutralise</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 1459 soil pH levels to prevent acidic soil in Fiji. This measure aims to improve fertilizer use efficiency, promote precision nutrient application based on soil testing, and enhance soil organic matters through mill mud and green manuring and test conservation. The FSC also faces challenges related to workforce in both, production and processing levels. To address this, the FSC has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Sugar Institute of India to conduct training and development for the workforce. Furthermore, we put in skilled expert trades people to strengthen its technical capabilities and excellence. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the FSC’s Annual Report which has not been entirely satisfactory. However, I have full confidence in the current Board led by Mr. Nitya Reddy. With those words, Madam Deputy Speaker, I, therefore, support this motion. HON. V. PILLAY.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address this august House and give my contribution to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Sugar Corporation 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. Madam Deputy Speaker, over the four years under review, the Committee noted a significant decline in cane production from 2020 to 2021, followed by a 16 percent increase from 2021 to 2022. Despite this improvement, cane production remains below the desired level of 2.5 million tonnes, and continues to show a declining trend, if no concrete action is taken. The Committee identified several factors contributing to the decline in sugar production. These include the: Inconsistent cane supply to the mill, resulting in underutilisation of mill capacity; (1) Lack of interest by the farmers who perceive cane farming as unprofitable. (2) (3) Decline in cane quality; (4) Non-existence of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); and (5) Non-renewal or absence of the Strategic Plans to forecast the Corporation’s future targets and outputs. Madam Deputy Speaker, this is further aggravated with various underpinning issues that need urgent attention, such as frequent mill breakdowns. Just last week, there were at least two breakdowns, and before that, many more. Mill breakdowns burden the farmers as their cost increases in terms of paying labourers for extra food and providing accommodation for extended harvesting, which was not planned by the farmers. When new harvesting season approaches, farmers are very optimistic that there will be minimum, or no breakdown. We all know that mill has an aging infrastructure, but offseason gives enough time to the management to fix all mechanical issues that cause frequent breakdown. This, to my understanding, is not happening. Madam Deputy Speaker, this is one area the FSC has always neglected. I strongly urge the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry to look into this maintenance aspect of the mill operation. Someone is not doing the job properly. I have seen truck drivers spending days at the mill area to deliver the cane, and I have seen trucks loaded and parked at home to be allowed to deliver.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1460 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report also highlighted that the decline of the cane quality has reduced sugar production over the years, primarily due to the increased volume of burnt canes. This not only negatively impacts soil health and the environment but also increases operational and processing costs, resulting in the loss of revenue. Also, over the years many properties have been destroyed due to cane burning. Neighbouring farms have been damaged, as well creating animosity amongst farmers in the harvesting gangs. I would like to thank National Fire Authority for providing the services in protecting properties during fire. Madam Deputy Speaker, when cane is burnt, the farmers are faced with additional burden to cart the cane to the mill in the allocated time, as once this surpasses, the farmers are charged a penalty. This, in the long run, is a direct loss of revenue to the farmers. The burnt cane penalty deducted should be refunded to the farmers. I urge the honourable Minister to provide incentives to farmers to harvest green cane throughout the season. In fact, the Ministry of Sugar Industry must create an awareness campaign for farmers to harvest green cane and give incentives, for example, an extra $5 per tonne, if farmers harvest green cane. This will, no doubt, boost farmers' confidence and create a healthy competition amongst cane harvesting gangs. The current arrangement with the Sugar Cane Growers Fund is not enough. Madam Deputy Speaker, there are still many gangs that carry their cane via the rail system and tractors cart the rail trucks to the rail pickup point. Since last year, the road levy tax for tractors has increased, and as a result, the tractor operators have increased their per tonne cartage of cane. Therefore, the farmers have to pay more to cart cane to the rail pickup point. Madam Deputy Speaker, these are trying and testing times for our sugar industry, and I would like to thank all the farmers who have made sacrifices to keep the industry up and running. I also would like to thank the Government for providing the much-needed funds to boost sugar production. However, there are many challenges that still need to be addressed. Perhaps, Madam Deputy Speaker, this august House could consider empowering the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to work on a comprehensive document that can address the issues in the sugar sector. This would involve talking and inspecting FSC and their mills, engaging with cane farmers, and consulting with all stakeholders to bring back to this House a viable solution to help revive the sugar sector. Furthermore, the Committee should focus on implementing sustainable farming practices to enhance cane quality and ensure the long- term viability of the industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, I fully support all recommendations made by the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members of Parliament; I rise to provide a brief contribution on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) from the year 2020-2023. Madam Deputy Speaker, as I was sitting here, I was watching the light up there flashing and I am always one for symbolism and it kind of suggested to me that a light bulb has gone out on that side of the House. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 1461 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, when we talk about sugar, we are talking about one of the elephants in the room when it comes to the Fijian economy. I was looking at a report by the same Committee before we had a change of Government, and when you looked at it, it did not have any critical thoughts around the sugar industry. None, a very weak report and no constructive criticism. Now, the criticisms from the other side, Madam Deputy Speaker, are very, very pointed and actually accurate. And I congratulate them for their tender and honesty now since the light has come on. I am reminded of the words of Albert Einstein. He says that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Madam Deputy Speaker, that is the summary of the sugar industry. We have been doing exactly the same thing and expecting or hoping or praying that we get a different result. Madam Deputy Speaker, when you look at the Fiji Sugar Corporation Report and I am just looking at the 2023 Financial Report, being a Chartered Accountant, you just look at it to get a measure of a business. So, I looked at the statistics, the 10 years statistical review on Page No. 66 of the Financial Report. Honourable Pillay said, “We have been trying to get the sugarcane crush up to 2.5 million tonnes per year.” For the last 10 years, we have never reached that tonnage.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> The last 20 years.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> There you go! Well, I have just got what I have here and I am talking from what is available. The net assets, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is the amount of assets the company has versus the liabilities. Generally, when you have more liabilities than assets, you know that you are in trouble. For the whole 10 years from 2014 to 2023, we have had negative net assets. So, to the point raised by the honourable Tubuna, we have been accepting an insolvent company for the last 10 years, or 20 years if you want to believe honourable Premila Kumar, without doing anything. Finally, just for the purpose of today’s discussion, I thought to read something, again, from Page No. 33, paragraph 2.1(a) – the basis of accounting which has growing concern. When this note, Madam Deputy Speaker, appears in audited accounts and the honourable Minister for Sugar will know this, you run for the yields. You actually run for the yields, and this is what it says, and I quote: “The financial statements have been prepared on a growing concern basis on the assumption that the Corporation will continue to receive ongoing support from the Fiji Government.” For argument’s sake, Madam Deputy Speaker, if the Fiji Government collapses today, there is a big problem with FSC. That is how serious this situation is. We cannot allow this to continue any longer. So, I would like to congratulate the honourable Tubuna that through discussions, he decided to reach out to FAO, and we are now preparing a report that will allow us to have a deep look at sugar and try and come up with something. This side of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker, we are motivated to try and fix the sugar industry, and I hope that we can work together with the other side of the House. They have so many good ideas, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is only a pity that they did not do anything in the last 16 years.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1462 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- So, this side of the House can work with that side of the House and solve the sugar issues. Madam Deputy Speaker, the other thing that is happening is that within FSC, I am aware that there is another review happening by a private sector entity. Again, they are just looking at FSC operators. So, between these two reports, I hope that we can get them completed before the end of the year, which you can certainly sit on this side of the House when it goes to Cabinet, we welcome the other side of the House with their ideas because this elephant in the room does not need politics. It needs bold, brave, courageous decisions so that we do not allow us to collapse if the sugar industry collapses. Madam Deputy Speaker, I fully support the findings of the Committee, we do accept that FSC is insolvent, it is in trouble, it needs to be fixed but I can assure the people of Fiji that we are going to fix it. I hope that the other of the House, given the experience they have had over the last 16 years, will come alongside and work with us so that we ensure that we can, as honourable Ravunawa put it, hand over a better industry to our children in the future. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Sugar Corporation’s 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. Firstly, I want to congratulate the Committee on their work in putting this Report together. I also want to appreciate the Committee for the report format, especially on how they came up with the findings and the corresponding recommendations, which makes this Report much easier to understand and is meaningful. Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to address great concerns regarding the sugar industry, especially the persistent issues plaguing FSC. Despite numerous discussions and reports over the years, as already been said by the colleagues from the other side and this side of Parliament, we grapple with the same challenges - declining sugar production; deteriorating soil fertility; inactive farmers; low sugar yield due to burnt cane; and poor cane quality. According to the latest FSC Report to the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, the cane production is stagnating significantly below the desired 2.5 million tonnes, with the troubling trend of declining. Mills that used to crush up to 1 million tonnes of cane per season, are currently processing only 0.5 million tonnes. This data, Madam Deputy Speaker, is not merely numbers, it represents a failing industry, struggling to meet its potentials, and more critically failing those who depend on it for their livelihoods. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have heard these issues articulated year after year. We know the problem, we understand the scope of the challenges, yet the question remains, where are the experts who should address these issues? Where and which strategies should be revisited and revised when they fail to deliver? Madam Deputy Speaker, in this day and age of strategic planning and industry advancements, it is incomprehensible that an industry of this magnitude does not have a robust strategic plan or key performance indicators to measure its performance internally, as stated in the Report’s findings in items 2.5 and 2.8. Madam Deputy Speaker, the situation with the FSC requires more than just financial</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 1463 investment. It demands a comprehensive multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder and multi-sectoral approach. Helping FSC will require an overhaul of the sugar industry. Looking at the roles and responsibilities of our stakeholders and their effectiveness in contributing to the work, of course FSC, in partnership with farmers, is the main driver of this industry. If FSC fails and farmers fail, there will be no sugar industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, we must recognise that money alone cannot resolve the decline in cane production. The Government must not keep pumping money into FSC without addressing the fractures in the sugar industry system. Government needs to address several critical areas with an integrated strategy, which include the following: (1) Increase cane production numbers, and incentives are needed to supply farmers in boosting cane production. This includes revitalising unproductive farming areas and encouraging greater farmer engagement. (2) Subsidise cane production costs. To make sugar farming viable, Government must find ways to reduce production costs. This could include financial subsidies or support mechanisms for farmers which I know is already happening but there is a need to take this to another level. (3) Improve cane quality – to improve sugar yields FSC must enhance the quality of cane. This will require research, development and implementation of best farming practices. (4) Enhance collaboration – issues within the Sugar Industry are not the sole responsibility of the Fiji Sugar Corporation. It is imperative that all stakeholders including Government agencies, research institutions, including experts, to work together and bring the industry up. (5) Trans-institutional and trans-sectoral approach is crucial in addressing the various factors impacting the industry’s viability. Madam Deputy Speaker, the sugar industry is a significant player in our economy and vital to the livelihood of approximately 3,000 workers and 200,000 individuals who depend on it. The situation demands urgent action and re-alignment of strategies, so it is time for a meaningful, impactful measures that go beyond the superficial. Negative implications of the sugar industry problem are huge and far-reaching. If this industry goes down, we can witness its impacts on other industries and sectors. The sugar industry operates within a web of inter-connected relationships and systems. We must work together to save FSC and save others and our national economy. To conclude, the challenge is substantial but not insurmountable. By fostering collaboration, revising strategies and focusing on Key Performance Indicators, we can revitalise the sugar industry and secure its future. Let us rise to this challenge and take the decisive steps to save an industry integral to our economy and the people. All those being said, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before the House.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1464 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 HON. S. TUBUNA.- I noted the various comments and suggestions that have been made and I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions. Of course, most of these inputs will be part of the report that we will be presenting to the FAO Review Team that is currently in the country. I wish to comment on one issue that has been raised by honourable Pillay on the mill. The team will also be looking at the right size of the mill that has to be established in this country. All the mills that we have are more than 100 years old and we need to get new ideas, integrated mills where you have mills that can produce sugar, ethanol and other products. So, that is the type of mills that we need and, of course, the team that will be in the country will be looking at all of these issues. There was also an issue on green sugar raised by honourable Pillay to promote the purchase of green sugar by FSC. As you are aware, there was a system that was established by the previous government, the Cane Quality Payment System. Perhaps, that was not the way forward as we had already spent $10 million in trying to establish that system but after a while, it was not adopted by FSC for one reason or the other. I think in the new system, we have to introduce a Cane Quality Payment System whereby those who are producing cane with the utmost quality are the ones that will have to be paid and those who are producing cane of poor quality, their payment will be based on the quality of the cane. I wish to thank honourable Members for their contributions, and I do support the motion before the House. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. I thank you all for your contributions and for your patience today. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. Vinaka saka vakalevu. The Parliament adjourned at 3.30 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37</p></body>
