<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Expansion of the Dental Care Programme (Question No. 113/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament whether the Government</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1431 has any plans to expand the Dental Care Programme under the Private Public Partnership Health Care Scheme to the Northern, Western and Eastern Divisions in this new financial year? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. The short answer, Sir, is that at the moment, there are no plans but let me just explain the Public Private Partnership (PPP) General Practitioners Scheme very briefly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a COVID-19 measure, and it was a sensible and right thing to do at that time because the hospitals were having difficulties with the availability of the services so the General Practitioners (GPs) were allowed to look after and see the patients and, of course, the Government was paying for those services. That Scheme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is still continuing. There are some Dental GPs who are providing those services in Suva. We, obviously, found out that once you start this kind of Scheme, then the expansion and the demand for it never ends and we also found, as the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services would tell you, that a lot of people who could go to the health centres and get the same kind of basic services were choosing to go to private GPs and the bill for Government kept increasing post-COVID-19. In the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we brought a means test and we said that all those people on social welfare schemes could continue with the GP Scheme, but those who can and should use public health facilities, particularly those around health centres, then they should. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an additional answer to the honourable Member’s question, that is something that we can look at but we have to have a good, proper, demand assessment. As I have said about Aspen, for example, in my Budget Speech, on the financial model, the demand assessment was never considered properly when that Scheme was started. So, the cost just kept escalating, the demand kept escalating, so people who could go to a health centre would end up at a public hospital, paid for by Government, when these services are also available in the health centres. So, that is a bit of a background with respect to the question asked by honourable Ravunawa. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to declare my interest before asking this question, as I am a Director of one of the private pharmacies under PPP in the Health Care Scheme. We have seen that when a patient goes to a hospital or health centre, he/she is given a prescription, he/she can come and get those medications that are provided for free from private pharmacies. But if a GP writes the prescription and that prescription is taken to a hospital or a health centre pharmacy, they are not given that medication. While the burden has actually shifted to the private pharmacies to keep this medication in pharmacies and previously, we used to get 45 cents per item but now we are getting somewhere close to around 20 percent per medication, which is not basically the cost recovered for our overhead in running a private pharmacy, why are public hospitals and health centres not keeping the medications that are provided under the Free Medical Scheme? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I know the question is directed to me, but the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services is here already. I am not aware of that happening but, perhaps, the honourable Minister can answer that very specifically, Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1432</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just elaborate on the question raised by honourable Maharaj, he knows the difference between the private pharmacy and the public pharmacy, that the private pharmacy will review its essential drug list and that essential drug list will then include some of the medications that are not currently available in the Government Pharmacy but are available in the private pharmacy. When that happens, then it will solve what the honourable Member is saying, that if a prescription is given by the private pharmacy, then they can also source it from the Government Pharmacy by using that programme on Free Medicine. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question. The honourable Member has asked about the PPP in the Eastern Division as well. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics has answered for the Western and Central Divisions. But knowing that we have the MV Cagivou - the former Prime Minister had a vision to have a vessel which is state-of-the-art, with a hospital itself inside the vessel, in the past 20 months, did the honourable Minister visit that Vessel and understand that this PPP Scheme can also be utilised in the Eastern Divion as well? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what the honourable Member is referring to, and I could not get was he was asking. But if he is asking whether these services are available in the public health facilities, of course, these services are available. Part of the problem, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to GP Scheme was that a lot of the patients who could go to the health centres and get basic services, treatment and medicine, were choosing to go to this GP Scheme and this is what I was saying. That was a COVID measure, and it continued and expanded, and the demand was never ending, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, in the last Budget, we took a good decision to say, “Alright, we will have a means test. We will look at those who deserve to get those kind of services paid for by Government”. We have done that, and I think it is working well. But with respect to dental services, apart from the Central Division, we do not have this in other Divisions and as the honourable Member has quite rightly said, whether the Government has plans to do that or not, we will consider that, we will look at the demand, we will look at the cost, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and then we will make the decision. Thank you. HON. V. LAL.- A supplementary question, Sir. What we have noticed is that when patients go to those GPs that are under the Scheme, when those GPs prescribe medicine, they ask their patients to go to some of their own pharmacies, rather than going to the health centres and hospitals. What can be done about that because the patients go to these doctors, and they have their own friend pharmacists? Instead of getting free medicine from hospitals and health centres, these patients are referred to certain pharmacies. Are we educating the patients about this, Sir? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have indicated a very serious situation where you are saying that some of the doctors are referring them to their own pharmacies?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. LAL.:</span> Yes, they do, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Do you have evidence of that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. LAL.:</span> I can provide evidence, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, you can provide that because I am not too keen to allow that question to continue because you are basing it on some wild allegations, et cetera. We need to be very careful. Yes, he is a private practitioner….</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1433 HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Sir, just for clarification, I think what the honourable Member is saying now is that a general rule applies where a prescriber should not be a dispenser. Ever since there was a law passed that hospitals can operate their own pharmacies, what we have seen is that there can be a compromise in a patient’s treatment if, for example, a particular medication is not available. And if I am a prescriber and I am a dispenser, having an interest in that, I can prescribe whatever is available in my pharmacy. It does not necessarily mean that I will send them to my pharmacy, but I will prescribe what is available in my pharmacy so that it is convenient to get a prescription from me and get dispensed from the pharmacy that is owned by me. So, that is something that we need to look at into future because we cannot compromise the health of the patients, whether the prescriber should be allowed to also own a pharmacy, so he or she becomes a prescriber and a dispenser at the same time. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Maharaj, you have declared your interest already, and I can see where you are coming from. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am glad that honourable Maharaj brought that issue up, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When they were in Government and we were on the other side, we opposed that Bill. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- We actually said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that that was not a good Bill and it was done to benefit certain people. I am very happy that honourable Maharaj now agrees, and we should look at that. He is right, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Just to add, in the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we added an additional item to the 21 zero- rated items - prescribed medicine. So, if you get a prescription from your doctor, you go to a pharmacy, you do not pay 15 percent VAT on it. So, the prescribed medicine is now VAT free. JICA’s Grant Funding for Fiji Airports (Question No. 114/2024) HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the Grant Funding from the Japan International Cooperation Agency for Fiji Airports? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tuiwailevu for his question which is a very useful question because it brings the Government to answer and to let it be known in the House and to the people of Fiji what this development partner had been doing with Fiji and for Fiji. Like many of our development partners, the Government of Japan have been a very reliable partner for Fiji over many decades and we welcome the constructive approach that Japan brings to its relationships, not only with Fiji but with the region in general, and their contribution towards Fiji’s economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with Government’s approach to triumph economic growth in our foreign policy prosperity pillar, priority will always be given towards the progression and expansion of key enablers, such as airport infrastructure upgrades to enhance connectivity, travel and to improve</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1434</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 competitiveness and trade. The role of Fiji Airports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to convey my sincere appreciation to the Government of Japan and its funding agency, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for providing support to Fiji Airports through a $15 million grant for the improvement of aviation safety facilities at major airports in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports plays a fundamental role in the progress of Fiji’s economy as it manages the airport operations, oversees the air space and undertakes the transits of goods and services that are significant to Fiji’s market. Fiji Airports and JICA: The initial discussions between Fiji Airports and JICA commenced in 2013 under the FijiFirst Government but was halted because of the global pandemic. It recommenced in 2022 and continued in 2023 when JICA officially dispatched a preparatory survey team to Fiji Airports for discussions and explanations on the Draft Preparatory Report. That culminated in the endorsement of the report by the relevant officials on 17th January, 2024. Agreement and Due Diligence: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the JICA grant assistance is focused on improving safety at the airports and the procurement of hi-tech aircraft surveillance systems and equipment to enhance Fiji’s capabilities and capacity in that face. As per the grant agreement, JICA committed to the following areas: (1) procurement and installation of aircraft surveillance systems at the Nadi International Airport and Labasa Airport; (2) procurement and delivery of five fire trucks for Nausori, Labasa, Savusavu and Matei Airports; (3) procurement and delivery of three rescue boats for Nadi International Airport; and (4) provision of consultancy services for improving aviation safety. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the grant documentation received from JICA consists of the Grant Agreement and the Exchange of Notes between the Government of Fiji and the Government of Japan. This has undergone the appropriate due diligence and screened through the relevant agencies including the Office of the Solicitor-General. Cabinet was also consulted and have appreciatively acknowledged the grants support by JICA, including the conveyance of the official endorsement towards the grant documentation on 15th July, 2024. The official ceremony for the endorsement of the grant documentation is expected to eventuate in the coming days and will be attended by representatives from JICA, the Embassy of the Government of Japan and Fiji Airports, and further discussions on that were done during my visit to Japan for 10th Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM10). Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to this support, Government has recently signed a cooperation agreement (it was done while I was in Japan) with the Government of Japan purposed to help improve our national disaster preparedness and response capacity. Through this partnership, the Government of Fiji will explore the use of an advanced satellite positioning system to improve its early warning capabilities particularly in relation to tsunami risks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, increasing our access to satellite data and cutting-edge remote sensing technology is vital for our society and well-being, and we further welcome this cooperation with the Government of Japan. That was also signed while I was at PALM10. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by these areas of collaboration, our enduring relationship with Japan is marked by increasing engagement across the various critical sectors and issues, and I take this opportunity to thank the Government, the people of Japan and JICA for their support and</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1435 partnership. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Prime Minister, just a quick question with respect to the aircraft surveillance system. Is this an upgrade or complete overall that will be procured and purchased with respect to the aircraft surveillance system? Does it entail training of our air traffic controllers? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not overhaul or overall, it is just the continuation, upgrading of the facilities we already have. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Sir, my question to the honourable Prime Minister is related to passenger experiences. When people travel out of Labasa, there are no security checks done, but when people are entering Labasa through aircraft, there are all kinds of security checks done at Nadi and Nausori. The aid that Fiji will be receiving, will that also include security checks? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been told that it is the World Bank project and I had also noticed that and I mentioned it to the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation that we needed to upgrade those security aspects of operations also. MR. SPEAKER.- Especially from Labasa, Savusavu and Taveuni, cause you never know, drugs might be coming there too. You do not have sniffer dogs as well. Renovation of Public Toilet Facilities (Question No. 115/2024) HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament if the Government has any plans to renovate and improve the state of the public toilet facilities in all towns and cities? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for this very important question. The Coalition Government recognises the essential role that public toilet facilities play in all our urban centres. They are not only vital for public health and sanitation, but also contribute to overall image and functionality of our towns and cities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the responsibility for maintaining and upgrading these facilities falls primarily on all the municipal councils of all the 13 municipalities. The Government is committed to supporting these councils through various initiatives. Firstly, we are provided capital grants specifically earmarked for the construction of new public conveniences and the renovation of existing ones. These grants aim to ensure that public toilets are clean, safe, accessible and environmentally friendly. I am also pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also seen some changes and tangible results in some of the municipalities. For instance, in Sigatoka Town, because they have got some issues with the current public convenience, as well as planning to construct a new facility with the construction costing around $75,000. Similarly with other small municipal councils, Suva City as well as Lautoka, there were also plans in place to upgrade and renovate some of these public conveniences. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, like all other 12 municipalities, there are also renovation plans for their public conveniences</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1436</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 within this financial year. This renovation include tiling, painting, replacement of current as well as old toilet seats, cisterns and essential electoral and plant works. For this new financial year 2024-2025, many councils have strategically planned to complete these renovations in the first and second quarters ensuring that facilities are in optimal condition during peak usage periods such as local festivals and carnivals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while large councils are better equipped to undertake comprehensive renovations, smaller councils face constraints due to limited funding. However, these councils are prioritising essential repairs and maintenance to keep facilities operational. Most of these small municipalities have caretakers in place to open as well as close these facilities on a daily basis. When there is a need to repair, they have an internal board, and also have plans in place to upgrade or maintain these facilities. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also encourage community engagement in the renovation process, public input on the design and features for renovated conveniences which can lead to more user friendly and appreciated facilities. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the planned renovations and improvement to all our public conveniences and facilities across municipalities demonstrates the Coalition Government’s commitment to enhancing urban infrastructure and public health. These initiatives are part of our broader strategy to improve the quality of life for all Fijians, and also promote sustainable urban development. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, supplementary question to the honourable Minister, bringing the subject closer to Suva City, there are three public facilities or toilets that supports the capital. Only three from the market to Terry Walk and one at the Botanical Garden. The one at Sukuna Park is closed at the moment. All these facilities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are dirty, unhygienic and unsafe. May I ask the honourable Minister if close attention or he could expedite to build these facilities fit or good for public use and above all they could build forward. Redirect their prioritisation of the work here in Suva to improving this basic, essential facility. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member again for raising this, I think it is a very pertinent issue right now. I just alluded to earlier. For this financial year, the Suva City Council should be upgrading some of the other facilities that were mentioned. We are hopeful that we also maintain and upgrade the facility to a standard that is user-friendly and also improve the sanitation as it is communally used by the public and those who visit Suva City. The councils are committed, and we are looking forward to more improvements in this financial year. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, in the last parliament sitting a friend of mine sent in pictures of used syringes in the urinal area in one of the public conveniences. With the upgrade plans outlined by the honourable Minister, what security measures are in place or will be implemented to guarantee public safety?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, ….</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Let me cut it short for you:</span> You indicated that the grants are there and everything, it is just the proper upkeep of this, so we do not get the smells. We were talking about Sukuna Park yesterday, that is the very thing that is happening in Sukuna Park. We find strangers there, plastic bags for drugs scattered all over the place. It is the smell as well, honourable Minister, sometimes it chases you when you want to visit those conveniences, especially in Labasa and other municipalities. I do not know whether it should do with toilet manners, et cetera, otherwise it is just</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1437 too late and it is just upon us now with your grant to hire someone to keep cleaning the facilities. This happens in the boats as well. I spoke to the captains and told them, “Clean these toilets, these are public toilets and it should not be like this.” So, that is all we want to have that address from you, Sir. How can you best give us advice on that? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very common issue right now in our country comes down to the responsibility of the users of our public conveniences. In some of our municipalities, we have officers who are stationed as caretakers to look after these public facilities. Some are on a user-pay basis, you pay then you use the convenience. Like for Sukuna Park, there will be a security day and night to look after the whole place and also take care of the public convenience. That is something that the Council will take on board to ensure that all public facilities and convenience are safe and also have a proper adequate securities to look after these areas. HON. P. D KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that the boundaries are extended and it is included in towns and cities, my question to the honourable Minister, the honourable Minister just mentioned that the Government grants are given to build toilets. My question to the honourable Minister, can he explain to us, how much grant is given this year and which area these toilets will be built? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the figure right now. I can assure the House that we have the funds and we are also working with the councils especially the medium and small-size ones on the upgrading of their facilities. Like I said, for Sigatoka Town, there is a grant of $75,000 will be utilised to construct a new public convenience as well as the other municipalities around the country. MR. SPEAKER.- Government grants have been provided, that is the message from the honourable Minister, but where is directed to is a matter for him to go back and check the books, it is not off hand.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this is a serious issue.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Everything is serious:</span> (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Look at him:</span></p><p>(Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot be building toilets in and out of cities or everywhere. But there is some degree of responsibility to the shop owners, and by law, shop owners must provide those facilities. But most of the time you will see on the door, it is written, ‘not in use’. So, I ask the honourable Minister if the authorities can look into this? MR. SPEAKER.- That is a general question. I understand you will want to know which shop has a notice on its toilet, but it is up to you, honourable Minister, if you would like to answer that question. As he has stated, it is a serious question. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just wondering why the honourable Member is raising this issue now, when it should have been raised during his term. I am going to work on that, and I have just said, I think that is also a good idea. We will also request the shop owners and supermarkets to assist in this area.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1438</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have just received word that the Madam President of the Republic of India has left the Government House and she is on her way down to Parliament. As such and as alluded to in my earlier communication, the Standing Orders and Sitting will now be suspended, so as to allow Her Excellency the President of India to address Parliament today. In that respect, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to proceed to the Foyer to receive Her Excellency the President of India. [Leader of the Government in Parliament left the Chambers to greet and escort Her Excellency the President of India into the Chambers] Honourable Members, as part of this programme of welcoming Her Excellency the President, that is, upon entering the Parliament Chambers, all honourable Members will be upstanding to receive the President. The Leader of the Government in Parliament will escort Her Excellency into the Parliament Chambers and the order will be, the Leader of the Government in Parliament, then Her Excellency the President of India, and then the ADC. The Leader of the Government in Parliament will stand next to honourable Vosarogo and await Her Excellency to continue on the right to join the Speaker on the left side of the Speaker’s table. Her Excellency bows to both sides of Parliament, and then I will call out for the resumption of seats. ‘You may take your seats again’, when I do call that out. That is the process that we have in place, and I hope we just have to follow these steps to make the entrance more interesting and enlightening. Whilst I am saying that, I extend our welcome once more to the distinguished guests in the public gallery - the members of the Diplomatic Corp who are here, the Chairman of the GCC, the Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs, the Permanent Secretary of Health, our friends from Tamavua near Madam Seeto, and maybe our friends from the great Government of India, who have just joined us this morning. We welcome you, and we hope you will make this visit a memorable one, by giving all our best and how we listen tentatively to the message that Her Excellency the President will be sharing with us. Honourable Members and distinguished guests, may I request that we be upstanding to receive Her Excellency the President of India. [Her Excellency the President of India escorted into the Chamber by the Leader of the Government in Parliament] Honourable Members, we are, indeed, honoured and privileged today to welcome Her Excellency the President of the Republic of India, Shreemati Droupadi Murmu, to the Parliament of Fiji. Welcome Your Excellency! On behalf of the honourable Members, I welcome you to the Fijian Parliament, and also to Fiji for that matter. We look forward to your address to us this morning and anticipate renewed and stronger relations between our two Governments and Parliaments. I hope that you will fully enjoy your short visit to Fiji, Madam. Honourable Members, I now invite Her Excellency the President of India, Shreemati</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Address by HE the President of India 1439 Droupadi Murmu, to deliver her Address.</p></body>
