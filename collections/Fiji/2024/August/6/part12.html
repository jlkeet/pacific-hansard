<body><h3>ADDRESS BY HER EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA</h3><h4>ADDRESS BY HER EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA</h4><p>Honourable Speaker, Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu; the honourable Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka; the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Inia Seruiratu; honourable Members of Parliament; honourable Ministers; my dear friends; Namaskar, Ni sa bula. It is my great honour to meet you all, the elected representatives of Fiji, in this temple of democracy. I bring to you the greetings of 1.4 billion of your brothers and sisters in the largest democracy of the world, India. I thank the honourable Speaker for giving me this opportunity. This is a reflection of the close relations between our two countries. I am deeply honoured by the conferment of the Companion of the Order of Fiji this morning by His Excellency the President of Fiji. This honour is a reflection of the deep ties of friendship between our two countries. I also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency the President of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, on whose kind invitation, I arrived yesterday on my first visit to Fiji. I also have, along with me, our Minister of State, Shri George Kurian, as well as two Parliamentarians from our Lok Sabha, Shri Saumitra Khan and Shri Jugal Kishore. I would like to express my deep appreciation for the strong democratic ethos in Fiji. Each one of you has a very solemn responsibility of serving the people of this beautiful country. Despite the vast difference in our size, both our countries have much in common, including our vibrant democracies. Almost 10 years ago, speaking in this same hall, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, had underlined some basic values that unite India and Fiji. These includes, “our democracy, the diversity of our societies, our creed that all human beings are equal and our commitment to the liberty, dignity and rights of every individual”. These shared values are eternal and shall continue to guide us ahead. I am glad to note that India has been closely associated with your democratic journey, over the last three parliamentary elections in Fiji. As a close friend and partner with rich experience of fostering democracy at the grassroots level, India stands ready to partner at all times. Honourable Members of Parliament, in my short time here, I can see that the rest of the world has so much to learn from Fiji. The gentle Fijian way of life, the deep-rooted respect for traditions and customs, an open and multicultural environment, makes Fiji so special in an increasingly conflict-ridden world. No wonder, Fiji is the place where the rest of the world come to find its happiness. Fiji today is recognized around the world for its growing contribution to our common efforts, focussed on two major global challenges - climate change and addressing human conflicts. Whether it is shaping the global dialogue on climate change or voicing the concerns of the Ocean-States, Fiji has been contributing immensely to the global good. India greatly values and applauds the increasingly prominent role played by Fiji around the world. You have also made major contributions to global peacekeeping efforts in some of the most dangerous conflict areas around the world. We salute Fiji’s contribution in making the world a better place to live.</p><p>1440 Address by HE the President of India 6 th August, 2024 In the field of sports, while we may have been recently crowned the T-20 World Champions in Cricket, I must say India has a lot to learn from Fiji in rugby. We are very happy that one of your legendary players, Waisale Serevi, is India’s new National Rugby Coach. I do look forward to the day when our two teams will play each other. I take this opportunity to also convey our heartiest congratulations to the Fiji Men’s Rugby Team for their wonderful Silver Medal performance in the Paris Olympics. Mananye sansad sadasye gan, 145 barso se adhik samay purva, nyati ne hamari dono desho ko ek saath joda jo girmitiyas, paheli baar Bharat se Fiji dvip ke taor par pahunche the. (I think you understand Hindi). Jitne bhi unka yaha … jeevan khatro aur kathinaiyo se bhara tha, ye jankar khushi hoti hai ki kaese girmitiya aur unko vanshajo ko is desh ne apnaya hai. Badle mein uhnone apni kadi mehnat aur parishram se apne naye matra-bhumi ke nirmaan men vyapak ypo daan diya. Main Fiji sarkar ko Girmitiya Diwas karyekramo ke dvara, rashtriye nirmaan ke prayasak ke liye girmit vanshaj ke apaar yog daan ko prakash mein lane ke liye dhanyevaad deti hoon. 1970s (unnis sau sattar) ke baad is dashak mein hamare dono desho ne milkar ek adhunik aur bahumulye sanjhedhari taiyaar karne ka prayas kiya hai. Mujhe ye jaankar prashanta ho rahi hai ki aaj hamare saubhagyeta rashtriye nirmaan ke sabhi pramukh shetro mein, chahe wo sugarcane ho ya space. Speaking of Space, I would like to particularly thank the Fijian government for its assistance towards Aditya-L1 Mission, to place the first Space-based solar observatory last year. Your support in hosting the Temporary Telemetry Tracking and Command Centre in Suva for the historic Mission is greatly appreciated. Our co-operation in agriculture, capacity building, climate change, clean energy, digital partnership, education, healthcare, manufacturing, research, renewable energy and the SME sector, continues to grow from strength to strength. Despite the physical distance between us, we have always had a close bond. No wonder, in times of need, we have been among the first to respond. I am glad to note that the COVID-19 vaccines provided by India in 2021 under the Vaccine Maitri initiative played a key role in Fiji’s successful National Vaccination Programme. As we celebrate the 75 years of India’s diplomatic presence in Fiji, I am pleased to see the strong growth in our high level engagements, development projects and our people-centric activities. I am told that in the last 18 months alone, 15 Ministerial level visits have taken place on both the sides. The historic meeting of both our Prime Ministers in May 2023, during the FIPIC-III Summit has given new energy and direction to our bilateral ties. I am confident that the newly announced projects, including the Super Speciality Cardiology Hospital to be established in Suva, would help to meet the priority needs of the people of Fiji and the wider Pacific region. Our joint hosting of the highly successful 12th World Hindi Conference last year in Nadi and the high level participation in the Girmit Day National Celebrations, have further helped strengthen the strong bond between our two nations. Honourable Members of Parliament, we are also conscious of the many serious challenges common to us. The foremost one being the fight against climate change and rise in sea level, which is a threat to many Ocean States.</p><p>6 th August, 2024 Address by HE the President of India 1441 As a large developing country, frequently exposed to the uncertainties of nature, India also knows very well the deep impact of climate change. That is why we are committed to doing our best as a responsible member of the world. Under our G20 Presidency last year, we have high priority to the two topics of sustainable development and climate change. We made, “One Earth, One Family, One Future”, the theme of our G20 Presidency. India has considerably reduced its emission intensity and has also achieved 40 percent of installed electric capacity through non-fossil fuel sources. Between 2017 and 2023, India has added around 100 gigawatts of installed electric capacity of which, around 80 percent is from non-fossil fuel-based resources. In addition to these domestic steps, India has also taken the lead on a number of international platforms for climate action. We sincerely appreciate Fiji for its enthusiastic support to many of these initiatives, including International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS). We hope Fiji will soon formally join the Global Biofuel Alliance as well. As a powerful voice of the Global South, India will keep pushing the developed countries for both, climate finance and climate technology. We will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Fiji and other Ocean States for climate justice. Honourable Members of Parliament, as India emerges strongly on the global stage, we stand ready to partner with Fiji, according to your priorities, to build a stronger, resilient, and more prosperous nation. Let us come together to unlock the full potential in our partnership for the mutual benefit of people of both our beloved countries. Thank you, dhanyavaad, vinaka vakalevu. (Acclamation) MR. SPEAKER.- Your Excellency the President of India, Shri Mati Droupadi Murmu, thank you for your most insightful Address to the Parliament of Fiji. Your visit today has, indeed, reminded us of the history that binds us, as well as our common goal to prosper our nations through respecting the democratic process. I would also like to express my gratitude to the Government of India for its commitment to constructing the 100-bed super speciality hospital that you have just alluded to. This facility will not only benefit us, as you have indicated Madam, but also the entire Pacific region. Additionally, we are grateful to India for being one of the first countries to provide us with vaccines during the COVID- 19 pandemic. This support was critical for the re-opening of Fiji after the pandemic. Madam, we wish you well in the remainder of your visit in Fiji. Vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now suspend proceedings for an official photo session with Her Excellency the President of India at the Parliamentary entrance. [Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament escorts Her Excellency the President of India out of the Parliament Chambers] The House is in suspension now. May I ask that we give a bit more time to the Secretariat staff to prepare for the photoshoot at the Parliamentary entrance by placing seven chairs in the front, and hopefully, all of us will be upstanding on the side. The Parliament adjourned at 11.46 a.m.</p><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1442 The Parliament resumed at 12.26 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure to raise his question, may I seek your forbearance, honourable Members, as I shall be asking the honourable Deputy Speaker to preside over this session till the end of the day since I have an appointment with some doctors. I hope you will bear with me on that, honourable Members.</p></body>
