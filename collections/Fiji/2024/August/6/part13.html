<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p>Development of Medical Tourism (Question No. 116/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the progress made in the development of Medical Tourism? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vakalalabure for the question, which is an important one. Medical tourism is essential when people travel to another country to receive medical care. This market has expanded rapidly over the years for many reasons, such as cost effectiveness, where it is cheaper abroad, some treatments are not available locally, waiting time for surgery and the quality of care. A number of countries are leading in this area and a good example is India where our own people from Fiji and the Pacific travel yearly for treatment, and this is really supplementary revenue for India as a destination. Mr. Speaker, Sir, medical tourism is much more than hospitals and doctors, you are looking at complementing niches, such as health and wellness, where people cross borders for spa, yoga camps and mindfulness retreats. For medical tourism to work in Fiji and to be a premium medical tourism hub, we need to get the health infrastructure right for the benefit of not just tourists, but our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2022, we had an estimate of 2 percent of visitors taking part in some form of health and medical activity. In 2023, we had a slight increase to 2.6 percent. In the 2024-2025 National Budget, the Government is investing $540 million in the health sector, around $450 million to the Ministry of Health and $90 million for the Ba and Lautoka Hospitals under Public Private Partnership. Mr. Speaker, Sir, investments are being made to enhance our healthcare infrastructure. For example, the Indian Government is supporting the construction of a super speciality hospital in Nasinu, focussing on cardiac and kidney care, as Her Excellency the President of India had alluded to this morning. The CWM Hospital is also undergoing major upgrades with the Australian Government funding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are building robust partnerships with esteemed medical institutions and universities worldwide. A prime example is Pacific Specialist Healthcare (PSH), which exemplifies our commitment to excellence in specialised medical care, and I had the pleasure of visiting the facility a few weeks ago. It is situated right across from the airport and is already adding to its facilities and will soon open an annex, almost doubling its size. Sir, PSH is leading the way in providing state of the art facilities in advanced treatments, helping position Fiji as a centre of medical expertise.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1443 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government also has in place incentives to encourage investments in private hospitals. We are looking at investment allowance for capital expenditure in building, renovating or expanding a private hospital. Under the medical investment package, there are concessions and duty-free entry of certain capital equipment, plant and machinery. This is part of our broader efforts to drive private sector investments in healthcare. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at last year’s Fiji Tourism Convention, we discussed the possibility of convening a medical tourism dialogue to explore where we are, where we want to get you and where the gaps are. This is something we will work towards. Our marketing campaign will highlight Fiji as a premier, safe and an advanced healthcare destination. This market holds great potential because it really is a year-round activity. If properly managed, it can be linked to other products such as cultural tourism. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we have made progress on the medical tourism front, there is still much to be done. We are committed to delivering a comprehensive strategy for becoming a leading regional hub in medical tourism. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. Honourable Minister, will we be looking at different sorts of accreditation that needs to be done if we are going to truly benefit out of the medical tourism? Together with ensuring that apart from just medical tourism, we are also looking at wellness tourism where we know that worldwide, it is actually a billion-dollar industry. So, there is issues of accreditation and there are pitfalls and dangers that exist when we start doing medical tourism and the necessary laws also that need to be done to ensure that there is proper protection. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, our standards are quite at levels that are consistent with what is observed in other countries, so accreditation is not a major issue. We know that we subscribe to standards that are observed in our part of the world and we are quite comfortable with that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge everyone to take the time to visit PSH in Nadi, right across from the airport. The quality of the service there is world class. That is an indication of what we have today, and the beauty about it is the people there are mostly locals. I was quite impressed with the medical staff in there, they are mostly locals but carrying out care that is world class. You really have to go and see what is on offer. It is something to be proud of, and as I have said in my address, they are already building an annex, doubling its size. In terms of wellness, Mr. Speaker, most operations in Fiji and most hotels now have their own spa and the likes, and these are, again, market driven - standards that are observed worldwide. Even going forward, a major resort is going to be opened in Namuka, between Shangri-La and Natadola, that will also have some cosmetic surgery, Mr. Speaker. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst talking about medical tourism, I agree with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, I did visit Pacific Specialist Healthcare (PSH) in Nadi which is worldclass, and I also visited Nadi Hospital which is, at the moment, pathetic in nature and the service delivery there is more than pathetic. Recently, we had a case whereby a young lady died because of negligence. She was not transferred to Lautoka Hospital on time, and her parents are still crying for justice to prevail and have an investigation into that case.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1444</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, while on one side, we have a private hospital which is of worldclass, on the other side, we have a public hospital which is really pathetic. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister would also remember that during his time, he had also commented about the service delivery at Nadi Hospital. Unfortunately, it remained the same. Doctors have come and gone, nurses have come and gone, staff have come and gone, but for some reason, service delivery at Nadi Hospital is not improving. If we are looking at medical tourism, there seems to be some core problem that we need to identify and improve on, in order to give a worldclass service at Nadi Hospital. At the moment, I think the Board of Visitors that is managing Nadi Hospital, I stand to be corrected, I think there is some disconnect between the Management and staff. That is why the service is not delivered as per the expectation of either the last Government or the current Government, but patients are suffering. If the honourable Minister can assure that they can look into that before actually going into medical tourism. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is quite an important observation because we cannot uplift the standard only for tourism, we need to see the uplifting of standards across the community. A huge market segment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are the baby boomers, people, kind of, my generation. They have retired, they have quite a lot of disposable income, but they only travel to areas where they are assured of medical care. This is where the challenge is for Fiji, and the uplifting of medical tourism will also need the uplifting of what is available to our people. So, the example of CWM Hospital is quite remarkable, very encouraging, and with the assistance from the Australian Government, it will upgrade CWM Hospital to a standard consistent with what is observed overseas. On Nadi, in particular, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did mention my experience there. Last week, I went to welcome the Guru from India at Prince Charles Park and I went to Nadi Hospital as I wanted to use the washroom. I could not use it, but I shared it with the honourable Minister, and efforts are being made to improve those areas. One of the drives now that we will be sharing with you is just to get the basics right. And I shared with him, like I am also a hotelier. People come to my hotel everyday, bathrooms need to work, electricity needs to be there, air conditioning, plumbing, so I have suggested to him that there must be a maintenance team in every hospital in Fiji. So, that is where we are going, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to get the basics right. If a door breaks, fix it. There is a carpenter there to do it. Plumbing is a problem, so there is a plumber there to fix it, like in a hotel. So, likewise, we would all need to see our hospitals. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, as I said earlier, medical tourism is actually a billion dollar industry. One of the most lucrative parts of medical tourism is cosmetic surgery. This is one of the reasons why I asked about accreditation, et cetera. Will you be looking at ensuring that the honourable Minister of Finance provides the necessary incentives for the private sector to set up such hospital, because there is interest? This is great for Fiji because it takes us to another level. So, will you be looking at making sure that there are incentives provided for those from the private sector who may need to? Again, when you start doing these things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the necessary legislation needs to be put in place so that we do not foul of any laws, et cetera, in reconstructive surgery that goes on. It is a great place to come, get a nose job, enjoy the sun and then go back home, and there are people interested in actually getting that done. Will the honourable Minister be looking at probably doing a comprehensive survey as to what is needed and what is not from within, and also the incentivisation</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1445 that is required to get these people to come and open up these particular surgeries? There are many different facets to medical tourism. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have indicated in my speech, there is a lot of concessions to anyone investing in tourism. In actual fact, the IMF says that Fiji provides the most concession in any country towards the development of tourism. Similarly, those concessions are also extended to those who want to invest in medical tourism. As I have said, there is a five-star or six-star resort that will be opening in the Coral Coast and they are looking at cosmetic. This is an Australian-based operation, so it will be based on Australian standards. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we have seen, for instance, in the development of the Aspen Hospital, it provides services at a cost for people coming from offshore, but for our own population who earn lower income, they will be provided with services free. For the agencies that we have coming across and establishing facilities, is Government thinking of some system where own local population who might not have access to those kind of specialist services they provide, that Government will consider a mean-tested approach for locals who cannot go anywhere else for that kind of service, to utilise from these facilities and have them assisted or subsidised? Is there any notion of doing that for this kind of facilities? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with Pacific Specialist Healthcare (PSH) as an example, they structure their rates, and it actually has a payment plan for locals. So, all that they have there, Mr. Speaker, is available to locals also rates that we can afford. But that will be important as we move forward, that we consider the local population in terms of affordability for these highly specialised services. Allocation Utilisation - iTaukei Land Development (Question No. 117/2024) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the utilisation of the $4 million allocation for the iTaukei Land Development in the 2023-2024 Budget? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. In regard to the iTaukei Land Development grant, I also thank the previous Government for introducing this programme, which was to develop the people and grow the economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project is in two phases. The first one is on the documentation which is scoping and engineering documentation. The second phase is on the construction, which deals with land clearing, levelling, subdividing the lots and put in essential services - electricity, water and roads. As we took over the project last year, three projects were still in phase one, that is, on the scoping and engineering documentation. Seven projects out of the ten that was approved in 2015, so three in phase one and seven in phase two. The one which is under construction when we took over, three have been completed, one is on hold and three are ongoing. The three that have been completed are in Nasoqela, Tailevu, Vuda in Lautoka and Yadua in Nadroga. The project that is on hold is the Vuda II in Lautoka, which was</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1446</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 done by General Machinery Hire. The three that are ongoing are Wairabetia in Vuda done by B. W. Holdings which has been completed; the Tubalevu project in Tavua, also a contract by B. W. Holdings which is about 85 percent completed; and in Saweni which was done by B. W. Holdings but taken over by Vikash Construction which is about 85 percent completed. Of project that has been on documentation and engineering is the Lovu General Industry in Lautoka which has completed Phase 1 and Saravi in Nadroga, while Veiseisei in Vuda has completed the scoping but still awaiting the engineering documents. The advice that was given to us by the consultants is that the money that was given to us is just enough to complete the three construction works, which is the subdivision for Saweni, Wairabetia and Tubalevu. As of 31 st July, our utilization was $1.6 million, or 39 percent of the budget. The delay was caused by the adverse weather, the slow in the approvals process, and the shortage of the construction materials. Also, adding into it is the hand-over time that was given to us. These projects were with two Ministries - the Office of the Attorney-General and the Ministry of Finance. So, when we took over, we had difficulty in trying to get all the details on how the project was run. As of now, we have been advised by the consultant that the projects should be completed by the end of September. I visited the sites two weeks ago, I told them that it will never be completed at the end of September. So, that is how the projects have been going on and we are trying our best to complete the two leftover projects. We do not want to introduce any other ones to go into the phase two, because we want to complete the first two, then we will decide on how we go forward. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for his very detailed answer to question and I wish him well and we leave it on your good hands, honourable Minister, particularly for the completion of the remaining projects. Just a quick question, honourable Minister, you are aware of the housing and office space shortage in Levuka. If I may ask the question on behalf of the community of Vuma Village because I think in the previous Administration, this is one of the projects that was also in the list. The Government wants to diversify and strengthen its presence in Levuka but we are limited by and office issues. So, I just wish to raise the question about the Vuma Project, if it is still under consideration, if you can just, please, confirm, honourable Minister. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, with the projects that were given to us, we took over the 10 projects that was first approved. Out of 142 applications, there were 10 approved and 132 did not meet the criteria that is set for the grant. So, I will look into the one that you have raised today, honourable Member. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question. Thank you, honourable Minister, for your responses. One of the things that I have been talking about the whole of this week is about the importance of execution and implementation, and 39 percent, I understand the reason that you have given but I think that is something that Government needs to take note of - the importance of good execution, good implementation, to raise those percentages up. I am interested, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on one of the criteria that we had when the system was put up and would like to know whether this criteria has changed. One of the conditions was that after it has been developed, that the landowners who are taking on the development should not sell the lots at anything below the market value. Is that condition still in place? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, the condition still stands and that is the reason why most of the lots are still not being able to be sold. After this, we will have to look at it because the quicker</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1447 they sell the lots, then people can move in and construct their own house. It has been an issue now because some of them have already made their arrangements in terms of the price, but when we put in the price for valuation and commercial for market price, it is a bit hard for them to sell at this time. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, most of the Ministers are involved in bilateral talks. So, we will skip Question No. 118 and move to Question No. 119. (Question No. 118/2024 deferred to later sitting) Sale of Fresh Ginger - Australia Ginger Farmers Association (Question No. 119/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the progress of the sale of fresh ginger to the Australia Ginger Farmers Association in the last 12 months, as mentioned by the Minister in Parliament in March 2023? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by the honourable Member. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the talks between the two countries and the relevant organisations continue. However, the Ministry cannot afford to wait for an opening in the Australian market, while harvested ginger continues to go to waste. The Ministry is looking to amend the relevant legislations which are stringent and non- facilitative for fresh exports to Australia. Currently, Mr. Speaker Sir, there are two main exporters of processed ginger in Fiji - Kaiming Agro Processing and Fresh Pack Trading, while other exporters that send small quantities include Produce Processing Pte Limited, Shahi Foods, Vinaka Farm and Ranadi Plantation, which specialises in organic ginger. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the over production and supply of ginger last year, the Ministry through its capital intervention, increased the capacity of our local ginger exports to absorb an extra 100 tonnes of matured ginger, in addition to their annual quota of 400 tonnes. So, the immature ginger quota remains at 1,500 tonnes per year, and all ginger supplied to the market is processed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kaiming Agro Processing supplied 300 tonnes matured processed ginger to the United States of America and Canada, while 250 tonnes processed crystal, paste and juice was exported to Australia in the last season. The requirements remain the same, all farmers supplying to registered exporters have a quota. However, meeting the quality criteria remains a challenge. Climatic conditions, management practices and awareness of quality standards is currently being worked on in scaling up to order by the Ministry and the stakeholders in order to meet the market demands and to supply the export markets. Exporters continue to experience resistance in accessing fresh ginger exports to Australia due to claim of nematode risk of Fiji ginger. However, Fiji continues to facilitate the Australia markets, while the Navua-based Vinaka Farm, an organic ginger provider for local and overseas export has managed to supply eight tonnes of fresh organic matured ginger to Australia in the last fiscal year.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1448</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th August, 2024 The Ministry is working in partnership with such players, together with the Ministry of Trade, to try and increase the volume of organic ginger production in Fiji, increasing Fiji’s competitive edge in the global market and also as a way out of the difficulty in accessing the Australian market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bilateral quarantine agreement protocol to supply ginger remains the same, as I have alluded to earlier, and this continues to be supported and executed by the Ministry. When I delivered my Ministerial Statement last year, it triggered bilaterial discussions not only with Australia but New Zealand as well, to the effect that the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council hosted a workshop in April this year, inviting a New Zealand-based company to discuss the import of fresh ginger and banana from Fiji. The MOU is currently being developed and expected to be signed between the two organisations. Further discussions with Biosecurity of Fiji and other stakeholders are in progress to send a five-tonne shipment via airfreight to compete with the Italian ginger currently in the New Zealand market. The Ministry will continue to work with the Fiji Crop and Livestock Council in upskilling our farmers on record keeping, quality standards and registration, to meet the standards for fresh supply to New Zealand. Fiji can further raise its standards through Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Organic Certification by 2026 to obtain premium prices. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while Fiji ginger is highly regarded in the international market, it has been difficult to access the fresh ginger market in Australia. We understand that they also have the interest of their own ginger farmers to protect. So, our way forward is to support agro-processors in Fiji, to increase their capacity to value-add ginger and purchase more ginger from farmers. However, the Ministry will continue to discuss with Australia and the stakeholders to increase its market share for Fiji processed ginger, and it will also explore new pathways to send Fiji ginger into new markets both, local and abroad. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, a supplementary question. Honourable Minister thank you for your response. It appears that Australia is not going to open more for us in terms of our ginger. You truly said and I do agree that for ginger farmers (I am a ginger farmer myself), we cannot wait this long. I just came back from Indonesia, together with the honourable Speaker, on a trip last week and after a bilateral talk with our Indonesian partners, on the side, I was able to talk with one of the Members of P raising this question about them buying ginger from us. He said, “Indonesia is big, we have enough ginger, we can feed our own market.” However, if we think of talking with them to take part of our ginger or a quarter of our ginger, they are ready to talk with us on that. It was very encouraging when I heard that and I shared to the honourable Speaker, “Maybe, it is time for us to move away from Australia and look for other markets.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we will consider that opportunity.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. Honourable Minister, one of the most successful ginger companies in Australia is Buderim Ginger. To circumvent the push back from the Australian ginger farmers, Buderim was actually getting younger ginger out of Fiji - a substantial amount and labelling it and turning it into sweets. The question is, has that expanded somewhat where we are sending more of our younger ginger out to Buderim because they seem to be very keen with respect to Fijian ginger and they hold it in very high regard? They are one of the world’s best ginger companies and for purposes of our own farmers producing that kind of ginger that they need.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1449 HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is correct. In fact, in Fiji, the baby ginger market is more lucrative than the matured ginger market, simply because of what we are discussing right now - the non-reluctance of Australia to accept fresh ginger, but we all understand. I have raised it here that the quality of Fiji’s matured ginger is equal to none. It melts in your mouth, it is the best ginger in the world, and that is probably why Australia wants to make it difficult for our fresh matured ginger to enter because they simply would not be able to compete. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the opening in the New Zealand market gives hope to ginger farmers. I declare my interest as well, we are in the planting season now, starting in September. Do we have hope in completing this MOU getting it signed so that when the crops starts maturing next year, there is hope that it will access the New Zealand market? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- I hope you declare your interest. Yes, we will work on fast- tracking the signing of the MOU because that is a definite offer that has come to us from the company in New Zealand. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, for the statement made by honourable Tuinaceva, I think what needs to be undertaken first is an MOU. I do not know if it is still there with Parliament or straight from bilateral, because they have indicated there is a market there. If we can shift to Asia, there is a big market there rather than relying on the premium market that we have in Australia. They have so many rules and regulations. I have met several times with a Chinese descent businessman. We discussed very thoroughly on how best we can advance the stalemate that has been reached in ginger marketing, but it seems that the interest of the Australian farmers, again, is something that the Australian Government readily protects. I think it is an MOU and maybe, that is something for Government to follow up on, on the Indonesian available market and maybe, it is much closer to us because we have their fishing boats, and we have several issues that we have been trading with in Indonesia and the Melanesian Spearhead Group. We are holding one-on-one discussions with them as well. The providing of markets for our readily available agricultural products is one of the things that can be pursued. I just wish to highlight that in this very important issue that has been raised regarding the market availability. Honourable Members, Question Numbers 120/2024, 121/2024, 122/2024 and 123/2024, I think will have to be rolled over to the next sitting or availability of time where they could be addressed, because most of the Members are in the bilateral talks. (Question Nos. 120/2024; 121/2024; 122/2024; and 123/2024 deferred to later sitting) At this juncture, I intend to adjourn the House for lunch. When we resume, Madam Deputy Speaker will be presiding. The Parliament adjourned at 1.09 p.m.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1450 Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.20 p.m.</p></body>
