S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion.</p><h4>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to present the overview of the</h4><p>Sugar Cane Growers Council’s 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Council’s 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports on 12 th July, 2024. The Committee is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar Industry for submitting the responses to the Committee’s tabled Consolidated Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Council’s 2019- 2021 Annual Reports. The Sugar Cane Growers Council’s reporting period stated that growers recorded a notable 18 percent decline in cane production, compared to the 2020 season. One of the major contributing factors was due to the massive destruction of TC Yasa in 2020. The reporting period in 2019 noted that there were 16,631 registered cane growers with only 11,902 active cane growers. This slightly increased in 2020, recording a total number of 16,843 registered growers in the country with 1,875 cane harvesting gangs. Whilst there were 16,684 registered cane growers in 2021, close to 11,622 growers actively grew cane individually and run small to medium cane farms, with a majority producing less than 200 tonnes per year. The Committee is concerned with the slight growth of cane growers over the period and that 80 percent of the registered farmers produce less than 200 tonnes of cane per year, which is only 20 percent of the total cane production. The Committee noted with concern the lack of clear KPIs relating to the objectives and functions of the Council against which the Council’s performance can be adequately monitored. During our visit to the Sugar Cane Growers Council’s Office, the Committee found deep levels of mistrust amongst the farmers, as well as perceived miscommunication with iTLTB. While the Board assured the farmers of their commitment towards supporting the sugar industry through lease renewals, it was apparent that farmers remained skeptical. The Sugar Cane Growers Council should play a vital role in building trust in this relationship. The Committee highlighted KPIs and urged the Sugar Cane Growers Council to develop new KPIs for new income streams that will enhance the economic viability of the sugar industry. Moving on, the Committee recommended that there needs to be a greater integration of new technologies, interventions of specific policies, new farming methods, combined with the traditional knowledge of farmers. New incentives and training needs to be held by the Sugar Cane Growers Council to improve productivity that requires to reverse the declining sugarcane crop production. The Committee also recommended that the Sugar Cane Growers Council should also work in</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1451 building trust with all the sugar-related stakeholders, to allow serious integrated approach at all levels in ensuring continuous economic growth at a large scale in the sugar industry. Therefore, it is vital to identify important policy and practical measures to reform the sugar industry in Fiji and boost farmers’ confidence and motivation as critical ingredients for increasing sugarcane crop production yield and performance to continue in the sugarcane farming business. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for the debate on the motion. I have a list of speakers, as follows: (1) Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; (2) Honourable S. T. Koroilavesau; (3) Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; and (4) Honourable P. K. Ravunawa. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to address the findings of the Consolidated Review Report n the Sugar Cane Growers Council’s 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12th July, 2024. We have carefully reviewed the Reports and acknowledged the critical areas highlighted by the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, and I thank the Committee for its attention to detail in examining the Annual Reports of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC). As highlighted in the 2021 Annual Report, Madam Deputy Speaker, the sugar industry endured a significant setback with an 18 percent decline in cane production, compared to the 2020 season. This unfortunate reduction was a direct consequence of the unprecedented devastation brought about by TC Yasa in 2020. The industry has also seen continuous decline in the number of active cane farmers which was attributed to the aging farmer population and the financial hurdles they face. The Ministry is proactively engaging in measures to attract young farmers into the sector. Our initiatives include promoting farm sharing agreements through the SCGC, new farmer programme and lease premium assistance programme and the promotion inter-cropping. Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, we are championing farm mechanisation to boost the efficiency in the yield, given the massive labour shortage in the industry. The Report highlights a concerning mistrust amongst the farmers, particularly regarding lease renewals. The Ministry is absolutely committed to re-building this trust. We are working closely with the SCGC, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund (SCGF) and the iTLTB, to ensure that all communications are transparent, accurate and timely. Our goal is to bring about a harmonious and co-operative relations between all stakeholders in the industry. In alignment with our national global commitments, we acknowledge the importance of integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into the Council’s reporting framework. We are particularly focused that the SDGs, Madam Deputy Speaker, will emphasise the gender equality. The Ministry pledges to ensure that future reports capture this essential elements, reflecting the dedication to promoting an inclusive and equitable industry. In conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Sugar remains steadfast with its objective to overcome the challenges faced by the sugar industry. We are committed to implementing strategic measures that will secure better a future for our farmers and the industry at large. Our collective efforts are aimed at ensuring the sustainable growth and success of Fiji’s sugar sector,</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1452 Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 which is a cornerstone of our nation’s economy and heritage. I extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for their contribution and deliberation. Based on those remarks, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion. Vinaka. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am a Member of the Committee so I will basically be talking on the discussions and interventions that we carried out during our meeting. Madam Deputy Speaker, historically, the sugar industry and its activities has shaped the development of Fiji’s economy over decades. However, the Committee is concerned that in the past 15 years, cane production has been declining. The Committee strongly feels that the sugar industry’s existence needs to be relooked at and a close monitoring system to be put in place to identify the production progress. Madam Deputy Speaker, therefore, it is vital that we identify important policies and practical measures to reform the sugar industry in Fiji and boost farmers’ confidence in the motivation and critical ingredients for increasing sugarcane crop cultivation, production, yield, and for farmers to continue in sugarcane farming as a business. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) has the mandate to protect and promote the livelihood of the growers through innovative measures, focussing mainly on growers’ welfare, timely redress to grower grievances, negotiations, and support towards increasing farm yield and subsidising cost of production and advocacy. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee began its review in May 2024. The review process adopted by the Committee was agreed upon through a consensus by the Members to review of the Report and a summary to be submitted as a follow-up. At the end of the review, the Committee made recommendations based on the discussions with stakeholders on the Annual Report’s contents. Madam Deputy Speaker, the issues surrounding the sugar industry is quite vast and wide. What we had intended to do was identifying the critical areas that we can highlight in this Report and the Ministry of Sugar can then carry on and make changes in accordance with the findings that we have made. We identified that the 10-acre land that has been allocated to farmers during the colonial days is not substantial enough to produce cane and give returns to the farmers. There is a need to consolidate these, regroup the small acreage into bigger farms so that there is a greater economic means to produce sugarcane that will give the benefit to the farmers for their livelihood and looking after their families. During our visit, we found a deep level of mistrust among farmers, as well as miscommunication with iTLTB. I was quite concerned about this because within the sugar industry discussion, it seems that the iTLTB is always blamed for the non-continuation of sugarcane leases or the reduction of acreage. In fact, when the CEO of iTLTB came and we had a general discussion, he was very forthcoming. He understood that to be able to bring the sugar industry back, there has to be an increase in sugarcane production. He has suggested that there is a huge amount of land that is available in their pool that can be allocated for sugarcane farming. So, we really need to look into the issues concerning the leases and then come up with some ideas of making use of these land. One of the other issues, Madam Deputy Speaker, is the actual involvement of traditional landowners for cane farming. We have found that in Nasarayawa in Vanua Levu. They have a new</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1453 system where the actual landowners are farming, and it was very successful. In fact, they are one of the major producers of cane to Labasa Sugar Mill. We asked them about intercropping, they had carried out intercropping, but basically there was no market, so they had to leave that intercropping scheme. Madam Deputy Speaker, the need for greater integration of new technologies is something that has to be emphasised. I understand that the honourable Minister has been to India where they had discussed about the railway system and the positives of re-inventing the railway system because of its emphasis to the infrastructure, and he has highlighted that he is looking at that matter, and I appreciate the comments that he has made. Madam Deputy Speaker, we need to have new initiatives and training, led by the SCGC. In our visit both, in the Western Division and in Labasa, it seems to imply that the cane growers are isolated and not well connected to the agencies that are involved in the production of sugarcane and the milling of cane to produce sugar. We need specific policies and interventions to be introduced to urgently boost farmer morale and confidence in the industry for growers to increase crop production. All efforts must be directed in ensuring that farmers produce more than 300 tonnes to remain in the industry. Those farmers who are providing less than 300 tonnes, need to be supported by the Ministry of Agriculture through their alternative livelihood programmes. Madam Deputy Speaker, I think honourable Kiran, being with FRIENDS, had indicated about mixed cropping. She is looking at me suspiciously. We had brought in the Ministry of Agriculture and sat together in one of the meeting rooms and told them - the Permanent Secretary for Agriculture and the Permanent Secretary for the Sugar Industry, so they have developed a huge increase in the production of mixed crops within their sugarcane farms. We are going in the right direction, but for small farmers, it is very important for intercropping so that the earnings they get from the other crops, will provide them substantial income during the offseason. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. That is all I can contribute. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me thank the Committee for their Report on the consolidated review of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) from 2019 to 2021. I have noted also some of the recommendations they have made. Honourable Koroilavesau had alluded to some of the most significant ones and the honourable Minister also mentioned a few. What I would like to say though is that, if you look at this Report, Madam Deputy Speaker, and if you look at their reports on the SCGC of the previous years and in the previous Parliament, you will find similarities in the recommendations that the Committees have made, which means that these issues that they have highlighted in the recommendations that they have made are not new in this House. It seems that there has been a whole lot of debate about it. I think we all agree that sugarcane will continue to play a significant part in our development as a nation into the future. I know there is a lot of sugarcane farmers in this House too. They are sugarcane farmers because they realise how important it is, not only to Fiji but to their families as well, and how it is important to the growers on whose report we are talking about. But the discussions has always been in comparing stakeholders, like the SCGC representing the farmers, the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) representing the processers</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1454 Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 and, of course, Government on one party. Amidst all these recommendations, they are really all good. I would like to add on to another, maybe its high time that, apart from subsidising the industry and looking at value adding, we should also seriously look at some other alternative crops that could grow well in this field. During one of my trips, I was looking at this fruit called durian. It grows well in the Tropics. It earns a lot of money for Malaysia and Thailand. This is a really good substitute, but there are many others as well. The honourable Kamikamica is looking at me. He had talked about macadamia nuts and a whole range of other things, something that will not only entice the farmers. But given also the recommendations of the Committee and finding alternative living out of these things, we could also really make it into a produce that people can grow, and we can export at the end of the day. Perhaps, that is the one thing I would like to add. It takes political will, and I hope that in whatever direction the sugar industry is going in Fiji, that we will be bold enough to make these tough decisions on behalf of our community, especially for our economy and our people, and the future of this industry as a whole. So, continue to look at it but also look at other avenues that would benefit us into the future. Thank you. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to add my voice to this crucial debate, a debate that centres on the livelihood of our farmers, the health of our economy and the legacy that we want to leave as stewards of this great nation. I express my sincere gratitude to the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for their diligent study of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) Annual Reports from 2019 to 2021 and also their sensible recommendations. Yet, Madam Deputy Speaker, I stand here as an Opposition Member, tasked with the role of providing checks and balances. It is my duty to say that while the Committee’s recommendations are commendable and bipartisan in nature, that alone is not enough - we must do more. The proposed integration of new technologies and farming methods in the agriculture sector is a vital step but let us also be reminded that while we champion progress, it is the wisdom of our traditional farming knowledge that forms our roots, so let us not abandon them. As alluded to by the previous speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, we, indeed, need a new policy intervention to boost the farmers’ morale – it is a non-negotiable first step in transforming our sugar industry. Therefore, I urge the Government to ensure that there is transparent and effective communication between all stakeholders, to ensure the successful implementation of the diversification strategies. The SCGC was established in accordance with the Sugar Industry Act 1984 with the specific function to protect and further the interests of registered cane growers, grow their farming yield and also look after the welfare of their families. I urge the Government not to see farmers merely as producers or statistics, but as the backbone of our economy as well. So, farmers’ welfare should be a matter of national priority, not an industrial concern and definitely not merely used as a political football. That must stop, Madam Deputy Speaker. The recommendation for farmers producing less than 300 tonnes to be supported through alternative livelihood programmes from the Ministry of Agriculture is a valuable suggestion. However, let us go a step further to provide our farmers with an array of support, be it financial, educational or infrastructural. We must invest in them as our future depends on it. Farmers are the backbone of this country, and we must ensure that they have the utmost confidence in their work and</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>6 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - SCGC 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1455 its outcome. While I fully endorse the pursuit of research and development, let us not lose sight of the critical factors, such as soil health and environmental resilience. These are not just nice-to-have, but they are the bedrock of our agricultural survival. Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, the importance of research and development cannot be overstated, particularly in improving productivity, enhance soil fertility and promoting climate resilience. The measure that the Committee recommended in this regard are essential. In recognising the need for restructuring the governance of the SCGC, I must also underline the necessity of accountability. A change in structure means little, if not merit with accountability and transparency principle, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam Deputy Speaker, encouraging collaboration between the Council and other sugar entities is crucial for sharing knowledge. I encourage the Council to work together with other sugar entities, to ensure that the growers receive correct and effective information on farming skills and farming methods to boost productivity. The urgency here should lie in fostering a vibrant ecosystem where every grower feels nurtured, informed and are valued. Madam Deputy Speaker, each recommendation speaks to key transformational need that is needed in the sugar industry, from overhauling governance structures to instilling the growers’ confidence. If followed prudently and coupled with a few additional steps, we can turn our beloved sugar industry into a powerhouse. Reform is a must for our sugar industry. The Committee’s recommendation to identify necessary policy and practical measures to boost farmers’ confidence and motivation is the step in the right direction. These are the vehicles to propel us forward towards increased sugarcane production and the farmer’s yield. In the spirit of collaboration, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is further urged that sugar stakeholders develop key KPIs. The new income streams will enhance the economic viability of the sugar sector and to move forward with an auditor change, to ensure independence, objectivity and maintenance of a robust financial control. However, words are not enough, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Government must critically examine these suggestions and act on them urgently. We owe it to the sugarcane farmers, to our fellow citizens and the generation that will inherit either the fruits or failures of our actions here today. The stakes are high, and the time is now. Let us act decisively. The future of one of Fiji’s cornerstone industry is now hanging in the balance. Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I take note of the various contributions that have been made by honourable Members and I would like to thank them for their contributions. Of course, some of those issues that have been raised will be covered in the other reports that we will be covering in the next two days or so. The honourable Minister has raised that a team from FAO is currently in the country undertaking a review of all the issues we have raised. What we will be doing is an overall review of the industry, as well as looking at all the institutions that are linked to the industry, whether there is a need to have those institutions or there is a need to look at the restructure of the industry to ensure that it is sustainable in the long term.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1456 Consolidated Review Report - FSC 2020-2023 Annual Reports 6 th August, 2024 We agree that there needs to be a sugar industry, the industry has to be there, but in what size and what form it has to take, that has to be decided by the Report. Of course, as has being raised by the other side of the House and also this side, it needs a political will from our side. We have to take the hard decision to ensure that we continue with the industry, sustaining the livelihood of our people and, at the same time, providing income and growth to the country. I do not have any other comments, but I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions. I do support the motion, Madam Deputy Speaker. MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
