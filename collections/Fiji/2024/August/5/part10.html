<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. Visit to Fiji - Her Excellency the President of India Honourable Members, as you are all now aware, Her Excellency the President of the Republic of India will visit Parliament tomorrow and will deliver an address. For the duration of the Presidential visit, access to Parliament and its precincts and gallery will be by invitation only. May I also remind you that sometimes this morning a tentative programme for the official visit will be circulated to all honourable Members. That programme is from the honourable Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Communications from the Speaker</h4><p>1369 Resolutions of the Business Committee Honourable Members, I would also like to inform you that the Members of the Business Committee have unanimously approved the following: (1) Parliament will uphold the ongoing practice with respect to the speaking times during debates on the Standing Committee review reports, whereby the mover will have up to five minutes to open the debate and up to five minutes of their right of reply. There will only be two speakers from each side of the House, and each of the two speakers will have up to 10 minutes to speak. (2) Pursuant to the Standing Order amendments of 24th May, 2024, Ministers responses to Oral Questions will be up to 10 minutes (from 20 minutes to 10 minutes) to avoid honourable Ministers being pointed out at in trying to make Ministerial Statements. These are just responses to the questions. The responses to supplementary questions will be between five minutes and 10 minutes, at the discretion of the honourable Speaker. (3) Honourable Whips must notify the Secretary-General if some of your honourable Members wish to speak in the vernacular at any given time and day during the sittings. All the Secretariat ask from you honourable Members is, please, give notice to us so we can prepare the translators that they be given enough notice time, because otherwise, people fire off into their own dialects and the poor translators at the top are finding it difficult to quickly respond to translations, instead of speaking in the Bauan language, they use their own dialects. I must say here, especially the two of our honourable Members from the big Province of Ra - the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the honourable Ratu Niudamu. I trust all honourable Members we will try and communicate accordingly with your Whips in that matter, or in that respect. (4) An official request was received from the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for the Standing Committee to table its reports on the Child Justice Bill, Child Care and Protection Bill and the National Disaster Risk Management Bill at a later sitting of Parliament. The Chairperson has confirmed that the Standing Committee has further referred the Bills to the legal drafters with their comments. Honourable Members, with your indulgence, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights will table its reports on the Child Justice Bill, Child Care and Protection Bill and National Disaster Risk Management Bill at a later sitting of Parliament. (5) The Business Committee has unanimously approved that all future Bills under Standing Order 51 will be referred equally to the Standing Committees of Parliament, and not only to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. This is to try and share the workload to the other Standing Committees of which, the honourable Members their operational rights are all the same. It is just a matter of sharing the burden, we have done this in the past, and as such, we would like to make it part of our Standing Orders now as to ensure that it will be referred to all Standing Committees. As such, all honourable Members on the Standing Committees must be capacitated to undertake such a function. The Business Committee has also approved the honourable Government Whip to ensure that the Bills are equally distributed between all six Standing Committees. I understand your workload, Madam Whip, is a bit heavy but, again, that is the responsibility that goes with that position.</p><h4>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Status of the 26 Members of the Opposition For the information of all honourable Members, my Office has received from the 25 honourable Members of the Opposition that they are now Independents. Some of them wrote to me and some of them declared during the participation of the debates in the recent past by informing Parliament that they stand here as an Independent now. One honourable Member is awaiting the outcome of the appeal lodged with the Fijian Electoral Commission. So, he still has to notify me of his decision whilst waiting for that appeal that he has lodged. I can also confirm that pursuant to Standing Order 4(2), there are two working groups or blocs in the Opposition. One is being led by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and this is the Group of 16. You try and inform me of how you want to be called, but this is the message from the Chair. This group is now known as Group of 16 Bloc. Their Whip is honourable Jone Usamate and their Deputy Whip is honourable Ketan Lal. The other Group of 9 Bloc, (I hope you do not mind; this is like being in prison or something), is being led by honourable Ioane Naivalurua. Their Whip is the honourable Viliame Naupoto and their Deputy Whip is the honourable Alipate Matasawalevu. As far as the 26 honourable Members are concerned, all 26 Members remain Opposition Members, operating under the two working groups or blocs, and in that respect, the Speaker is mandated that under Standing Order 18(2) to ensure the rights and privileges of all honourable Members in Parliament and in the Standing and Select Committees. In light of the two working groups or blocs in the Opposition and pursuant to Standing Order 114(4) and Standing Order 115(1), my Office will undertake a review of the membership of the six Standing Committees and the four Select Committees to ensure fair representation of the two working groups or blocs, and a further announcement will be made later this week. Honourable Members, whilst we appreciate that we are now being faced with unprecedented situations pertaining to deregistration of a political party and Members continuing as Independents, I plead with you all that we must continue to engage in constructive dialogue as we have done previously or recently in the Business Committee where Members of the Opposition just put their heads together and decided on how to raise questions. As such, we will continue in that element of dialogue so as to ensure and uphold the best interest of the people that have elected you, and most importantly, our beloved country.</p></body>
