<body><h3>ANNEXURE I</h3><h4>ANNEXURE I</h4><p>MINISTER FOR EDUCATION (Hon. A. M. Radrodro) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 108/2024 is as follows: The Coalition Government continues to recognise the significance of education at different levels from primary to tertiary-level education. Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS) was established in 2014 with the core mandate to administer Government scholarships, grants and study loans. TSLS plays a critical role as the major stakeholder for human capital development in the country by providing highly trained and competent workforce to sustain our economy. (a) Since 2014, seventy thousand nine hundred and four students (70,904) students have been funded through scholarships, study loans, micro qualifications grants and apprenticeship scheme. This amounts to total financial investment of $1.1 billion. A total of 68,700 students have been funded by TSLS through Scholarships, Study Loans and Grants at 19 local Tertiary Education Institutes (TEI's) and 18 Institutions in Australia and New Zealand. In addition, 1,879 students have been assisted through Micro Qualification Grant and 325 students under Apprenticeship Scheme. TSLS scholarships, Study Loans and Grants The breakdown of the 68,700 students funded under scholarships, study loans and grants are: Higher Education Institution The University of the South Pacific Fiji National University University of Fiji Corpus Christi Teachers College Fulton Adventist University College Sangam Institute of Nursing Technical College of Fiji Centre for Applied Technology Development Keshals Business Education Institute Pacific Polytechnic Monfort Boys Town Navuso Agricultural Technical Institute Service Pro No. of Students 20,610 30,226 3,110 358 551 1,223 10,857 151 32 1,194 15 10 10</p><p>ii.

This equates to approximately $160 million dollars of Investment. The breakdown by Institution cannot be released as it will cause reputational damage to the Tertiary Education Institutions. However, the institutions have the information on probation, suspension and non-completion. Students were provided with a TELS loan from 2014 to 2019 with very low marks to do degree programmes which contributed to such high non- completion. The Technical Colleges also attributed to the non-completion figures. The Fijian Parliament has approved amendments to the TSLS Act to obtain academically 'at risk' student information. The information is to be used to subsequently prepare remedial plans for their tertiary education institutions to early detect and provide scaffolding support to reduce the non - completion rate. (c) The Higher Education Commission Fiji (HECF) and Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS) have no legal mandate to collect employment records of the graduates. Due to this there are no records on where the graduates who benefited from Government</p><p>iv. funding are employed. However, with amendments to the TSLS Act, Bill No. 16 of 2024 and Act No. 12 of 2024, TSLS now has the mandate to collect student employment record. Section 17A of TSLS Act requires " A student or former student who is employed or self-employed, must provide the Service with his or her employment record". All TSLS funded students are now obligated to submit the employment record to TSLS within 6 months of being employed or self-employed and any other time as directed by TSLS. With this requirement, it will not only allow TSLS to keep track of where students are employed but also assist in bond clearance process and national planning. TSLS will strengthen the policies, regulations and the Act to ensure transparent and accountable management of government funding to maximize return from taxpayer investment in education.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 1092024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Ref.
