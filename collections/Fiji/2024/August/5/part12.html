<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members the following Ministers have given notice to make</p><h4>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40::</h4><p>(1) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate and Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (2) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (3) Honourable Minister for Education; and (4) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. The Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes. I will then invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the statement of no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the honourable Leader of the Opposition or the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate, to also speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate. Pacific as the Ocean of Peace HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also like to welcome those who are watching us on livestream and also some young visitors from the United States of America seating in the gallery this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to inform the House of the progress in the development of the concept of the Pacific as the Ocean of Peace. This week, Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are taking the concept through the Pacific Islands Forum consultation process. On 15th November, 1520, a long time ago, long after the first Pacific Islanders had reached this ocean, Ferdinand Magellan sailed into the Mar del Sur (The South Sea - named by Vasco Nunez Balboa, Spanish Explorer and Conquistador) and renamed it Mar Pacifico, the Pacific Ocean because of its calm waters. The waters of the Pacific are not always calm, they can be stormy at times, violent and threatening. However, as Epeli Hau’ofa noted in his essay, We are the Ocean: Selected Works and I quote: “Just as the sea is an open and ever flowing reality, so should our oceanic identity transcend all forms of insularity, to become one that is openly searching, inventive and welcoming”. It is fitting to note therefore, Sir, that at a time of geostrategic tension, economic uncertainty and a changing climatic environment, those who are the custodians of the ocean welcome the proposal that the Pacific be an Ocean of Peace and agree to adopt some high-level principles, to guide efforts to realise this ambition and embed peace as a cornerstone of future policies and strategies. After having presented to the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders at their meeting in Rarotonga in November 2023, the leaders have tasked the PIF Secretariat to further develop the Ocean of Peace concept for consideration at the 53 rd Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Tonga later this month. This directive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has since inspired deep reflections across the region about the opportunities inherent in that concept. It has also caught the attention of international</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1372</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 leaders like President Biden of the United States of America, President Xi Jing Ping of China, the Emperor of Japan and his Prime Minister Kishida and the Prime Minister of India, Shri Modi, and I am sure Her Excellency, the President of India who is coming to Fiji this afternoon also agrees. As a region, the Pacific knows the value of peace as we lived through the horrors of its absence. This ocean and its diverse and vibrant lands have been a theatre of two world wars and a testing ground of the most dangerous weapons, the impacts of which are still felt today. Yet, Mr. Speaker, this is not a passive region without agency, the collective voice of the Pacific is as loud as it is profound and proud. Building Pacific regionalism over many decades, the Forum family have created a strong basis to give effect to this vision of advancing the region as an Ocean of Peace, the greatest area on the globe under Christianity yet so fragile and prone to conflicts. Let me be clear, Sir, the concept of peace comes from deep within our faith in God of peace, deference and justice that finds its expressions in our approach to issues that are embedded in the Pacific Way. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an Ocean of Peace reflects the Pacific Way, as first defined in 1970 by the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara at the United Nations. It is owned and shaped by Pacific people and Pacific traditions. The concept recognises that whilst core values and Pacific identify are shared across the region, local customs and understandings vary. Humility, quiet leadership, reconciliation the and communication peaceful resolution of concerns, based on the Pacific Way of bringing people and nations together to find common ground and manage disagreements. It is a shared commitment these definitions. through run to As we work towards the principles, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ocean of Peace concept offers an opportunity to re-embrace foundational tenets, principles and ethics of Pacific regionalism and to weave the threads of our past with our vision for the future. In this respect, the Ocean of Peace underscores several key themes: (1) Protecting and recognising the Pacific's stewardship of the environment and ocean that underpins the lives, livelihoods and very existence of our people and connects us, including, in response to climate change - which our leaders recognised as the greatest threat to existence, collective security and wellbeing. (2) The Pacific's longstanding support for and ongoing contribution to global peace-making systems, institutions and solutions which resonates with the calls for peace in many parts of the world today. (3) The sophistication and longevity of the Pacific's advocacy in favour of core global platforms underpinning peace and security, including freedom of navigation, arms control and non-proliferation of hostilities arrangements. (4) The 2050 Strategy vision of a shared responsibility for maintaining Pacific peace and security and for building capability to meet the region's needs. (5) The Boe Declaration’s broad definition of security as well as mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. (6) Statements reinforcing the Pacific's peaceful example to uphold international law and urge others to refrain from actions that undermine peace and security in the Blue Pacific and beyond. (7) The opportunities and benefits for the Blue Pacific in enhancing regional economic connectivity and integration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ocean of Peace is a signal that we seek a region in which strategic competition is managed, where stability is the touchstone of regional relationships, where coercion</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1373 is eschewed and where differences are resolved peacefully. The Ocean of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is both an aspiration and a pathway to a regional arrangement crafted by the States of the Pacific region, but also respected by other powers of the broader Indo Pacific region, hence our desire that when they enter the region, they tone down and tune in to the ways of the Pacific. Yet, the Ocean of Peace cannot survive as a unilateral assertion. It rests, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a shared commitment by all states in the region to put a stable peace at the centre of their strategic policies. Through the Ocean of Peace, we recognise the right of the people to peace and reaffirm the strong resolve of our people to maintain and strengthen international peace and security. By adopting this concept, Mr. Speaker, we declare and secure that right. We are conscious of the determination of the Pacific Island countries to preserve their independence, their sovereignty and their territorial integrity, and to develop their relations under conditions of peace and liberty. We are convinced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the importance of promoting peace and cooperation in Oceania for the benefit of the Pacific people, in particular, and humankind in general. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are convinced of the need to preserve the region from acts of militarisation, arms race, and, above all, nuclear weapons - their threats of use and use. We recognise the interest and responsibility of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) membership to promote regional cooperation for economic development and peace. Working through the PIF and recognising that this is a long-term objective, Fiji promotes an Ocean of Peace based on a set of principles that recognises and complements existing frameworks. The Pacific Leaders’ guidance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the refinement of the principles and situating it within the existing landscape of Pacific regionalism and global engagement would ensure it meets the needs and expectations of the PIF membership in a complex and contested environment, regionally and beyond. As a concept, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ocean of Peace is an opportunity and should be seen as a beacon of hope, that could spur on the evolution of our region's longstanding commitment to peace and prosperity for our people. The Ocean of Peace concept promotes and harnesses the innovation of the Blue Pacific and the unique perspective our region brings on issues of global significance, most especially at a time that the world is going through today. The Ocean of Peace, Mr Speaker, Sir, offers this generation the opportunity to echo and embrace the determination, and I quote: "to ensure, so far as lies within their power, that the bounty and beauty of the land and sea in their region shall remain the heritage of their peoples and their descendants in perpetuity to be enjoyed by all in peace”, w hich is clarified for those members who are party to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treat y, commonly referred to as the Treaty of Rarotonga. The Ocean of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also offers a platform to expand for a global audience, concepts central to the Pacific Way, including to articulate how those within and beyond the Blue Pacific can embrace mechanisms to work together and resolve differences respectfully and with understanding.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1374</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate for your contribution. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me, first of all, acknowledge and thank the honourable Prime Minister for the Ministerial Statement on the development of the concept of the Pacific as an ‘Ocean of Peace’, that he has delivered in this august House this morning. Let me say from the very beginning Sir, in my response that we very much look forward to this, not only to this side of the House, but every Fijian because this is something that we first heard of, as stated by the honourable Prime Minister, when he attended the Leaders Meeting in Rarotonga in November last year. We did some follow-ups with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and we were told that Fiji was to develop the concept further, as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister, and be presented in the meeting in Tonga this year and, of course, we look forward to that. But let me acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister as well for assuring us that this concept of peace recognises and complements the existing frameworks and particularly, as agreed to by our Leaders, the Boe Declaration and the 2050 Strategy, which we are familiar with. So, I wish to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for that, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I say that in acknowledging the statement, we all know how important our ocean is, not only to Fiji, but other Pacific Island countries, whose livelihood and survival depend, to a large extend, on the oceans around us and moreso, its extractable into the Boe Declaration and the 2050 Pacific Strategy for a Blue Pacific continent. If I may just refer to that document, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in the strategic context and the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, it does state that the Forum Leaders endorsed the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, espousing their vision for the Pacific as a region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity so that all Pacific people can live free, healthy and productive lives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst much of our livelihood is derived from the ocean to a large extent, it has also become an avenue of great vulnerability to our nations. The Blue Pacific Strategy seeks to foster security and peace in the region, and the Boe Declaration on the other hand, affirms that the extended concept of security addresses the wide range of security issues in the region, both traditional and non- traditional. I am sure we are familiar with these documents, there are six strategic areas: (1) Climate Change-being high in the list; (2) Human Security issues; (3) Resource Security issues; (4) Environmental issues; (5) Cyber-Security issues; and (6) Trans-National Crime. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are noble aspirations, and we acknowledge Government for that. Of course, our people deserve to live in an environment where security is guaranteed, and peace is abound. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last couple of months, we have been overwhelmed with the report of major drug finds and the impacts of drug abuse within our societies, and much of these have succumb to our shores via our oceans. I know the honourable Minister for Home Affairs is doing his best in terms of monitoring of our vast ocean that we have, given the limited resources that we have, but we are thankful to the partnership, particularly SDG17 on partnership that will help us to ensure that we have a secure region.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1375 May I just conclude in the few remaining seconds, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to emphasise that, again, we are moving out to the region, but section 13 of the Climate Change Act 2021 stipulates our responsibilities in as far as oceans is concerned. Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I know that it comes under your portfolio, particularly on the National Ocean Policy Steering Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is a very important Committee. I know that it has been started previously, and I followed up with your staff, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, they have been meeting regularly, which is good, but that is a very, very important Committee not only for Fiji, but particularly linking us. We have just completed SIDS 4 in Antigua and Barbuda. These are all issues that are relevant, and you have raised these issues too, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Tonga, during the Pacific Islands Parliaments Group (PIPG) meeting last year. We look forward to this, as I have said, it is a new concept, but we look forward to its implementation and we thank the honourable Prime Minister again, and the Government for this initiative. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate for your contribution. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to first thank the honourable Prime Minister and acknowledge his Ministerial Statement on such a very important matter for the world today. The world is crying for peace, and everyone wants peace, including this part of the world - the Pacific, we call our home. The fundamentals of peace in this part of the world has already been articulated very well by the honourable Prime Minister. I have had to take the time to follow his earlier speeches, not only here but also in the region, as well in the way that he has presented to the global world. What is ahead of us are the challenges of the ‘20 fast century’. I say ‘20 fast’ not the ‘21st’ world. The world is moving so fast that there are things that you and I can control, and there are things that we cannot control, and one of which is conflict. Mr. Speaker, from our group this side, we endorse, acknowledge and fully support the Government’s effort, led by the honourable Prime Minister, to put into place an ocean of peace. Not long ago, this part of our home was referred to as the ‘arc of instability.’ The honourable Prime Minister is quite familiar with that. We were labelled as the arc of instability. From our view on this side of the House, it is about time that we change this into the Ocean of Peace or the Arc of Peace, Prosperity and Stability. Our view from this side, Mr. Speaker, that the way forward to bring the world to our part of the Pacific that we create the right environment, the right situation, and we have in place leaders that not only foster and stand on the firm belief for peace, we create the environment of peace. We wish the honourable Prime Minister well, as he embarks on the next Pacific Islands Forum meeting, which we believe this is where it is going to be discussed and endorsed. We wish you well, honourable Prime Minister, as you posture our part of the world as the Ocean of Peace. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we adjourn for tea, honourable Members, I would like to add that we have also just returned from our recent trip to Indonesia to a regional meeting, including the Pacific. They are identifying themselves as having their borders within the Pacific Ocean, and they were looking forward to knowing how best we can address issues that were outstanding, especially in trying to address what the honourable Prime Minister has just said. We turn it into an Ocean of Peace – the ocean that brings us together</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1376</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 and identifies us together, should be a catalyst for peace within our region. We are so grateful to hear that this morning, and that will be something that will be pursued, subject, of course, to the various ratifications that we have undersigned as a country, to guide us in the Pacific as well, as highlighted by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. That, honourable Members, is certainly a worthy cause to pursue, especially in the name of peace within our region. It would be remiss of me as well not to acknowledge, even though the honourable Prime Minister has sounded his acknowledgement, on the presence in the gallery of some students, I understand, with same coloured shirts which is known locally as kalavata, and I apologise I do not have information here with me as to where you are from, but we appreciate your presence this morning in the gallery in being with us as the honourable Members deliberate on issues that are before them. We invite you as well to the tea that you may share with honourable Members. Honourable Members, the House is now adjourned for tea, and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.30 a.m.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1377 The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we shall now move on. I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications to deliver his Statement. Update on the Business Mission to North America HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; bula vinaka and good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to provide a Ministerial Statement of the update on the Business Mission to North America that was held on 4 th May, 2024 to 14 th May, 2024. The Business Mission served as a crucial platform for fostering bilateral relations, enhancing trade and economic relations with the North America region and, most importantly, reconnecting or rekindling our connections with our diaspora. The Business Mission was organised in partnership with Investment Fiji, the Fiji Trade Commission of North America, and the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. It featured business forums, networking diaspora events, business meetings, site visits, and meetings with government officials, investors across three locations, namely, Surrey in British Columbia, San Francisco and California in the USA, and Toronto in Ontario, Canada. It was an absolute honour, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to lead this unique Fijian delegation composed of Government representatives, private sector investors, and our exporters. Not only was this a large mission to the North American Region, which had over 25 Delegates representing wide range of businesses and agencies, we also visited the three separate locations, as I have mentioned. Members of the Fiji Delegation included senior representatives from Investment Fiji, the Ministry of Trade, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), Fiji Airways, iTaukei Land Trust Board (TLTB), BSP Life (Fiji) Ltd, Outsource Fiji, Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, the Trade Commission, and we were accompanied by Fiji's Honorary Consuls. The Fiji delegation also included exporters from Agro Marketing Authority of Fiji, Green Kavalicious (Fiji) Pte Ltd, Pleass Global Ltd, Ranviz Fresh Farm Produce, Sea and Soil Fiji, Lami Kava, Green Gold Kava, and Road King Farms. Given this Mission had both an Investment Delegation and an Exporter Delegation, separate programmes were coordinated on selected days where the investment delegation had separate meetings from the exporters. The exporter delegation engaged in Fiji and Island Stores, warehouse, distributor visits, and had an opportunity to meet and engage in dialogue with store owners on Fiji products, particularly in the Bay Area, United States, and also in Ontario, Canada, and Surrey. The Business Forums were the marquee events at each location, which enabled delegations to present to invited participants on Fiji's economic overview, investment opportunities, business environment and incentives, key travel statistics, Fiji tourism sector, key markets and future plans.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1378</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Agencies, such as Outsource Fiji, TLTB and the Ministry of Lands presented in the Business Forums together with FNPF and BSP Life. Notably, Sir, at the Business Forum in San Francisco, senior executives from both Google and the Wonderful Company presented on their investments and plans for Fiji, and it set the stage for two of Fiji's largest investors to speak very positively about their potential and future plans. In that meeting, Fiji Water or Wonderful Company made the announcement about commercial agriculture in Fiji. We, on this side of the House believe that it is a transformative announcement for our country. At the same time, Google, which is approaching its entry date to Fiji, which is sometimes this year, announced or reconfirmed their entry into Fiji and the exciting prospects that lay ahead in terms of our engagement between us and Google. The Business Forums offered exporters an opportunity to display their products and to present their products to the invited participants. This provided an opportunity for businesses and importers from North America to engage. It was also seen that the presence of our diaspora is quite large, and for me, Mr. Speaker, very exciting. Canada particularly is a place where we have perhaps neglected over the years, in particular in Ontario where the mission provided a great platform to reconnect with our diaspora and meet with our business leaders and government officials and re-introduce their country of birth to them and invite them to come and do business at home. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the three Business Forums, there was a significant number of high level trade and investment-related meetings. This included meetings with senior representatives of Google at their Google Cloud Campus. We also visited the Wonderful Company’s Pomegranate and Solar Facility in Del Ray, San Francisco which probably forbodes what the Wonderful Company or Fiji Water plans to do in Fiji. They plan to replace their currently diesel- powered factory with solar. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as some of our diaspora members would say or I would like to say, they have become "sleeper agents" in North America. As I have mentioned, we have invited them to return home and together rebuild Fiji. I would like to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hardworking people in North America who worked behind the scenes to ensure not only the success of the Business Mission, but we were welcoming warmed as if we never left Fiji. In Surrey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were honoured to be accorded a traditional welcome by the Semiahmoo First Nations and the iTaukei community. This event was coordinated by our iTaukei Cultural Society in British Columbia, including a talanoa session at the Peace Arch Heritage Hall in Surrey. The Fijian Association of Canada also hosted a community event with discussions focused on diaspora investment, tourism growth and economic diversification at the Fijian Centre in Surrey Canada. The Fiji Association of Canada has been the cornerstone of for the diaspora unity for the past 56 years, making it the largest Fijian Association outside Fiji. At San Francisco, a talanoa session was also organised for the Bay Area diaspora, where they were informed of investment opportunities and incentives in Fiji, along with issues and challenges faced by the diaspora community there. In Ontario, Canada, the Fiji an Association of Ontario warmly welcomed the Fiji delegation and hosted us to both the networking and community business event. As we proactively continue to rebuild Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure our diaspora community in North America that we have heard their concerns and raised them in the margins of the business mission and are working towards addressing their issues. The Coalition Government, of course, will try and ensure that their issues are addressed. We are working closely with the Fiji Immigration Department to address some issues raised by our diaspora regarding passports and</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1379 citizenship services, and hopefully we can provide some solutions in the near future. Mr. Speaker, Sir I would like to talk briefly about kava. The opportunity to meet with the US-based kava association and various actors in the kava sector was indeed timely to capitalise on the large growing market for kava in the United States of America. During the mission, Fiji’s kava exporters who were part of the delegation met key large western market and Pacific Island diaspora buyers who import and distribute kava to kava bars, retail and online. Just as an aside, Sir, there are about 400 kava bars in the West Coast including Miami, and they are growing at about 10 per month, I am told. As the kava industry is anticipated to become a billion-dollar industry in the future, the Business Mission reinforced the desire to continue to pursue the Kava Bill in the interest to protecting the kava industry and establishing quality and food safety standards of Fiji’s kava. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is huge potential in kava. We, as a country need to play our part and ensure that kava exported to the United States of America meets the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and import requirements, and of course, by extension creates more jobs and wealth in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the leg to Ontario, we did meet with the Government of Ontario. I had the privilege of meeting the Premier of Ontario and the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, honourable Doug Ford, a very inspirational leader, where we had very positive discussions around areas of mutual understanding, cooperation and opportunities for trade and investment. I also had the opportunity to meet with the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in Ontario, honourable Ted Arnott, and the delegation was provided a private tour and welcomed in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Subsequently, we met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, honourable Lisa Thompson, and the Associate Minister for Small Business, Economic Development and Job Creation, honourable Ninan Tangri with discussions that centred around potential areas for collaboration and support. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Ontario, we also attended some high level meetings and networking events. A significant one was, of course, being hosted to a private invite only networking event by the Toronto- Dominion (TD) Bank Group. The TD Bank Group is one of the five largest Banks in Canada. We were invited by senior members of that Bank to share the perspectives on Fiji. There are some potential leads that have come out of that discussion. In North America, we also had very fruitful discussions along the way. Mr. Speaker, I guess in terms of trade missions, there is always the question of what you are bringing back to your home country. I am pleased to report that in terms of potential investment generated from the meetings, there was about $108 million leads generated through trade and investment potential, and that is excluding the $200 million that is currently going to be invested by Google in the Data Centre. I am happy to report that there will be delegations from Canada coming into Fiji very soon. Mr. Speaker, from what we saw during the visit, there is substantial potential in the North American region for trade and investment, including diaspora investment. This mission has acted as a platform to connect with the diaspora, meet current and potential investors, develop networks and strengthen our relationships between Government agencies and partners of Fiji. I wish to assure this august House that we will continue to explore and strengthen our networks in the North American region. The Canadian opportunity, Sir, is quite exciting particularly when it has the same demographics and dynamics as the Australian economy, and it is almost like as if we were entering another major opportunity when we visited Canada. We look forward to further engagements with Canada and the Canadian businesses over the next few months.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1380</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Before I end, Mr. Speaker, I would like to place on record my appreciation for those who helped particularly those on the ground that helped with putting together of the event, I particular name the Honorary Consuls in the United States of America and Canada and Mr. Sam Basra, who was instrumental in putting together the visit to Canada. Mr. Speaker, on all matrices, this visit by this Government into North America has been a success and we look forward to continuing to work together with both the United States of America and Canada to explore the opportunities that lie ahead of us. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Members of Parliament and Ministers, first of all, let me say congratulations to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade for recognising the importance of that particular region with respect to furthering Fiji’s trade, et cetera to North America. Mr. Speaker, this has actually been an ongoing issue with respect to North America in terms of bringing investment into Fiji and also growing our export market as rightfully pointed out by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. One of the most important issues that needs to be attended to and is critical as a component in all of these, is to ensure that our biosecurity pathways are cleared. I know the honourable Minister is hard at work trying to ensure that all of that is done, because one of the most important things for us in terms of foreign exchange, et cetera is cargo export. Right now, Fiji’s kava market, most of the kava is actually consumed locally, if I am correct, Sir, I think it is only 8 percent that actually gets exported. It is a huge following in North America. As rightfully pointed out, there are kava bars popping up everywhere. So, there is a demand for all of these, Mr. Speaker, and from what I understand, it only takes five days for a packed kava parcel to go from here to Montreal. There is room for Fiji to make considerable amount of money in North America in that industry and I take my hat off to the honourable Minister and I wish him well with respect to endeavouring into the kava industry and making it more viable for Fiji to export to Canada. This is one of the countries, there are issues that need to dealt with with Health Canada. I am glad that he actually met the Minister for Agriculture also in Canada and try and get these things ironed out. One of the other things also, Sir, we must realise that we have a huge diaspora that actually lives in that particular portion of the world. Pre 1987, Fiji had a visa free to Canada and I am hoping also that the honourable Minister managed to have some discussions with respect to that issue because we have a huge diaspora and I think pretty much quite a few people who live in Fiji have relatives there. It would be an important issue that would go hand-in-hand with our trade with them. In terms of the rest of the North America, the trade that actually happens, the larger number out of the figures comes from Fiji Water export. We need to increase our trade and I think that is the only region where the balance of trade is in our favour, most of the places around the world are not in our favour but this is a one place and its comes out of the export of Fiji Water. We are exporting less to that particular region and these kinds of missions are important for us to grow our export sector, but at the same time, the encouragement also needs to come for our local growers to try and pursue those avenues. This is why I pointed out the issue regarding biosecurity. Mr. Speaker, Canada also has a growing e-commerce industry. It exports many other things also, but it has a growing e-commerce industry and I hope the honourable Minister managed to tap into some people there to see if there was room for improvement and investment into Fiji. The travel and tourism industry also is something that is important to North America. These were discussions that were ongoing for many, many years but nothing has actually come to provision.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1381 I will wait, Mr. Speaker, to see how many of these projects that have come on board will come into fruition and I am hopeful that Investment Fiji will facilitate them as quickly as possible because I know that one of the things that comes out of this North Americans is that, they want things done quickly, approvals and processes, et cetera need to take place really quickly so that they can get their projects into the space and actually start exporting and importing whatever it is that they need to do. One area that I am not sure if the honourable Minister managed to tap into, they have a huge cannabis industry also and I think the medicinal cannabis industry that the honourable Minister has spoken about earlier, they are certainly experts in that particular area and I hope the honourable Minister managed to speak to some people to see if we can get some assistance whether we should be doing that or not. With those few words, I thank the honourable Minister for a well led mission. I think the right amount of people and the right people actually went across and most definitely, Sir, from our perspective too we have heard some positive reports regarding the mission that actually went across. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade for his Statement this morning on the important work of diversifying a market, trying to improve, increase the sphere of our trade. There is a commodity that Fiji has, that is, our mahogany. Our mahogany is the second largest plantation in the world, second to Brazil. Very unique feature of our mahogany they say is that because it has those pin knots. Fiji mahogany has got those little black dots. I think that is a commodity as we go into our trade missions that we need to advertise or promote more because right now our mahogany usually goes down to America via South America, and it is really timber. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one time, I sounded out a very rich businessman, a billionaire in fact and I asked him about mahogany in Fiji, I said, “what would you do with the mahogany if it belonged to you?” He basically said, “Mahogany is a rich man’s furniture. I would process it halfway here in Fiji so that we can get employment, a bit of down streaming and then send it across to one of those companies that do those signature furniture’s, put their signature on it and sell it.” I urge the honourable Deputy Prime Minister in further trade missions that we should be trying to promote our mahogany products, not only the timber but ways in which we can tap into those niche markets because ours is a plantation mahogany. In countries in South America where mahogany grows freely, there is a lot of restrictions put on it because of deforestation in the areas where they grow. On the other point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on our diaspora, there is this big problem that we are facing now which is brain drain and the way to perhaps arrest brain drain is to turn it into a brain drain gain. As they go out, they go and invest, they learn how to run their businesses, they are well educated, but we would like to turn that brain drain into a brain drain gain, and that gain comes when our policies, for them here locally, is correct - policies with immigration and how they can come back, policies with how they can come in and set up their businesses. I know that we had a seen this big flow of people out of Fiji, as brain drain but we can turn that around, Mr. Speaker, Sir, into a brain drain gain by looking at the policies that we have to ensure that it can attract them to come back and share with us the expertise that they have and help build our country as well. Again, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Statement. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Minister for Education to deliver his Statement.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1382</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Update on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members of Parliament; I thank you for the opportunity to present my Ministerial Statement, providing an update on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS) and the new initiatives for 2025. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Coalition Government, I would also like to wish TSLS a happy 10th Year Anniversary. Sir, the Coalition Government is making serious strides towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on quality education. The TSLS plays a critical role by ensuring that the targets on increasing access to tertiary education for youth, including girls, and people with disabilities are met through innovative scholarship and study grant policies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must also thank the TSLS Board, the CEO and Management for coming up with recommendations for new initiatives and value adding to existing schemes in the 2024-2025 Budget, which are based on the premise and rationale to allow greater access for human capital development to commensurately mitigate loss of labour through migration and have demand-driven skills sets. As announced and passed in the 2024-2025 National Budget, $150.5 million is allocated to sponsor 10,830 new, and to continue to fund 9,940 sponsored students, and this allocation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the highest ever for new intakes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS came up with a recommendation to introduce two new overseas schemes for cost sharing overseas PhD and Masters Scholarship and merit-based Postgraduate Diploma specialisation in in-service overseas scholarship. I thank TSLS for this initiative, as we need more people with specialist qualification to continue to build intellectual capital in disciplines of Medical and Health Services, Engineering, Climate Change, Marine, Forestry, Public Policy and Analysis, Economic Modelling and Policies, Public Financing and Veterinary Science, and in the fields of social science. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the TSLS for brokering partnerships with four Australian Universities, who will bear tuition fee, whilst Government will take care of stipend and miscellaneous. Funding students for overseas scholarships is highly costly to the taxpayers, as it averages $350,000 to $400,000 for a degree programme. Therefore, the PhD will cost more, and Government would like to thank the following Australian Universities for coming onboard on this scheme with TSLS. They are: (1) Western Sydney University; (2) Swinburne University of Technology; (3) University of Newcastle; (4) Queensland University of Technology; and (5) Monash University who will sign an MOU later to join this scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS came up with a new initiative on Graduate Business Startup Scheme. This was timely, as the Coalition Government wants our graduates to also be job creators. In the 2024-2025 Budget, 30 TSLS sponsored graduates are provided with the opportunity to undergo training and start up a business through training and mentoring by the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation (FCEF), and this initiative will allow graduates to be job creators.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1383 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is taking another bold step by partnering with the employers with specialised training facilities and resources to train students and employ them after successful completion. And I must thank the TSLS for coming up with the idea, as a new scheme of Industry/Employer Based Skills Qualification Scheme will provide opportunity to 300 students to get trained by the Higher Education Commission Fiji (HECF) accredited employer-based providers for skills qualification at Certificate III, IV or Diploma Level 5 Programmes. This will reduce the employer concerns and quality, and this is a game changer scheme to allow TVET to be employer or industry led. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to value add the Micro Qualification Grants, two new categories of White Good Repairs and Existing Micro Business training on book-keeping and marketing are added. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TSLS Board and Management firmly believes in providing transparent information to the public, being the taxpayer-funded organisation. On 2nd August, 2024, TSLS launched the publicly accessible Community Awareness Scholarship Handbook and this is a testament. This is to assist students, parents and guardians to be much more informed and get informed decision on what programmes are offered under TSLS. The handbook can also be accessible online under the TSLS website, www.tsls.com.fj. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS will be conducting Careers Teachers Workshop around the country so that Careers Teachers will also have full information on all the scholarships and grant schemes and are able to provide right advice to students and parents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be followed by school visitations to majority of the schools in Fiji, including the rural and maritime schools, to enlighten the students on the schemes available in the 2024-2025 financial year, the eligibility criteria, application requirements and the application process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has also opened the application for Hardship Assistance Scheme on 2nd August, 2024, to allow those students who have completed Year 1 privately and has a pass rate of 50 percent to be assisted from Semester 2 of 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS will open the application for the first round of Micro-Qualification Grant on 13th September, 2024, followed by the opening of application for all other Schemes in December for the 2025 academic year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TSLS has some remarkable achievements in the last few years. The launch of the in-house developed Employer Connect Portal marks the first of its kind in the Pacific. The portal was developed which allows graduates to search for job vacancies according to area of their specialisation. Sir, the new online application system was also introduced by TSLS which allows students to seamlessly apply for scholarship. The new online application portal is set to redefine the standard of educational support in Fiji. It takes only five minutes to ten minutes to apply, if the applicant has all the pre-requisites. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS is committed to providing students with end-to-end care, which means a lot more is done in terms of providing scaffolding support, than just providing scholarships. It is pleasing to know that TSLS has a three-tier support system which not only caters for its current students, but students who have graduated as well, providing full support from scholarship awarding to employment. In addition to weekly learning sessions for current students, postgraduate care is provided to graduates as a search for employment.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1384</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS reviewed scholarship priority areas and developed a 10-Year Human Capital Development Plan, independently done by Professor Hitendra Pillay, who is an expert from Queensland University of Technology. This plan is now used for allocation of funds for scholarships in the priority areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the strategic priority areas for TSLS in the Strategic Plan is to provide excellent customer service, and I am proud to say, as one of the line Ministers, that TSLS has done remarkably well in this area. On 30th May, 2024, TSLS opened a new office in Nadi and this office is built around this objective, to provide excellent customer services to students in the West. This office has a bigger area for customer service, learning support facility and self-serving student kiosks. I applaud TSLS for increasing its footprint in the Western Division by opening a Nadi Office to serve the South- Western students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in ensuring convenient service to students, TSLS has come forward to take over the function of bond monitoring, travel clearance and full clearance from the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) effective from 1st January, 2025. This will make TSLS a one stop agency for providing investment statements, bond and travel clearance. To effectively carry out this function, the opening of the new Nadi Office will provide convenience to the students and graduates, as it is in close proximity to the International Airport and Immigration Office. The TSLS will work closely with the Department of Immigration for listing and removal of names from the Immigration Controversial list. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has strategic priority focus on ICT transformation. Together with the opening of the new Nadi Office, the new TSLS website and the Sponsorship Information Management System was lodged, which is aligned to this strategic priority. The TSLS is now proving to be amongst the most technologically advanced institutions in Fiji, which suits them as their core clients are tech savvy. The revamped TSLS website is more convenient and easier to use and contains every information that students and stakeholders need to know about the scholarships. The website includes disability-user functions, bond calculator, is highly mobile responsive, user-friendly, and users can access information and online application system from anywhere on any device. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new patent Sponsorship Information Management System is an enhanced version of recording sponsorship data. This shows a continuous commitment of TSLS to improve the management and accessibility of sponsorship data. The newly developed platform includes student module, payment module and integration with the University system, the Ministry of Education’s Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS) and Immigration system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has presence on major social media platforms and a dedicated officer providing service through all the platforms. The online Escalation Complaint Management System ensures that queries are given one day turnaround time. The students can trace their complaints on this system. The online chat service will become 24 hours by next year to the student, as Artificial Intelligent (AI) tools are being added. Currently, it is only from 8.00 a.m. to 4.30p.m. from Mondays to Fridays.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1385 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Board, the CEO and the Management of TSLS for envisioning and putting service at the forefront of its function. The institution has won a Fiji Business Excellence Award at the Commitment Level twice and this external and independent testament of operational and management excellence is the indication that TSLS as a 10-year-old institution is a trailblazer. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seek your understanding and approval to submit a copy of the TSLS 2025 Community Awareness Handbook for the Parliamentary recording purposes, and I offer my best wishes to the Board, the CEO, staff and students for the better utilisation of the Government support system that is now being provided. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak in reply. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; first and foremost, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Education for his Ministerial Statement on the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (TSLS). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tertiary Education and Loan Scheme (TELS) was introduced in 2014 with the focus of achieving the best educational outcomes for Fiji and ensuring that funding is spent on scholarship and loans, which would result in contributing to Fiji’s economic growth, workforce development and livelihood. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TSLS has spent $1.44 billion from the Budget to assist approximately 68,000 students in its last 10 years of operation. The total amount of taxpayers’ money spent has indicated a huge contribution to Fiji that is prioritised through tertiary education and training programmes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, all students meeting the educational requirements at any tertiary institution were given loans, but that is not the case today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many students who have received admission into programmes at universities but are studying privately. This is because they did not qualify for a scholarship or loan. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Government established a sustainable funding model for tertiary education by creating a revolving fund for future students intending to study in tertiary institutions. Unfortunately, this Government has created an unsustainable financial model where, every year, taxpayers fork out around $150 million for tertiary education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, $150 million could have gone towards public goods, hospitals, roads, bridges and other important developments. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. H. CHAND.- The Government is given budgetary support by Australia and New Zealand. Students in these countries are on higher education contribution scheme, not like ours. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality is that many of our graduates are now sitting at home without jobs and many more will join them. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor!</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1386</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 HON. H. CHAND.- The Government has imposed 50 percent penalties for forfeiting bonds, if they wish to seek opportunities offshore. How does this help our graduates or the economy? Remittances sent by unemployed students working abroad can contribute positively to our foreign exchange. Unfortunately, this Government is not creating jobs, but punishing the unemployed graduates. HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolute shame! HON. H. CHAND.- The Government decision to write off students’ debts has forced over $600 million directly equating to the current budget deficit. Converting the students loan scheme to a scholarship is not sustainable for a small economy like ours. Even larger economies like Australia, continue to maintain a loan scheme for tertiary education. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I thank the honourable Minister this morning for his Ministerial Statement - a very educational one, and I also beg to differ from honourable Hem Chand in terms of his response this morning, given that the TSLS was a making of the previous Administration, but the statement this morning by the honourable Minister talks about how this particular institution has developed. The announcement of the budget more recently, it has developed the four new scholarship schemes that are in the TSLS and also the value adding and expanding of existing schemes which we are very happy about. It also considers other areas like micro qualification grant to mitigate skills shortage for labour and targeting unemployed youths. One of the statements that was just made by the honourable Member just before me in terms of unemployment, those who have graduated but are unemployed. One classic example was when we had our Women’s Parliament last week. The Sergeant at Arms, the lady police was a Bachelor of Science graduate, but was recruited by the Fiji Police Force. This is how they are creating employment. In terms of graduates, finding other means of employment through the Fiji Police Force, they can further their studies. So, these are some of the things that we must also consider. One of the things that I would like to applaud is the Merit Based Higher Education – Level 7 Scheme. Sir, $27.4 million has been awarded, it will be catering for 700 awards under this scheme. From these awards, it will reserve for rural and maritime for Year 13 students 100 awards. This is very important because in the previous administration where we had awards cut off marks and some of our students from the maritime areas and rural areas, they were left off because of the cut-off marks. We are thankful that we are given 100 awards from the 700 awards that will be reserved for rural and maritime areas. Given the standard of our secondary schools in rural and maritime areas, they are not the same as those in the urban areas. The other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is in terms of the Apprenticeship Scheme that is also under TSLS where $1 million would be allocated for the Scheme and 50 percent tuition fee to encourage employers to pay apprenticeship students to offset expenses or provide wages top-up. This is something that is welcomed for the Industrial Attachment Allowance Scheme that is also under TSLS. I would like to thank the TSLS Board and also the CEO, Dr. Hasmukh Lal, for the innovation that has been done. In other areas where TSLS can also improve is taking up other courses for other disciplined forces like the RFMF TFs that are already there that can be used so that they can get</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1387 permanent employment or employment rather than waiting for calls to come on duty in the camp. Those are a few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of my contribution this morning and our response and I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement this morning and also to all the students out there in the university, we wish you all well in your education. Maritime Pine Project HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, I rise to deliver my statement on the Maritime Pine Project carried out by the Ministry of Forestry, in collaboration with our partners Fiji Pine Limited, Fiji Pine Trust and the landowners. Mr. Speaker, our logging operations in the maritime islands is a vital project that contributes to our economy and supports our local communities. It is also a project where the Government has also re-strategised and invested heavily since this financial year; recognising and addressing the situation of resource owners on these islands. Mr. Speaker, the Government introduced the Maritime Pine Package Project with the aim of ensuring the sustainable use and management of maritime pine resources through investments in machines, skills training and inventory of pine resources. The project was introduced to support maritime communities to use their mature pine plantation resources for the construction of their houses or needed renovations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since logging contractors from the mainland find it unprofitable to barge logs or timber across to the mainland and sell them, the Government stepped in to support by subsidising part of the operations through the purchase of portable sawmill machines. The main objective is to support the maritime islands’ pine schemes to be equipped with appropriate harvesting machines and tools with the capacity to economically harvest, process and market their matured pine trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overall socio-economic impact of this project is to improve the livelihoods of maritime villages. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work started in Cicia and in Gau. Since then, the Government has been injecting funding support into the harvesting and processing of maritime pine plantations as a capital project in the annual budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Maritime Pine Development Programme, the Ministry has been able to support maritime islands to develop their pine industry as well as provide timber to local communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are various measurable outputs and outcomes from these maritime projects, support and beneficiaries including the communities, private sector and the nation as a whole. For our maritime communities, there are financial benefits, for example, in in Muani, payment of $60 per tonne of logs to landowners resulting so far in a total payout of $0.8 million. This direct financial support will enhance the livelihoods of the local landowners and their families. Secondly, there are employment opportunities for communities, the project will create numerous job opportunities in logging, transportation and port operations, leading to increase employment in the local communities.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1388</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Thirdly, infrastructure development, the construction and upgrading of port facilities guided by the Fiji Roads Authority will improve local infrastructure, providing long term benefits to the communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the private sector will also benefit firstly through economic activity. The release of $647,000 to Tropik Wood Industries Limited will stimulate economic activity within the private sector through barge subsidy. Secondly, business opportunities, logistics and transportation sectors will benefit from the movement of six barge loads, each carrying 2,000 tonnes of logs, creating new business opportunities and partnership. Thirdly, sustainable practices, by adhering to sustainable logging practices, the private sector can demonstrate its commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate responsibility, enhancing its reputation and ensuring long-term viability. For the nation as a whole, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also a significant benefits: (1) Expected economic growth - the overall economic contribution of this logging operation, including job creation and business opportunities will support national economic growth. (2) Sustainable development - the project aligns with our national goals of promoting sustainable practices, ensuring that our natural resources are managed responsibly for future generations. (3) Enhance agriculture – the improvements in port facilities and related infrastructure will have lasting positive impacts on national logistics and trade capabilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example, the project has been able to provide timber to build more than 50 housing structures. This has a total estimated value of more than $400,000. Harvesting has proven extremely fruitful over the life of the project. We have seen harvesting in the village of Waiqori in Oneata with a total log volume of 160 meters cubed, sawn timber of 92 metres cubed and 19 housing structures built. Tubou and Levuka Villages on Lakeba have log volume of 70.601 metre cubed, sawn timber at 40.591 metre cubed and eight housing structures built. Nasau and Korotolu Villages on Moce Island, a total of 129.979 metre cubed sawn timber, 73.919 metre cubed and a total of 15 housing structures built. The village of Mataso in Kadavu with a total of 450 metres cubed of log volume, sawn timber of 256 metres cubed and a total of 15 housing structures built. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also seen the development of vital infrastructure, for example, the construction and inauguration of a jetty in Muani, Kadavu to enable the export of logs. The first logging barge departed in June this year. The Narocake Pine Scheme in Gau has also been assisted through the Ministry of Forestry’s Pine Development Capital Project in processing pine posts. The Ministry has committed a total of $25,000 and produced a volume of 79 cubic metres worth of $59, 724 from the sales. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these funds, the Narocake Pine Scheme was able to purchase a three-tonne canopy truck. Together with the assistance from the Ministry of Trade and Co-operatives, the scheme managed to develop the Narocake Co-operative Limited as part of our community development programme using the Fiji Pine Trust Grant under Head 32 on Maritime Development. Mr. Speaker, Moala and Lakeba has also been assisted through the Housing Rehabilitation Programme - 15 houses in Moala and 11 houses in Lakeba had been provided for with a total value of more than $150,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the coming financial year, the Ministry will continue to expand maritime pine projects to ensure the socio-economic benefits of the forestry sector, including rehabilitation, rebuilding and economic development are extended to our maritime communities. This year, we have a number of planned activities to further this objective and we will continue to support logistics for commercial pine development, which includes the port construction at Wainiyabia, Lakeba and Solodamu, Kadavu. We will conduct a sustainable forest management for villages in Kadavu, Lakeba</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1389 and Gau. We have Rehabilitation Integrated Restocking Programme with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Forestry’s research and development for Muani, including planting short term agricultural produce to combat food security, planting of grasses to prevent wash-off sediments, the planting of food trees and financial literacy training in collaboration with the Ministry of Co- operatives and other financial institutions. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also partake in the felling, sawmilling, timber treatment and marketing of the Narocake Pine Scheme, Lakeba Pine Scheme and the Kadavu Pine Scheme. The support will include the purchase of equipment to assist in the felling of logs, processing of logs, ensuring consistent management of machines, treatment of the logs as well as marketing the finished timber product. We will continue to support the maritime islands pine scheme using our commercial maritime pine subsidy in barge and boat fare to ensure the commercial viability of these projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the collaboration and support we receive from the Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Pine Trust is invaluable to the success of the project. We thank them for the invaluable contributions to our maritime communities. The Ministry will continue to work closely with Fiji Pine Trust. This year the total budget allocated for Fiji Pine Trust under the Capital Grant is $1.7 million. In addition to working with Fiji Pine Trust in developing a 20-Year Forest Management Plan, with harvesting schedules for all pine schemes in the maritime islands, we will work with the Fiji Pine Trust on the activities mentioned above, including the development and construction of the jetties, silviculture including the establishment of a pine nursery in Kadavu, training awareness and business support for pine scheme workers. It is through Fiji Pine Limited’s subsidiary Tropik Wood Industries Limited that the logs are processed through Fiji’s largest sawmill, producing both woodchip mill for export and being an independent power producer, exporting excess power to the national grid. MR. SPEAKER.- Finally the Wainiyabia Wharf is going to be constructed. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the honourable Minister for her Ministerial Statement on the maritime projects and the things that the Government has been doing. I noticed also the amount of money in investment that is going into this particular sector. We have had maritime pine around the islands over many years - Lakeba, Kadavu, Lomaiviti and various places. It is good to see that the emphasis that is taking place that should help out the people in the maritime islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the forestry sector, if there is one big crisis that is happening in this sector, that if we are not too careful in the few years ahead of us, the sector will run out of raw materials. There is basically a shortage of trees that is happening, this is impacting Tropik Wood right now, and I think Fiji Pine in particular there is a particular concern for this. This calls upon the forestry sector in Fiji to be innovative in the way it approaches what it tries to do. I was very glad to hear about all the economics, the plans that are in place to provide assistance for the people in the villages. I was actually in Dravuwalu and Mataso Villages earlier this year. It is good that we have the plans but one of the problems that we have is execution; you have a plan and a budget and execution. When I was in Mataso this year, the sawn timber that had been cut down in the forest had still not been brought down to the village, it was rotting in the forest. I think it is very important for us to realize that when you have these plans, the execution is absolutely critical. In the village of Mataso,</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1390</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 one of the things that was in the agreement was, I do not know what the term is, in our iTaukei na sui ni vale; the main timber for the houses. They were to do 15, they only did seven. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Oh! HON. J. USAMATE.- There is timber that is out there that is cut, that is rotting away. Some of the houses that they were going to build in Mataso and around Kadavu, they were supposed to have the direct post that goes right from the ground to the top of the house. (Honourable Government Member interjects) HON. J. USAMATE.- In the forest there, these thing are rotting. What I am saying is, the plans are very good, they need to be executed well because when you go to these villages people complaining on the ground. Sometimes there is a hassle between the Fiji Pine and the Pine Trust of Fiji as to who is responsible; that is very important. The other thing that is very important, one thing that has always been in the forestry sector, they have always said, “we are asset rich but cash poor.” This is the same too for the islands. If you go to some of the islands, Lakeba, I am Vola Ni Kawa Bula in Lakeba, I planted pine in Lakeba in the villages of Nasaqalau and Waciwaci... (Honourable Government Members interject) HON. J. USAMATE.-..but the people complain about the returns not coming to them. They are not getting those returns on the ground where people matter. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- This is the complaint. I was in my Bose ni Yavusa last Saturday, that is what they were talking about. (Honourable Government Member interjects) HON. J. USAMATE.- So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we have these high and mighty plans, very good. But make sure you execute it, make sure you make it happen so that the people on the ground can get some returns in their pockets. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- This is absolutely critical:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, one of the things that I must say too for the forestry sector, one that has been a private company in Fiji now that they are looking (because of this shortage of raw products that we have) to innovate, to look at new kinds of things that they should plant. Xinfa which has two solars in Vanua Levu, they are beginning to do tissue culture of acacia and eucalyptus. Why? Because they mature much faster and we need these raw materials to go into the sawmills to produce those things. I encourage the Ministry of Forestry and the whole sector, what you are doing is good, do fix the execution, make sure it reaches the bottom, do not just look at your outputs, ticking your boxes, make sure you have an impact on the outcomes on people’s lives. Secondly, being innovative in what you are doing. If you have done quite well in the past, you also need to be innovative, maybe these other forestry products and trees we need to look at; acacia and eucalyptus, things that mature faster because our sawmills are running out of inputs of the raw material to allow them to maintain the employment that we talk about, to maintain the industries</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1391 that they feed into. Overall, this sector, exports have been declining, imports have been increasing. So, I value this, honourable Minister congratulations with this, just make sure we hit the execution right and we make sure it makes an impact on the people on the grassroots. MR. SPEAKER.- Your concern is noted given the likely shortage of our timber supply to the sawmills, et cetera. But that problem has existed for quite some time. Even my time as a Director of Fiji Pine Limited, because good raw timber for milling were converted to chips, but now that concern still lingers on, and I hope the Ministry of Forestry takes note. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for her statement this morning on the Maritime Pine Scheme, very much long-awaited by those that own pine in the maritime areas. As she had presented this morning, it is also triggering a lot of developments and economic activities in those islands where they are harvesting from. I would like to throw a bit of caution in the whole process and, that is, as we harvest the pine in these islands, I am suggesting that there is a study made as to whether it is proper to replant the pine, or you turn that land into farming land. Over the years, I think, if there is a study at the Ministry and when I was the Permanent Secretary there, I saw that some of the pine were initially brought to Fiji to be planted in areas where you cannot plant anything else. When it grew, it thrived, and it turned into an industry. But what happened over the years as pine grew, the land began to be fertile for farming, especially in those islands where land is not as big, there is a shortage of land, and for those land where pines are planted, a study can be made if that can be turned into farmland, then please do not replant pine and then turn it into farmland. There is also a study that would be lying down there in the Ministry when we had this big flood in the West few years ago. One of the reasons we concluded was that, that landslide that was happening because of the way we replant pine. As you know, when pine is harvested, before you replant you have to burn down where it was harvested so that the glue that is in the pine is all burnt out. It attracts insects that will eat the new pine plant that you will plant. However, in the process of burning it down, it burns holes down where the stems of the pines are cut off and so you have these holes in the ground and we thought that when it rained heavily at that time, water seeped into those holes where the pine trees were, and it assisted in that big landslide that occurred. So, if you are going to replant in the islands, and you know all those pines are up on the hills, I hope that there is also a study that is made that we have to replant that. It does not trigger off this landslide of whatever land is available there now. Thank you again to the honourable Minister for the maritime pine project. I know that it is a project that they have been waiting for, for a long time, and I hope that it will be pursued well.</p></body>
