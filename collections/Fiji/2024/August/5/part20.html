(b) Against what standards and quality were their courses benchmarked to, to justify receiving a grant of $7 million in the last 18 months; The Polytech has been benchmarked against the standards established by the Higher Education Commission of Fiji (HECF) and has met these standards. Announcement of grants approved to any higher education institution is one thing, but actual funds are only released as delivered, spent, and properly acquitted by the institutions with documentary evidence. Pacific Polytech has received $2,260,000 since starting operations in 2021/22. All the award programmes have either been developed by the HECF or developed by the Pacific Polytech are scrutinized and subsequently approved by the HECF. The HECF was created under the Higher Education Act 2008. The Higher Education Promulgation was gazetted on 14th October 2008 and came into effect on 1st January 2010 establishing the Fiji Higher Education Commission as an autonomous governance framework that is responsible for standards and qualities in all tertiary institutions. The HECF sets the standards of the National Qualifications and monitors the quality of delivery and assessment. A summary of the mandate of HECF is attached as Appendix 1. All NQs are benchmarked against the Fiji National Quality Standards. These courses are for Fijians from the age of 17 years up, who are not in any form of employment during the period of sponsorship.

These courses are developed in consultation with the specific employer and industry. Courses are in the following broad areas: ➢ Business and management ➢ ICT ➢ Hospitality ➢ Trades &amp; Technology This section of the Polytech is a new section, which has started working with some large employers to provide inhouse training to their employees. The courses are fully funded by the organisations. (c) Two types of assessments were carried out: ➢ Financial: as a standard requirement, as for all other institutions covered by HECF, the Polytech is required to submit spending acquittals to HECF for quarterly grant sums released. Once HECF is satisfied with spending acquittals submitted by PP, only then they authorize to release grant for next quarter. This process is followed before grant for any quarter is released. In addition, submission of audited financial statements of the institutions are mandatory. The Polytech has submitted its all the years for which it has received Government grants. These audits are clean and provide no cause for any concern. ➢ Academic: The HECF monitors the programmes which are funded by government grants. No institution can offer programmes which are not approved by the Commission. All award programmes of the Polytech have received stringent scrutiny, and have been duly approved</p><p>by the Higher Education Commission of Fiji.
