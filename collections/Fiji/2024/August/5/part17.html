<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –SUGAR CANE GROWERS FUND 2019 AND 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – SUGAR CANE GROWERS FUND 2019 AND 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 23 rd May, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund is a statutory body providing affordable loans to sugar cane growers in Fiji with the aim to increase the production of sugar cane, improve efficiency in planting, growing, harvesting and the transportation of sugar cane, also rehabilitate farms and farm buildings and other installations, the damaged, destroyed or affected by floods, cyclones and droughts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee upon being referred with the SCGF 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports undertook site visits to the Western and Northern Divisions and also received public hearing from the Fund headed by the Chief Executive Officer to gather information on the Fund operational dynamics as part of the Committee’s scrutiny process. While the Committee scrutinized the Report, it identified pertinent issues of concern such as: (1) Annual Reports provided by the SCGF failed to include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the periods under review. These indicators are essential for the Committee to make more informed recommendations and to gauge the performance of the organisation. (2) Various assistance programmes provided by the Ministry of Sugar other than SCGF to assist sugarcane farmers in improving their production and quality of cane. For example, Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance, Weedicide and Fertilizer subsidy, funding to improve Cane Access Roads, subsidy to purchase mechanical harvesters, grants</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 1423 to encourage new farmers in the Sugar Sector and Cane Cartage Grant. (3) Utilizing rail transport for cane would prove significantly more cost-effective compared to the current practice of using trucks. Trucks rely heavily on fuel and are subject to escalating fuel prices and contribute to road congestion and cause road damage. Furthermore, the Committee in its Review Report articulated eight findings with recommendations in which the Ministry of Sugar has responded and provide assurance that the Fund will be working in implementing the recommendations to enhance sustainability and efficiency of the Fund and other sugar sectors. The Committee is satisfied with the Annual Reports during the review period. However, we note that there are certain areas that can be improved through more enhanced coordination, commitment, and accountability of all sugar sectors. MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate and before allowing the honourable Members to take the floor, I have a list from the Whips as well: (1) Honourable P. D. Kumar; (2) Honourable Minister for Multi Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; (3) Honourable S. Nand; and (4) Honourable Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this motion. When cane farmers face financial distress or hardship, they rely on the Sugar Cane Growers Fund for their welfare. The Growers Fund provides loans to the cane farmers for personal use and also to increase sugar production, improve efficiency and crop diversification. The Sugar Cane Growers Fund established with farmers money holds a 90.6 percent stake in South Pacific Fertilizers Pte. Limited managed by the Growers Fund Board. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite Government assistance and funding from the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, cane production is declining and there is little crop diversification, and we know the key reason here is the cost of production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee scrutinized all the reports, and they came up with several recommendations but today I will speak specifically on four recommendations which was made by the Committee. Two of these recommendations focused on South Pacific Fertilizers Pte Limited and this is to improve its financial performance and invest in diversified products including the production of natural fertilizers. It is baffling, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the fertiliser company has not ventured into diversified products to become financially viable. They still import and blend fertilisers failing to meet farmers’ demand, farmers need fertilisers tailored to the soil types, but what they get is not based on the soil type. In all these, I question what Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) is doing? They need to be there to see the effectiveness of these fertilisers when they are applied on the farm. The South Pacific Fertilizers Limited has not made any effort to produce natural fertilisers using locally available resources like chicken manure, et cetera, despite high prices of imported fertilisers. Over the years, South Pacific Fertilizers Limited missed the opportunity to become the primary supplier of fertilisers to the non-sugar sector. The company could have built a trusted brand</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1424 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 for farmers across all farming needs, instead it relies on Government subsidies indirectly to stay afloat. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the real issue lies with the Sugar Cane Growers Board of Directors, past and present. The question is, why have they allowed South Pacific Fertilizers Limited to remain stagnant? Is it because Sugar Cane Growers Fund continues to receive dividends at taxpayer’s expense? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also recommended that the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act be reviewed to expand its financial products to non-sugar farmers, making it a financial facility for every farmer needing assistance. This diversification would generate profits, benefitting cane farmers through broader agricultural support at reduced interest rates or even grants. It is encouraging to note that the Ministry of Sugar is pursuing in this direction, leveraging the expertise of the current CEO who is a former banker. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act’s limitation, restricting loans during emergencies such as natural disasters. In this regard, the Ministry of Sugar proposed a solution through the Master Award, but it was turned down by the Sugar Industry Tribunal, citing that Sugar Cane Growers Fund cannot be given preference. This narrow thinking has no place in an industry facing insolvency. Fiji’s sugar industry is in crisis which is well-known by all of us, but it is propped up by past and present government assistance without addressing the fundamental problem. Merely keeping it on life support, each year more taxpayer money is poured into this failing system with no change to the status quo. This is not a sustainable solution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In the new financial year, the Government committed over $68 million to the sugar sector. Will this money improve sugar production? Will it yield the results we hope for? These are the questions that we are posing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry’s troubles are worsened when politicians see the sugar sector as their world bank, engaging in blame games and fill good speeches. Sugar institutions instead of improving sugar production are engaged in political manoeuvring for their survival, obstructing essential reforms as seen during the consultations for the Sugar Bill that was introduced by the previous government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, the Government has decided to spend $200,000 on the Fiji Sugar Cane Growers Council elections. Rather than taking politics out of the sugar sector and focusing on commercial viability, this Government is injecting politics back into the system at the expense of taxpayers who are paying for that. (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- This move undermines the reforms our sugar industry desperately needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry has not undergone necessary reforms due to these obstructions. The previous government's gradual reform to remove politics and establish the industry on a business model must continue. We can no longer afford to spend millions of taxpayer dollars each year on inefficient farmers, millers, and sugar institutions established during the colonial era. We cannot expect these institutions to become efficient and productive under the current structure. Mr. Speaker Sir, the industry structure was designed for a different era, characterized by guaranteed sugar prices under the Lome and Cotonou Agreements. Trade dynamics have changed, yet we expect these colonial-era institutions to perform well. Mr. Speaker Sir, we must learn from countries like Mauritius, which have consolidated, modernized and diversified under the new Sugar Efficiency Act. The mills have diversified into</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 1425 electricity generation, ethanol production and rum. Our learned Minister has been visiting Mauritius quite a bit and we are looking forward to whatever learnings he has received through his study tour, he will be able to implement and bring the industry to a profitable level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all sugar institutions should assist farmers and treat them like kings. Some of these organisations do not efficiently serve the farmers, leaving them to run around to get their matters sorted and this is something we experienced during our field visit. Mr. Speaker Sir, these institutions exist because of the farmers' hard-earned money. Under the Master Award, 70 percent of sugar sales revenue goes to the farmers, and 30 percent to the miller. From the miller’s allocation, SRIF gets some component. Unfortunately, FSC still owes more than $5 million to SRIF. Mr. Speaker Sir, before I take my seat, the only way forward and I want to emphasise to prevent the imminent collapse of the sugar industry is through consolidation, modernisation and diversification. I do understand that the Ministry of Sugar is in the process of hiring a consultant to dive deeper into all these problems and come up with some solutions. We look forward to working with the Government in trying to address some of these problems which is encountered by the sugar sector. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Committee Report on the Consolidated Review Reports of Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must commend the Board, the CEO, the management and staff for the remarkable transformation of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund that had gone under in the recent years under the leadership of its CEO, Mr. Raj Sharma and his new Board. Some of the notable achievements include enhancement of the Governance Framework through the implementation of the various policies including the Compliance Risk Management and Audit. It also includes the continuous review of the products and services, the introduction of a new technology platform and deepening the engagement with the growers and stakeholders. I would also like to applaud the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for its commitment to the international initiatives as the Sustainable Development Goals. A notable programme is the Green Cane Incentive which was recently launched complimenting the Government’s incentives for the supply of green cane. Under this initiative, the farmers will harvest 75 percent or more of the green cane, receive a 2 percent deduction in interest from 6 percent to 4 percent. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund has repositioned itself both, within and outside of the sugar industry. This is evident from the participation and the success of the Fiji Business Excellence Award for the last three consecutive years. We are mindful of the legislation faced by Sugarcane Growers Fund in extending credit services to both, the sugar and non-sugar sectors. The Fund’s strategic intent is to diversify and expand its function for a greater sustainability which is commendable. In this context, the Asian Development Bank was engaged to conduct a debt analysis and develop a roadmap for the Sugarcane Growers Fund to potentially become a licensed financial institution. The Sugarcane Growers Fund’s intentions is to diversify its balance sheet to absorb the unexpected shocks, such as natural disasters and to generate returns to the benefit of sugar which is</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1426 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 noted and encouraged. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugarcane Growers Fund is self-funded and concessionary that were surpluses. It has potential to evolve into a dynamic financial institution, operating on a commercial or semi-commercial basis, with the benefits accruing to the sugar sector as its core founders. The Report also raises concern about the financial performance of the South Pacific Fertilizer Company which the Sugarcane Growers Fund holds 90 percent of shares. We are informed that appropriate actions are taken to address these issues. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must inform Parliament that consultants engaged to the Food and Agriculture Organization are currently conducting a comprehensive study on the sugarcane industry. I want to put on record my sincere appreciation to honourable Sakiusa Tubuna for facilitating our request for FAO at no cost to the Government of Fiji. This study, Mr. Speaker, aims to identify current and the future barriers to the sugar production and provide a policy recommendation to revitalise the industry. While there are concerns over the decline in sugarcane production, despite the availability of the funds from the Sugarcane Growers Fund and the various assistance from the Ministry of Sugar Industry. The FAO report is expected to provide valuable guidance in the development of the comprehensive policy for the industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this report will be presented to us by end of October, to Parliament as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our sugar industry faces a wide range of challenge from social and economic to environment forces. A deep understanding of this challenges is essential to appreciate the industry’s performance. The outcome of the study will offer a clear direction and strategies for the future. The sugar industry has been and will continue to be a significant contributor to the economic growth and development of this nation building. The Sugarcane Growers Fund and its subsidy - SPFL both has vital roles within and beyond the industry’s economic drivers, especially with the ongoing reform of the Sugarcane Growers Fund. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would like to just add on to what honourable Premila has said about the South Pacific Fertilizers and trying to get poultry manure, et cetera, I have initiated the programme and we have been talking to Goodman Fielder, Ram Sami and Sons and Rooster Poultry. They are coming on board to help the Sugar Research Institute and also the fertilizer company to see how we can bring in new fertilizer. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for their contribution and deliberation. Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before the House. Our farmers are the centre of the industry and apart from land leases, the biggest challenge our farmers face is high cost of production. The Sugarcane Growers Fund plays a very vital role in ensuring that funds are available to the farmers in terms of farm development, in terms of production, and also for their private and personal issues, for example, family issues or medical. I would have loved to see a bit of expansion in the loans on types of loans that have been issued to our farmers. The Fund’s services need to be streamlined, and there are three or four institutions that are providing services to our farmers. All these institutions should have a holistic</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 1427 approach, so the farmer gets consolidated information from all the people - everyone sings the same song tune. It is important that apart from providing loans to our farmers, we should ensure that they are capable of managing their finances. Therefore, workshops and seminars on financial management should be the core focus of the Sugarcane Growers Fund, so that our farmers’ capacities is developed and enhanced. Because of our land size and farm size, not all the farmers are able to mechanise, are not able to invest in machinery, therefore, the Sugarcane Growers Fund should exploring options where they can get for smallholder farms tractors that are walk-behind tractors, inputs that can be attached to this, so that the cost of production on the farm decreases. The biggest cost of production on the farm is labour and the inputs. Farmers barely make a living out of the cane farm. If mechanisation is done, if the farms are mechanised, efficiency on the farm will increase. The farmer will be able to get more done in a lesser amount of time. The operations on the farm will increase and there will be a consistent in quality. Labour savings would be another big savings on the farm. Initially, it will be a high cost of investment, but if you spread it over a period time, the farmer wins in terms of savings. The machinery can also be used for diversification. We should strongly encourage our cane farmers to diversify. They should not totally stick to cane production. They should diversify into cash crop production, livestock production, so that each component can complement each other and enhance the farmers’ income. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our objective should be to ensure that our farmers have a sustainable livelihood and that our national agriculture throughput is improved, be it sugar or be it other crops. I believe the sugar industry has the potential to grow, but together with it, the other agricultural commodities have a potential to grow and I would love to see that the Sugarcane Growers Fund provide avenues to our farmers to enable them, whilst they are improving their cane production and improving their farm, they improve their livelihood, they diversify, and have a better standard of living. That is the ultimate goal we should all strive for, ensuring that our farmers, be it sugarcane, be it other diversified products, they should ensure that the Fund supports them, the Fund ensures them, that they can have a sustainable livelihood and a better living standard. With those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister and other honourable Members for the contribution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugarcane Growers Fund was established in 1984 on the Sugar Price Support Fund which was established in 1948 and it was part of a strategy to put aside part of the sugar price for the farmers into a fund for rehabilitation. So, the history is long, the intention was very noble and the Fund, over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has served the farmers very well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for laying out some of the progress that has been made over the last 18 months. However, I was kind of intrigued, happy as well as concerned about the comments made my honourable Premila Kumar. I wish she was able to make those comments when she was in government, because we would not have wasted those four years that she was in government, we might have done something better.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>1428 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I was not looking after sugar:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Regardless of whether you were looking after sugar or not, you were a member of the government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this reference to politics in the sugar industry, is what we used to hear for 16 years. When we had politics, we were doing very well, we were producing 3.2 million tonnes of cane in 2006. After 2006, we lost $350 million because that was the European Union funding. Honourable Kumar knows, we wrote a paper together on the impact of the Lome Convention on the environment and she did a very good thesis, and I must commend her for that, but she has probably forgotten about that. She should have known when she was in government that, that $350 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was precisely directed towards reforming the sugar industry. Countries like Mauritius that she talked about, used European Union funding because the Lome Convention, the preferential prices was going to come to an end, and the European Union was providing all the sugar growing countries, under Lome Convention, with those additional grant funding so that there were three components - improving efficiency at the mill level, improving efficiency at the farm level, improving efficiency for the growers, so that the cost of production per acre went down, and the third component, of course, was alternative livelihood. So, those who wanted to exit the sugar industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be allowed to do that through an appropriate funding. We lost that. They abolished the Growers Council. She referred to a Bill, that was the draconian Bill that they wanted to bring, and if it was not for some of us in the Opposition and growers listened outside Parliament, to do that and that Bill, if there was not that kind of opposition outside of Parliament, would have enslaved the farmers to this day. That is what they were trying to do. What we have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 18 months, is to provide an open political environment that is now more thinking. Honourable Tubuna, an expert in agriculture, working with the FAO. Now, this is a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is thinking and putting together resources and putting more people. We have a very good Chairman for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, we have good CEO, and there are people who are thinking now on how we can improve and get things done for the sugar industry together. As I have said, this is a Government which is not about gimmicks, which is not about fancy stunt, this is a Government which is thinking seriously about the sugar industry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Change is there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> We have changed a lot of things and we are doing things, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But you cannot correct the 16 years of direct deliberate neglect of the industry by the government that she was part of, and some of them are sitting on the other side. She concluded very well, and I thank her for that. I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, going forward, I know the honourable Leader of the Opposition knew about this and going forward, I agree that we should work as a Parliament, and we should come together. The Committee that we have is going to drive the agenda. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we do that, we will cut out all the hogwash, and we will do the right thing</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 1429 (Laughter) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I thank the Committee Members for thinking and getting this Report done. It is a good beginning and I think it will mean well for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund and for the farmers. There is a possibility that the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, as honourable Sachida Nand said which is a good point, could create itself into a much more agile fund, providing additional support for non-sugar crop sectors. This Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, has put in policies. We are now providing subsidies for fertilizer and weedicide for non-sugar crop sectors as well because we believe in diversification. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go to Vanua Levu, you will see the level of interest in the production of cassava, dalo, rice, and you will see Vanua Levu buzzing in many areas because of the deliberate Government policy to support the non-sugar agriculture sector. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there has been quite a lot that has been said about the industry. This week, we will be discussing about the industry. There will be four reports that will be tabled in Parliament. I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their contribution and, of course, I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of our sitting today. I thank you all for your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. in our preparation to receive Her Excellency the President of the Republic of India visiting us after the ceremony at the GPH. The Parliament adjourned at 5.52 p.m.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 108/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Education (Ref.
