<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LANDS ANDMINERAL RESOURCES 2018-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LANDS AND MINERAL RESOURCES 2018-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move; That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2018–2019, 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 Annual Reports which were tabled on 22 nd May, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to present the overview of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources operations for the fiscal year 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. These years have been pivotal as the Ministry navigated various challenges and opportunities in managing Fiji’s land and mineral resources. In 2018-2019 the focus was on enhancing land administration in improving the efficiency of land services. The Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources made significant strides in updating land records and streamlining the land allocation process. Additionally, the Ministry launched initiatives to boost sustainable land management and address environmental concerns. The fiscal year 2019-2020 saw the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources building on these foundations which increase emphasis on strategic resource management and infrastructure development. The Ministry initiated key projects aimed at strengthening the Ministry’s regulatory framework and engaging with local communities to ensure that land and mineral extraction were conducted responsibly and sustainably. For 2020-2021 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the global COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges. Despite this hurdle, the Ministry demonstrated resilience by accelerating digital transformation, ensuring continuity in land and resources management and adapting our strategies to meet evolving needs. The staff continued to prioritise maintaining critical services, supporting economic recovering and re-enforcing our commitment to sustainable development. Throughout these years the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has remained steadfast in its vision to manage Fiji’s land and mineral resources with integrity and foresight. The Committee noted that the Ministry had highlighted the activities and challenges while maintaining the focus on the Ministry’s commitment to sustainable resource management in Fiji. The Committee is thankful to the staff of the Ministry for their overall performance during the review period. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor, I have received the list of speakers from the Whips as follows: (1) Honourable S. S. Kirpal; (2) Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; (3) Honourable J. Usamate; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. I have been informed as well that the second group, not the Group of 16, the Group of 9 have</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>1414 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 decided not to participate. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the 2018 to 2021 Consolidated Report by the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. Before I start my contribution, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Lands, Chief Valuer, Director of Lands and the Acting Permanent Secretary. Today, I have signed an agreement with the Ministry of Lands of the sales data which is available for all the valuers. The valuers should know that now we will be getting the sales data and our evaluation will be more accurate, honourable Minister. I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would also understand how vital that information was, it had been missing for two and half years. MR. SPEAKER.- It has been missing for how many years? HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- For two and a half years. The thing is that till today, I have signed the agreement, we did not know the actual values of properties around Fiji, so it was very difficult for us to do a valuation in Fiji because of that vital data missing. That is the heart of our valuation, so once again thank you honourable Minister, I really appreciate that. This is an old report, however, …. MR. SPEAKER.- That is a side comment?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.:</span> Pardon, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> That is a different thing? So now you are going to your….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Going back to this one:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Meandering:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Appreciating:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. S. KIRPAL.:</span> I am appreciating, not blaming all the time, so I really appreciate the honourable Minister and the Government of the day. You should also appreciate, honourable Minister for Trade. Going back to the Report, looking at Recommendation 2 where it says the problem of outsourcing the survey of land. I understand that there has been a shortage of surveyors in Fiji. Also, we can recommend that if the subdivision is given to individuals who can do the surveys if consent is granted, it will be much easier to have some of the informal settlements legalised. We used to practice that during your time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we got consent for two lots to three lots and the lessees used to do the subdivision themselves, and the cost was borne by them. It was one of the ways we could reduce the number of informal settlements on State land in Fiji. Mostly, the Western area has a lot of informal settlements on State land, and I think the honourable Minister will agree with that. The second one is the efficient service which is in Recommendation 3. This one has to be improved because the mortgage and transfer consent has to be given on time, it should be fast tracked. If it is not given on time, for example, if it is a lapse of three months then the lessees or the buyers have to pay another consent fees of $100. If it is done within three months or it can be done within</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 1415 two weeks or three weeks, it will be much better. If the officers of the Ministry of Lands see there is a breach of any condition which they have to rectify, that should be given to the solicitors or the lessees to rectify quickly so that the transfer or the mortgage consent could be given earlier. This is one of the areas we think that the Ministry of Lands has to improve on - the consent to the mortgage and the transfer consent. We look forward working with the Minister and other stakeholders to look into it and how they can fast-track those concerns. The major one is Recommendation 4 where the Committee has picked up the arrears of rental, so it is not new. Arrears has been outstanding amounting to millions of dollars. A major concern are properties with the State as they do not want to pay rental because it is between the four or five brothers or sisters, and they do not want to pay rental. The second issue is the increase in rental. I know in 1999 to 2000, the land value was not that much. In Nasinu, it was $30,000 to $40,000, so rental on 2.5 percent was a bit less but now the land value with the same property has gone up to $150,000 to $200,000 and then UCV of that, you pay rental 2.5 percent is very high. That may be one of the causes, so if the Ministry of Lands and other stakeholders and valuers could look into it, on how we can get into a percentage of rental where both parties benefit. To reduce rental, the best part will be for the Government to have amnesty to the lessees, the penal rental and the penalties, the Government can consider giving, I will stick to the lessees to pay rental so they can take out the interest and the penal rental which has been charged on those land leases. These are the things which we can do - we can reduce rental and Government can have more revenue on it, otherwise the arrears will keep on increasing. These are a few things which we can look into, and I hope the Government considers the amnesty to the lessees of the sugarcane lessees in the West and all the lessees in residential and commercial areas, so they can have revenue, and at the same time, the people will be able to clear off their rental. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the work done by the Committee. I had been a former Member of the Natural Resource Committee and once again, I would like to thank the honourable Minister. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the review of the Ministry’s Report from 2018 to 2021. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry notes the role and the responsibility that it carries and the desire to continue to strive towards delivering excellence service to the public and to the people of Fiji. The Standing Committee on Natural Resources have come up with seven general recommendations in the Report, which I will highlight in this august House. Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that the Ministry clearly identifies performance indicators and also carries out proper assessments of the achievements of the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry noted the recommendation and is working towards having clear performance indicators and to ensure systematic assessment of its achievements. Within the Ministry, there is a quarterly internal verification of our plans conducted from all the respective divisions where officers are located. From the verification of these reports, Sir, presentations are conducted which we were able to gauge the performance from these officers.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>1416 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the Ministry reconsiders its policy and actively undertake the development of subdivisions which includes the option of outsourcing development work whilst maintaining an oversight role. Mr. Speaker, this recommendation is noted by the Ministry and is considering issuing development leases to potential developers who have the capability to develop State land to its highest and best use. The Ministry will strengthen its monitoring mechanism that will ensure development works are carried out within the development lease and to avoid issues of over development. Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Ministry continues to enhance the use of information technology, digital platforms and applications to assist the Ministry achieve our targets and deliver better, effective and efficient services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is currently taking proactive steps in firstly scanning of all of our archaic files within our offices and for update we are almost completing scanning all the files in the West and North. The major task will be in ensuring that, that also happens in the Central and Eastern regions. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is using its in-house capacity to develop the following platforms and again I have spoken about this in my past addresses, and I just reiterate them again for the use and benefit of those who have and retain State leases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, MyLeaseInfo app for State land leases to register and access their lease information, we are urging this to all those who have State leases is to register. Again, the second one is on Online State Land Application shortly termed as OSLA. That is a platform where all lands that belong to the State can be applied for by everyone without having to visit any Ministry office. Consent application, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also coming online. We are currently developing and have already trialled this consent applications which is to compliment the MyLeaseInfo and the OSLA platform where lessees can also apply online for various consents along with the digitization of the entire application process. Recommendation 4: The Committee strongly recommends that proper recovery plans for outstanding leases, rents are implemented to collect unpaid dues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges this comment and this recommendation. We are putting forward strategies to be undertaken by the Ministry to improve the collection of our rental: (1) We are working with the Solicitor-General’s Office in taking legal advice, particularly those who have commercial or industrial leases and continue to default on a yearly basis. (2) We are looking at waiver of interest incentive. Our staff are also visiting lessees and conducting awareness on rental payments, issuance of notices and flyer on rental payments. (3) We are accepting undertakings with lessees to clear rental arrears within a respective period. There is much media publicity and awareness being made by the Ministry. (4) We are providing options on mode of payments to lessees, development of Debt and Revenue Management Policy within and, of course, the acceptance of undertakings. Recommendation 5: The Committees strong recommendation in the continuation and strengthening of the Ministry’s retention policies and also its training and capacity building policies.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 1417 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry welcomes this recommendation and ensures that proper procedures are in place regarding the retention of staff and human resources development within the Ministry. Recommendation 6: The Committee strongly recommends for proper application of financial procedures to enable efficient financial accountability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledged this recommendation, and we are working to strengthening our internal processes and ensure that appropriate measures and guidelines are being followed in ensuring accuracy, transparency and compliance with regulatory standards. In terms of financial accountability, the Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Finance on its internal reforms and policies. Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the Ministry strengthens the measures by which it eliminates illegal sand and gravel extraction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has strengthened its monitoring of illegal sand and river gravel extraction in the three Divisions through the engagement of our natural resources monitoring officers within the Ministry. We continue to raise awareness and engagements with the landowning units to help them monitor the resources that they and the Ministry are able to provide. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an MOU has been signed with the Fiji Police Force in 2022, to address the illegal river gravel and sand extraction in 2022. The Ministry is also moving to a lateral approach in working together with other Ministries, such as the Provincial Offices and other Government Ministries in ensuring that illegal activities on State resources is minimised or eradicated altogether. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I once again commend the Report and thank the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for the recommendation and the work that has been done. Vinaka. HON. J. USAMATE.- I would like to thank the Chairman for leading us through the deliberations on this Report, and the comments that have been received from the honourable Minister. There are just a few things that I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Having been part of that Ministry in the latter part of the period under review and also being part of the Committee, I would just like to appreciate the format of the Annual Report that was done by the Ministry. No long essays but just the focus on key results. I think that is something good for other Ministries to look at. One of the things that we were equally impressed with the Ministry and their Reports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the strong gender equality and in particular, the leadership of the Ministry at that particular point in time - the Permanent Secretary, along with many of the Directors, the Chief Valuer, Divisional Lands Officer, were all women. So, it was very remarkable to see that, that was happening in this particular Ministry. We, also appreciate at length the manner in which the SDGs that this Ministry was trying to contribute to meeting were clearly articulated in the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had a number of comments on a lot of the recommendations. I think the honourable Minister has identified in particular how they are addressing some of these recommendations. I will not spend too much time on it.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>1418 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the first one on identifying performance indicators, it is clearly articulated how well they have done that - their performance management system. There is one thing that I see, however, that a lot of these Annual Reports, we do not get an overall score on outputs or - an overall score of how the Ministry has done. In order to be able to do something like that, you would have to weigh the relative importance of different outputs so that you get an overall assessment. I think this is something that is very important when we are trying to assess. How well an entity has operated is to weight the different outputs so that you can get an overall score of the performance of the entity as a whole. That is something that I hope that this Ministry and other Ministries can take into account. The Ministry has addressed at length the development of the subdivisions, I think there has been a lot of growth in that particular area. There has been comments also from the Minister and I want to repeat that on how well the Ministry has done in using information, digital platforms, et cetera, to ease the way in which it carries out its operations. I will not repeat all those responses that the honourable Minister has made. Also, on the plans that have been made for the recovery of arrears, we know that the current rent in the Ministry is around $16 million per year, but the arrears total is around $20 million. It has been stated that this is not a new issue, it has been longstanding, but I think, as parliamentarians, we need to raise our concern with it, and we hope that the Ministry can continue to look at innovative ways of reducing that level of arrears. I know it is not easy. We take note of the measures they have put in place, and we hope that this needs to be addressed because $20 million is a lot of money for the Government to look at. It is an opportunity cost to what Government could have got out of that money. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a person who is involved in training, the recommendation recommending the continuation and strengthening of the Ministry’s retention policies and its training and capacity building policies, is something I strongly endorse. We were told that this particular Ministry, during this period, regularised 80 positions within the Ministry, and in particular, I was very impressed with what they referred to as an equalisation. When looking whether to give someone a job or not, they just did not look at the academic requirements, but look at the person’s competencies, and if the competencies were equal to what was you thought you would get out of the academic qualification, the person was given the job. So that was competency profiling and equalisation of not just the academic qualification of the person, but the person’s ability to do. I think that is the message that can be used right across all different Ministries. If you notice, we lose a lot of people. Some people are very well skilled but do not have the academic qualification, but on the job, they deliver, whereas others have the qualifications but cannot deliver. Eventually over time, they will deliver because they have that broad knowledge capacity and the academic qualifications, over time they grow to becoming much better at their particular job. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to emphasise that very strongly. I have always been very impressed with the Ministry on how they try to make sure that their staff are very well qualified. This is a very well qualified Ministry. We have people with PhDs in this Ministry and a strong group that has Masters, all of whom have worked their way up through the ranks. I congratulate the Committee and recommend for proper application of financial procedures. The Ministry, over the past have always had qualified audit opinions and even in the year in question,</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 1419 it was qualified, but I understand that in the following year (2022-2023), the audit became unqualified. I think that is the achievement on its own and we hope that the Ministry can continue to do this, to make sure that the financial procedures are in place to ensure financial accountability. The honourable Minister has mentioned the issue of about illegal sand and gravel extraction, and this illegal extraction is something that we find for all of the resource sectors, whether it is forestry or fishing. It is not easy to address because sometimes the people who are guilty of doing this are in cahoots with some of the landowners themselves. That is always something difficult to try to address. I am pleased to mention the idea about penalties, stronger partnerships with other agencies, and we hope that they can continue to work to improve that for this important Ministry. I also want to mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of this Ministry during COVID-19 where their GIS Specialists were at the forefront of the activities that were undertaken. The Command Centre and the Ministry of Health and all around, were using their GIS skills that became very important in that battle against COVID-19 at that time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues I wanted to raise, I was looking at some of the comments that were made by the staff, one of the areas that they had some difficulties in was the success of borehole development, which was less than 100 percent, which means that of the number of boreholes they put into the ground, not all of them were successful. This is understandable, but I think the percentage of it, whether it is how high it is, is a concern. Why that is of a particular concern to me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I was looking in this year’s budget (this is not for this Report), the amount of budget that they have for boreholes in groundwater for the large islands, has increased from around $3million right up to $5 million. I am worried, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about execution. I have talked about this in forestry, and I hope the execution can be undertaken to make use of this rapid rise. If not, and if we are not very careful, we will do it anyhow, you do not do the reconnaissance correctly and the assessments correctly, you just dig the borehole, and your percentage of successful borehole declines. So, itt is very important that, that be done. That is a concern that I have. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one last thing that I have talked about is that, in the land situation that we have in Fiji, we have the iTLTB and the Ministry of Lands that looks after most of the land in this country. There is a portion of 4 percent for the State land, then we have the portion under the iTLTB land. One of the concerns that I always have, being a former Minister, working in Government, is the fact that so many civil servants cannot afford land. A lot of them live in squatter settlements. I know that there is a grouping where the TLTB and the Ministry of Lands sit and they look at the whole land situation. We really need to find some sort of a solution where our own civil servants can get housing and can get land. I do not know what the solution is, maybe something around valuation to make sure that people can afford land, to reduce speculation which I think is one of the causes of the hyped land prices so that our own civil servants themselves can even get land to be able to have a house for themselves. I know it will require some sort of a framework across Government, across iTaukei Affairs, TLTB and the Ministry of Lands, to come up with some sort of a scenario or approach that allows our people to get access to land so that they can build a house. There are too many people now moving into squatter settlements, et cetera. Along those lines, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish the Ministry well with these recommendations. I was glad to hear the sentiments from the honourable Minister and I support the motion before the</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1420 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 House. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I want to thank the honourable Members who have spoken before me and particularly, thank the honourable Minister for Lands for addressing all the recommendations very clearly so I am not going to talk about that. I also thank honourable Kirpal and honourable Usamate. I think honourable Usamate today made some very good points and suggestions. HON. J. USAMATE.- I always do! (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I think he touched on some very, very importants points.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in the last 18 months, I have realised the importance of this Ministry, the significant of this Ministry because when you look at how the economic entities, investment and he talked about housing, beyond housing is the efficiency and the effectiveness with which the Ministry of Lands and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs actually works. It determines, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how quickly investors can get on to the activities, but also the availability of land for those who want to build their houses. I think the availability and access to land is a serious issue, and I agree that it is time that we, as a government, and Opposition should set up a taskforce to look at how more land could be opened up at a price at a rate which is affordable to many of our people. I am also very pleased to say looking at it from the Ministry of Finance that in the last 18 months, a lot of progress has been made by the Ministry in terms of the legislation, review of some of the policies, ongoing digitisation of land records, Government’s efforts to address shortage of registered valuers. On the lease arrears, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see there is quite a bit of flexibility now in terms of what the Ministry is doing. They have undertaken a review of the criteria and, hopefully, we will have further incentives to reduce the amount of arrears that has been there. Just on the 2024-2025 Budget and in relation to what honourable Usamate shared with respect to boreholes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very good initiative in the Budget, and this came out very clearly throughout the national consultations that we had on the National Development Plan. It seems to us that there was a lot of legacy issues in terms of availability of water supply in the rural areas. That is why the allocation for 1,700 boreholes over the next two years - 1,000 in Viti Levu, 500 in Vanua Levu and 200 in the maritime islands. I take the point very well that honourable Usamate made and both, myself and the honourable Minister for Lands, I mentioned that in my Budget Speech that there will be a taskforce which will involve the Ministry of Lands, Ministry of Waterways, Water Authority of Fiji and the Ministry of Finance - a taskforce made up of Permanent Secretaries who will ensure that we are able to actually deliver all these boreholes and address this fundamental issue of access and availability of drinking water in the rural areas. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will engage, not only the facilities and the machines that are available with the Ministry of Lands, but also bring in private players so that there is an urgency, there is a very clear focus as to how we can complete these boreholes as per the allocation in the Budget. The</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – MLMR 2018-2021 Annual Reports 1421 Ministry’s overall budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was increased by $6.4 million, which is a significant increase. The other important allocation of almost a million dollars was the survey of mahogany plantations and we realised we had some discussions this morning that a lot of trees are getting old. The value may be declining, and part of the problem was how quickly these surveys were done and forest harvested. The Survey of Government Stations, Cabinet earlier this year had approved the extension on the Survey of Government institutions on itaukei land lease to the State for the next 10 years. That is another additional allocation that we have provided. The groundwater assistance programme which includes the boreholes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, again, a very important component of this year’s Budget within the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. So, once again, Mr. Speaker, I think the honourable Minister has covered the recommendations very well and I thank the Committee on Natural Resources for their Report and the contribution the Members have made. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to speak in reply, just some concerns caught my attention. One was mentioned recently by honourable Usamate, the affordability of land for residential purposes by civil servants. He stated that it is so high, expensive, and it is difficult for them to acquire a land, especially for residential purposes. I do not know, I have stated this already and I will want to echo that again, it is the Town Planning together with the Ministry of Lands and the iTaukei Affairs to just try and sit and sort out how best can they make Native land or State land attractive by not imposing very stringent conditions in the town planning approval. Put gravel road instead of tarsealed road. You just do GPS boundary survey on wooden stakes and then they are given a lease. If they want to go beyond that and getting the lease surveyed and things like of that nature, then it is upon them to follow that up, whether they go through their banks, at least, they have something in their hands. It is an agreement to lease but that is a contract. When you reduce such issues by the very approval that we give it makes the land very expensive. Cadastral surveys are very expensive and honourable Kirpal has mentioned that. On top of that, instead of tarsealed road and gravel road, you are providing them access and it is upon them for future Government development to come up with that to tarseal the road afterwards. We did that in Ba, Bainisucu in Labasa, Malolo Sector in Nadi and Drasa in Lautoka where we relaxed all the conditions, got the approval and it is cheaper. Recommendation 4 caught my attention, the arrears, I also mentioned this in the past, when you do not isolate what is rental owing and what is truly rental arrears, then both will be seen to be clogged up together and that becomes arrears. That is why you have a $20 million arrears, honourable Minister for Lands. If you take away the rental owing because the rental clause in the lease as provided by Ministry of Lands and iTLTB allows for the payment of an annual sum into modes of payments – 6-monthly. When the first 6 months has not been paid, it does not mean that has become arrears in July, it is still rental owing. We have tried this, we have had it tested in the Courts and that was upheld. So, we reduced our arrears from $20 million to about $14 million or $15 million.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1422 Consolidated Review Report–SCGF 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports 5 th August, 2024 Again, when you go into trying to address arrears by spending more money in recruiting the people who will follow up the arrears, you are spending more money to get a money that was already owing to you. I hope I am making sense here. I am just trying to share this so at least it could throw some light into this how could this be addressed. What the honourable Usamate stated is very critical when civil servants cannot afford residential allotments and when the rents are high, arrears are high, the cost that comes with it to have it to be addressed, the end result is the eviction of people from land that is already expensive to get a hold of. I am just sharing that in the hope that it might drive some ideas into you honourable Members, to see how best you can address the arrears and the way to reduce the cost. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- I wish to thank all Members who have contributed to the debate this afternoon and for the supporting the Report that had been submitted. I have nothing else to add, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
