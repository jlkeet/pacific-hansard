<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND WATERWAYS (Hon. V. T. T. K. Rayalu) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 109/2024 is as follows: The Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has 1 local Senior Veterinary Officer. However, there are vacant positions of a Principal Veterinary Officer, 2 Senior Veterinary Officers, and 1 Veterinary Officer at the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory, which will be re-advertised on Saturday 10/08/2024 to attract qualified Veterinarians. The Ministry is also working on running a qualifier examination to register more local veterinarians, who have graduated from local institutions. The Ministry is also collaborating with the Australia Volunteers Program to assist with 3 veterinarians from Australia to support the Ministry on Veterinary Clinical Work. We are expecting 3 Volunteers in October 2024 to serve in our Ministry for a period of 1 year. The review of the Fiji Veterinary Surgeons Act of 1956 will begin in mid-August of 2024 when the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) consultants arrive in Fiji. The review will incorporate improvements in the Act to address gaps and meet the demands of the sector. Furthermore, it will open up the registration of veterinarians from other academic institutions who have the necessary qualifications and experience to practice in Fiji. The Ministry of Agriculture will also work with the World Organization of Animal Health (WOAH), the Solicitor Generalâ€™s Office and other stakeholders in Fiji to set up a Veterinary Statutory Council which will oversee all decisions relating to veterinary work in Fiji.</p><p>vi.</p></body>
