<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>New National Rehabilitation Centre - Tamavua Hospital (Question No. 97/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1392</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th August, 2024 Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on the progress of the plans for a new National Rehabilitation Centre to replace the current Twomey Hospital in Tamavua?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Ravunawa for his question:</span></p><p>Just a point to note, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the question, if I can put it in order, the new rehabilitation centre is not to replace the current Twomey Hospital, but rather to replace the old Tamavua Military Hospital or former Tamavua Rehabilitation Facility. On the current progress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the construction of a new National Rehabilitation Centre has been approved by the Government of Fiji and the Government of Korea. Last year, Cabinet approved a subsidiary arrangement between the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), to establish Fiji’s National Rehabilitation Centre. As per the agreement, KOICA will provide a grant-in-aid of not more than $10 million, which is approximately FJ$22.2 million and, therefore, we are grateful to KOICA and to the Government, and to the people of Korea, for their generous assistance. Most of the Tamavua Hospital has been assessed to be non- compliant with OHS requirements from the non-maintenance of the aging buildings and facilities that were built in many decades ago. Although we have experienced some delays in finalising the relocation of all services currently offered at the old Tamavua Hospital and the clearance of utilities servicing the hospital. The Tamavua Hospital Team and the Ministry’s Assets Management Team have been working closely with the Ministry of Works and KOICA Fiji’s Office in the last 10 months, to ensure that the site is ready for the KOICA Construction Team anticipated movement into the site in January of 2025. Sir, further to that, the health partner, the Latter Days Saints Charity, has also indicated its willingness to assist in funding more than $300,000 required for the temporary relocation of the rehabilitation hospital to the Twomey Hospital for the duration of the construction, again, which the Ministry is grateful for. Government has allocated a funding of $400,000 in this financial year for the demolition and preparation of the hospital site for the new rehabilitation hospital, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Meanwhile, other preparatory activities have been undertaken and are ongoing. They include the first in-country training by rehabilitation medicine experts from the Korean University and Korea Rehab which was conducted in April this year. The second in-country training is planned for January next year. There is an invitational training programme also planned where seven to eight health professionals from Fiji will be travelling to Korea for onsite training at a Centre of Excellence in Korea. The project team is also expected to be travelling to Fiji later this year for ongoing discussions with KOICA Fiji Office Team and the Ministry’s Team and the project designers, as we continue our preparation for this very important project, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Sir, the detailed design phase is anticipated to be completed in September of this year and</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1393 their process of tendering of project will subsequently follow in October 2024. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister for Health. This Rehabilitation Centre, is it specifically for physical impairment rehabilitation or is it also going to take care of our drug-dependent people that we know that St. Giles Hospital is unable to cope with the numbers at the moment? Is the Rehabilitation Centre, generally speaking, for all of those or is it specific to physical impairment? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Koya for his question. It is for the physical impairment disability. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, we noted that there is a reduction in the budget for this year by $0.4 million for this particular project. But I am happy that there is a plan underway for staff capacity building, also in preparation for the construction, as well as for the operation of this rehabilitation centre. I have no supplementary question, but I wish the honourable Minister well and thank the Government of Korea for their support. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, I am interested in the total cost of the project. You mentioned about the FJ$22 million from KOICA, the assistance from the LDS Church and the demolition cost. Will Government be required to fork out some more funds? I did not hear the total cost of the project, if you may elaborate on that, honourable Minister. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. The amount FJ$22.2 million is the total cost for the project, which is equivalent to $10 million Korean dollars. Nevertheless, our allocation has been in terms of the preparatory works. That is what is currently budgeted, even though it was not utilised in the last financial year due to some unforeseen difficulties to do with water and electricity that is currently also supplying the Fiji National University (FNU). Those are some obstacles that the Ministry has faced but, nevertheless, in terms of the allocation - the grant, that will cover not only the construction but also the capacity building, as I have raised, as well as the finer equipment that will be used to carry out the necessary services to be provided. That is from everything - the beds, equipment, et cetera, that are all included in the Agreement. So, that is, in a nutshell, what is included in the grant. Establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman (Question No. 98/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for his question. I am pleased to inform Parliament that during the Cabinet Sitting of 15 th July, 2024, the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsman was approved. Sir, this is a significant decision and it shows the Government’s commitment and political will to enhancing consumer protection and fostering trust in the financial services sector.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1394 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsperson has been set up and we have appointed a skilled and knowledgeable Ombudsperson to manage complaints and aid in resolving issues. Sir, the person is Ms. Wati Seeto. She has been appointed as the first Financial Services Ombudsperson, as announced by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) on 31 st July - last month. Ms. Seeto joined the RBF in 2010 after holding senior positions at the Capital Markets Development Authority, bringing with her 25 years of legal expertise, 15 years of which is spent in financial regulation and consumer protection. She, in our view, will spearhead this significant establishment due to her legal knowledge and commitment to consumer advocacy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the establishment of the Financial Services Ombudsperson function, the existing complaints management function undertaken by the RBF will be maintained, but elevated to ensuring the specific function is conducted by an appointed Financial Services Ombudsperson. The Office will function as an impartial platform, dedicated to resolving disputes between consumers and financial services providers and regulated by RBF. Its primary responsibilities include investigating complaints, facilitating discussions, ensuring fair resolution. Its role is crucial in providing consumers with the reliable mechanism to address their grievances which ultimately helps to build trust and confidence in the financial services sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In this regard, the Ombudsperson will have an increased focus on ensuring the principles of independence, to secure impartiality, clarity of scope and powers, accessibility, effectiveness and transparency and accountability. We are confident Sir, that the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsperson will play a crucial role in maintaining transparency and accountability in Fiji’s financial services sector. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, how will the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman be funded? What measures are in place to ensure its independence and impartiality, considering that the Office is based within Reserve Bank of Fiji? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is a very good question. The Governor of the RBF is appointed by the Constitutional Offices Commission, and it is an independent office. The credibility of RBF rests on the independence on which the Bank conducts its monetary policies. Therefore, the framework of independence is within the existing structure. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be reviewing its effectiveness, and we will see how it works within the framework of the RBF. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that in 2000, there was a Banking Services Commission Report which recommended the establishment of the Office of the Banking Ombudsman, but we are now talking about the Financial Services Ombudsperson’s Office. We felt that this was an immediate issue that can be accommodated within the framework of the independence provided for the RBF, but we will be reviewing this within a year or so to assess its effectiveness, look at the data on the number of complaints and how effectively and efficiently the Office is able to serve and resolve some of those complaints. HON. P. D. KUMAR. - Funding? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.– The funding, of course, will be provided by the RBF as an independent institution.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1395 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I have a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. With the creation of the Financial Services Ombudsman, I am just interested in the legislations that are in place for effectiveness and efficiency of the functioning of the Office because some of our laws are archaic and within the current environment. So, my simple question, honourable Minister is, whether the laws that we have is sufficient to ensure that the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman is effective and serves the purposes in which we created it? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition. I think it is a very important point. The existing Complaints Management Framework is supervised by the RBF, already in terms of all the financial institutions, the banks, but the honourable Leader of Opposition is right, that once we are able to review the effectiveness of this provision that we have created and we want to do that within a year, then I think we would be able to look at if it needs changes to the law or if it needs a completely separate Financial Services Ombudspersons Office outside of the RBF. For that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will have to look at the legislative framework and the changes that would be required, whether it is part of the Reserve Bank Act or a separate legislation to set up a totally independent Office of the Ombudsperson. HON. J. USAMATE. - I thank the honourable Minister for the development of this position of the Financial Services Ombudsman. I am not too sure if this role will be more like a mediatory role where the parties come to a conclusion, or more like an arbiter. If it is an arbiter, would his decisions then be legally binding on the parties? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD. - Again, a good question. At the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the position, within the framework of the RBF, will try and resolve the complaints that consumers have with respect to any financial services institution. But, as I have said, the original recommendation that was made in 2000 as part of the banking inquiry, suggested a completely separate office for the Banking Ombudsman at that time. Over the years, the RBF assumed and there were changes made for it to have a special Complaints Management Framework, which has been working. But this Office itself is going to strengthen and, perhaps provide a lot more teeth for an office within the RBF, and a dedicated person. With the kind of experience that Ms. Seeto has, would be able to resolve, in my view, a lot of the complaints that consumers would have, but that option is still there - to look at a completely independent office with its own legislative framework. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for lunch. The first bell will be sounded at 2.25 p.m., so it is a two-hour lunch break. The Parliament adjourned at 12.31 p.m.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1396 The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. Status of Re-Development at Sukuna Park (Question No. 99/2024) HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the status of Sukuna Park? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this issue has also been of public interest and I also wish to provide an update on the re-development of Sukuna Park in Suva. This project Mr. Speaker, Sir, is of significant importance for the capital city. The Sukuna Park has been named in honour of one of Fiji’s most revered leaders and Statesman; Ratu Sir Josefa Lalabalavu Vanayaliyali Sukuna. The Park has long been a central feature of Suva offering a green space of leisure, cultural events and public gatherings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sukuna Park is a recreational space approved by the Suva City Council through the Ministry of Local Government. The Council was able to partner with Auckland City Council in 2019 to understand multiple dimensions of municipal operations, one of the areas of study or review has been the recreational facilities management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project was launched with the goal of transforming the Park into a modern, multi-functional public space that meets the needs of Suva’s growing population and aligns with contemporary urban learning principles. The re-development of Sukuna Park is a key initiative of the Suva City Council since 2020. The objective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to improve the landscape, have a better podium to host events, increase foot traffic at the Park, improve lighting structure and introduce modern park furniture which is an increase of sitting, improved walkways and make the park smart through digital platforms such as charger booths and WiFi. It is believed that this will enhance the Park’s functionality and statics while preserving its historical and cultural significance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project is self-funded by the Suva City Council with an initial budget of $13 million. In 2020, the scope of work was altered to full re-development of the Park, including a two-level cafeteria; that was a concept of the previous administration. However, Sir, the budget was reduced to $7 million with a decision by the Special Administrator of SCC to remove the cafeteria. It is worth noting that a budget of $500,000 was allocated for landscaping purposes only. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the park was closed by the SCC towards the end of 2021 to allow for demolition works and rehabilitation works. A consultant was engaged by Suva City Council who designed the initial master plan back then. However, in the first quarter of 2023, Suva City Council had engaged a new consultant; the revision of rehabilitation masterplan to reflect a modern Suva City Smart Park. A new consultancy team was engaged and the construction of the podium began in June 2023. The sealworks were carried after the tender and evaluation by Suva City Council. These works were followed by building services and the landscape works. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to update this august House, the project was completed last month. However, the contractors currently turning into defects as per the defects liability period, as such, they are hoping to open the Sukuna Park re- development project this month after the completion of the defects identified by the consultant.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, the re-development of Sukuna Park represents a significant</h4><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1397 investment to the future of Suva with a smart city concept. The provision of disabled facilities indicates that no one is left behind for urban development. The Council has also further considered the importance of having security with CCTV cameras, fencing and provision of security at the park to avoid any criminal activities in the area. A newly developed Sukuna Park will also be strengthening the revenue streams of the Suva City Council through some commercial activities in partnership with several business houses as well as stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am confident that upon completion, Sukuna Park will stand as a testament to our commitment to creating a vibrant, sustainable and inclusive public space for all Fijians. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to the question before the august House this afternoon. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question. I thank the honourable Minister for his response. At the end of the day, there are not enough parks in Suva and the surrounding areas. Two, the existing parks right now does not meet the needs of our people. Three, there is an urgent need to build multipurpose recreational centres in our community that is built for purpose and also for the future. My question to the honourable Minister, does he have this in his future plans? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for raising a very important issue this afternoon. Some of the concept of changing the way we do things in our municipalities have also been shared with all our Special Administrators who currently manager the 13 municipalities. In July last month the Tavua Town Council through its new Special Administration have opened a new park that is called the Family Park. This Family Park, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an open space but they have divided up into three different spaces. One is to cater for the children’s park, the middle is where the family can go and gather while the children are playing and there is also a space just alongside those two spaces where they have dedicated for the senior citizens. These are some of the new initiatives that we are doing at the moment, all the municipalities are inclusive in the designing and the re-designing of the current parks as well as some of the unutilised and underutilised open spaces that we have in most of these municipalities, especially in Suva. There are also some unutilised spaces in Suva that we are also thinking of developing, and if you look at some of the recreational spaces, they are mostly open spaces. There is no provision for them to have multipurpose courts while people are enjoying playing touch rugby, others can enjoy the other facility. These are some of the innovative plans that we are currently promoting with the Councils to ensure that when we come up with new designs of making use of the open spaces for the public, we have to be inclusive in the way we design some of these new recreational spaces. MR. SPEAKER.- What about the one in Lami, that is a multipurpose one HON P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sukuna Park was designed for entertainment purposes, and mainly for the cruise liners that come to Suva. There was a purpose for that particular park mainly to entertain the working community, people who are in the office, et cetera, they can go to that park with their lunch and enjoy their lunch. Part of that concept was this particular modern café. This café had a rooftop bar overlooking the ocean, and the back of the building had a stepwise pavilion, so people could sit and watch the entertainment happening at the podium. When tourists come, they can also enjoy that facility, et cetera. I am rather saddened that this particular component was taken away as part of the re- development plan. We have just heard from honourable Naivalurua that anything you build is for a</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1398 purpose and for the future. That particular structure was for the future. I would like to know from the honourable Minister any reason why that particular structure was taken off considering that Suva City Council makes around $30 million every year from ratepayers and have sufficient money in its account. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for raising this question. Maybe, she is right in her own way but if you look at Sukuna Park, it only is about 10,000 square metres. The green space that we have is not enough to cater for the population we have in Suva. That is the very reason why I have also advised the Administrator to remove the cafeteria. We need families to enjoy the green space, we want the kids to walk around freely.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Entertainment to watch rugby:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

KOYA.:</span> Sir, I think he knows what I am going to ask him actually.</p><p>Honourable Minister, I understand what you are doing, even with the shortfalls that are coming in, in terms of the development of the park. Because you are going to put it in a particular pristine condition like Albert Park used to be, are you going to be setting certain ground rules and rules in terms of the usage and how it is kept so as we do not fall down that same trap that we have now at Albert Park where the vehicles are running around Albert Park?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Finance Minister give more money:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the design of the park itself has enough walkways, where people can walk around the park. I have also stated in my address that SCC also has plans to install CCTV cameras as well as have securities day and night to monitor the various activities around Sukuna Park and also ensure that the security and the safety of users are paramount when they utilise the park. In any development there will always be a plan to maintain the quality and the standard of whatever plans that you have. That is something that the Council also has in place to ensure that there is a plan in place to ensure that they maintain the Park at a level that is expected by the users and the general public. Young Entrepreneurship Scheme Programme (Question No. 100/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1399 Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the Young Entrepreneurship Scheme Programme? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Young Entrepreneurship Scheme Programme is commonly known as YES Programme, and I have to admit that it was a construct of the previous government which we have continued to support for some very good reasons. Firstly, it invests in our youths who have unique business ideas or innovative ideas, and the vision of which is to promote the entrepreneurial spirit in our young Fijians to become job creators rather than job seekers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since inception, the YES Programme has invested in about 18 recipients with a total investment of about $441,000 across a wide range of sectors from health and human services, agriculture, traffic management, recreational services and information technology, just to name a few. Each of these recipients offer a unique and innovative business idea that aims to improve upon the current service or product currently being offered in the market or offering something totally new to the people of Fiji. The YES Programme offers up to a grant of about $30,000 for the purchase of capital expenditure items, and the eligibility is for entrepreneurs or young men and women between the age of 18 years and 40 years, and of course, has to be a Fiji citizen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme has some very interesting facts. The success rate of this Programme is around 73 percent. On average, a YES recipient creates about three jobs, on average, a YES recipient has a total turnover of close to $50,000. In the year 2022 to 2023, the MSME Monitoring and Evaluation Team reported that four recipients were extremely active and performing at an excellent level. Of course, the recipients are also contributing to the SDGs by fostering innovative business practices that promotes economic growth, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. Not only commercial viability, but they also create a positive impact aligning with SDGs such as: • SDG8 - Decent work and economic growth; • SDG9 - Industry innovation and infrastructure; and • SDG010 - Reduced inequalities. Existing YES recipients go above and beyond to further their education and enrich their knowledge, achieving personal growth and contributing to society. Some of them end up being part of the Fiji Enterprise Engine cohorts, which is a very popular accelerator, incubator programme run through Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP). In fact, there have been a few very prominent winners of the YES Programme. I mentioned Christopher Vanualailai, who was named as one of the top 100 climate tax startups out of 10,000 businesses assessed across the Indo-Pacific region. Some of the other recipients that were supported this year included Rasalato Yanuyanurua of Aswhy Enterprises, who has transformed his business from exporting raw lumber to producing guitar billets and semi-finished guitar parts from mahogany. The young entrepreneur is now targeting high- end international markets, particularly in the US and Canada, showcasing his innovation and determination in the new markets. There is Munesh Prasad of Cocosip, who is planning to launch premium packet coconuts by preparing and peeling coconuts into diamond shape pieces, having the top of the coconut flatten and adding a coconut opener that is sold in some of the major supermarkets and resorts. The business also plans to diversify their product to manufacture chip blocks made from coconut husks.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1400 Mr. Speaker, these demonstrates the type of innovation that exists in our country and the Ministry plans to continue to encourage this culture of entrepreneurship in developing future aspiring entrepreneurs in the years to come. Mr. Speaker, I thought I just mention, and I have mentioned a few times in this august Chamber, that this side of the House is trying to develop a comprehensive MSME ecosystem that ensures that we continue to support entrepreneurs in their journey. As such, I just thought I would mention that there is about $300,000 sitting within TELS which is considered a Graduate Incubator Starter Programme in terms of a grant. That will be used to actually assist our young entrepreneurs which is exciting and, at least, focused particularly on student graduates. On top of that, Mr. Speaker, to support our young entrepreneurs, the Ministry has established an MSME information hub at the Suva Flea Market which offers assistance to MSMEs and has attracted many young people seeking information about the YES Programme. Funding permitting, Sir, we hope to extend this out to other central locations across the country. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been one of the recipients of this very powerful programme, the YES Entrepreneurship Scheme, and I am glad to hear of all the successful stories that we have and it is so important to invest in our youth. A question for the honourable Minister is, apart from the funding, is there any other multi-sectoral support in terms of, let us just say, “I was advised later on that I could use the $30,000 funding, put it through FDB, and I could get more out of it and get further assistance and that through low interest rates”? So, are there any more assistance, apart from the funding itself, provided to the recipients within the other Ministries? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I think the honourable Sharma has answered his own question. There are other avenues for support in other Ministries, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Rural and Development, Ministry of Youth and also Ministry of Women now has some support grants as well, Tourism has actually come up with a MSME grant. In actual fact, the total amounts that are now dedicated towards MSMEs is around $120 million in various forms, which includes the sugarcane farmers as well. So, that is quite a broad level of support that is happening. Mr. Speaker, it is an exciting space because as we all know, 18 percent of GDP is represented by the MSMEs. Not only that, it represents up to 60 percent of the jobs that are created in our country. So, that is why in terms of where this side of the House is headed, Sir, we are doing our best to really try and develop this ecosystem to ensure that over the next couple of years, we do create a comprehensive ecosystem. By that, Sir, I mean, just imagine if we start training our entrepreneurs from high school level before they get to university and beyond. Would that be an exciting prospect for our young people? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, we have heard you speak a lot about diversification, et cetera. Can you tell us whether in terms of the YES Programme, is there any specific programme within it which says that, “Alright, these are the areas that we need to diversify into”, and we are hunting down those young people that are in those areas that we can diversify into, whether it be exporting or whether it be producing something for our local markets? Are we actually doing that so that we can diversify with our young people because they do end up being quite successful entrepreneurs? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question. Mr. Speaker, the YES Programme is obviously targeted towards innovative ideas. By default, may be a lot of the ideas sit in the ICT space and also agricultural value-add processing. So, to the honourable Koya’s point, it starts creating that diversification that we all need in the economy. There is a couple that comes to</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1401 mind - TraSeable Solutions. They have been around for some time and are now developing solutions. A local couple, developing solutions for the Ministry of Agriculture in terms of IT Solutions for blockchain database design. I think they are now offering it to some of the other agencies. From what I hear, they are now in the Seychelles actually doing the same thing. So, this is the level of entrepreneurship, Sir, that our young people are capable of. It is quite an exciting thing to be watching and I think that if we provide the right level of resource, we provide the right training at the right time, we can see some very significant progress in this area, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Just for the information of honourable Members, we have just returned from a Parliamentary Meeting within the region. It was held in Indonesia, and Indonesia is renowned for MSMEs and all that. We were taken to a university where the overall start-up cost for MSMEs is so reduced that the students, straight away from university, go online and they are guided and helped by the universities. I think some of them are being held now by what the Deputy Prime Minister has stated that some of the universities are helping out here, but this has reduced the start-up course. They are well on their way to producing things straight into the online platform. I am just sharing this since it has, kind of, ignited the interest on MSMEs because it is huge and promising for us here in Fiji because we just sell online. Some of the staff that we have now are going online and that is a great start. But I do not know how they reduce their start-up cost by going that way. I am just sharing that because that was one of the things that struck our team while we were in Indonesia. We were amazed by the developments that Indonesia has undertaken right now. The fifth Oral Question for today has been moved to a later date. That is the question by honourable Alvick Maharaj to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, who is now tied up with the preparation for the arrival of the President of the Republic of India. As such, we will move that question to a later date. We will go straight to the six Oral Question for today, honourable Members. For that, I have also received communication from the Ministry of Finance, that this question should be redirected to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. Again, these are some of the developments that has come during question time. In the Business Committee Meeting, we ask whether to accept these questions directed to the Ministers and we receive advice that the questions should be referred to another Minister. However, we are getting communication directly from the Ministry, asking us to redirect the question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. ( Question No. 101/2024 moved to a later date ) Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation – Phase 2 (Question No. 102/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Stand-by Loan for Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation – Phase 2?</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1402 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing this change. I was not in the Business Committee, otherwise I would have raised it there, but thank you for allowing that. I thank the honourable Member for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Japanese Government has, over the years, offered financial assistance schemes for development projects designed to meet diverse needs of Fiji, including emergency assistance on resilience and recovery efforts to combat the aftermath of natural disasters or pandemic. The Government of Fiji acknowledges the assistance and support from the Government of Japan over the years, particularly during the COVID-19 years and natural disasters where the Government of Japan and other development partners provided immediate assistance to Fiji during that time when Fiji was in dire need. The Government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation (JICA) is the largest bilaterial lender to the Government of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, JICA provides grants and loan financing to Fiji, and it is the first development partner to provide concessional loan facility to the Government of Fiji. So, JICA’s proposed financing is the standby loan for Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation - Phase 2. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2019, the Government was given Phase 1 of this standby loan for disaster recovery and the amount was FJ$80 million. The proposed standby loan for Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation is the continuation of the Phase 1 to Phase 2 and this was endorsed by Cabinet on 15 th July. This facility provided by JICA is, again, to $72 million and is part of the Government’s loan funding programme for this fiscal year 2024 -2025. The proposed loan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by JICA is to promote economic stabilisation and development effects, in particular enhancing the capacity of Disaster Risk Management. The principal amount offered by the Japanese Government for such a facility is 0.25 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the case of Fiji, 0.25 percent of GDP was applied. However, noting Fiji’s vulnerability to natural disasters, the Japanese Government offered a standby loan facility in the amount US$46 million, equivalent FJ$72 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financing facility is actually pegged to achievement to policy reform actions on three key action areas. (1) Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; (2) (3) Understanding disaster risk and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response. Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; So, the Policy Reform Actions will be achieved in a coordinated approach between the stakeholders, the: (1) National Disaster Management Office (NDMO); (2) Fiji Meteorological Office under the Ministry of Rural Maritime Development and Disaster Management; (3) Municipal Council and City Council under the Ministry of Local Government; and (4) Mineral Resources Division under the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. This standby loan facility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a very concessional loan with some of the most favourable terms the Fijian Government has received with an interest rate of 0.4 percent per annum and a 40 year repayment term after a 10-year grace period.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1403 The pre-condition for the draw-down of this loan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, (this is an emergency provision), is that a Declaration of a State of Natural Disaster Post-Disaster by Cabinet on the advice of the National Disaster Management Council in accordance with section 17(1) of the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998. So, this loan, Sir, is contingent upon that condition being met after disaster had struck, after the Cabinet has declared it as a national disaster and conditioned on sound macro-economic and public financial management strategy. Subdivision of Informal Settlements on State Land (Question No. 103/2024) HON. S. S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the informal settlements on State land that have been subdivided since January 2023? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The Ministry of Housing has acquired development leases for the Ministry of Lands to develop four informal settlements that are located on State land. These are Cuvu in Sigatoka, Sasawira in Nausori, River Road in Nasinu, as well as Wainicaubati in Nasinu. Out of the four settlements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sasawira Settlement is located at 9 Miles which has an area of 17.3 acres. River Road in Narere has an area of 26.2 acres and Caubati, normally called Mama’s Place, with an area of 21.5 acres, and are currently undergoing planning works. These settlements, including three other settlements on iTLTB land, are earmarked for completion of construction phase by the end of this year, before progressing into construction phase. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the completion of development for three informal settlements on State land will benefit 769 households. The total estimated cost to upgrade these settlements is approximately $21 million. Cuvu Settlement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with an area of 9.3 acres, has had its construction works completed in 2022. This included drainage, roads, footpaths, paddings and installation of basic utilities. Due to a number of disagreements between the residents of Cuvu, the survey plan was amended and redefined to accommodate the request of the residents and the amended survey plan was approved in December 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in early 2024, the Ministry of Housing started the lot allocation process through the distribution of application forms to sitting residents. The process is in accordance with the Lot Allocation Policy. The allocation of the lots was successfully carried out by Lomara Associates to determine the market value of each lot. The information collected from applicants enabled the Lot Allocation Committee to identify those households who were eligible for Government assistance. The total cost to complete development of Cuvu Settlement is $3.7 million. For the completion of the lot allocation process, 105 households of Cuvu will be able to legally own house blocks with a 99-year lease title. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was in Cuvu last week and I was told by the tenants that the honourable Minister assured that the leases will be issued to the tenants. May I know what is holding up the issuance of the leases because he also made a public statement in the media as well? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- I have stated that there were some differences regarding the boundaries of some of the existing current residents, so the Ministry went in and amended the scheme plan and also got the survey plan approved. With Cuvu, there are some residents who have also been</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1404 given the agreement for lease, and something that we have also issue that we have had with iTLTB on who is going to allocate the lease; iTLTB or the Ministry of Housing? So, that is an issue we are trying to resolve with the iTLTB before issuing the leases to the current residents. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, you did mention Sasawira. I took a cab yesterday and the owner of the taxi lives in Sasawira, and he asked me if I can raise this question in Parliament. For him, they are waiting but there is a request from them, the road condition is so bad. He asked me if I can ask, “please confirm with the honourable Minister if they can do something about the road condition while waiting for the other developments.” HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- I think there is some funding that we have allocated this year to assist those informal settlements who have issues regarding the basic services and infrastructure because the request is now raised in Parliament, we will try and look into that honourable Member, and try to assist the residents of Sasawira. MR. SPEAKER.- I hope you will not mind honourable Minister because people are already there, they are sitting there. That is why the road conditions has worsened because they use it all the time, but that is part of the development. Supply Chain Agreement Under IPEF (Question No. 104/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the Implementation of the Supply Chain Agreement under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) for Prosperity? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Tuiwailevu for the question and in case the House is wondering why I am so excited on giving an update, in my mind, Mr. Speaker, the implementation of IPEF and the benefits that are potentially can accrue from IPEF is the reason why I will hopefully continue to update the House because there are some promising opportunities that lie at the heart of IPEF, should Fiji continue to be an active member. As we all know, firstly I would like to thank the House for unanimously approving IPEF together, and I had the honour of attending the last meeting in Singapore with the honourable Premila Kumar. Basically Mr. Speaker, since the approval in September of last year of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, the 14 partners that make up 40 percent of the global GDP had been actively working together to try and get the agreement going. The agreement officially entered into force on the 24 th February, 2024 and of course on 30 th July marked a significant milestone with implementation of the agreement where we started putting in place the necessary committees that are part and parcel of the Supply Chain Agreement. Mr. Speaker, the Supply Chain Agreement, hopefully, will allow the 14 countries to start working together in terms of supply requirements across the countries and it is my hope that should there be another crisis in the global supply chain, that the 14 countries including Fiji can work closely together. There are three bodies Mr. Speaker that were required to be set up as part of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement. These were the:</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1405 (1) Supply Chain Council; (2) Crisis Response Network; and (3) Labour Rights Advisory Board. At the moment, Fiji in terms of trying to be an active participant in IPEF has actually put its hand up in serving on the Supply Chain Council and we have the Permanent Secretary for Trade and Co-operatives, MSME and Communications, Mr. Shaheen Ali on the Supply Chain Council. In the Crisis Response Network, the Principal Trade Economist, Ms. Deepika Singh is a member of that Crisis Network body. In terms of Labour Rights Advisory Board, I am also happy to report that the Permanent Secretary for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations, Mr. Jone Maretino Nemani, who is no stranger to most of us, will serve on the Labour Rights Advisory Board. He is joined by Mr. Felix Anthony, the National Secretary of the Trade Union Congress and Mr. Jonetani Tonawai, Chief Executive of the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation. It is also probably significant to note, Mr. Speaker, that in discussions with some of the major partners in IPEF, Fiji has been invited to be the Vice Chair on the Labour Rights Advisory Board (LRAB) and so the Permanent Secretary for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations will serve as Vice Chair on LRAB, supporting the Chair from the United States of America. This role underscores our commitment to strengthening labour relations and labour rights, and ensuring fair working conditions for all workers across the Indo-Pacific region, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Fiji’s election as Vice Chair of the Labour Rights Advisory Board is a recognition of the important role Fiji plays in the region, and our capability was clearly demonstrated during the ongoing IPEF negotiations. As Vice Chair of the Labor Rights Advisory Board, Fiji will play a pivotal role in advancing labour rights and workforce development across IPEF supply chains. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have further plans in terms of the advancement of the implementation of the supply chain agreement which includes first in-person meeting in Washing DC in September 2024. The meeting is part of a supply chain summit organised by the United States Department of Commerce and Fiji’s representatives will make most of the opportunity to progress the benefits for Fiji through the three bodies that I have mentioned under the IPEF supply chain. We will also have the Solicitor-General’s Office and FICAC attend the summit as Pillar 4 on fair economy will also be discussed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is proud to be at the forefront of this initiative. By working alongside with global players, we are committed to ensuring the security and competitiveness of our critical supply chains. Through participation in such initiatives, we aim to drive economic growth, improve living standards, and create are more resilient and prosperous future for our country. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, can you just give us a quick rundown on what is on the TOR for the Supply Chain Council? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I do not have the TOR in front of me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but it is really to just look at the fair labour relations across the 14 countries, and discuss issues that have relevance towards industrial relations and try and build a common working environment across its jurisdiction. As you know, various countries are at different levels in terms of their labour relations, so this is an endeavour to actually have open discussions amongst the 14 in the IPEF family and continue to improve labour relations across all jurisdictions.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1406 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. My question to you honourable Minister is, what are some of the activities that will be undertaken to enhance Fiji’s supply chain capabilities? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Basically, the way IPEF is conducting, the forward progress is there are various elements. There are elements around capacity building, which was actually initiated by Fiji as a major component of IPEF. Before Fiji’s participation, it was not really there as a need. There will be a lot of capacity building, there will be a lot of sharing information particularly in terms of the capabilities of some of the countries in terms of supply chain support. By virtue of the relationship, we hope to see more closer working together in terms of getting cheaper imports, for example. That is the type of relationship building that may result from IPEF and we will be keen to progress as we go along. Land Transport Authority – RSL Number Plates (Question No. 105/2024) HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament why LTA is holding on to the RSL number plates for those providers whose approval has been given and are already providing the service? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform Parliament that all road users, vehicle owners, passengers and permit holders of public services vehicles are governed by the Land Transport Act 1998 and its corresponding regulations under the Land Transport Regulation 2000. With regard to the question, I would like to advise the honourable Member that effective 1 st January, 2018, the LTA ceased issuing Rural Service Licenses (RSL) following amendments to the Land Transport Public Service Vehicle Regulation. Regulation 18A sub-regulation (6)(d) specifies that an RSL issued before this date is deemed either minibus permit or a road permit for carrier licenses, depending on the vehicle’s construction. Since then, the LTA has been converting valid RSLs issued prior to 1 st January, 2018 into either mini-bus license or carrier license based on the vehicle type. To- date, a total of 460 RSL permits have been converted, with this process continuing during annual registration or renewals for those RSL holders who have not yet completed the conversion. I would like to reassure the honourable Members that LTA is diligently processing the conversion of all RSLs into other minibus licenses (LM) or carrier licenses (LC) and is committed to facilitating this transition. All permit holders are encouraged to visit any LTA branch to complete the conversion and obtain the necessary number plates. HON. V. LAL.- The initial question came out of a complaint from a RSL provider, Sir, that despite providing all the relevant documents, some of the RSL providers have not been paid. This has been happening for some time, we have received a number of complaints. Why is it so, Sir? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I can look into that specific case, but as I mentioned, from the initially issued 460 RSLs, only eight have yet to be converted. That is the process which the LTA is currently going through in terms of the process when they are coming up for their license renewal. I am not sure about that case, maybe it is included, but we can look into it.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1407 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Are you sure?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- He needs the specific details:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Are you satisfied honourable Virendra Lal? HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to confirm with the honourable Minister, only eight left from the 460, after that there will be no more RSLs? They will be fully converted to LM and LC?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is correct:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I will make that the last supplementary question. HON. V. NATH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his answers, but looking at issuing of RSL to twin cabs, these were given to a few twin cabs like in Levuka and Ra where the road condition was not good, where a normal carrier cannot go. I believe these RSL permits are not being renewed. Can the honourable Minister throw light on this, please?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have to check on those specific ones.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- That is okay:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Who raised the question, you, honourable Nath? Honourable Bala is saying okay. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is alright, since the honourable Minister has agreed that he will probably provide the answers later. That is alright with me because I understand, given the landscape of few places where normal carriers cannot go, and he is aware too. I remember him asking a similar question when he was this side of Parliament. Probably, he will come back with the answer at a later stage. Impacts of the PALM Programme (Question No. 106/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations update Parliament on the impacts of the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Programme towards children of workers engaged in this Programme and what is the Ministry doing to address these challenges? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government sees the PALM Scheme and the New Zealand Seasonal Work Scheme as initiatives for economic benefits, empowerment and sustainable development through increased remittances and skills enhancements to strengthen the economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour mobility for our unskilled Fijian workers offers a means for individuals to access employment opportunities, acquire new skills and generate income to support their families and communities, including children.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1408 Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour mobility schemes have a positive impact on children of workers by providing them with access to better education, financial stability and opportunities for personal growth and development. Amidst the economic opportunities and contributions generated by labour programmes, there exists significant challenges on children’s welfare and protection not only in Fiji, but globally as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, children face multiple challenges due to labour mobility, such as prolonged family separations, educational challenges, social isolation, emotional stress and lack of stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, children left behind by their parents engaged under such schemes are, at least, being neglected and exploited due to economic pressures put on them under the care of a single parent or guardians. The absence of proper care and support exposes children to limited accessibility to education and healthcare. A small number of parents also get involve in extra-marital affairs and neglect their families back at home. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that we address the issue, to ensure that benefits of labour mobility do not come at the expense of the vulnerable children, emphasising the need for comprehensive social policies and support systems to protect the children from abuse and neglect. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, through my Ministry, is currently taking crucial steps to address this issue. These include: (1) The expansion of the four days pre-departure briefing into two weeks to be more comprehensive and includes spouses, as well as caregiver participation and family focus sessions on family welfare and communication. (2) Reviewing client registration forms to include information on children of workers under the care of parents left behind or guardians to strengthen our data collection, enabling effective monitoring on children who may be exposed to vulnerable situations. (3) Review the recruitment and selection process to discourage the participation of both parents in the scheme. (4) The role of appointed Country Liaison Officers in attending to cases where workers disengage from their families and the provision for pastoral care. (5) Conducting financial literacy programmes which the families of workers can actively participate in, to ensure that remittances are managed effectively and contribute to the long-term wellbeing of the children. (6) Establishing networks with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection and the Legal Aid Commission to provide the necessary support to children of spouses of disengaged labour mobility workers. The Fiji Council of Social Services representatives is also on our National Employment Centre Board. (7) Encouraging workers engaged under long-term to visit their families back home during the four-week break in December. (8) Participation of the recent Family Accompaniment Programme for August 2024, which is a step forward for Fijian PALM workers to take their families to Australia, reducing the impact of prolonged separation. The Ministry along with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade held information sessions with 82 interested families two weeks ago. Under the conditions of this visa, spouses will have full work rights while in Australia and children can attend local public schools without paying international student fee.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1409 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Australian Federal Government’s recent announcement on establishing a world-first Workplace Justice Visa, allowing migrant workers, including labour mobility workers, who have been exploited at work, to extent their visa and seek justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the good news continues. Last week also saw the introduction of a new stronger protections against visa cancellation for workers when they have been subjected to workplace wrongdoings. No longer will workers need to make the difficult choice between maintaining their visa and seeking justice at work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, redeployment in the same industry is now also possible, which was not there in the past. Why I am saying all these things, Sir, workers normally abscond or run away when they are ill-treated at the workplace, and they do not get justice. Now, all these is going to prevent them from getting into anything illegal because they have their rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these is because of the continuous dialogue we have been having with the Australian authorities and the relevant stakeholders during our ministerial visits. Had this been done several years earlier, by now, this problem would probably have been mitigated…. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> …much further.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> It hurts you because you didn’t do it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Oh!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Washing the hog now:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, to effectively protect children in the context of labour mobility collaboration amongst Government, Civil Society Organisations and stakeholders is crucial. Comprehensive strategies are needed to safeguard children’s rights and address risks from family separation due to labour mobility engagements. We are now in the process of establishing a working group of relevant stakeholders to monitor and resolve problems faced by the children of our workers. In this instance, again, the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection, as well as the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, will be included. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above strategies put in place will assist the Government to prevent children from being harmed in any way due to prolonged absence of parents and seeks to ensure that children remain safe and supported and connected with their families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, UNICEF and the Government of Vanuatu hosted a meeting of the labour sending countries on 16th July and 17th July, to discuss a report done by Academics from the University of Western Sydney as well as USP, on the negative impact of the Scheme on children that are left behind. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also discussed measures to be put in place for the prevention and mitigation of this impact.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>5 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1410 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcome document should be ready in the coming weeks and then I will also be able to present a full Ministerial Statement on further studies that we will employ to prevent the negative impact on children. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister for that very detailed reply. Honourable Members, I would like to take this time to introduce a housekeeping matter and, that is, for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times. I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
