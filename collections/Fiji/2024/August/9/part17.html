ANNEXURE II ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 160/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport (Ref. Pages: 1649) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MINISTER FOR PUBLIC WORKS, METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES AND TRANSPORT (Hon. Ro F. Q. Tuisawau) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 160/2024 is as follows: Fiji has a total of 69 lighthouses located across its various islands and coastal regions, serving as critical aids for maritime navigation and safety. Out of these, 51 lighthouses which equates to 73 percent, are currently operational. There are 18 non-operational lighthouses, representing 17 percent of the total lighthouses. Most of these lighthouses were damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, which was one of the most powerful cyclones to ever hit Fiji, causing widespread devastation. The force of the cyclone resulted in significant structural damage to many of these vital navigational aids, rendering them inoperative and highlighting the urgent need for repair and restoration. Out of the 18 non-operational lighthouses, the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) successfully repaired and brought back into operation three lighthouses in the last financial year (2023/2024). These lighthouses are: (1) Lautoka Harbour - Pinder Reef Light; (2) Beqa Island - South West Reef Light; and (3) Suva Harbour - North East End Light. MSAF has a comprehensive plan to commit, through its budgetary allocations, to repair and make operational a total of three lighthouses per year over the next five years, from 2024 to 2029. The three lighthouses scheduled for the 2024/2025 financial year are: (1) Beqa Island - Nawamati Point Light; (2) Makogai Island Light; and (3) Lau Group - Vatoa Island Light. Additionally, in the 2024/2025 financial year, Government has allocated budget to MSAF, through its Aids to Navigation Capital Allocation, to construct 21 Light Beacons from Natovi to Ovalau and Natovi to Nabouwalu, which are among the most congested and frequently used navigational passages in Fiji, operating 24/7. Beyond lighthouses, the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) also maintains various other Aids to Navigation (ATONS) structures to ensure safe maritime travel. These include Light Beacons, Leading Beacons, and Navigation Buoys. Currently, there are a total of 14 Light Beacons, of which 13 are operational and one is non-operational.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>Additionally, there are 4 Leading Beacons, with 3 being operational and one non-operational. Furthermore, there are 13 Navigation Buoys, with 10 operational and 3 non-operational. These ATONS structures are crucial for guiding vessels safely through Fiji's waters, and MSAF is committed to their ongoing maintenance and repair to uphold maritime safety standards. iv.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53</p></body>
