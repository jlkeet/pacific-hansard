<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for this week. I also welcome those sitting in the gallery, bula vinaka. I acknowledge the presence of Mrs. Kamikamica and Ms. Makereta Waqavonovono. I also welcome all those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. 2024 Women’s Mock Parliament Honourable Members, last week, we conducted the 2024Fji Women’s Mock Parliament after a lapse of seven years. Under the direction of the Steering Committee, 58 women were chosen from a total of 140 applications received. The number gave us an indication that women are eager to take up leadership positions and participate in our democratic processes. The Women’s Mock Parliament gave them the opportunity to learn more about parliament, its key functions and procedures, the important role of Parliamentary committees and understanding some key policy issues. Some of us sat in the gallery during their debates and it was encouraging to hear the issues discussed and the research done by these women in the short time given to them. I am amazed of the confidence that they portrayed, their poise and how they delivered. These kinds of opportunities, if provide, more women will participate in the democratic and decision-making processes, and they will become change makers in their communities.</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>1622</p><h4>Communications from the Speaker</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 I also acknowledge the generous support of the governments of Australian, Japan and New Zealand through the UNDP under the Fiji Parliament Support Project towards the Women’s Mock Parliament, and given that the project is not permanent, I call on the Government through the Ministry of Finance to acknowledge the significance and importance of such an activity and therefore support Parliament’s budget submission for such events in the future.

Niudamu will replace honourable F. S. Koya Thank you Honourable Members and we will proceed to the next item.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE. - Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would just like to raise a Point of Order on Standing Order 114(4). This is a Point of Order and also a dissenting motion. The Standing Order 114(4) reads:</p><h4>“Each party is, as far as possible, entitled to be represented on each standing</h4><h4>committee in a way that fairly reflects that party’s representation in Parliament.”</h4><p>In Standing Order 4, in the Definition of party, Standing Order 4(2) allows: “… three or more independent members who have formed a working relationship for the purposes of participating in parliamentary business in relation to which these Standing Orders … must be treated as a party…” Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing us to remain here as Independent Members of Parliament and for allowing us to work in different blocs that we have decided to be in the bloc on our side, the bloc of 16 and the bloc of 9. We really thank you from the bottom of our hearts. But in Standing Order 114, it is clear that it says, the intent of this is representation in Standing Committees should be proportional to the party’s representation in Parliament. In this case we are not a party, we are just a bloc, but if you look at the totality of the Opposition Independent Members, we are a total of 26. If we look at the percentage in that 26 that comprises of the Group of 16, we make up 61.5 percent. I would submit, Sir, in accordance with this Standing Order that the proportion of places in Standing Committees for this bloc of 16 should be 61.5 or close to 62 percent, and that is the ground on which I am making this Standing Order. I do not know how else to suggest it in accordance with the Standing Orders. MR. SPEAKER.- I thank you for raising that issue again. That has been raised with me by honourable Koya several times because of the numbers, but again, let me make myself very clear here. Before all this happened, I had written a letter to each and every 26 honourable Member for you to decide when the axe falls from the Supervisor of Elections on the deregistration, what would you choose yourself to be, either you become an Independent or you join other political parties. All of you decided, some wrote to me, some stated during their participation of the debate in the House that all elected to be Independents.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>By being Independent, honourable Usamate, you are not a political party. By operation of law, you have decided. You came in through the party system but by operation of law, you are now deemed as Independent. So as such, we have played it our level best to see how we can have you all participating effectively in these Standing Committees, et cetera. First of all, I have decided that you all remain Independent, and you become the blocs - Bloc 16 and Bloc 9, and each of you select your Whip, even your Leader and most of all, it has to have the written approval of all your Members. The 16 I have received with the exception of one, honourable Alvick Maharaj, who is still pursuing his case of appeal with the Supervisor of Elections. The rest, you are all Independent and you are categorised according to your wish, you go with the 9 or the 16, and I hope if we could stay that way until we finish this term. It is a bit difficult for us, but we just have to make do with whatever is there to help us decide on the best course that you maintain the way you think and the way you want to decide as well as the Group of 9. Sometimes I hear that it is good, that you have agreed to come together. You have even agreed to come together during the Business Committee in sharing the questions, that is the way to go because effectively, you all come from one party, but as I stated, by operation of law, when the Supervisor of Elections has to deregister the party, it is the voters that put you in Parliament, you are not sacked from Parliament. You are still a Member of Parliament, but you now work in groups because you cannot be working together as one, even though you came through one party, but this is how you operate. That again, is democracy. You are just showing the true colours of democracy that exist now, otherwise this would not have happened. Maybe we could be going for a by-election for all the 26 seats and that will not happen because that is the way I see as you being deemed Independent. When you came through, you came through FijiFirst Party, but the stage of events has happened, so you are now still in the House as Independent under the two working groups. I hope you can continue to work together. That is all my reply to you honourable Usamate and also for the queries being raised by honourable Koya to me after the Business Committee. I hope that provides a satisfactory answer to all your queries about who you are now in the House. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I raise another matter? MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your explanation….</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Usually honourable Usamate, the directive given by the Speaker is not questionable. If you want to question, take it to the Courts. I made that decision, but I am allowing it, since I want to encourage more conversation. What is your next point? HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Sir, for your magnanimity in allowing me to just ask this question. The question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my understanding, forgive me for my ignorance if I am wrong, is that the honourable Leader of the Opposition would be the one that would nominate the people to take up the seats in the Standing Committees, so in this particular case, is that still in order or is that no longer in order? MR. SPEAKER.- In the Standing Committees, the honourable Leader of the Opposition was elected through the Constitution and that was done in this august House. By virtue of that, he still maintain his seat because none of you have come forward with the suggestion that you change it. That is the only way we will change it - in the House. But inasfar as his role, that is now being kind of curtailed by that operation of law, you are all deemed as Independents including him, but by virtue</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1625 of him being selected or elected in the House under the Constitution, he still maintains his Leader of the Opposition. The rest, you and I can understand, it is a bit difficult for him to continue in that regard when the rest of the Members are all regarded as Independent. Am I making myself clear?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Anyone else is still not clear of who they are right now in the House? (Laughter)</p></body>
