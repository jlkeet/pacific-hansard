<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response to that question. My question is related to what he has just mentioned, that for village improvement and sanitation, the Team monitors until it is completed. My question to him is, once the improvements are made, how do you ensure that, that improvement continues and not that it reverts back to what it was before? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Village Improvement Scheme, what we have seen for the past few years is the deteriorating of the standard of our village. This programme, we will try and continue. Once you are being assisted, that is not the end of it. We will continue to make sure the overall village improves. We the Turaga ni Koro and the Nasi ni Koro, whom we will be relying on to help us in maintaining. The actual reason behind this is, we need to improve the standard of living of our people</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1644</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 in the communities. In the last two days, we have discussed about the ablution in the city and towns. We really need to look at that. If we need for them to come and use the public toilets in the towns, we need to improve those that are in the village. It is an issue for Fiji realistically. If we go anywhere, we have seen how clean is the public space, especially when everyone is using it. The Ministry of iTaukei wants to take it to the village level, to make sure they look after it, because that is very important. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a question to the honourable Minister on community halls. Given the experience in the past, community halls are used as evacuation centres. My question to the honourable Minister is on the standards and the plan, whether it goes through the same approval process in terms of housing, because previously we had community halls that collapsed, but they were used as evacuations centres? My question is basically on the standards of these community halls. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a good question. We have already discussed it with our team. From the next budget, we will not be touching community halls, it is just because of that. We need an engineer and a specialised team to look at the structure and things like that. We will leave the community halls to the Ministry of Rural Development, and we will just take care of the small ones, because we do not have the expertise. But for the ones that we are doing now, we have advised the team to make sure the structure is done properly, but for the next one, we will leave it for the Ministry of Rural Development to take care of the community halls. We might just be doing the repair to make sure it is in a good standard. MR. SPEAKER.- That is a good question. In my village in Somosomo, we take it upon ourselves to do the maintenance of all our meeting our houses, the Church and everything, because help from the Government should go elsewhere because we can do it on our own. That is how we should be ensuring that the small money that is set aside for such purposes is distributed to those who are really in need, especially when it comes to disaster centres. It is not easy, but we have been doing it for the last so many years. We took a leaf from Buca Village in Natewa - Niko Nawaikula’s village, and in Drekeniwai. They do their own fundraising to see that these village halls and churches are fully funded, because they also act as disaster centres. I think it is upon us, leaders, that we should be ensuring that we continue to forge ahead in this area without relying too much on Government funds. Training Offered for PRB Tenants (Question No. 158/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, before I ask my question, I would like to wish the people of Fiji the Happy World Indigenous Day. Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament on the type of training offered to tenants of the Public Rental Board? MR. SPEAKER.- Is that from SDGs - the World Indigenous Day? What do you mean by this, honourable Member?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- United Nations:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- That is interesting:</span> So, it is World Indigenous Day today. I think we should</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1645 be celebrating that and be happy as well as we live in a country that recognizes indigenous freedom, et cetera. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tuiwailevu for the question. The Public Rental Board (PRB) was established in 1989 to provide transitional rental housing accommodation to low income earners around the country. The PRB flats are rented out to low income earners at a very affordable weekly rate and they are assisted in annual Government funded rental subsidy assistance. In the last financial year, there were 813 families or tenants that were assisted with the Government subsidy of $1.2. million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the purpose of the flats are to serve as transitional flat for tenants, occupants or tenants are expected to exit the PRB flats after six years to allow others on the waiting list to be accommodated. The migrating tenants are expected to move into the new homes after six years in any PRB estate. Unfortunately, due the challenges of accessing affordable homes in the real estate market, there has been a low rate in migration to home ownership by the PRB sitting tenants. To assist and promote economic and financial empowerment to the sitting tenants, the Board continues to liaise with financial institutions and the Ministry of Trade and Commerce to conduct financial literacy trainings for the past 18 months. The sole objective of these trainings is to improve budget management skills as well as promote savings among the tenants. Some of the tenants that attended the trainings can access Small Business Grant from the Ministry of Trade and Commerce after being awarded training certificates. I thank the honourable Minister as well and his Ministry for assisting and also providing tenants to some of the sitting tenants around our PRB estates. Such initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the PRB helps in preparing tenants to access a stable income to support their families and to know the significance of savings which will allow them to purchase their own home after migrating from the PRB estate. There was a total of four financial literacy trainings conducted by PRB on financial literacy training and small business in the Central Division. These trainings were accommodated by the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. The trainings were held in the following Estates - Raiwai, Newtown, Mead Road and McFarlane Estate with a total of 123 tenants attending the training and around 60 percent of the tenants applied for the grant and awaiting outcome of their applications. The effectiveness of these trainings has led four tenants from Mead Road Estate to receive Government grants and are currently running their own small businesses; two of the four tenants have their own vegetables and fruits stalls along Mead Road. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Board has also a PRB office in the North and also conducted eight financial leaderships trainings which were hosted by the Fiji Development Bank and Consumer Council. A total of 323 tenants participated in these trainings in four estates. They are in Tuatua in Labasa, Naqere in Savusavu, as well as Naodamu and Vunimoli Estates. The result of these trainings has shown in the number of tenants that have started their own small businesses such as planting, selling produce in the market to assist in their rent payments and women’s clubs also being formed in Naodamu Estate in Labasa that allowed women in this estate to sell their farm produce, mats, food packs and also assist them in their savings for their respective families. The Fiji Development Bank and Unit Trust of Fiji have also carried awareness in several estates in the Western Division. Various programmes include assistance that institutions are willing to offer to the tenants. The Public Rental Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue its work to assist their tenants in practicing skills related to budgeting, savings and to prepare them for uncertain times consequently enabling them to achieve important financial goals.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1646</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir and I also thank the honourable Minister for his response. Honourable Minister my question to you is related to the programmes that you deliver in the Public Rental Board. How do you gauge the change in financial behaviour of the tenants who have received this training? you. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. An interesting feature about families or tenants that live in these Public Rental Board Estates, these are all low income earners and some do not have fixed employment and …. MR. SPEAKER.- Order! There is running commentary going on in front of me. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- The programme that has been initiated by Public Rental Board is a new initiative and because they are mostly low income earners, some are just single income earners with their families, some have struggled and with this type of assistance, especially the women, they have gone further after obtaining certificates. They have assisted their families, not only in the repayment of their monthly rental, they have also assisted in other family needs in their respective families. So overall, there is financial as well as economic empowerment to all those who have attended the trainings. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the information that is provided about the training of tenants at PRB. The question is, during COVID some of the tenants had accumulated in arrears and if the Ministry or Government can consider forgiving those arrears, given most of them are low income earners - security guards, elderly women and some are single mothers. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is a very valid statement that has been provided to us this afternoon by the honourable Member. Because of the financial background of these sitting tenants, majority of them faced financial difficulties in trying to pay or meet their monthly repayments and some of their payments have gone into arrears. The Board in the last financial year have also assisted in forgiving some of the arrears that were accrued by some of the sitting tenants. MR. SPEAKER.- We will press on, honourable Members.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBERS.- Vinaka:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you:</span> Some have requested to attend their midday prayers, and I have allowed that as well.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>List of MSAF Capital Projects for 2024-2025 (Question No. 159/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport provide Parliament the complete list of capital projects to be undertaken by MSAF in the 2024–2025 Financial Year, indicating the following for each project; (a) The project’s budget; (b) The anticipated completion date; and</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1647 (c) The project benefits and beneficiaries of each project. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask for permission to make some general comments before I answer the written question? MR. SPEAKER.- Alright, you do not like the question or what? 1 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I do have the answer. The pattern of the questioning in terms of what the Opposition has been asking, so throughout my Ministry, we have provided the details to- date of the breakdowns. I am thinking about the separation of powers of the Executive, Parliament and the Judiciary. In the last Parliament when we were in the Opposition…. MR. SPEAKER.- Is full of wisdom, what you have stated. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- When we were in Opposition, these kinds of questions never got through from our side in the Business Committee. I know that you are not the individuals you were at that time. (Laughter) You are now reformed. I noticed a big change have overcome you so the whole nation is grateful for that, but still I am …. MR. SPEAKER.- They have seen the light. (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Even though the light has resulted in sort of disintegration but still we have seen the light. That is the question. Just from my perspective as a Minister in terms of Parliament and the Executive, the principle there is as a government, we are elected and the Parliament oversees, but we run, I suppose uninterferred as the Executive or the management of the ministries. Secondly, when we are given the authority to operationalise the budget into programmes and implementation, we do it on the assumption that there would not be any political interference, but with the provision of these kinds of detailed information, there is the danger in that, that the prioritisation according to what the civil servants have given us in the budget can be politicised in this Parliament with ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Be transparent, don’t worry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what he is trying to say:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I am not saying that it will happen, what I am saying is there is the danger of that. It relates back to the separation of powers. The last point, as the Executive, in any organisation structure you report as a manager to the Chief Executive. So, I report to my Chief Executive who is the honourable Prime Minister, but now I feel I have two Chief Executives - the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Usamate. 1 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 159/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure I.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1648</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- This is Parliament:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, that is what I am saying, exactly that is what I am saying. Now the Parliament is infringing on my reporting line because of the provision of this information which can result in them doing that. So, these are just some general observations.</p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Now, you are begging us even to ask more questions.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I am just making some general observations in terms of the management of the State as per the Judiciary, the Executive and Parliament. The demarcation is becoming confused because now I feel that someone else is monitoring my performance when Parliament should really be referring to the Annual Report of the Ministry to oversee and the Auditor- General’s Reports. When those reports on the Ministry and the Auditor-General’s Reports comes in, that is when the Opposition comes in.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is right:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> But now with that information, it is like ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> How do we hold you accountable? (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, has given me the right to raise these fundamental issues of democracy. The demarcation is there but we are crossing the lines, and it can result in confusion, which is what is happening now. Because we are a Government with a good heart, we are not like the last government which did not provide information and blocked things at the Business Committee, I hereby give you the information. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have stated this on more than one occasion and that is for the Opposition, the only punch that they can score with is on questions. For the Government side, whether we like it or not, we just have to ensure that we have everything on the fingertips so when question time arises, that is when they throw everything at us. I remember when we were in the Opposition, the Government needs to change their tactics in answering questions. They did not want to ask specifically for roads from our constituents but rather for the whole of the nation roads, it is quite difficult but that is the game that they played in the past government. We had to follow, but it kept us raising questions all the time. So, honourable Minister, with due respect to your answers being supplied on time, I humbly ask you that you please take on the questions, come what may and just reply; that is all. HON. V. NATH.- Before I ask the question, may I congratulate the Baby Bula Boys Under 16 soccer team and the management for their fine performance against Tahiti. This is the first time in history they have qualified to play the Under 17 World Cup in 2025. I was watching Junior Shankar playing and it really inspired my son, Krish who is at Nehru Primary School. MR. SPEAKER.- Were you watching soccer during Parliamentary hours? (Laughter)</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1649 HON. V. NATH. – No, this game was yesterday. I was not watching today but I did watch it yesterday evening and I enjoyed the game. So, I would like to congratulate the coach, the managers and the players as well. Fine job boys, keep it up! Before I ask my question, I was just hoping that the honourable Minister will not argue, like how he argued with his Lelean OB. Status of Lighthouses Around Fiji (Question No. 160/2024) HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the status of the various lighthouses around Fiji, how many are operational and how many are not, and what are the plans to repair, replace and maintain the lighthouses? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Just to clarify, I was not arguing with honourable Usamate, it 2 was just some observation. Sir, I have the answer to the written question, and I have been very cooperative. The next time, I will not give it when it comes to this session.</p></body>
