<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes, with a 10 minute response by the Minister responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate. Review of the 2013 Constitution HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I do deliver the Statement, I wish all the schools that are at the knockout stages for Deans, I will not mention a particular school in the interest of my safety, and I also would like to wish the honourable Alitia Bainivalu a happy birthday. MR. SPEAKER.- Are you talking about QVS?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> Maybe, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to make a statement on what I firmly believe is a priority issue for Fiji and, that is, that the 2013 Constitution is to be reviewed as soon as practically possible. I will take one step further and say the truth and reconciliation should only be attempted after the Constitution is reviewed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that this process of review will have to commence from this House under your leadership, as the Head of our Legislature, where we will have to agree and give our blessings for the review of the 2013 Constitution, of course, when the required Bill is tabled in this House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am of the view that this Constitution does not have a unifying effect on the people of Fiji. There is a big divide, mostly along political lines, on the support or otherwise on 2 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 160/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure II.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1650 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 this Constitution. One of the reasons is because these is this perception that this Constitution is attached or aligned to one political party. I have held that view well before I became a Member of Parliament. Since the first Elections under this Constitution in 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution has been the subject of criticism and, sometimes, even ridiculed in this House and outside of this House. There has been a constant chorus of voices from individuals and organisations to review this Constitution. Recently, a political party, not represented in this House, publicly announced that they are putting together a team to push for a way to change or amend this Constitution. In the last few days, when the media got wind of the fact that I will be making this statement today both, criticisms and praise had come from the members of the public on my statement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take advantage of this privilege given to MPs to make statements in this House, to add my voice to the call for a review of the 2013 Constitution and I thank my fellow colleagues, who also wanted to make a statement today, who are giving way to me to make my statement. I will provide a few reasons on why I think this Constitution needs to be reviewed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution has to be reviewed to remove its perceived connection to one political party. This has been a downside to this Constitution, perhaps, because of the process that was followed to create it. When there is, at least, a perception that this Constitution, or any Constitution for that matter is connected to a political party, the Constitution becomes a political pointscoring issue. In the last Election, the Parties on the Government side campaign on changing the Constitution and this side, maintained that this Constitution is good.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You are one of them:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> Yes, I was one of them.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am of the view that the Constitution should never be used as a political campaign point because that will make one supporter of the Constitution contingent on which political party one supports. In the perfect setting, I believe that a constitution is supposed to be supported and respected irrespective of political affiliation. This perception of attachment of the Constitution to one political party will only be removed if this Constitution is taken back to the people and it comes back to this House from the people, and when we and those that come after us to this august Chamber, hold our Holy Books and swear an Oath to uphold the Constitution, we swear an Oath to uphold the will of the people rather than the will of a few. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we learn that lesson, then we know that it will be a big and grave mistake for the Government of the day, should they lay claim to the reviewed Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the situation that this House is in right now, where we have an Opposition (26 in total) that are all independent Members of Parliament and there is no political parties in Opposition, is not covered in the Constitution. The only reference in the Constitution closest to this situation that we are in is in Section 78(c), which refers to Independent Members of Parliament not in support of the Prime Minister to be included in the voting process to appoint the Leader of the Opposition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we heard your ruling this morning and the discussions that ensued. I must thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your wisdom and insight in guiding Parliament to adjust and accommodate this unprecedented situation that we are in, especially given the lack of guidance</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1651 provided in the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, upholding the Constitution does not mean that we should not amend it. Upholding it, in my view, means that we must also ensure that the Constitution remains relevant to the situation that the nation encounters. When the Constitution’s capacities to cope with new issues and demands thrust on it is weak or lacking, there is an inherent need to strengthen it, and that strengthening process is through a review and amendment, if necessary. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution is not all bad, but not all good either. Let me quote a few sections to illustrate this point: Chapter 1, Section 6(a) and (b), in my view, is a section that is worth retaining. It reads, and I quote: “Any attempt to establish a Government other than in compliance with this Constitution shall be unlawful, and – (a) anything done to further that attempt is invalid and of no force or effect; and (b) no immunities can lawfully be granted under any law to any person in respect of actions taken or omitted in furtherance of such an attempt.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, this section is what I refer to as the anti-coup clause. It is worth keeping, and there are many more good Sections in this Constitution that we should keep. A Clause that could be or should be amended, in my view, is in Chapter 5, Section 113(2), which refers to the remuneration and benefits to Judicial Officers. It reads, and I quote: “The salaries and benefits payable to the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal shall be determined by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister following consultation by the Prime Minister with the Attorney General.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me declare that I am not imputing any wrongdoing or any sinister motive on any of those high office holders mentioned in this section, and I respect all the past and serving holders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my view, this Clause breaks important democratic values that a constitution should protect. It breaks the very important rule of the Separation of Powers, in my view. It puts into question the independence of the Judiciary, at least, the Head of the Judiciary. In my view, the Head of the Executive cannot and should not determine the salaries and benefits of the Head of the Judiciary, and this clause also, Mr. Speaker, opens up the high office in the land to unfair criticism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 131(2) on the role of the Military has been the subject of criticism and discussion. It is, in my view, as the former holder of the Head of the Military, in my view, it is too broad, and a lot of our hope is dependent on the character and the good judgment of the Head of the Military to exercise his powers correctly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those two Clauses that I had mentioned, alone warrants an amendment in this Constitution and, sadly, there are a few more. I urge all Members of this august House to seriously think about the importance of and the urgent need to take this Constitution back to the</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1652 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 people to be reviewed and amended as necessary. It is our duty as representatives of the people to do so. It will come back to this House from the people and, as I have mentioned at the beginning of my statement, we and those who will be elected to this House in the years to come, will hold their Holy Books and swear that they will uphold a Constitution that truly encapsulates the will of the people. The 2013 Constitution has brought this nation back into a democratically elected Government in 2014 until now. To review and amend this Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is never ‘anti’ anything, it is not anti-anyone or anti-any group or anti-any political party. In fact, it is pro – pro-the people, it is pro- nation building, it is pro-democracy, and this is the way we perfect our young democracy. The work of perfecting our democracy is never-ending, it will continue well into the future by those who will come after us. But now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our turn - the whole 56 of us on this floor, including you, Mr. Speaker, as the Head of the Legislature. In closing, to use the analogy of a potter who puts his hand on the clay to help remove its imperfection. It is now our time, our turn to put our hands on our imperfect democracy and remove its imperfection. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- And I now call on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to make his response. The floor is yours, Sir. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate my words of congratulations to all the indigenous peoples of the world on World Indigenous Day. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the End of the Week Statement by the honourable Naupoto, calling for review of the 2013 Constitution. I was going to ask the honourable Attorney- General to do this for me, but I found that I still have time to contribute before I go to the next appointment with my colleagues from Tonga and the Cook Islands, and Troika of Pacific Islands Forum. At the outset, Sir, allow me to place on record that I already have agreed to the proposition. I am very much in favour and also commit the Government to the various efforts that will go into working towards the completion of this task. The 2013 Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sets out the power to the State, limitations on the State in relation to citizens and must protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. Further, those who exercise power must be held accountable to the people they serve. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is particularly important in a multiethnic, multireligious and multicultural nation like Fiji, to have a constitution brought about by consensus, and with consent and ownership from all constituent communities. We are seeing right now around the world, Sir, the coming into conflict, the various interests in the various societies and communities around the world. Recently, we saw the disturbances in Bangladesh and in the United Kingdom.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1653 We could be blamed for starting all these in 1987, but since then, everyone has realised the dynamics of ethnicities around the world. Wherever we are, if we are involved in the formulation of constitutions, or the foundations of lawmaking and governing in all these communities, none of which now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is monogamous. We are all multiethnic, there is no other monoethnic society in the world right now. And we must expect that there will continue to be uprising, may be not violent, it will be uprising anyway. People and groups are coming up and voicing their concerns - the French revolution, the war of independence in America. This morning in Caucus I mentioned to my colleagues those two upheavals happening in Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. People will continue to question, why? Why is this happening in my home? How do I define my home? I am reminded of what the late Archbishop Mataca said in the process of working towards a constitution after the 1997 Constitution was put out of place. He said this, and I quote: “No matter how we come to be in Fiji, or how long we have been here, we are all part of this land. It is the land of our birth or the land of our adoption, the land to which we belong. That brought home to me the need for national not just communal leadership. I was looking at communal leadership in the beginning of my journey or my venture into politics, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My first political party was ethnicity based but since I became elected to be the Prime Minister for all races, all ethnicities in Fiji, my perception changed. But since then, there have been other dynamics applied on our leadership role. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Naupoto mentioned this morning his role as the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces under this Constitution and what the current Commander in General, Ratu Jone might be thinking at this time. There is that thought within the military, what about us? How will we fair in any new arrangement, probably thinking about the immunity clauses taken away, whether some of them or some whom they know might have been involved in those things that they could be brought to trial on so many years after the event. These are things that we will have to think about as we grapple with the reconstruction of our Constitution. Mr. Speaker, recently we had a Professor from the Australian National University who spoke to some of us who went there in a presentation that was organised by the Fiji National University at the University Campus in Nasinu. He gave us some very clear thoughts, but they were his own thoughts. Most of us were there and a lot of people noticed that I was taking down a lot of notes. The notes I was taking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was not for me to ask the questions later that night but for me to be able to use as we continue on this journey. Sir, the requirements of the Constitution, we are at leisure to look up those requirements for the amendments. Some of them, as he said that night, are pretty impossible to achieve. We are talking about three-quarters of the membership of the House which we know we have, we easily calculate that. We are talking about three-quarters of the registered voters, depends on what day, what time we make the count. How many died since we took the count and before they cast their votes? What figure will we be looking at? It is so, so difficult. I am hoping that before we get to that stage, we will have worked out the formular or more achievable formular to be able to execute the tasks that we have given ourselves and I must congratulate the honourable Naupoto for bringing this up. We said that it was part of our manifesto. His party did not say it that they would do it but he has said this morning to this honourable House that the responsibility for laying the foundations of governance in any country must come from the</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1654 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 people themselves. It is not necessarily the duty of one political party to be defending a constitution nor any other political party to try and amend it. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned various upheavals happening around the world. As a former peacekeeper, I have seen the destruction of ethnic differences being taken out and weaponised. I hope we do not get to that stage, I was hoping I would be able to put a fullstop there, but this time, I cannot put the fullstop. I will have to say, “we do not get to that stage again.” MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that is all about democracy. We sit and listen to the various views whether it is for or against. That is why we are here; to listen to this kind of opposing views and supporting views, just to how best we can continue to move ahead. I thank you for that statement, honourable Naupoto. It has been a while since we have now heard this in this august House and I am so happy to be part of this team. I only hope that those who will be deciding this will certainly have a heart to hear this and continue to hear it and continue to prepare to make adjustments. This is all for us. Government Grant to Tertiary Institutions HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable fellow Members of Parliament, a very good afternoon to you all. Mr. Speaker, for many years the governments have been giving grants to tertiary institutes and not small amounts but figures amounting into millions of dollars. Mr. Speaker, when not enough scholarships were awarded to students and when the tuition fee was not as massive as it is today, it made prefect sense to provide grants to tertiary institutes to support the student in subsidising the tuition fees and paying for the salaries of lecturers and support staff. Mr. Speaker, the world has changed. Since the inception of grants system to tertiary institutes, the demand has increased and the grounds for applying grants has changed as well. Mr. Speaker, I believe we need to revisit the formula and criteria that is used to determine the grants to tertiary institutes. If we look at the school grants given to primary and secondary schools, it is well defined and very clear. Where and how the money can be utilised is clearly documented. This system allows proper scrutiny and leaves no chance for abuse of funds. Now that the Government is providing scholarships to students and paying tuition fee at a rate that is determined by the universities, should we continue with current grant system is my first question. I am not saying we should stop the grant, but what we need to do is to revisit the criteria. Investing in the education sector is one of the best investments a nation can do to improve the socio-economic status of the country. Investing in education is investing in the future. A knowledgeable society with a high rate of literacy allows the nation to develop at a much faster rate. Mr. Speaker, during my time when I was a student at the Fiji school of Medicine, even as a private student, two-thirds of my tuition fee was subsidised through the grant that was provided to tertiary institutes. With an unfortunate reason, the grant is no longer used to subsidise the private students. We all know that there are close to 19,000 students who are studying privately and around 15,500 students who are on scholarship. The number of private students are as follows: (1) University of Fiji - 1,550; (2) Fiji National University - 9,310; and (3) University of the South Pacific - 8,120.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1655 This number does not account for those students studying privately or in other tertiary institutes, such as technical colleges. These statistics suggest that we have more students studying as private student compared to those students who are on scholarship. This raises serious concern on what this Government has been preaching about making tertiary institutes free for every student. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the following words may sound very familiar to our ears, "We will remove TELS, we will make sure that every student studies through scholarship, we will make tertiary education free.” How can we justify that there are more private students than those on scholarship under this government? One may argue that during FijiFirst’s time there were private students, but the difference is that at that point in time, they at least had a choice to either take loan or study privately, but now there is no such option. It is either one gets scholarship or forced to study privately. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now that this government has removed the loan scheme, just imagine what parents must be going through to pay for tuition fees. The very policy that they criticized, that by giving loans to students, we were putting burden on the students, and now that they have removed TELS forcing students to study privately resulting in draining out parents of their savings and FNPF. What did the Government achieve by making this blunder when TELS was removed? Where is the free education from pre-school to tertiary institute, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that same note we were also informed that 50 percent of the school grant to the primary and secondary schools is still pending, and we are almost closing second term. Parents are even forced in primary and secondary schools to take part in fundraising. They are forced to pay tuition fees in the name of school levy, ground fees and building fees. (Honourable Government Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> It is, they are.</p><p>If you do not pay these fees or levies, students are not taken into school, and we had raised these concerns. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Stop lying! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- I had given the example of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial School (MGM) whereby two students were not allowed. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Which school? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- MGM. Two students were not allowed to be enrolled because they were not agreeing to it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total tuition fee I paid to complete my four years Bachelors programme in pharmacy, the students now are paying the same amount as tuition fee for just a single year. How can we expect the parents of these 19,000 students to all of a sudden start paying tuition fees from their pockets, withdrawing from their savings in the banks and FNPF that was there to secure the parents future. If parents utilize their FNPF to pay for tuition fees, after retirement, they will not have any option but to fall back on the Government for social assistance thus increasing the burden on the Ministry of Social Protection. My second question, if the taxpayers fund is not used to subsidise the students, then what is given for? Is not there some kind of double dipping that the Government now provides full</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1656 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 scholarship and paying large sums as grant to tertiary institutes? Around $160 million a year and then additional grants to tertiary institutes as well. Is this justified? These are question that we need to ask ourselves as we move forward. My third and most important question is, should we convert this grant as subsidy towards the private student? The main source of revenue for tertiary institutes is through tuition fees. They must be having other source of income that should be used to cover operation cost, travel expense and not use Government grant to cover operational cost. If we continue to provide grant, we should ensure that private students tuition is subsidized, lecturers’ pay is improved and those students already on scholarship, their allowances is readjusted Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also note that use of grant is not scrutinised by Parliament, we have been hearing a lot about accountability and transparency, so these grants should be scrutinised by Parliament. We are dealing with public funds, and we need to be accountable as parliamentarians. Lecturers in certain universities are merely paid peanuts. For example, compare the salary of a lecturer with PhD at FNU to a Vice-Principal in a High School and an Assistant Lecturer’s salary to a High School Teacher. Tutors and support staff too are at a very low salary, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There has been a lot of talks that these grants are being abused, and we as legislators need to scrutinise the use of these grants, the type of course offered, the length of course offered, the job market (if any) when the students graduate, capital projects, et cetera. These grants have been given for too long now without proper accountability and transparency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just yesterday the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts stated, “wherever taxpayer’s money is given directly or indirectly, it should be audited by the Office of Auditor-General.” All grants given needs to be clearly scrutinised. If there is no abuse, no mismanagement of the fund, I do not think there should be any issue with these institutions in allowing Office of Auditor-General to audit the use of these grants. This is something that we need to start exploring in future and let us make an informed decision on the future of the grants given to tertiary institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Currently, the Higher Education Commission determines the amount, but the criteria used is not something that is vetted by this august House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suggest that we form a Parliamentary Committee to investigate the funding structure and criteria. Let the Committee do its report and present it back to Parliament and we as legislators make an informed decision. I still stand that we need to use this grant to subsidise the tuition fees of close to 19,000 private students in Fiji. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the End of Week Statement by the honourable Member in accordance with section 35(2) of the Standing Order. Before that, I would just like to give a quick response on some of the issues that has been highlighted. I just wanted to clarify the 50 percent education grant, the grant has been paid of time for 100 percent for Term 3, 100 percent for Term 1 and 50 percent up to July. So, when the new financial year starts, that is when the other 50 percent, which is, August, that will be paid out. It should be paid out some time next week. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the accountability issue, the honourable Member knows very well when he was part of the previous government, there was no accountability, lack of it, in terms of the funding from the Higher Education Grant. I think if he had listened to my Ministerial Statement on Monday, he would have noted the new initiatives that were undertaken by the Tertiary Scholarships Loan Scheme (TSLS) that will capture over 10,000 students in the new initiatives and also the Hardship</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1657 Scholarship that has been given for those students who have been studying on private arrangement.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> You need to listen, there are 19,000 private students.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- You should have listened on Monday to understand what was mentioned:</span> The Ministry of Education is conscious that the grants released to tertiary institutions are taxpayer’s money. As a Minister for Education, I have emphasised to all tertiary institutions to ensure that the funds are being used as intended and to ensure students are provided with education support. Fiji has a well-oiled workforce available for our future needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the 2024-2025 Financial Year, Government grants have been provided to 13 training institutions, three universities and 10 smaller Higher Education institutes. The basis of the grant assessment, as per the guidelines of the Higher Education Commission of Fiji Regulations, they call for grants made each year and the training institutions submit detailed applications including their annual costed Operating Plan, a yearly budget, current Annual Report, Annual Business Plan and the overall strategic plan. The Higher Education Institutions assesses the relevant documents and recommends the grant amount to be provided to each training institution. Grant request from the training institutions are usually much higher and the grants are usually given out based on the Higher Education Commission of Fiji’s assessment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the grants are approved in the National Budget, the grant agreements are prepared, vetted by the Solicitor-General’s Office and funds are disbursed on a quarterly basis. The total grant for the 2024-2025 Financial Year amounts to $90.7 million. The grants are assessed based on the costs and the purposes intended. Mr. Speaker, Sir, each tertiary institution is different from their varying courses offered and faculty sizes, so cost for each tertiary institution will be different. This cost given to tertiary institutions via the grant will always cover the operational costs, including salaries, programme delivery, development of new programmes, research, rents, utility bills, advertisements, upgrading of IT systems, and the list goes on. How do we determine how much should be given to each higher education institution? The process of grant is one of the Higher Education Commission Fiji’s mandated functions, as enshrined in their Regulation, is to analyse the grant usage from the previous year and following careful assessment by the team, their acquittal is submitted against their costed operation plan, the strategic plan, the budget, and that is when they decide the grant that is given to that training institutions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, there will be a different amount given to higher education institutions which is based on the utilisation rate and the programmes that they run. For example, in the year 2024-2025, some education institutions requested higher amounts and some lower amounts. For example, for Fiji National University, Higher Education Commission of Fiji ascertains surplus funds from the analysis of their financials, then added back that surplus and then reduced the grants that are given to them. Disbursements of grants, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Higher Education of Fiji’s legislation has provisions for fines and suspension of registration if any Higher Education institute is caught for fraudulent act. In terms of the calculation of grant on the fees, this can be part of the review of the universities that is currently conducted by the Higher Education of Fiji.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1658 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, universities are regularly increasing their fees approved by their Councils, at the same time, requesting for grants. This needs to be managed better and hold the training institutions to be accountable and the Higher Education of Fiji, through the current review exercise, will ensure that strategies are identified and implemented that will have stronger accountability on the use of taxpayers’ funds. The Government representatives on the respective university councils continue to be vigilant with the increasing fees or change in programmes. The Higher Education Commission of Fiji’s legislation do not have the powers to monitor fee increase and this can be considered as a proposed way in the current review that is currently being conducted. Government needs to consider investigating issues of increasing fees. The review of the university is currently being conducted by external review team. On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tertiary institutions need to monitor academic progress and provide intervention and learning support to the students, as I have mentioned on Monday, and we all should equally share in encouraging our students to excel academically, as the future of our country depends on them. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure this august House that the Ministry of Education, together with the Higher Education Commission, is more than ever vigilant about ensuring that the taxpayers of this country benefit from the Government Grants provided to the universities and other training institutions around Fiji. Vinaka saka vakalevu. National Statistics on Child Sex Abuse HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to pay tribute to the indigenous people of the world on this International People’s Day, especially to the iTaukei people of the land, the Chiefs and its people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to talk about an issue that is difficult and has been a taboo, and I thank you for this time. Sir, it is time for all of us, those of us in this House, but also our Civil Society Organisations, our communities, families and faith-based organisations, to confront the serious issue of child abuse and child sexual abuse. Each month, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions release a shocking data that exposes the fact that we are failing our children on a daily basis. Data from the Office of the DPP indicate that average age of the youngest victims of child sexual abuse in the past six years is two years old, and the youngest victim was six months old. The average age of the youngest accused person is 12 years old. Three out of five rape cases reported are against children and 23 births out of thousand females are below the age of 18 years of age. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) data reveals that five out of every six children in Fiji suffer abuse or neglect by their family. Let me share more specific data obtained from the Fiji Police Force on child sexual abuse by specific offence reported in the years 2021 to 2023, including January to June 2024. The year 2021 recorded 729 cases, followed by an increase in 2022, with 1,034 cases, and then a decline in 2023 with 844 cases. The first six months of 2024 has so far recorded 324 cases, Mr. Speaker. The monthly average of recording child sexual abuse cases is 54, with rape being the most problem offence targeting children in Fiji. Let me give some breakdown of the CSO’s data of the 324 child sexual abuse cases that were reported during January to June 2024 period, that 13 to 17</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1659 years age group had the highest number of reported cases, that is 215, followed by the 6 to 12 years age group - 94, and the infant, Mr. Speaker, that is, zero to five years age group - 15. Rape was the most prevalent reported offence of 104 cases, followed by Indecent Assault of 71 cases, and Sexual Assault of 60 cases. Females were the overwhelming victims of child sexual abuse, accounting for 297 or 91.7 percent of the reported cases. Male accounted for remaining 27 or abuse, accounting for 297 or 91.7 percent of the reported cases. Male accounted for remaining 27 or 8.3 percent of the cases. Even though there appears to be a declining trend, raw statistics do not always tell the whole story, Mr. Speaker. It is possible that with greater awareness of the dangers to young children, their parents or grandparents understand more clearly the threats to them and are exercising more care. However, Mr. Speaker, any child that has to go through the trauma of abuse is one two many. These figures should be a source of shame and soul searching for us as a nation, and most importantly we must look seriously at what we are doing about it. As a nation we have to do better to protect our children. Fiji has rectified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1993, and more recently, is committed to National Action Plan to prevent violence against all women and girls. Fiji, in 2001, has been committed to the Stockholm Declaration - an agenda for action against commercial sexual exploitation of children. The Coalition Government takes the matter of protection of our children as a high priority, and our Ministry has developed a separate Unit for Children. Director and Child Protection Officers have been appointed. There are two Bills before Parliament - Child Protection Bill 2024 and Child Justice Bill 2024, which will enable better care of children that come into State care or are in conflict with law. However, these children should not have to come through a legal system, Mr. Speaker. We are a nation that prides itself in communal ties and love for our children. All our different traditions speak of high regard for children. Then why, Mr. Speaker, are children suffering from abuse and trauma? We find children on the streets suffering neglect, children involved in drug trade, children as victims and children as perpetrators of crime. When we trace the children found on the streets, they are from single or broken families. Single parentage is not a new phenomenon, but in the past, we saw stronger ownership from community and extended families. Mr. Speaker, our society is changing rapidly, in some ways for the good and in other ways not so good. Many of the assumptions we make about family life are no longer whole, there are many single parent families passes or sometimes separated for work or other reasons, including working overseas. Children are being sent to relatives in urban centres for education or back to rural areas for economic reasons. Sometimes to situations where unknown to them, there are sexual predators. Mr. Speaker, we cannot generalise the choices some parents make or may be forced to make under the circumstances. There are many reasons for these choices and many parents may not realise the dangers which they are exposing their children to. It is the responsibility for all of us, to ensure children are protected from these dangers. There are many studies that indicate that many abused children will go on to become abusers themselves. In a recent case, a 13 year old accused was a victim of rape at 6 years old by her own</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1660 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 grandfather, who is still doing jail time. It is reported that five out of six children in our community go through abuse. This case teaches us a lesson. These children who are abused, if not rehabilitated and supported, could become abusers and we already see high levels of abuse in our community. While perpetrators get a second chance at life, a child that is abused loses his or her innocence and is traumatised for life. It is most challenging to counsel and rehabilitate infants, who go through these traumatic experiences at the hands of those who should have been their protectors. Sadly, we find that society, family and community members of the victims often blame them for the offence and ostracize them within their own homes, instead of offering them kindness, empathy and an environment of love and healing. Each child abuse is traumatised for life. We are dutybound to make every effort to look into the issues surrounding the matter and to develop protection mechanisms. Mr. Speaker, we have to look deep within our communities for help. This is matter I have been working on with some stakeholders to see how we can create more awareness and build protection programmes, and I am calling for all interested people, community organisations and agencies to assist and look for comprehensive community-based solutions, which will help protect our children and bring down the incidences of child sexual abuse. There is a great movement on creating awareness on the issue of drugs through Churches, through the Vanua and through the faith creations. I call on all stakeholders and all religious state bodies to also add to the agenda the issue of child sexual abuse and create a network of protection. When we see suspicious circumstances surrounding children, it is each of our responsibility to take responsibility and report the matter to the Police. We also have a 24 hour toll free helpline number dedicated to the welfare of children. Anyone can call and speak with professional counsellors who are ready to listen to challenges faced by our children and refer for help and support. This number is 1325, Mr. Speaker. Children are precious gifts entrusted in our care. We owe it to the future to ensure our children receive the best care and protection. I strongly believe that if we all commit, we can achieve it. If I may quote Wesley Kenneth or West Stafford as he is known, the former President and CEO of Compassion International and an advocate for children, I quote: “If we nurture the dreams of children, the world will be blessed. If we destroy them the world is doomed”. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HON. L. D.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members of Parliament, happy World Indigenous Day today, 9 th August 2024 - a day to promote indigenous people’s rights and celebrate indigenous communities. I stand in solidarity with the people of West Papua and the Kanaks of New Caledonia.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024 End of Week Statements 1661 Mr. Speaker, and honourable Members of Parliament, we have heard from the honourable Assistant Minister regarding the prevalence of the abuse of children in our nation, and what it means for the future of this country. Yet, we still keep going and doing the same thing day after day, or we can draw a line in the sand now. We can do that by recognising that protecting children is everyone’s business. As you have heard the statistics, five out of six children in Fiji are abused or neglected by their family. Surely, every honourable Member of this Parliament cannot accept this statistic. Every one of these children carries a story of lasting hurt and trauma that will impact their adult lives. If we do not act urgently, we risk a deeply traumatised generation where cycles of abuse will continue on to their children and their children’s children. In May this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this very Parliament, as mentioned by the honourable Assistant Minister, we introduced two landmark Bills - the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024and the Child Justice Bill 2024. Laws to protect children are indispensable to changing the landscape, but laws alone will not protect children. Every Ministry and every member of our community needs to commit to this journey. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot just stand by and tolerate this, because the standard we walk past is the standard we accept. But it will take all Ministries working together, not just the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. It will take both sides of the House working together, taking leadership in your role in keeping our children safe. I am relieved that finally after 18 months, the Opposition has appointed their Shadow Ministers for the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. I acknowledge the honourable Virendra Lal from the C-16 and honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu from the C-9 plus two or three. I look forward to working with you both honourable Members to advance the welfare of our children in our beloved Fiji. We are going to need the help of our traditional structures, the strength of our diverse cultures, and of the many strong faiths across our country, to help us drive this change. This is why it is with great honour, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to announce to you today that the Government through the Ministry, plans to embark upon a National Action Plan to eliminate violence against children. The world’s largest study on Childhood Adversity shows that adults who experience abuse, neglect and traumatised children are far more likely to suffer long term intellectual, behavioural, physical and mental health problems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this plan is not just the Government owned action plan. We need every community and every citizen to feel that it is also part of them too. The pillars of the Action Plan will be strengthened by our cultures, by our identity, but its substance also needs to embody children’s rights, their development and their wellbeing. We want to give all of Fiji’s children the best future they can possibly imagine. The plan will be grounded in all the elements that science, our culture, communities, faith, tell us will support families and communities in raising children to protect them from harm. Mr. Speaker, our National Action Plan should hold the ambition that every dimension of Fiji’s Government, traditional structures and community mechanisms, faith-based organisations, civil society organisations must see to protecting children from harm as their responsibility. Why should every part of our society want to embrace this Plan? If we support our families in our communities, stop abusing and neglecting children, I believe we will see a safer Fiji. It cannot</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1662 End of Week Statement 9 th August, 2024 just be the role of the Government, of the Minister, of the Fiji Police Force, of the DPP, of Civil Society Organisations - it will be a call to return the responsibility back on our families and our communities. This Plan together with the two new Bills that are being proposed will put us on the cusp of generational change. Children who grow are protected, nurtured, supported and loved will become adults who create a stronger and even more successful Fiji. So, as I mentioned, this would need to be a whole of Government, whole of society and whole of community approach. I look forward to the convening next month of our National Taskforce on Pornography between the Ministry of Communications and our Ministry as co-chairs, to look at the harmful effects of pornography and to ban the access of pornography to children as well as regulating the access of pornography in our country. There is anecdotal evidence of the will be connection between pornography and violence against children and women. Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for Communications for the commitment to that. We have to make sure that every system and workforce that deal with children everyday a held to account and I am not just talking about our schools, but when we are talking about our sports fields, communities, faith-based organisations and even families. Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of perpetrators against children are family members. So, the homes are not safe. What are we going to do about it as a nation? This is a call to action. The National Action Plan will need to be able to look at this and how we can support families to keep our children safer. Mr. Speaker, our Child Justice Bill takes us so much closer to dealing with our children in conflict with the law. Looking at a diversion programme to divert our children away from the criminal justice system and to be put safely where they will be nurtured and re-integrated back into their families and communities because putting them in the criminal justice system is not working. The rates of recidivism and reoffending is much higher. Mr. Speaker, for a diverse unified Fiji to prosper, we cannot traumatise this generation. I call on all Members to unite together in this purpose and vision to be able to help our children to be safe and to look at their welfare and wellbeing for a better future for Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I am just wondering what has happened to the cybercrime that we are signatory to? Is that something that we have tapped into? And hearing all these crimes from both you and your honourable Assistant Minister, it kind of bothers me whether we have been taking effect of our signatory to that Budapest Convention or not. I would rather we hear from you on what has happened to the reports that you have lodged, because we are signatory to the Budapest Convention.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, three pillars of the vanua are very closely laced together - the iTaukei, our natural resources and our culture. Drugs have easily penetrated the vanua because of the cracks in our societal structure which have allowed this to spread unchecked. The present Government recognised this very early when we came into office particularly the damage it had caused, not only in the urban environment but also within our iTaukei communities. This problem is further enhanced by the decline in traditional vanua governance seen in the past few years. People have accused the vanua of neglect assuming it has not done or taken any action to address the drug problem. Drugs in the vanua is a massive problem and requires a comprehensive approach and we will use the tools at our disposal to confront the problems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done, we have taken a proactive approach with the Veitarogi Vanua visiting villages to fill vacant traditional titles. Previously, they only entered the village when there was a title dispute. This approach was entirely new to villages and was met with great enthusiasm and gratitude. We need to demonstrate that we are committed to filling the vacant traditional titles as it is a crucial step in addressing the drug problem in Fiji, but we will not rest there. Our training team will follow shortly. Traditional leaders must be capacitated. Mr. Speaker, that is hands on actively for us. At the policy level, the localisation process is currently underway for the United Nations Declarations on the Right of Indigenous People. The consultations are almost completed, and we will soon take it to Cabinet with the village guidelines. Laws and legislations will be reviewed particularly those dealing with natural resources. There is no other way to alleviate poverty for the iTaukei. A dynamic rural economy that utilises natural resources from the land to sea will provide another option for our villagers. “Say No to Drugs” is not just about traditional leadership, it is also about commercialising our natural resources to fight poverty. The Government is already taking concrete steps towards achieving it. The review of the iTaukei institutions is currently underway with two primary objectives being the economic empowerment and the strengthening of traditional governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, culture can play a significant role in the fight against drugs by providing a strong sense of identity and community. Last year, I attended the Melanesian Arts Festival and this year the Festival of Pacific Arts. It was an eye opener. Those who underestimate the significance of culture to confront the serious issues like drugs, often overlook the powerful influence it has on community resilience and individual behaviour. While inspired by the two festivals, Fiji is already on the course to further integrate cultural heritage into the National Development Strategy. Community empowerment and iTaukei villages would be impacted the most. This year, for the first time, we have been resourced with Cultural Officers for the Provinces, as has been addressed by the honourable Assistant Minister. It is part of the implementation of the National Cultural Policy.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>1665 Mr. Speaker, Sir, filling the vacant traditional title is just the beginning, not an end. Our strategy must include all pillars of the Vanua for long term success. Ignorance has long undermined the Vanua, which now seeks proper recognition. From the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports yesterday, we have witnessed the successful of the support of the Vanua to the Government, and we will continue to seek the Vanua ’s support to the Government and also to religious organisations. We will also see that the Vanua takes education seriously, as that will be the way forward for our community. Strengthening the three pillars of the Vanua is essential, otherwise, our efforts will merely be seen as well-intended but insufficient. Vinaka vakalevu, Turaga Sipika. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu, honourable Minister.</p></body>
