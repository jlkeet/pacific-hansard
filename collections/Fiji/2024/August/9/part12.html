<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Assistance to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Question No. 149/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament on the types of assistance the Ministry can provide to the public to assist in the prevention of cruelty to animals? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1626</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, animal ownership comes with responsibility, practised with the five principles of animal freedom. This was developed in 1965 by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and widely recognised. The five Freedoms described society’s expectations for the conditions animals should experience when under human control, namely: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Freedom from hunger, malnutrition and thirst; Freedom from fear and distress; Freedom from heat stress or physical discomfort; Freedom from pain, injury and disease; and Freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is rather unfortunate to observe that as a result of owner’s negligence, animals are vulnerable to mistreatment by the public and often results in animal straying on to plantations, causing damages to crops, as well as getting involved in vehicle accidents on the highway. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Protection of Animals Act 1954 requires a comprehensive review due to its outdated provisions. For example, the minimum fine for offenders is set at $10. Additionally, it is important to note that Fiji currently lacks an Animal Welfare Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry advocates responsible animal ownership by raising awareness, ensuring animal identification through licensing, or branding and ear tagging, as well as installing fencing and providing sufficient feed, water and nutrition. To ensure the safety of the public, a programme to capture stray animals is currently underway by the Ministry to manage stray animals, primarily, addressing those that pose a threat to agricultural land, roadways and human safety. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry works closely and supports the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) with financial grants to handle cases that are reported to them and are mostly targeted at pets. These are for the treatment of sick and injured dogs and cats, as well to desex them, to control the population of strays. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, I would like to thank honourable Naupoto for raising this question. We have SPCA, we have the Greater Good Animal Sanctuary, and we have another one in Nadi as well, the Animal Fiji, and they have gone around and done a lot of spay and neuter programmes. I have seen the budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the stray animal campaign has an increase allocation from $430,000 to $530,000. Could the honourable Minister inform Parliament, and I am sure a lot of people are listening too, but I agree with the honourable Minister that the cruelty begins from those pet owners when the pets are babies, they give the babies out, I mean, the babies are thrown in the rubbish dump, which has been some of the cases. The cruelty begins from there and it comes down to authorities and authorities get blamed for this. So, with that new allocation, can the honourable Minister highlight in Parliament on some of the initiatives or partnerships with these organisations in going forward to prevent cruelty to animals, especially stray animals? MR. SPEAKER.- This has been a very long and outstanding issue because most of the farmers out there in the rural areas, they have now gone to the extent of buying fences to fence off their vegetable gardens, et cetera, from stray animals.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1627 Most of those stray animals started off as pets but slowly, they become a nuisance to the people, especially in the rural areas. That is why the Government has set aside funds for them to shoot down all these animals. Either, they are taken to an animal pound, I hope you understand a pound because you come from the rural area. They put them there until the owner goes there and claims the animals and they have to pay a certain kind of fee to get their animals out. So, I have allowed your supplementary question to go, but let us hear from the honourable Minister for Agriculture. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of stray animals, like you have said, has been a longstanding one. Sometimes, I personally feel sorry for the farmers, especially livestock farmers, because when there is a dog attack, they lose hundreds of animals - goats, sheep or cattle. So, for a livestock farmer, that has been a lifetime achievement to get those numbers up to that level and for a few stray dogs to just to come in, attack the flock and then kill those many numbers, it is quite disheartening, to say the least. The question here is, which one is more important, to protect the stray dog or protect the livestock farmers who contribute to the livelihood of this country? The gist of the whole matter is that, when you own an animal, learn to be a responsible owner. That is the gist of the matter. What I have stated in my earlier answer, feed your animal, look after them because they are just like you. We are all part of the animal kingdom, anyway. When you do not look after them, they will go somewhere else, they will start hunting for their own food, after all, that is what they were made out to be, especially dogs. So, do not get me wrong, dogs are very, very smart animals. We have placed cages and we have observed how dogs react to cages. One will walk and lift up the back, the other one will go, bite the bait, get it out and then the big one comes up. They are very smart. And when they go in packs, that is the most dangerous one because they will go into a livestock farm, they will find a real nice place to observe the movement of the animals and the owners of the animals, then when everything is set, they will attack. This is what we, in the Ministry of Agriculture, especially livestock officers go through. So I take my hats off to them for operating within very challenging circumstances. Then there are the Acts. Most of them are archaic, and the Pound Act is one of them. We are working on the review of the Pounds Act and like many other Acts that contribute to the control of stray animals, we need to review them as fast as possible so that, at least, it can cover our backs when it comes to the stray animals’ issue. Then you have the pet lovers, animals’ rights, and I know they love their animals but at the end of the day, when stray animals start attacking livestock, that is when we do not see eye to eye. MR. SPEAKER.- I still want to elaborate more because this is honourable Naupoto’s passion - stray animals in the urban areas. However, out in the rural, it is a different thing. They are trying to encourage sheep farming, especially in Taveuni, but the problem is stray dogs. Dogs are smart animals, and they operate, just like they had been taught, and that is through their dire need of food. They kill the sheep, drink the blood and leave the carcass out there. So it becomes a very horrific kind of way to finding food because they only drink the blood and leave the carcass out there. Also, in the beef farming in Yaqara, the dogs are smart. They know how to lead the animals down a steep cliff for them to fall and they pick the animal down from the bottom of the cliff. I think this is the umpteenth time that you have raised this in the House, honourable Naupoto, but I</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1628</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 just ask you to liaise with the relevant bodies out there - SPCA, just to ensure that that particular animal that you want to be looked after is taken care of. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just ask a very quick supplementary and a plea; he mentioned that Fiji lacks an Animal Welfare Act, and if there is no plan to bring in that Act right now, I plead with the Government if you can work on an Animal Welfare Act and bring it to this House. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, so let us leave it at that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, just one question. Given the responses by the honourable Minister for Agriculture, I am wondering, is it then the Government’s position if we have stray animals, we should just eradicate them? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- May be, if you become Minister for Agriculture someday, but not under my watch. We will have to consider the animal welfare societies. Even one time when I was interviewed, then out of frustration I said, “Shoot”, but that was after receiving complaints after complaints. But really, we have to consider the animal welfare societies. MOU Between Fiji and International Peace Institute (Question No. 150/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Fiji and the International Peace Institute? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- I thank the honourable Vakalalabure for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet, on 15th July of this year, approved the execution of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Government of Fiji, through the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, and International Peace Institute (IPI). The MOU focuses on building Government capacity and strengthening its institutional arrangements, to ensure that we have the capacity to effectively engage in international climate change negotiations through trainings and workshops facilitated by the International Peace Institute in preparation for the 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) in Baku, Azerbaijan. As the honourable Leader of the Opposition had implored us to do this week and to be prepared well for the COP29, I hope he is preparing well, because he will again be part of the delegation or he may delegate someone to go on his behalf. The MOU is intended to focus on several areas of cooperation and capacity building through stakeholder meetings and negotiations training, including climate actions, climate change advocacy and communications, negotiations related to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), organisation support and participation in mission aligns climate action meetings and events, development of select communication documents and activities, provision of advice on ways to strengthen the response of the multilateral system to the climate emergency and institutional strengthening support and capacity building.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1629 Some may ask, why IPI? Mr. Speaker, Sir, IPI has a track record in supporting Small Islands Developing States directly in negotiations and enable further potential to lead key elements of the process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPI and its academic partner - University of Pennsylvania, were involved supporting the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in our efforts to establish a new fund, and funding arrangements for Loss and Damage. One of our Ambassadors stationed in Jakarta now is instrumental in the formulation also for the promotion of the Loss and Damage funds. It is a non-profit think tank closely associated with the United Nations and focus on addressing most pressing issues affecting international peace and security, advising both, member States and UN Secretariat of policy issues, and in a non-partisan way. Sir, through the IPI, we were able to leverage our leadership and representation in climate international forums, for instance, Fiji was appointed Co-Chair of G-77 and China Group for Global Goal on Adaptation, negotiate and track at COP 27, Fiji is also the AOSIS representative on the Board of the Fund for responding to loss and damages. The relevance of the MOU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the continued increase in migration and skills shortages, the onus should always be on Government to continue training and upskilling our workforce. It is imperative for the Government to explore and consider such partnerships and opportunities to continuously strengthen institutional knowledge and capacity of our civil servants. This partnership with IPI will offer additional support in enhancing the knowledge, skills and capacities of our civil servants, who will represent Fiji as negotiators to extend their engagements, as the complexity of climate change negotiations continue to grow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a regional and global leader in addressing climate change, there is a need for a strengthened delegation that can meaningfully participate and engage in the negotiations process as well as promote national initiatives and the unified Pacific position. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOU will be signed on behalf of the Fiji Government by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change next month, September 2024. The MOU between Government and IPI is mutually beneficial to both parties. Following the signing, the IPI will commence its work as per the MOU in assisting the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. The main focus after the signing in September will be to prepare our technical negotiators through inter-agency collaboration in the lead up to COP29. Mr. Speaker, Sir, up to three fully funded IPI representatives will be able to join Fiji COPs delegation to provide flexible support to Fiji’s climate change negotiators under guidance from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs a strong delegation to continue building momentum as the regional and international leader in our effort to manage the inequality and the multitude of threats posed by climate change, not only to Fiji but to the Small Island States in the Pacific. Through this MOU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government stands to benefit from an arrangement and relationships that has been beneficial to many governments before us, and we aim to use that collaboration to further advance a strong and unified Pacific voice and position at the COP29. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a supplementary question to the honourable Prime Minister. Thank you indeed, honourable Prime Minister for the MOU with International Peace Institute. I understand that the IPI has been in existence since 1970. Unfortunately, they are still in</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1630</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 New York rather than moving out into the region and that will be my question, Sir. If there are considerations for asking IPI the possibility of perhaps moving into the region either Caribbean or even here in the Pacific because of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) issues in as far as climate change is concerned. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for that question. As one who was there from the beginning of the discussions and negotiations, I believe he will be in a very good position come next COP to be Head Negotiator in the move in trying to convince them of the need to shift their headquarters from where they are into one of the areas covered by AOSIS. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his response to that particular question and highlighting the work of the International Peace Institute and the training of the people that negotiate at these treaties because what they negotiate, that ultimately will have an impact on us. Mr. Speaker, I am just looking at the website for the IPI, I also noticed that they do a lot events and research. I am just wondering also, is that part of the understanding to try to get events organised by them and research that relate particularly to our climate challenges here to be conducted by Fiji. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only assume that they are part of the formulation of those events that take part around the COP Conference. This year, it is going to be a lot on funding so the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance will be heading the Fiji delegation with the support of the honourable Leader of the Opposition and those that we feel will be able to actively participate in those negotiations. Plans to Regularise Turmeric Prices (Question No. 151/2024) HON. A. N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on plans to regularise the turmeric prices so that it can be a viable commodity for the local communities? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will probably use it as an opportunity to shed the House some light on where Government decided in terms of potential in the agricultural sector. Firstly, Sir, the turmeric is emerging as a significant export for the country, according to the Bureau of Statistics provisional data. Fiji exports to United States of America, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Singapore and Tuvalu. In 2023, was around $24.8 million with an export value in terms of volume of 3, 216 tonnes. In 2022, it was $21.6 million with about 2,500 tonnes. Before COVID-19, this export was somewhat quiet and I believe during COVID-19, the turmeric emerged as somewhat of a lifesaver for the agricultural sector and was being exported to the US in quite significant volumes. The Ministry of Trade has a bit a theory in terms of agriculture, if we can identify 10 exports that generate about $100 million in terms of export a year, that is a billion dollars in terms of opportunity. Turmeric is certainly one of those products that has that opportunity. To the question that was</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1631 raised by the honourable Tuicolo, it is a good question, Mr. Speaker, and talks to a great question about how we support a non-sugar industry. Right now, the challenge with the farmers is that the price fluctuates. In terms of trying to maintain a living, ensuring that you get the right level of income from your effort, that has been a challenge with turmeric and some other product as well, Sir. In terms of budgetary allocations, I know there are some allocations with the Ministry of Agriculture for turmeric, Sir, but nothing to regularise pricing. I am sure the honourable Minister for Finance will agree, going forward, it is perhaps something that the Government will need to consider, if we are to expand other sectors in the economy. Sugar does get assistance in terms of pricing, and it is only fair that the other products particularly products with good potential get some level of support as well, Sir. Certainly, in terms of the Ministry of Trade, Sir, it is definitely on the radar as one of the top ten products that we are trying to sort of push. Of course, at the moment turmeric is grown wild and so there is a marketing around organic turmeric which is quite attractive, but there needs to be consideration around developing farms as well going forwards, Sir, so that we try and reach a greater target, say we go for $50 million and then go beyond that it terms of export potential. HON. F. S KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Minister the turmeric industry as you rightfully pointed out is actually quite a substantial industry around the world, I think it is about AU$75 a kilogramme with respect to organic turmeric. My question is, if you are going to undertake this price issue that is being spoken about, will it be a comprehensive study done because there is a difference between the organic turmeric and also just the normal turmeric, and the export market into the US and Australia is actually quite huge. With respect to organic status, we do have a Fijian organic labelling. The certification currently, I think, only sits with Podcom. Will we be undertaking the proper certification through our own Ministry of Agriculture, I am wondering how far that has gone? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Koya raises a good point in terms of study. There is now a commercial agriculture/aquaculture taskforce in the Ministry of Trade and what we have been doing is actually, once we identify a product that is of interest, we try and move ahead with some sort of study particularly depending on the products and turmeric is certainly one of them. Right now, we are involved in a study for pineapple, we have just kick started one on kava as well through the assistance of Market Development Facility (MDF). What we are finding is they becoming quite a very good repository of assistance in terms of trying to align our commercial ambitions with some good strategy. It is on the card but we will circle back once the findings are known. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you have mentioned organic, efforts were made in the previous years on the development of the Fiji organic standard. I do not know how far that has progressed. For now, without the Fiji organic standard, the price is better, but we are not hitting the premium price. One of the priorities is the completion of the Fiji organic standard so that after that, then we can graduate it into other standards that are recognised in the world market. So, how far have we progressed with the Fiji organic standard, honourable Deputy Prime Minister? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, I cannot remember the name of the organisation but we are using an organisation for the Fiji organic for the branding. There is a Singaporean company in Fiji at the moment, they are experts in organic certification. We have had some initial discussions, and we will see where that progress is, but yes, the certification of organic is quite important. As you correctly point out, it does attract the premium pricing.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1632</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question, as alluded to by the honourable Minister that turmeric in Navosa grows wild. Most of these areas are only accessed by horse and foot and women and girls are the ones who are mostly engaged in the harvesting. When exporters come to buy, they only pick what they want, and the rejected ones are thrown away. Can the Ministry assist our farmers in finding other markets that will address this issue faced by the farmers? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I will use the words of honourable Usamate, “absolutely, Sir”. N</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Not hogwash:</span></p><p>(Laughter) We will connect up, honourable Tuicolo, actually you have raised quite a few good points there and I can tell you that the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Agriculture have been actually quite active in creating rural roads and moving very fast. You would have heard the update by the honourable Minister for Rural Development on the significant number of roads that they have started doing over the last few months. I am sure we will try and connect up and assist. We are happy to have a look as well in terms of the access turmeric, I am sure there might be even a local market for it. National Taskforce on Food Safety (Question No. 152/2024) HON. K. V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the progress and activities of the National Taskforce on Food Safety? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess I normally get this by the other side of Parliament on the number of taskforces that Ministry of Trade has created. Let me assure Parliament that these are not idle taskforces, they are actually a reaction to issues that we find on the ground. For certain taskforces, such as the National Taskforce on Food Safety, my brief to them is, it is a limited timeline taskforce. Our job is to flush out the issues that we are currently facing in Fiji and hopefully look at the legislations, make changes and move on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just allow me to elucidate a little bit on the progress and activities. Last year in October, we created the National Food Safety Taskforce which was really a reaction to a lot of reports that we were seeing on the ground and challenges faced by consumers. This is regarding modification of labelling, sale of near expiry items, importation challenges, food handling issues, distribution and storage challenges as well. This taskforce, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a very comprehensive taskforce. It involves all the key stakeholder agencies: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, Ministry of Local Government, Consumer Council of Fiji, Fiji Revenue Customs Service (FRCS) and Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) working together to try and flush out this issue.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1633 We have finalised a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the agencies just to be very clear in terms of what we are trying to do, looking at the current legislation and promoting a lot more consumer engagement and collaborating with each other to ensure that food safety is paramount. Some of you might recall, quite recently there was a lot of inaccurate and deceptive labelling on some food products. So, the consumer watchdogs, which is FCCC and Consumer Council of Fiji have been actively talking to these misbehaving wholesalers and they are being dealt with. We have also received a lot of complaints on imported tuna. The Pacific Fishing Company (PAFCO) came and met us and were quite concerned with the level of imported tuna. Some of the tuna entering the country, you can almost argue that it is not fit for human consumption. We are trying to target that as well through this taskforce and try and remove them off the shelves. There is an elevated inspection process that has been going on for a couple of months now. The Consumer Council of Fiji, FCCC, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Government have been working together to start the monitoring of labelling, expiry, quality of food, and as a result, some shops have been reprimanded. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently as well, we have started trying to engage with the private sector directly. Just to sort of express the Government’s concern perhaps, in terms of the food safety and beyond that. We are seriously looking at how we can strengthen laws to ensure that food safety which is paramount for our people is protected. HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his elaboration. I thought we were going to refer to him as the Minister for Taskforces, but as I was listening, I was thinking about the issues of food safety that have been something that has been around for a long time. I was thinking, a lot of the issues that you are raising - food labelling, the quality of food, the handling of food which has been covered by programmes, like Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), et cetera, there are already existing legislations that cover this. So, is a matter of lack of execution of those, or is it lacunas in the law themselves that are allowing these things to filter through? What is the findings of the taskforce in these areas? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, as I have said, what we try to do immediately is escalate the level of scrutiny around the country which has happened just to make people aware that they cannot bring in substandard food into our country. The laws are still a bit weak, for example, I am told when Customs sees expired items that come into the country, they do not have any guidelines at the moment to stop them at the border. That is just a simple example of what we are dealing with. So, we intend to tighten up these laws and hopefully, in the next couple of months, I can bring forward possibly some regulatory changes or even legislative changes, to try and tighten up that whole area. The bulk of the food safety monitoring sits with the Ministry of Health and I would just like to thank the Ministry for Health and Medical Services for collaborating with the other agencies because we do have inspectors in the Ministry of Trade, the FCCC, Consumer Council of Fiji and also Ministry of Local Government. Right now, we are trying to work together because obviously, if you hunt in a group, there is a lot more of it, so we are finding that quite effective and we will continue to do that. I intend to have a meeting with some of the very big retail wholesale companies in Fiji soon, just to, sort of, continue the pressure of what we see in an endeavour to make sure that food safety concerns in the country are allayed.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1634</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- My question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, for agricultural products, two of the key issues are in as far as food safety is concerned is on the use of harmful chemicals and antibiotics with livestock. How does the taskforce look at addressing these issues? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for raising that, perhaps, it is something that I can talk to the Ministry of Agriculture about it. At the moment, our concern is more about the imported products into Fiji, but I do take your point on the concerns around getting substandard products from within Fiji as well. Certainly, there is a significant issue around imported food items and the reason why we raise this question is just to ensure the House and also the people of Fiji that this Government is actually very serious in trying to do something about it. I think some of the retailers and large companies have been getting away with it, and that is going to stop. MR. SPEAKER.- I remember quite well when we were in the Opposition, honourable Qereqeretabua brought up a case of tinned tuna that penetrated the market here in Fiji. It had quite a terrible smell that she produced that can of tuna in the House. Those are the examples of how there are existing gaps in the way we conduct ourselves by ensuring that nothing of this sort infiltrates our market, but there again that is a glaring example. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister; what level of engagement do we have with the FAO, a UN agency, with respect to ensuring that we get this right in terms of our Food Safety Regulations, et cetera? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are not on the Taskforce, if that is the question, but certainly once we crystalise some of the issues that we are trying to deal with, we will certainly reach out to other agencies for help. But right now, I think we are managing well, there is a quite a bit of expertise on the ground and our priority is just to remove any inferior products from the shelves because our Fijians deserve better. Vinaka. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this Taskforce is operating to look into the safety of the food products that are imported in Fiji, there are also a concern by wholesalers and retailers that there are times when their product is already in Fiji, it is held back and not just for one or two days, the shipment is sometimes delayed to close to around 30 to 60 days and it goes into bond. When they have to pay for the bond fees and everything, the cost of the goods goes up. So, if the licence or approval can be given in the timely manner, the consumers will not be affected by the hike up in the price that is actually caused by the delay in the process. So, if they can also look at the process that is being followed to give the approvals to the wholesalers and importers in a timely manner would be very much appreciated, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- is that supplementary question is part of the initial one? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is bordering, Sir, on a new question but what I will say is that, I will take that on board as noted but in terms of complaints. What we are trying to do now is to attend to issues that are reported by the regulators, particularly FCCC and Consumer Council. That issue has not come up but we will take that on board and see what can be done. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning tea. We will resume when the bell is sounded. Parliament is adjourned. The Parliament adjourned at 11.02 a.m.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1635 The Parliament resumed at 11.36 a.m. Investigation on the Ferries Wheel Incident (Question No. 153/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations update Parliament on the progress of the investigations on the ferries wheel incident a year ago? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Chand for that question. Let me begin by saying that there has been a lot of public interest in this matter and there have been questions raised outside Parliament. Despite us giving several progress reports, people have still been questioning and I am happy that it has come up here so that I can clarify this once and for all, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry, through the National OHS Service, completed the conduct of the full investigations into the ferries wheel accident that occurred on 30 th June, 2023 at the Vodafone Arena during the showcase event. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the full Accident Investigation Report was compiled and submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 18 th December, 2023. The Ministry had identified and filed the alleged breaches that contributed to the accident, in line with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1996 and its associated regulations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport also conducted their investigation on the mechanical components or engineering examination of the ride. The Fiji Police Force has been carrying out its own investigation as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the occurrence of the accident, the Ministry has given media updates on both, the preliminary and full investigations on 1 st July, 2023; 8 th July, 2023; 9 th July, 2023; 18 th August, 2023; and 15 th June, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been advised by the Office of the Director of the Public Prosecutions that we cannot release the full report to the media or to the public because it is a trialable case. That is why we have submitted it to the ODPP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been following up with the ODPP on the progress and have also followed up with the Fiji Police. The ODPP, as of this morning, had advised that they are still waiting for the Police to complete their investigation and hand over their recommendations to the ODPP. The Police, I know, is still investigating because our staff had been interviewed just in the last few days. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has a stringent process of carrying out all inspections for all plants, equipment and machinery, including all amusement rides and structures. Prior to any amusement ride installation, the National OHS Service Inspectors go through the standard operating procedures on the design and layout of the rides at the proposed sites with the organisers of the amusement rides and the facility owners. This is to ensure that proper and adequate facilities, such as ground levelling, water, electricity supplies, traffic and public movements are in place.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1636</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 This also includes the review and evaluation of rides to be used, especially in its structures and operation mechanisms. All ride owners must ensure the validity of the Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) certifications conducted by the Ministry prior to any installations, to ensure the integrity of all the load-bearing metals and structures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National OHS Service conducts initial ground inspections using standardised checklist for the right individual components, such as the transmissions, drives, seats, bolts and nuts, locks, pins, springs, lock washers, wires, fasteners, rollers, et cetera, to name a few. The rides, after its assembly, are then inspected again to confirm the functionality of all the components whereby checks are conducted on the operations of seats, safety bars, belts, pins and lock speed, transmission assembly, control devices, breaks and clutches, electrical wiring and lighting, isolation barriers, entry and exit points and emergency procedures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amusement rides are put through operational test, including load test. In addition to the above, relevant awareness and trainings are also conducted for the amusement ride owners, workers and operators. I wish to assure that all the rides are thoroughly inspected and tested prior to any operations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has taken preventative measures to ensure that amusement ride owners, as part of their duty of care, protect their patrons from reasonably foreseeable risks created by their amusement rides when in operation. All rides are continued to be inspected to ensure that the rides are operating with all reasonable safety measures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry ensures that all rides have been constructed properly and are in good condition. Amusement ride owners are also obliged, under the law, to provide and maintain plants and systems of work that are safe and without risk to anyone’s health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in preventing similar accidents and strengthening OHS compliance, the Ministry continues to ensure that the health and safety policies and procedures are in place to protect the workers and their patrons at all times, and set clear guidelines for patrons, such as any restrictions while on the rides and rules against reckless behaviour or any other unwarranted situation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, my Ministry continuously provides the necessary health and safety awareness and training to all the amusement ride owners and their operators, as alluded to earlier. Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately non-workers and in this case, the victims of the accident can only seek redress through civil action after the courts have convicted the persons responsible. This is in accordance with the current law. They are not covered by Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) because they are not workers. We have also tried with all the insurance companies to get them to get insurance against accidents but unfortunately none of the insurance companies are prepared to ensure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure this august House and the general public that the Ministry takes all possible actions to prevent mishaps of this nature within the provisions of the OHS laws. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the comprehensive Report. Family members of the victim and the public strongly criticise the manner in which this case has been handled. The family of the victim are still waiting for the justice and also for the report. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament whether the machine was inspected before it was allowed to be used and was a certificate to this effect issued? HON. A. D. SINGH.- That is the normal thing to be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1637 MR. SPEAKER.- It is still before the courts, Sir?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Yes, we leave it at that.</p><p>NDMO Partnership with Japan’s QZSS (Question No. 154/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the National Disaster Management Office partnership with Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System for early warning system? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to address this august House on the Memorandum of Cooperation that was signed on the margins of PALM 2024. It is effective for three years with the National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) of Japan, a Government institution responsible for planning, designing and coordinating space policy and the development, maintenance and operation of the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) with our Government to improve our early warning systems. The honourable Prime Minister had stated this in his Report on the PALM trip earlier in the week. In Fiji, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management through the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources through their Seismology Unit are the key Government agencies responsible for managing National Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Activities related to tsunami. Our mission is to ensure the safety and security of our nation against geological hazards. These three entities, the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and Mineral Resources Department (MRD) have agreed to initiate cooperation in the field of emergency warning systems using the advanced QZSS technology, and through close consultation and collaborative activities, this partnership aims to significantly enhance our ability to respond to emergencies and protect our communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the QZSS is renowned for its precision and reliability in providing real time data which is essential for effective disaster management. This partnership underscores our commitment to adopting innovative solutions to safeguard our nation against natural disasters. Mr. Speaker, the Early Warning System Service (EWSS) disseminates crucial disaster and crisis management information from disaster management organisations to help prevent disasters. This include data on earthquakes and tsunamis transmitted by the Japanese Government’s QZSS (Michibiki) which began operations in 2017. In 2018, the disaster and crisis report service was launched by QZSS to provide early warnings on hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis and floods and to address communication challenges following significant disasters. The National Space Policy Secretariat initiated discussions to establish a National Committee to explore QZSS applications for disaster risk reduction. This Committee includes experts in satellite technology, communication, DRR and disaster management and international affairs. Fiji was selected for feasibility studies to understand the Early Warning System and address technical challenges. The National Disaster Management Office is responsible for facilitating and managing disaster risk reduction activities, whereas the Mineral Resources Department serves as a National Tsunami Warning Authority. In 2019 after extensive discussions and site visits, Fiji and Japan agreed to formulate a Memorandum of Cooperation to</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1638</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 explore the use of QZSS in Fiji’s Early Warning Systems. The National Committee reviewed the feasibility study results and devised a strategy for implementing this technology, demonstrating its application in Fiji using data provided by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key activities of the National Committee are as follows - the NTT group will work in collaboration with NDMO and MRD to conduct demonstration campaigns, assessing the operational effectiveness of the EWSS in various emergencies scenarios. Responsibilities, the NTT group will conduct surveys, address technological standards and regulatory requirements, develop demonstration scenarios and prototype systems and cover costs related to labour, equipment, travel and accommodation for the Japanese team involve in demonstrations. They will also gather feedback from relevant organisations for further improvement. On complementary data source in Fiji, the MRD relies heavily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre for seismic information. Utilising the QZSS as a secondary data source will complement the PTWC data enhancing our ability to pinpoint wave arrival times and impact areas. Sir, MRD will provide technical advice to the NDMO allowing for simplified targeted public advisories or preparing for incoming tsunami hazards. The QZSS, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a satellite system that the Japanese Government uses and which we are privileged to be part of now. It only hovers over the Pacific, reaching only up to Japan and then coming back down to the Pacific, just South of Australia. That is the extent of where it goes, it does a figure eight movement around that area and that why it is very accurate in looking at wave patterns and all that kind of things, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The QZSS Early Warning System service, collaboration between the NDMO, MRD, National Space Policy Secretariat and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone group aims to enhance tsunami information, dissemination in Fiji through coordinated demonstrations. These demonstrations will use different hazard scenarios to illustrate the operation of QZSS in coordination with NDMO and MRD. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership is the testament of our commitment to leveraging advance technology and international cooperation to protect our citizens and enhance our disaster management capabilities. We all look forward to seeing the positive impacts of this collaboration and strengthen resilience of our two nations. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, to the honourable Minister. I have acknowledged the Japanese Government for the assistance of the QZSS, but honourable Minister prior to this, there has also been an arrangement with the Japanese Government about the siren system to extend from Suva to Lautoka and if I remember correctly, probably down to Rakiraki. How far has that progressed, Mr. Speaker, Sir? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the discussions regarding the extension of the early warning system, the sirens and the speaker system that we see up to Lami, discussions are continuing at the moment but there are some misgivings about the use of sirens at the moment in the national disaster management space. We have been having some bad experiences in some areas in Hawaii, when they had the fires. What they found was when they sounded the sirens, instead of them fleeing, they actually went towards the places they were not supposed to go. So, there are some explorations in how that can be mitigated in the future. In the area of disaster management, this is a topical issue at the moment, and we are seeing how other technologies can be used, maybe the use of mobile phones with personal messages being sent to each one of us to warn us of that. I think in New Zealand, that is what they are preferring to do. We are in a flux at the moment, we are looking at how we are going to be progressing, but at the moment the Japanese Government has continued to progress the siren, the early warning system that they had committed to and it will</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1639 be going right up to Ra. I think that was stage 2 of the project. The discussions are continuing. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I thank the honourable Minister for his comprehensive answer, but I believe he has missed one thing, a national phenomenon such as earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruptions. My question to the honourable Minister is, there will be many challenges but the two challenges which we were discussing when we were in the Ministry was environmental and geographical challenges. Can the honourable Minister explain how will NDMO address this, have they got any plans to address these two phenomena? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Can the honourable Member clarify that - what does he mean by environmental and geographical challenges? Can you just explain that further? HON. V. NATH.- There are about nine challenges, it is data information management, environment and geographical challenges, coordination and complication challenges, public awareness, et cetera. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Question?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> Geographical, Fiji is unique with its many islands and remote communities.</p><p>It will definitely not give accurate information…. HON. V. T. RAYALU.- Question? HON. V. NATH.- I already had asked the question, you wait, wawa. Because we have many islands, some of the remote areas will not be covered accurately. I am asking how will you cover that? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a good question but it is something that we are all working towards. It is going to be a fusion of all these technologies that we use. As I had mentioned, we can use mobile phones and if there are black spots that are being experienced, we can also use radio technology. I think in just a last few sessions, we have heard of radio technology VHF and HF radios being used as well. These are the kind of technologies that we will be exploring to see how we can reach into the geographical nature of Fiji and how all the islands are scattered around the Pacific and that is how we hope to deal with that. MR. SPEAKER.- It is quite difficult. It is an act of God, and it strikes us in seconds, whether you are waiting for the siren to be blown across to notify you that a tsunami is coming or what, it will be too late. Even coming down the steps of the three-storey building will be too late. So that is what they are doing. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Trigger system - good. You have asked for the whole 300 islands; it is quite a challenge.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have got traditional systems:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR.

Progress of the Dairy Production Facility Project (Question No. 155/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: With the Ministry having embarked on an initiative with investors from Israel to address large scale production technologies, can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the progress of the dairy production facility project in the Central Division? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish the honourable Sachida Nand a quick recovery. The dairy industry in Fiji is encountering challenges, like low milk production, poor quality feed, lack of modern technology resulting in low productivity and a shortage of fresh milk supply. Moreover, there is a demographic change with numerous youths showing little interest in pursuing careers in Agriculture, which includes dairy farming. In addition, the dairy sector has been hit hard by the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis diseases, drastically reducing the numbers of dairy cows in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the annual milk requirement in Fiji is around 77 million litres, whereas local farmers manage to produce approximately six million litres per year. The issue of low productivity is primarily due to the absence of modern technology and best practices. The continued use of hand milking and reliance on traditional methods also contribute to low milk yield per cow. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the challenges at hand, there are opportunities to improve the sector and cater for domestic needs and decrease reliance on imports. This can be achieved through the creation of Public-Private Partnerships through investments of large producers that will bring in cutting edge, environmentally friendly technologies and sustainable methods for dairy production. Fiji’s dairy sector has the potential to become a front runner in the Pacific region, boosting our exports to neighbouring islands and lessening the need for imports through this initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is really a large-scale production technology project proposal currently under discussion with the Ministry of Finance, including the Israeli Government. However, there needs to be consensus on the interest rates proposed before the commercial agreement can be signed. The proposal is to establish an intensive dairy production facility at Navuso Agricultural Technical Institute. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of the House, the selection of the Navuso Agriculture Technical Institute was done in collaboration with the Israelis early this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Dairy Co-Op Integration Project in Fiji aims to enhance the local dairy industry, through the creation of a sustainable 200 dairy cow farm, equipped with advance technology from Holland, Germany and Israel. The project includes a milking power, a 300-acre irrigated field for feed production and a modern milk processing plant. The farm will implement an intensive scheme using an Israeli automated model system for management, providing real time data on health, fertility, milk quality and productivity. The goal is to establish a self-sustainable enterprise that produces premium dairy products for the local and international markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, learning from past experiences with the Fiji Dairy Limited Company, we</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>9 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1641 are of the hope to make improvements to the setup of the Israeli Dairy Facility. The Ministry looks forward to your support and anticipates that this Dairy Facility will be established soon. HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for his reply. We are all familiar with the problems that we have with our dairy industry, its huge potential and the problems that had besotted it over the years. This issue was first brought up in the 2023-2024 Budget discussion and in June 2023, the honourable Minister had mentioned that it would be finalised in the next two weeks. We are now in July of this year, so can we have clarity from the honourable Minister as to when it is likely that this deal be signed so that we can progress? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- We are already into the commercial agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are just ironing out, like I have said, the interest rates to be employed under the commercial agreement. The Israelis will be here by the end of the month. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is fully aware, and he is very supportive of the project. So, we anticipate having it off the ground this year. MR. SPEAKER.- We are trying to do away with hand milking. Honourable Usamate, that is the idea, to bring in this Israeli development to help us because hand milking is not really taking out the full milk from the cow. That is why we are always short of milk all the time. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to the dairy industry, the dairy farmers in Fiji are struggling to get dairy animals for their farm and we cannot get animals from Australia and New Zealand due to various reasons. How is the honourable Minister planning to get dairy animals for this large-scale production? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member that question. We have a number of ways to get in animals and getting in live animals is what the honourable Member is talking about. With Australia and New Zealand, given the disease status, we have some diseases that we do not want to be brought into Fiji. You will remember that the four breed that we currently have, one of them is the dairy breed, the Brown Swiss, and we brought those four breeds in through embryo transfer, which is quite safe when it comes to transferring zoonotic disease. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will skip Oral Question No. 156/2024 since honourable Vocea has made a withdrawal on that question because that has been fully covered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications in his earlier statement. We will now jump right to the ninth Oral Question for today, I see you smiling, honourable Premila Kumar. HON. P. D. KUMAR- Sir, I am just exchanging smile with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. (Question No. 156/2004 withdrawn) Utilisation of $2 Million - Village Improvement Scheme (Question No. 157/2024) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1642</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>9 th August, 2024 Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the utilisation of the $2 million allocation for the Village Improvement Scheme in the 2023–2024 Budget? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government revived the Village Improvement Scheme (VIS) in the 2023- 2024 financial year. A sum of $2 million was provided in the Budget. The VIS has three components - Village Beautification, Sanitation and Community Hall. The VIS was advertised and applications were assessed through the Cabinet-approved criteria by a Committee. Under that criteria, our Ministry approved 30 out of the 283 applications that was submitted to us. The applications are required to provide one quarter of the cost, with the Government giving the other three quarter. The VIS 30 appproved projects, there was 14 village beautification projects approved for: (1) Nasesara in Moturiki; (2) Vuya in Bua; (3) Vivili in Savusavu; (4) Levuka-i-Yale, Kadavu; (5) Navuti in Moturiki; (6) Cawaru in Udu, Macuata; (7) Nacokaika in Naitasiri; (8) Namuaira, Viria in Naitasiri; (9) Waikalou, Soloira, Naitasiri; (10) Tailevu, Matailobau, Naitasiri; (11) Waisomo, Raviravi, Beqa; (12) Namaqumaqua, Serua; (13) Naviti, Saivou, Ra; (14) Kiuva, Bau, Tailevu.
