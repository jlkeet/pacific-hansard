<body><h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Back to Office Reports MR. SPEAKER.- Before we adjourn, honourable Members, for your information, the following are Back to Office Reports - Reports that, kind of, described the tours that we (Fiji Parliament) undertook to attend regional meetings. I usually lead the delegation and then there is one or two from the Opposition and Government side who travels with us. When a group makes a tour, it is proper that they compile a report when they come back and this report is highlighted in the House. There are two Back to Office Reports - the first one is on our Official Visit to the Parliament of Victoria and the second is on the Indonesia-Pacific Parliamentary Partnership (IPPP) Meeting which was held in Jakarta, Indonesia. That meeting was an interesting one whereby we encountered a kind of preparation that was completely different because we were hoping, through Fiji’s support and how we were able to kind of describe it, the inroads that they have made into West Papua, so there was a kind of a bilateral arrangement between the MSG comprising of Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands together with them, but the theme of the meeting was IPPP in the Pacific. So, we told the Madam Speaker, “This is good, but this is only to do with MSG. The rest of the Pacific that you want is there, down on the ground floor.” These are some of the things that we learn as we go to these kind of meetings because of the heavy investment they have undertaken in the resource rich country of West Papua. I told them that before coming to this meeting, we had a huge protest outside our Parliament. It was to do with West Papua and there are other countries from the Pacific, like New Caledonia - the Kanaks, who are seeking their independence and these have been long outstanding issues. That is why we have seen it fit to have these Reports be made available in the Library for reference. So, when you go there to do your research, these Reports will be available to you.</p></body>
