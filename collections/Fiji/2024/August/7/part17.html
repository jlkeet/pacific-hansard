<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –SUGAR RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF FIJI  2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – SUGAR RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF FIJI 2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji 2016-2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12 th July, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> I second the motion, Sir.</p><h4>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to present the overview of the Sugar</h4><p>Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. The Committee is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar Industry for submitting the responses to the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF). The Committee commends SRIF for its thorough research. However, it is imperative that technology transfer be used by farmers, as research could only be useful if farmers are able to use innovative knowledge to improve productivity. We hope that in the coming years, the Extension Officers from FSC can join SRIF to facilitate the knowledge and technology transfer to farmers.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>1537 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 While reviewing the SRIF Annual Reports, the Committee documented that SRIF has not been fully engaged with farmers in crop diversification, resulting in poor soil health and limited stream of income. While the sugar sector is not profitable, it could be due to lack of technical support and hand-holding our farmers. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sugar Research Institute of Fiji needs to engage in training our farmers to adopt integrated personnel management and integrated decision response to control and eradicate best decision which SRIF also needs to invest in social media for outreach programmes, and their contingency plan should there be any future pandemic to ensure business continuity. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion but I also received a list of speakers identified by the various Whips: (1) Honourable Leader of the Opposition; (2) Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic and Sugar Industry; (3) Honourable Ratu J. B. Niudamu; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first let me thank the Committee for the great work – the Chairman and Members of the Committee for the efforts that we have seen through the Reports that we have debating throughout the course of the week. Since this is the last of the Sugar Report, I asked our Caucus if I can take up one of the speaking slots so that maybe I can help the honourable Deputy Prime and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communication to understand things about the sugar industry better and of course perhaps also assure every Fijian that we all know and understand very well the importance of the industry. The role of government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are well aware, growth is so important to this. But let us not only look at FSC in isolation. The Government has done so much with other Government Commercial Companies. Energy Fiji Limited (EFL), the status in which EFL was in and how it has progressed over the years to where it is now; Fiji Rice, AMA, Food Processors Limited, Fiji Pine Limited, but when it comes to FSC, Sir, this is one thing, and I know the honourable Prime Minister cannot come up with a Cabinet Paper to shut FSC down tomorrow because Government has a social responsibility. We want FSC to be profitable, but when it comes to hard decisions of the approximately 250,000 individuals who directly or indirectly depend on the industry, because of the Government’s social responsibility, it will continue to support FSC. That is what previous governments have been doing all these years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That needs to be made clear to everyone. As I have stated, we want FSC to be profitable, but there are so many factors, Mr. Speaker, Sir and it has been discussed so many times in this House. Let us not forget the fact that the Government has a social responsibility and only Government can afford that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Though it may be operating at a loss, but we have, because it is important to keep the economy functioning. It is important because of the people who are dependent on the industry. Let us not discuss issues in isolation. Let us contextualise it so that it makes a lot of sense, particularly when we are dealing with policies and strategic directions in this Parliament. Yesterday we were told that we had been doing nothing in the last 16 years or so. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key things that Government did when it came in 2006 was the land and the iTaukei landowners have benefitted from CBUL. Land was heavily politicised. I will not go into</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>1538 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 the past issues, but every Government that comes in, the subject is that we see now, most of those were initiated under the term of the previous government. The mill upgrades, I know that there was an upgrade during the Labour Government but that did not work out well, so the incoming government has to take over the responsibility. These are past issues and problems that we can learn from, but we have to take the responsibility. Let me just focus on the report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have about five minutes left. I will just focus on some of the key roles of SRIF, not on the recommendations, as it was established in 2006. I want to focus on dissemination of technology and information needed for increased productivity, profitability and sustainability of the sugar industry. I have some recommendations to the honourable Minister. As highlighted by the honourable Usamate, one of the key problems that we have, particularly in the primary industry sector, is the transfer of technology from research to extension. We visited two universities in the Philippines a few years back. To honourable Tunabuna, this is the Philippine National University in Los Banos and Pampanga State Agricultural University. One of the key lessons that we have learnt from there is the Research Division also have their Extension Division. Honourable Minister, one of the problems in Fiji is Research does their research and then they convene the Extension workers and then they transfer the information under technology to them. How it is disseminated depends on the Extension officers. But Philippines came up with this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of this issue. Probably this is something that Fiji can learn from. Research must have its own extension so that there is no gap in between, and Research ensures that the transfer of technology is expedited and ensures that it reaches the target groups as well. That is something we can learn particularly from the role of SRIF. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to talk on the issue of soil and leaf analytical services, particularly in the role of SRIF. It states that SRIF is responsible for a few areas and I will just speak on a few areas. I will just start on soil and analytical services, crop diversification and effective land utilisation. On soil and leaf analytical services, again honourable Minister, there was a Mr. Bunda, he did a good article on sugar production in Fiji when he was in charge of Extension Services. I hope, honourable Minister, if you can get hold of that report because that is something we have been arguing for a long time. The soil condition in Fiji is one of the major contributing factors to the low production level, because of the pH level. Most of the land in Fiji has a problem with either acidity or alkalinity. Therefore, the intervention must be correct as well, whether we do aglime, which is calcium carbonate or we do gypsum which his calcium sulphate for alkalinity. This is a big issue because we keep chemical fertilisers year in, year out. One of the problems in sugar production in Fiji is the pH level. We fix the pH level, you will see a definite increase in sugar production, that is guaranteed. Mr. Speaker, Sir. The other one is on crop diversification. Sir, crop diversification has been there for a long time. When I came out of Ratu Kadavulevu School, I joined Native Land Development Corporation (NLDC) which is an extension arm of NLTB. Sir, Ratu Mara back in the Development Programme 8 (DP8) he had already predicted that we will one day lose the preferential arrangement and secondly the diversification in the sugar industry is on tropical fruits. I was part of that project, we did papaya and mangoes in Legalega. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Tikoduadua talked about macadamia nuts or duriano. That was the diversification programme but then over the years, nothing happened. Some strategic decisions should have taken place long time ago, but it did not happen. The diversification, let me repeat, was predicted and put in place by Ratu Mara way back in the DP8 (tropical fruits). Now I would insist, let us look at the potential in Vanua Levu. If can beef up the production in Vanua Levu, we can have other options on Viti Levu, particularly when it comes to diversification.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 1539 We can discuss this later, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but that is something that we need to seriously consider. That diversification as I have stated, it has been there for a long time but that political will and decision needs to take place and I am thankful. We look forward to the FAO Report and, of course, perhaps the convening of a Special Committee as well, not only to look at sugar, but the whole agriculture sector. May I just conclude, with effective land utilisation. Honourable Minister, back in 2014 a database has already been drawn for FSC. The current Director for NDMO, that was her project when she came out of University but I do not know what has happened to that database. We were there during the launching in 2014, excellent database but how do we translate that database into execution; that is a big problem. If we can dig into that, I have some information, I can help you honourable Minister, but of course definitely we need to take the industry forward and I thank the Committee for their work. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give my statement on SRIF, I would like to comment on honourable Premila Kumar’s comment about gender balance or gender equality in the industry. We have re-instated mill area committees now in all three Mills and a majority are ladies. They have also appointed the first lady iTaukei Director on FSC Board, so I am trying to go in that direction. I did enquire about the database, in fact it was sitting in the FSC and FSC workers were not trying to share that. This is the problem that these five organisations had; they were not talking to each other. When I came in and saw that the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing, that is why I am saying, why should we duplicate projects when we have already invested in those projects. Again, I am heading towards that direction as well. On crop diversification, in Thailand we realised that when the sugar price is low, they go and plant cassava. That was what I saw but currently sugarcane prices from last year is good so they went back to cane. But we cannot basically encourage them to go into cassava otherwise Labasa Mill will close in no time. On the soil conditions, yes, that problem we have come to know. We have to encourage farmers to add aglime but they are not willing to because it will cost them extra money. They are expecting the Government to give it free. Mr. Speaker, from last year, Professor Santiago Mahimairaja (CEO), he tried to promote that. So, when we went out to the farms to talk to the farmers, they said that they could not afford $25. So, we had to look at another set of subsidies; honourable Kamikamica, you are laughing. Another thing, honourable Kamikamica said yesterday about the balance sheets of FSC. I would like to inform Parliament today that for the first time FSC will present its 2024 balance sheet by September (the closing period is June). Just another information, FSC’s balance sheet was very weak and no bank was willing to touch it because of what had happened; FSC’s valuation of assets was 15 years old so we revalued FSC’s properties. It has jumped from $190 million to $600 million which will be reflected in the balance sheet and, of course, the Government has written off $200 million of that. So, come the next balance sheet, honourable Kamikamica you will be very happy to see. That does not mean that the balance sheet is right, we lose our interest on the farm itself. We have to work hard to make it possible. So, now with the balance sheet, I am pretty sure all the local banks will be willing to lend money to us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji 2016 to 2021 Annual Reports. As we delve into the details of these Reports,</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>1540 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 I would like to underscore the critical role SRIF has in our sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SRIF stand as a sole Sugar Research Institute in Fiji. Its contribution ranges from the development of 19 commercial sugarcane varieties towards advancement in crop improvement, pest and diseases management, soil health research mechanisation and sustainable farming practices. These initiatives are crucial for the increase in productivity ensuring the long term resilience of the sugarcane sector. The Ongoing Research Innovation provided by the SRIF have equipped our farmers with necessary tools and knowledge to navigate the challenges posed by the climate change, market fluctuations and other external factors. I would like to extend my appreciation to the recently appointed CEO, Dr. Vinesh Kumar whose proactive approach has been instrumental in disseminating critical information on the sugarcane varieties, pest and disease management and best farm practices to our farmers. Just two weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had the pleasure of immigrating the Wairuku Pest and Disease Station and Cane Breeding Section in Dobuilevu. These initiatives reflect Dr. Kumar’s commitment and the institute’s dedication to providing good services to our farmers. As elaborated in the Report, we recognise the necessity of establishing a formal Key Performance Indicator (KPI) with Research Institute of Fiji and are actively working towards this goal. This KPI is part of the broader initiative to create a comprehensive Fiji Sugar Industry Strategic Plan that involves all stakeholders. Our commitment is to implement smart KPIs and regular monitoring mechanisms to ensure accountability and effectiveness across all operations. Furthermore, we support a clear demarcation of roles between the Sugar Research Institute and Sugar Corporation. SRIF will focus on science, extension and advisory service while FSC will concentrate on milling and sugar marketing. This clear division is aimed to improve efficiency and streamlining operations. Additionally, we endorse the transfer of Field Officers from FSC to SRIF to enhance the Institute’s capacity to provide consistent research-based guidance to farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry is fully committed to implementing these recommendations and develop strategies for the industry’s betterment. We acknowledge the challenges but remain steadfast in our efforts to enhance the performance and sustainability of the sugar industry. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders, including the Opposition, so that we can achieve our shared goals. Based on those remarks, I support the motion. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I support the motion before the House, I wish to share in this august House my personal experience, in realising the existence of such institutions, like the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF). Recently, I was invited to the commissioning of an accommodation facility of SRIF Dobuilevu Cane Breeding Station in Ra, together with honourable Matasawalevu, where the honourable Minister commissioned this Station. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this station is the birthplace of all 19 cane varieties that were released in Fiji. Currently, the Station has a germplasm consisting of 727 varieties, collected over the years around the world. I was told that it takes around 12 to 15 years to release a cane variety. It is a hard and dedicated work, and I want to thank the dedicated scientists and technician who camped at this site for7 months to make sure that the sugar industry continues to have improved varieties of cane</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 1541 that gives us good sugar, resistant to pests and diseases, as well as remain productive amid climate change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to fully support the recommendation of the Standing Committee, especially on the need for extension services of FSC to be under SRIF, as alluded to earlier by the honourable Leader of Opposition and I am grateful that the honourable Minister for Sugar has informed the House. The FSC by far, Mr. Speaker, has too many problems on its own. It should remain focussed on its core business and that is milling. Let SRIF handle the extension services. Recently, I have seen in the papers, and I was personally told as of now by the honourable Minister for Sugar about the opening of the new pest and disease screening facility at Wairuku in Rakiraki. It will also be a hub for technology transfer. This is exciting times for sugarcane farmers in Ra, as we hear about the plans of opening a new mill in Rakiraki, not only for sugar but other sugarcane products. I would like to thank SRIF its new local CEO, Dr. Vinesh Kumar, and his dedicated team of mostly local scientists for their hard work. I fully support the recommendation of the Standing on Economic Affairs and I fully support the motion before Parliament. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, Sir, let me take this time to pay tribute to two of my colleagues in the Tourism and Civil Aviation, who have recently left us. Firstly, Mr. Eliki Kaumaitotoya of Kabara, who was one of the first trainee engineers with Qantas back in those days. He became an aircraft engineer, came back to Fiji, served with Qantas, and he was one of the founding members for ATS which is now a well-established organisation with the shareholding built by the Government and the workers. Eliki had served as chairman of CAAF and did a great job in ensuring that CAAF lived up to its Charter. He was a person known for the standards that he set, and we pay tribute to him for his contribution to tourism and civil aviation. Secondly, Mua Ieli Taukave, has also passed away. A true son of Fiji and Rotuma, a dear friend who played a big role in Air Pacific back in those days from the 1970s and until recently, he was managing the Rotuma Airport. So, I would like to ask the House that we pay tribute to these two larger than life personalities, who have contributed so much to tourism and aviation in Fiji. Still on Aviation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to share with the House with great joy that the negotiations with the Americans in terms of the service to Dallas has now been approved and Fiji Airways should be flying to Dallas on 10 th December, 2024. So, that is quite significant. As we know, the Americans would only talk to us if we liberalise our aviation policy which we did. Cabinet approved the liberation and dialogue with the Americans started in December last year in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Now, it is approved, and the service to Dallas will be on 10 th December so within 12 months, we are able to negotiate and have Fiji Airways fly to Dallas. So, it is the execution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji, I am very passionate about Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and sugar is a significant feedstock into the production of aviation fuel. I would like to see FSC thrive so that Fiji can produce its own aviation fuel, going</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>1542 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 forward, being a country that relies on aviation come tourism. As you look at the report here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noticed a very significant statement here, where SRIF says, and I quote, “…it is not about increasing the size of land but increasing productivity”, which in this case is yield. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, the yield is 47 tonnes per hectare whereas the global standard is 90 tonnes per hectare. In Labasa, when we did the consultation on the Sugar Bill, in Labasa around the Waiqele Airport area, there is a farmer there, who was yielding about 130 tonnes per hectare. In Nadi, there is a farmer who is doing 150 tonnes per hectare. So, given the size of the amount of land that is available for cane farming, if you increase the yield, we can easily reach our target. We need about 3.5 million tonnes to produce ethanol. So, we need to reach that, we need to go to 3.5 million tonnes to enable us to really produce sufficient ethanol for SAF. So, from aviation perspective, this is very, very important and I would like to see this happen. What is being shared today by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Minister for Sugar, the extension arm, role of SRIF, I think we should encourage that. It is also mentioned here in the Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on their long-term establishment of business arm of SRIF. If they can do that, Sir, I believe we can do 3.5 million tonnes of sugar and reuse sufficient ethanol for aviation. I do not want to visit the old days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but remember when you were sitting on the other side, we pleaded for a bipartisan committee to look into sugar, but we were told to go and fly kites. They could not agree to include us in a bipartisan committee. That was eight years ago, we were pleading with them. But now, with the new way of leadership, we are more inclusive, let us work together to make this happen. I am quite encouraged by what I see here with SRIF, the technology we can introduce and to fully manage the work of SRIF, extend to the cane farmers to produce the cane crop that we want. I am quite pleased with the recent announcement by the honourable Minister that the focus will be on Sigatoka to increase production. Nadroga/Navosa are also big in sugar production. It was only possible, Mr. Speaker, because of the efficient rail network. You know you have this main trunk and then it goes right into the valleys. A company was picking their crop right on their doorstep and that is how my Province was able to be a huge part of sugarcane crop. I would like to see more of that to come back. It is unfortunate we did not repair the Sigatoka Bridge, but you need to go into areas like my Province of Nadroga/Navosa and Ra to enable us to make that target. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite encouraged by the SRIF Report. I think it can be done with commitment and new systems, scientists and all that running the show, we should be alright. So, I support the Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji was one of the top research institutions in the world. That is when we were working very closely; all the stakeholders with the industry. As alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Extension needs to do thriving work. The Extension Officers, the area, vehicle and everything and they were fully backed by the Industry. You had good educated people in their Extension Division, as apart from the Field Officers</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 1543 for the milling area. When these two combine well, things work out well for the Industry. Then you have a very robust sugar industry with the growers, and the landowners were slowly stepping into their area of getting direct deductions straight from the industry whenever there was a cane payment. So, everyone benefited, right down to the landowners. We at iTLTB knew quite well. That was when Deo Charan Singh was the Accountant with FSC in Lautoka. He was later posted to Brussels, and I do not know where he is now. So, those were the days when SRIF was really up there - top notch. Honourable Members, I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to add into what you have just said on research. Of course, I agreed that there was quite a lot of research being undertaken with SRIF. When we went there, they were discussing the findings and, of course, they improved the varieties that they have. However, one of the problems that we noted from the Committee, is the low uptake of the new varieties. This is where we see the need to review the overall structure of the industry. You have heard yesterday that I alluded to the cane payment system. Farmers will only improve their variety if they are being paid. If they are not sufficiently paid, then they will not improve their varieties. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues that has been raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition is on diversification. There has been quite a lot of work already done by farmers. With the assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture, some farmer groups are already established. Last week, I was at Nubutautau and this farmer group from Sabeto came all the way there to train the villagers in planting bongo chillies. This co-operative, the New Valley Co-operative, they are based at Sabeto, they will be purchasing all those bongo chillies that will be planted by the people in the highlands. So, it is already happening, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Of course, with the Ministry of Environment, we are developing a new project under the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and, of course, with Ministry of Agriculture on a $20 million project to target Vanua Levu on diversification. If you can do it in Vanua Levu, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition had just said, then we can upscale it into Viti Levu. Try to do it on a small scale, then upscale it on a big scale. Of course, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be happy about what we are trying to do there. The honourable Leader of the Opposition has mentioned about the social responsibility of Government. Of course, we have the social responsibility, but we also have to look at the economic benefits and cost to the people of this country. I think, over time, we have been subsiding this industry for long and we need to look at the economic costs and benefits. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister yesterday, mentioned about the elephant in the room and I totally agree with him on that. The elephant in the room in Fiji politics is the sugar industry. Of course, there is also the Greek mythology of the Pandora’s box. I think the Pandora’s box in Fiji politics is the Fiji sugar and I think it is time to open the box now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution, and I do support the motion before the House.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>1544 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- You were quick to point towards the Leader of the Opposition, but you should have declared your interest too, especially for Vanua Levu. (Laughter) Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of Report. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of our sitting today. First of all, I must thank the honourable Deputy Speaker for presiding in my absence during yesterday’s afternoon session and I thank all of you for your contributions. I like this debate on the sugar industry. It was after a while then we started getting factual arguments here, which was really good, and I encourage you. I thank you all for those great contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 6.39 p.m.</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>ANNEXURE I ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 123/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry (Ref. Page: 1527) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i. MINISTER FOR MULTI-ETHNIC AFFAIRS AND SUGAR INDUSTRY (Hon. C. J. Singh) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Response to Question No. 123/2024 is as follows: (a) Tonnes of Sugar Cane Crushed Over the last five years, the tonnage of sugar cane crushed has varied due to several factors, including weather conditions and operational challenges. The data is as follows: Season 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Cane Crushed (Tonnes) 1,806,572 1,729,171 1,417,185 1,639,004 1,565,564 The highest tonnage was recorded in 2019, primarily due to favourable weather conditions and operational efficiencies. However, the subsequent years saw variations, with a notable drop in 2021 due to severe weather conditions, including Cyclone Yasa, which caused extensive crop damage. (b) Amount of Sugar and Molasses Produced The production of sugar and molasses over the same period also reflects similar trends as it is directly linked to sugarcane production: Sugar Production (Tonnes) Season 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Sugar Produced 168,703 151,589 133,209 155,812 139,628 Sugar Production: The highest output was in 2019 with 168,703 tonnes, and the lowest was in 2021 with 133,209 tonnes, largely influenced by adverse weather and operational challenges. Molasses Production (Tonnes) Season Molasscs Produced (Tonnes ) 2019 2020 83,734 82,767</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>ii. 2021 2022 2023 71,710 74,178 68,010 Molasses Production: Molasses production peaked in 2019 with 83,734 tonnes and was lowest in 2023 with 68,010 tonnes. (c) Downtime of the Mills, Dates and Cost to Repairs The issue of mill downtime has been a matter of critical concern, driven by equipment failures and maintenance requirements. Before delving into the specifics, it is essential to clarify the data and terminology associated with mill operations during the crushing season. There are four key categories: Cleaning Intermission Stops, Inside Stops, Outside Stops and Actual Crushing Time. (1) Cleaning Intermission Stops - These are planned factory stops scheduled for the regular cleaning of components such as evaporators and boilers, which cannot be accessed during regular operations. Typically, these stops occur on Sundays. (2) Inside Stops - These interruptions result from plant breakdowns and operational issues within the factory's control, causing the mill to halt crushing. This category includes the downtime referred to by the Honourable member. (3) Outside Stops - These are stoppages due to external factors beyond the mill's control, such as low or absent cane supply caused by poor harvesting efforts, inclement weather, logistical challenges, or strikes.</p><h4>(4) Actual Crushing Time - This metric represents the mill's actual operational time, calculated</h4><p>by subtracting the total stoppage time from the total available operational hours. Over the past five years, the downtime and associated costs, expressed in hours, are as follows: Mill National Season Total Cleaning Intermission Stops (hrs) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 565.7 1,172.7 801.6 959.3 1,241.7 Total Inside Stops (hrs) 2,163.6 1,387.3 1,074.3 1,050.0 1,558.6 Total Outside Stops (hrs) 1,844.9 1,687.6 1,170.2 2,217.9 2,139.6 Total Actual Crushing Time (hrs) 7,897.2 7,268.3 6,143.2 8,045.2 6,873.8 It is important to highlight that the downtime attributed to internal factors, known as Inside Stops, peaked in 2019 at 2,163.6 hours and reached its lowest in 2023 with 1,558.6hours. This represents a substantial reduction of 605 hours or 28%. Despite these improvements, the figures remain significant, and we are committed to continually reducing downtime, recognizing the challenges posed by our mills' century-old infrastructure.</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>iii. Moreover, the stoppages due to insufficient cane supply, categorized as Outside Stops, were notably higher in 2023 at 2,139.6 hours compared to previous years. This increase has led to rising operational costs for the FSC. We must acknowledge that unplanned stoppages, irrespective of their cause, have detrimental effects on both the FSC and our growers. Therefore, it is imperative that both the FSC and our farmers collaborate closely to address these issues. The FSC should focus on minimizing Inside Stops, while our farmers must work to mitigate Outside Stops. Together, we can enhance operational efficiency and secure the industry's future. The costs of maintaining the mill operations year on year basis. The total running maintenance costs over these years amount to $29,148,136.

(1) Ct was evident that the challenges faced by the FSC, included equipment failures, operational inefficiencies, and inconsistent cane-supply, that significantly impacted production. (2) While the Ministry recognizes the challenges and shortcomings faced by FSC's operations, we have unwavering confidence in the current board, under the leadership of Mr. Nitya Reddy. We are assured that they possess the vision and capability to address these issues decisively, steering FSC towards a path of long-term self-sufficiency and sustainability. (3) The Government is also committed to tackling these challenges head-on. Plans are already in place to address the issues faced by the millers during these downtimes. (4) We must recognize that while farmers receive a guaranteed minimum price of $85 per tonne of cane, FSC operated without such guarantees from the government, especially when there is a shortfall in cane supply. The inconsistent cane supply has directly affected FSC's ability to generate sufficient revenue to maintain their mills adequately. (5) Therefore, it is imperative that we work together with farmers to ensure a consistent and adequate supply of cane, reduce stoppages, and improve the industry's potential. (6) Let us move forward with these plans to secure a sustainable and prosperous future for the sugar industry in Fiji.</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>ANNEXURE II ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Written Question No. 134/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport (Ref.
