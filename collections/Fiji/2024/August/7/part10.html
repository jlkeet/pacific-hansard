<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to todayâ€™s sitting and especially those joining us in the gallery and for that, we acknowledge the presence of His Excellency the Ambassador of Japan, not forgetting the students of Corpus Christi Teachers College. You are most welcome. Let us hope some of you may be joining us in the Chambers here in the not too distant future. Maybe that is your calling, maybe this is another calling but we welcome those that may want to join us. We also thank those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you sincerely for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament.</p></body>
