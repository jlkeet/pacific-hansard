<body><h3>AMENDMENT TO THE 2024 CALENDAR OF PARLIAMENT SITTINGS</h3><p>AMENDMENT TO THE 2024 CALENDAR OF PARLIAMENT SITTINGS HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament adopts the amended 2024 Sitting Calendar for November and December.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as all honourable Members are aware, Parliament approved the Sitting Calendar for 2024 earlier this year</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>1466 Amendment – 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 7 th August, 2024 with an amendment made during the July sitting, following discussions at the Business Committee. As is customary, the Business Committee agreed that if there was a pressing need to adjust any of sittings, this would be subsequently tabled in Parliament for endorsement. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, this motion seeks Parliament’s approval to allow for the following changes to the sitting calendar: (a) (b) to defer the Sittings scheduled for 18 th to 22 nd November to 2 nd to 6 th December; and to reschedule the Prorogation date from 2 nd December to 16 th December. The reason for this request, Mr. Speaker Sir, is due to the recent confirmation of the COP29 meeting dates, which would coincide with the November sittings. At the initial approval of the Sitting Calendar, the COP29 meeting dates were not out yet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, COP is a crucial meeting given that climate change significantly impacts the Pacific Islands States. Our vulnerability as small island States to natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, floods and other climate-related events makes it imperative that we participate in the COP meeting both at the Government level and the Parliamentary level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of some of the issues at COP, which are pressing needs in terms of our nation, we should note that we have a 100 percent electricity target for all Fijians, there is a target of 81 percent renewable energy by 2021 but so far only 60 percent has been achieved and mostly via hydro-electricity. Fiji has been lagging behind in its ability to attract, establish and retain Independent Power Producers. It is critical that we reach out and also secure funding in terms of renewable energy. Looking at the long term, Fiji will require $4 billion in investments between 2024 to 2036 to achieve its 100 percent renewable energy targets with cumulative investment cost expected to be $20 billion by 2050, which is also why we are currently conducting a diagnostic study through the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in order to move this forward. Of course, we cannot just brush aside the fact that our total imports of fuel is 26 percent of the total import cost amounting to approximately $1.03 billion. In terms of water, Sir, climate change impacts also, as we have also highlighted in the 2050 Water Strategy, the rise in the earth’s temperatures is estimated Year 2100 to be 2 percent to 4 percent and sea level rise 25 centimetres and the nation estimates $4.5 billion estimated to strengthen the resilience of our water infrastructures. Of course, aging infrastructure, again, this is related to what will be discussed in COP29, $3 billion a total of $8 billion. So, there is a huge amount of cost in terms of climate, ensuring that our infrastructure is climate resilient, which is why we, as a Ministry, and also other Ministries under the honourable Prime Minister and the Ministry of Climate Change at the moment are engaged in formulating concept papers and proposal which will be taken to COP29. From that, we are looking forward to securing or at least begin the initial discussions to secure funding to move us forward. Not only in the term of this government but also for the next government in case there is a change of government. We are preparing the groundwork and the base for that in this COP. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We prepared it for you:</span></p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Amendment – 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 1467 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- We are preparing it for you because you did not prepare it for us. (Laughter) There were some major projects, thank you to the last government. As a government, we continue the good work of the previous government. In light of these brief salient points, I seek the indulgence of the honourable Members to support this motion. I commend the motion to Parliament and urging approval of the proposed amendments. I believe this is a very critical COP that we are preparing for in terms of preparation, and we are, in fact, preparing various proposals which will be moved forward at this COP, in order to secure not all the funding we need but at least the critical funding to take us forward for the next 10 years to 20 years. I extend my gratitude to the Members of the Business Committee for their support, and I look forward to the support of this Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate, if any. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on behalf of the Group of 16 to show support to the motion. This has been discussed in the Business Committee and the Government has justified the reason why we need to change the Sitting Calendar and, of course, we have accepted it. The good thing about this change is, it does not mean a loss in the number of sitting days or weeks as the case in the previous adjustments, but this is just a postponement of the sitting dates and shifting it from November to December. The honourable Minister has spent quite a considerable time talking about COP and honourable Prime Minister, I think he should attend the next COP in Baku, Azerbaijan. He has talked about water and energy which are critical, but I would urge Government honestly the honourable Prime Minister, Sir, our preparation last year was not good. I know it comes under your portfolio, talking to the officials, there was no meeting at all prior to our departure. A lot of technical meetings should be happening and even the politicians, the Ministers who would accompany you, Sir need to be well briefed because COP is not a holiday. We need to go and fight our issues because this is the biggest existential threat as we admit, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, I would urge the Government, we still have a few months now to prepare because there are a lot of issues and the technical staff will help those senior officials. The Ministers that will be attending COP, particularly now we have progressed in Loss and Damage, Just Transition, you are well aware, honourable Prime Minister, is one of the key issues that is under the lens now. Of course, for us, carbon trading, forest issues and deforestation and the issue on resilience and adaptation, although we are doing our best in terms of the mitigation plans, I would just urge the Government, let us prepare well for this year. We are fortunate that we have experienced people like Ambassador Yauvoli who led the team last year and we thank him for his leadership, but there needs to be a lot of preparation and maybe through the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister if we can take responsibility in ensuring that we convene the meetings prior to departure because that will be very important for us. This is not the only one, honourable Minister, all COPs are important, not only</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>1468 Amendment – 2024 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 7 th August, 2024 COP29. Every COP is important to every Pacific Islander and every member of Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). We have just finished the 4 th International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS4) meeting in Antigua and Barbuda. I had some very good discussions with the High Commissioner of Samoa last night in the reception at Government House because they are currently Chair of AOSIS. That synergy, when it comes to the voices of the Pacific Islands into AOSIS and the G-77 plus China, plus the other geopolitical groupings will be very important. We support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we wish the Government all the very best in terms of preparation for COP29. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the motion. I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition as well as the Business Committee for moving the dates as is mentioned, we are not going to forego any sittings but moving it to December. Mr. Speaker, an equally important platform that will be marked next year (2025) is the Beijing Platform for Action on Gender Equality. That was the Beijing Platform for Action was in 1995, there was a global commitment to achieving gender equality or SDG5 and next year 2025 is 30 years. In that very same week, the dates have also been set for global leaders to meet to prepare for 2025 on the Beijing Platform for Action +30, so that will be happening also in that week. I fully support this motion to be able to have our Government represented at that particular meeting. It is being hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) along with UN Women. More importantly, Mr. Speaker, as our Pacific leaders continue to commit where they have made a pledge for gender equality in the Pacific, this supports our work as we prepare for Beijing Platform for Action +30. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Business Committee and I also seek the support of the Members of the House to agree to this motion as we look forward as a Government to prepare for this very important platform. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> Honourable Premila Kumar would like to speak after this, I am sure.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as a woman Member of Parliament, I would hope she would support the very important work of the Government as we prepare for this historic occasion next year as we mark the 30 th Anniversary of Beijing Platform for Action, and on that very week we are convening for this particular event. I do support the motion before the House. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just to share a few ideas of preparing for this COP29 meeting as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, the last COP we attended in Dubai, the honourable Prime Minister, including myself, were astounded by THE 38 members of our delegation attending the meeting. I even met one and said ‘hello’ to her. I said to her, “You come from the United States or what, because I follow your page on Facebook and know that you sell food online.” She said, “No, Sir, I am part of your delegation.” I said, “Oh!”, so there were 38 there, and we could not figure out where they were from and what organisation they were there for. It was an amazing incident there, but quite costly as well. We were all meeting up on the other side of the world.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1469 But, again, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition has stated, it was not really well prepared but, hopefully, I understand this one here would be a better one in the hope that we better prepare our Prime Minister because the Prime Minister leads the delegation. And when it comes to Government one-on-one, that is when you get to understand how important it is and we also get a lot from whatever the rich countries that are there and are very much trading in fossil fuel because the aim is to reduce that, and their aim is to ensure that they dangle carrots in front of us and that will keep us quite for another year – smoke emission, et cetera. However, we are on this side of the world where we are at the whim of the big smoke polluters. We cannot do anything. They smog the whole world, and we suffer. That is something that we should badly prepare for when we go into this kind of meeting, and that has been, kind of, a reminder to us by the honourable Leader of Government in Parliament, as well as the honourable Minister for Women. That is all I have to say, and I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply, if any. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his comments. Under the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Climate Change has definitely taken measures to ensure that we are well prepared in moving forward. Not only that, but also in terms of the specialised personnel and the coordination between the Ministries, because at the end of the day, in a lot of the international fora, developing countries are always asking, “what are we getting out of it? This is in terms of the complexities related to accessing climate finance. In light of that, we have also had a few workshops regarding that. Currently, there is one going on in terms of the modalities and processes involved, so when we get there, at least, what we need to have are concept papers and proposals. But linking that up technically before we get there so that when we get there, there is at least some movement forward in terms of mitigation and other avenues where we could benefit from as a nation because I believe discussions have been going on for number of years and we are at a stage where some of the financing mechanisms are at a maturity stage, I would say, and it would be really, really good for us to take advantage of the opportunities at this point in time and ensure that whatever we are able to secure as a Government also benefits our people, moving forward, no matter whatever government is in power in Fiji. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
