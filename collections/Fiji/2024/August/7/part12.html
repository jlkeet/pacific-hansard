<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p>Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40, the: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; Honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management; and Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>1470</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, we will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, including the two groups, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. As I have just said, I will also invite the leader of Group 9 Bloc to speak for five minutes and there will be no other debate. I now call on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to deliver his Statement. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament; and I also warmly welcome the students who are with us this morning and we wish them well in their studies. I also acknowledge the presence of the Japanese Ambassador with us this morning, and also those who are watching us on livestream or listening to the radio. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to say a few words on my recent three-day visit to Japan for the 10th Pacific Island Leaders Meeting or PALM10, and I thank His Excellency the Ambassador for pushing for me to go as I was thinking that I should not go. But when I went, I knew it was a good decision to go as I was there in the 1st PALM, and the only remaining Pacific Leader from that group that went to the 1st PALM. Japan, like many of our other partners, has consistently been a reliable partner for Fiji over many decades. We appreciate Japan's constructive engagement in the region and its significant contributions to Fiji's socio-economic development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year marks the 54th anniversary of our bilateral relations with Japan which, over the recent past, has been nothing short of impressive, while our multilateral relationship has been strengthened via the PALM Summit held every three years over the last 27 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1997, as Prime Minister, I led the Fiji Delegation to the 1st PALM Summit, held in Tokyo in that year, but three years prior to that, we had formed the foundation of the group that we eventually called PALM, also held in Japan and I was also there, and I had the honour of visiting His Majesty the Emperor at that time. His young son was not in the palace, he was touring in Fiji at the time, and this time I met him as the Emperor. The relationship between Japan and the Pacific Island countries have developed along two tracks - the bilateral and regional. I proposed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to focus first on the bilateral relationship before I elaborate on the PALM Summit itself. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of our bilateral relationship in 1970, Japan has provided approximately USD1.6 billion worth of development assistance to Fiji, for which I express our sincere appreciation. I am also pleased to acknowledge the ongoing positive collaboration and exchanges on a possible Strategic Partnership Agreement between our two countries. A Strategic Partnership Agreement would be a landmark achievement in advancing our bilateral relationship to greater heights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Wednesday, 17 th July, 2024, I was privileged to lead our delegation to a bilateral meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, the honourable Fumio Kishida. In discussions with Prime Minister Kishida, I acknowledged the continuous and continuing support of the Government of Japan with our infrastructure needs in critical sectors including</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1471 healthcare, education, fisheries, aviation, and disaster management capabilities. I also expressed gratitude for the approval for a stand-by loan for disaster recovery and rehabilitation. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics elaborated on that during the 2024-2025 National Budget presentation. In addition, the establishment of a seamless disaster prevention system in Fiji through initiatives such as the Disaster Risk Management Reporting Service using the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). It is called “Michibiki”, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The QZSS enabled disaster reporting service, will enable our people to be better informed of imminent natural disasters, facilitating better preparation. To further our bilateral cooperation, three documents were signed, the: (1) Minutes of Meeting for a study on feasibility of utilising Japan's renewal, maintenance and repair technologies to extend the lifespan of the bridges, and feasibility of public private partnership projects. This is between the Ministry of Infrastructure of Japan and the Fiji Ministry of Public Works and the Fiji Roads Authority. (2) Memorandum of Cooperation in Emergency Warning Satellite System using QZSS. This is between the National Space Policy Secretariat, the Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan and Fiji’s Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Fiji’s Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. Memorandum of Cooperation on Trade and Investment Promotion between the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) and Investment Fiji. (3) Mr. Speaker, Sir, Prime Minister Kishida and I also exchanged views on various regional issues, including the proposal for the ‘Zone or Ocean of Peace.’ I also informed Prime Minister Kishida, Sir, of our gratitude to the Government of Japan for its transparency and honesty in dealing with the Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS ). We acknowledge Japan's commitment to keeping the Forum Leaders and the global community fully informed of the measures being taken to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the ALPS process. I noted the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) 4th July, 2023 report and the IAEA Taskforce’s first full report issued in January of this year, since the discharge began last year. The IAEA Task Force concluded the discharge to be consistent with the international safety standards and reaffirmed the conclusions from the Agency’s comprehensive safety report issued last year. We continue to request the Government of Japan to continue to take measures in accordance with international safety standards and to take all possible measures to ensure no transboundary harm to the Blue Pacific Continent happens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PALM Summit held every three years since 1997, has developed into a central platform for regional policy dialogue. I commend the Government and the people of Japan for the consistent delivery of its commitments throughout the PALM process for nearly three decades. On Thursday, 18 th July, 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 10 th Pacific Island Leaders Meeting was held under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Kishida Fumio, Prime Minister for Japan, and the honourable Mark Brown, Prime Minister of Cook Islands and current Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting.</p><h4>I attended the Summit with Leaders and representatives of 14 Pacific Island countries, as well</h4><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>1472</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 as New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the Government of Japan for agreeing to incorporate the seven priority areas of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and its Implementation Plan into the PALM process. This was achieved via a series of preparatory meeting of Senior Officials of PIF Member States, with representatives of the Government of Japan at the Forum Secretariat in the months and weeks leading up to the Summit. The outcomes of Senior Forum Officials discussions were tabled to the Caucus Meeting of Pacific Leaders in Tokyo on Wednesday, 17 th July, 2024, prior to the PALM Summit on 18 th July, 2024. As an aside, that Caucus Meeting allowed Pacific Leaders to also discuss other urgent matters, including the situation in New Caledonia, while we were still in Tokyo. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Leaders issued a Declaration and Joint Action Plan as the outcome of our discussions. The PALM10 Joint Action Plan is the basis for mutually acceptable projects for cooperation and exchange. The honourable Leader of the Opposition pointed out this morning that perhaps we did not see indications of the success of our participation in COP Meetings, but the same was true for PALM. Most of the actions take place after those consultations at those meetings, and the result will come when there is direct consultation with the officials of the various Governments participating. The Plan includes multiple concrete projects for cooperation and exchange, in line with the 2050 Strategy and its Implementation Plan. Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Joint Action Plan endorsed at the Summit, forms the basis for mutually acceptable projects for cooperation and exchanges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the PALM Summit and bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan, there were an additional 13 engagements and meetings that were made for a very busy three-day visit to the ‘Land of the Rising Sun.’ Along with the other Pacific leaders, Mrs. Rabuka and I were also honoured to meet their Royal Majesties, the Emperor and the Empress of Japan, in a brief audience. And as I have mentioned earlier, he was a young man when I visited his father, the late Emperor. The Prime Minister of Japan, honourable Kishida, also hosted Pacific Leaders to a State Banquet, and I must express my gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Government of Japan for all the full courtesies and privileges given to me and my delegation. I do not know whether he will get the Letters to the Editor questioning the cost of the banquet, but that is for him to deal with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I held fruitful discussions with the Chairman of the Japanese Internation Cooperation Agency (JICA), Dr. Akihiko Tanaka, to discuss ongoing and new areas of development cooperation. One area, Sir, that has been successful is the area of people-to-people exchange and human resource development. While I was there, part of the discussions for the return of the remains of a young man who was playing rugby there. We thank the Government of Japan for their cooperation and also the Ministry of Health of Fiji in their cooperation for the return of the remains of that young man. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my close observation of the strength of the Japanese economy and infrastructure, which must be described as the miraculous transformation from the struggles after World War II. I was impressed that despite the economic success, the people of Japan have retained</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1473 their culture of discipline, hard work, respect and civility. In this regard, I sought more opportunities for people-to-people exchange, in particular for our young people, including sports exchange. Just as an aside, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was very peaceful and orderly on the roads in Japan. They have much better roads than we have, they are much cleaner, and the drivers are so courteous. Even in traffic, we did not hear anyone honking as they respected the law that exists. It is used only in an emergency or dangerous situation. I was travelling in one of the new energy cars and I hope we will be able to buy, we have charging facilities in Fiji, all the cars were clean - very clean. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the presents of PIF leaders in one location allowed me to catch up briefly with the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Penny Wong and a few other leaders. I also had the opportunity to meet with the Speaker of the Japanese Legislative Assembly, honourable Fukishiro Nukaga and the Chairman of the Japan-Fiji Parliamentary Friendship League and other senior members enthusiastically attended our meeting. They have invited you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to send a delegation from Fiji to continue the conversation in the league I conveyed to honourable Nukaga your greetings, Sir, and I also conveyed his reciprocals greetings to you. I also took the opportunity to invite the honourable Nukaga and members of the Japan-Fiji Parliamentary Friendship League to visit Fiji, perhaps on the 55 th Anniversary of our Independence which is next year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also took the opportunity to meet with key Non-Profit Foundations who have been long time friends and supporters of Fiji and the Pacific. These are the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and its parent, the Nippon Foundation. I looked around and I felt that I was the oldest in the hall, then I went to these two leaders and found out that I was very young. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation hosted the Japan-Fiji Nations Conference in Tokyo in 1988, attended by the late former President, Prime Minister and Turaga Bale Na Tui Nayau, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, nine years before the first Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM) Summit held in 1997 and its still there. Sasakawa Peace Foundation hosted a special week of seminars and lectures during the PALM10 Summit to which it invited Pacific Leaders, academics and researchers. I was honoured to attend to give my view on the PALM Summit and the challenges that we faced in Fiji and in the Pacific. The Sasakawa Peace Foundation carries out extensive work on oceans related projects as well research related to the blue economy and Scholarships for the World Marine University. I was also honoured, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to meet Dr. Yohei Sasakawa, the Chairman of Nippon Foundation which facilitates development cooperation in Fiji and other parts of the world on ocean- related projects as well as disaster preparedness, quality education and health, particularly on leprosy and poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I always relish the opportunity to meet our people who have made Japan their home or the country that I visit as their home and Japan was no exception. My meeting with the diaspora in Japan at Fiji House, the residence of our ambassador, was a joyful one. I also met my grandson (honourable Minister for Education’s son), who was mixing the yaqona. I thought he would make the presentation, he told me, “ Au sega ni kila na vosa vaka noqu.” I also noted that this is a subjective observation that they are the most polite diaspora group that I have met. I think the culture of the Japanese has got onto them. They are very courteous and polite. I do not know what will happen when they come back to Fiji. I hope they retain that culture or respect. I believe the respectful manners, hard work and discipline of the Japanese people have or</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>1474</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 influenced them really positively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by these areas of collaboration, our enduring relationship with Japan is marked by increasing engagement across various critical sectors and issues and I take this opportunity to thank the Government and the people of Japan and JICA for their support and partnership. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first let me thank the honourable Prime Minister on his Ministerial Statement on the recent Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM10) that was held in Tokyo. Before I speak on some of the issues that he raised, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just clarify our non-attendance to the veiqaravi vakavanua yesterday because we were confronted with so many questions from Members of Government. Let me clear the air that we did not boycott the veiqaravi yesterday. Simply we did not receive any official invitation from Government. And, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, this has been the case in the three recent visits – visit by the honourable Prime Minister of Australia, honourable Prime Minister of New Zealand and, again, yesterday. Someone in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to answer to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are equally concerned and disappointed too and I need to raise it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I will see to it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p>Sir, PALM plays a very important role in strengthening our cooperation within the region and indeed with our bilateral partners. I, therefore, thank the honourable Prime Minister for his participation in the PALM10 Summit and for having committed Fiji to the Leaders Declaration and Joint Action Plan as agreed to by the leaders during the Summit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to acknowledge the leadership of the Government of Japan and I convey that through His Excellency the Ambassador who is in Parliament this morning for hosting the Summit and, of course, indeed Japan plays a very crucial role in our development as Small Island States and has demonstrated that through the years. I thank the honourable Prime Minister for clarifying the bilateral and, of course, the regional cooperation that we have with Japan as well. For Fiji in particular, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has alluded to Japan’s contribution towards our Disaster Management Programmes and relief over the years that have been immense. I benefitted a lot from the exchanges with Japan, particularly with the Father of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), the old Professor, and Fiji through the NDMO has learnt a lot, and of course, with the signing of one of the three MOUs particularly, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, on the Quasi- Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) satellite system. That is most welcomed because Japan also played a key role in the development of our Disaster Risk Reduction Policy that is consistent with the Sendai Framework of 2015. A particular element of the DRR Policy is on Early Warning Systems and that relates to our resilience particularly, and of course, that is a welcome move. Thank you, honourable Prime Minister for highlighting the issue on the Fukushima Nuclear Waste. That was one of the questions that I would want to raise because last year, I thank the Japanese Ambassador, my office was provided with an update on the scientific assessment of the waste; science is science. It is actually the effects on the ground that we want to hear, and of course, with the leaders present, we thank you for providing that update because it will probably provide some</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1475 relief to those concerned Pacific Islanders and environmentalist. We hope that we will continue to have dialogue with the Japanese Government as we progress when more of such waste is dumped into the Pacific. I have heard about the three MOUs. One of the major projects, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, that was discussed previously is the Nadi River Realignment, whether that was also brought up in your meeting with JICA President, but His Excellency the Ambassador is listening this morning, that is a major project for Fiji; the Nadi River realignment. The scoping has been done already, the Ministry of Agriculture with the Department of Land and Water Resources was heavily involved before the formation of waterways and that is something that is hanging in the agenda between our two countries. I hope that this is something that can be pursued further and, of course, the Ministry of Waterways and Rural Development will also be very keen to see how this will progress. Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for your Statement this morning and of course we acknowledge once again our cooperation with the Government and the people of Japan. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Group of Nine.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. NAIVALURUA.:</span> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand on behalf of G9 plus 2.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. NAIVALURUA.:</span> Sorry G9 Bloc, just a slip of the tongue.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- It is increasing or is it your tongue? (Laughter) HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- I rise to say thank you and acknowledge the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister on his back brief to this honourable House on his visit to Japan which has covered the bilateral relationship between the Fiji Government and the Japanese Government, and likewise an overview of the PALM discussions in the meeting that he had attended. What is of great interest to our side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is really the issue on the Zone of Peace. I think Japan plays an important role in supporting Fiji in ensuring not only the Indo-Pacific is a peaceful, stable and prosperous nation or zone, but has a very effective role to play in supporting our zone here as the Zone of Peace or the Ocean of Peace. On the bilateral issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for highlighting the Agreements or the Memorandum of Cooperation that has been signed. We know in this honourable House that our National Budget is not able to support all our needs, wants and there is an endless list. I take this time to thank the Japanese Government for their support in the past years in the areas that we have asked for their support and cooperation, and this has covered many areas and fields. I would like to highlight a specific one which just happened recently, that is, the visit of the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces to Japan. What has been highlighted in his visit that an agreement where both Japan and our small country here recognised the importance of maintaining our region, our zone and our home as a place where there is peace, stability and prosperity.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>1476</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 I also take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps in the presence of His Excellency the Ambassador this morning to raise a point and request for the assistance to Black Rock. There is a great need to build a hospital in Black Rock, the honourable Whip on my side here when he was the Commander, he had brought this issue up. I wanted to take this opportunity if they are able to support us in building a good hospital inside there and it will help the hospitals in the Nadi and Lautoka areas. I also acknowledge the support for the Search and Rescue. Thank you very much Your Excellency for that particular role that your Government has played. Last before I sit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a point that was raised that perhaps excited me is the People-to-People Exchanges of Cooperation which has been spoken at length by the honourable Prime Minister. If there is something that we should learn from, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the people. Japan, they are unique in many ways; their character, the way they behave, the way they act. Yesterday, we spoke about the toilets here and our inability to use the toilets properly perhaps is of great concern. The cleanest toilets I know of, is in Japan. People know how to behave, how to act because of their character and what they have been taught to do. So, I would encourage more People-to-People exchanges between our country and this wonderful place, Japan. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to highlight a few of these issues in response to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister. MR. SPEAKER.- If I may just add a bit on what you have stated and that is the state of our toilets yesterday. Honourable Members, I forgot that the state of the toilets here in Parliament too is something for you to see, it is so dirty. We are talking about public toilets, yet our toilets right here are not clean. Maybe my staff or maybe the members of the public are not careful in how they utilise this public convenience. At the same time, I am taken by a line stated by the honourable Prime Minister on his visit to the great country of Japan in that given that the people who are responsible for PALM who initiated the PALM project, they are still around. That is why the honourable Prime Minister mentioned that he was still young…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Still young:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> … very young. I like that because the energy now in Fiji is to get more youth into Parliament but at the same time, the lesson learnt from Japan is the longevity of life and how they rely on the wisdom of the old people to guide them through, that is overwhelming and interesting. Maybe those are some things that we need to learn from as highlighted by honourable Naivalurua of the great country of Japan and we thank you His Excellency for all that you have rendered to the country of Fiji. Honourable Members, on that note, I would like to adjourn the House for morning tea and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.45 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1477 The Parliament resumed at 11.23 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.– I now call upon the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation to deliver his Statement. Northern Air Britten Norman Islander Aircraft Incident - Gau Aerodrome HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow citizens, ladies and gentlemen; before I commence, let me just comment on the visit by Her Excellency the President of India. Actually, a delightful lady, I was honoured to be given the privilege to meet her at Nadi Airport and at Sheraton, a truly, truly delightful experience. I was quite saddened that I did not see the Opposition at the traditional ceremony yesterday and as you know, going forward, this Government now does not exclude anyone. So, we made a commitment to correct that going forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. D. KUMAR. – Like you boycotted Moti? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- On the visit by Prime Minister Modi, the arrangement was such - in writing, delivered to the SODELPA people at that time, that the Leader of Opposition, Ro Teimumu Kepa, would deliver the Vote of Thanks. But two days before the event, government said “Opposition, you have no role to play in this, we will do it all”. We were boycotting the heavy- handedness of the FijiFirst Party, not of Prime Minister Moti. Let me clarify that. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- –The programme came from Parliament, which is sovereign. Parliament said, “Leader of Opposition, you give the Vote of Thanks.” But then the Prime Minister came and said, “No, we will do it all.” So, that is it, not against Prime Minister Modi who we cherish very much, but the heavy-handedness in which it was handled. We were protesting that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to clarify that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation, I rise today to shed light on the recent incident involving a Northern Air Britten Norman Islander (BN2A) Aircraft at Gau Aerodrome on the morning of 23 rd July, 2024. This incident has understandably raised concerns, but it also presents an opportunity to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to aviation safety and our collective resilience in the face of challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that day, the aircraft overran its designated landing area and collided with a rock mound at the end of the runway. Despite the significant damage to the aircraft, I am glad to report that the two crew members and three passengers on board were swiftly and safely evacuated without any injuries by airport personnel. This outcome is a testament to the rigorous emergency response procedures and the exemplary professionalism of our aviation personnel. I want to assure this august House and the people of Fiji that aviation safety is paramount for this Government. Fiji is a signatory to the Chicago Convention and is bound by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. These standards are the bedrock of our national aviation regulations, ensuring that all aircraft operators and personnel meet stringent safety requirements. To operate commercially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an aircraft must possess a valid Certificate of Airworthiness, the airline must hold a valid Air Operator’s Certificate, and the pilot must be appropriately licensed. Moreover, the airport itself must be certified to accommodate the specific</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>1478</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 type of operation. This rigorous certification process is overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF), as part of our robust aviation safety oversight system. I want to reiterate that the safety of our citizens and visitors is of utmost importance. While the recent incident in Gau Aerodome is deeply regrettable, it is crucial to understand that a comprehensive investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the overrun. The findings of this investigation will inform any necessary corrective actions and enhancements to our aviation safety protocols. In line with the Civil Aviation (Occurrence Reporting and Investigation) Regulation 2009, Captain Norman Walding has been appointed as the Aircraft Accident Investigator. Captain Walding has been involved in the aviation industry for five decades, starting as a pilot and flying instructor on light aircraft, and later as captain on medium-sized twin turbo-prop aircraft. He spent over 15 years as a Senior Flight Operations Inspector at the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF), regulating the domestic aviation industry during which time he had been engaged to conduct several investigations in the past. Mr. Speaker, Sir, accident investigations are pivotal in our quest to enhance aviation safety. They are not about assigning blame, but about uncovering the causes and implementing safety recommendations to prevent future incidents. Fiji’s effective safety oversight implementation rate is currently sitting above the global average of 61 percent. The ICAO audit for Fiji is sitting at 78.72 percent since 2019, which is a testament to our adherence to international standards and our proactive safety measures. Our skies remain among the safest, and this investigation will only serve to strengthen that assurance. The aircraft involved, a 43-year-old model, was maintained diligently by CAAF, underscoring the importance of rigorous maintenance and operational standards. Northern Air, which owns and operates four aircrafts, also owns and operates an additional three Cessna aircrafts for its South Pacific Aviation Training Institute (SPATI) Flying School, which operates out of Nausori Airport aerodrome. The airline continues to uphold these high standards, ensuring that our aviation operations are conducted safely and efficiently. Our pilots, including those involved in this incident, are experienced professionals dedicated to the highest levels of safety and competence. Northern Air’s aircraft has been certified as airworthy, confirming that the aircraft is in good operational condition. Additionally, the airline’s Air Operator’s Certificate is valid. These valid safety documents reflect our stringent regulatory oversight. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the investigation process, which is currently underway, is aligned with the Civil Aviation (Occurrence Reporting and Investigation) Regulations 2009. The State of Occurrence, Fiji in this case, is primarily responsible for the investigation, which includes the notification of the accident to the State of design, manufacture, and to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The Minister responsible for Civil Aviation appoints the Investigator-in-Charge, who is granted extensive powers to access and analyse evidence, issue safety recommendations, and produce both, preliminary and final reports. Captain Walding, our appointed Investigator-in-Charge, will ensure a comprehensive examination of the incident, preserving evidence, inspecting aircraft and components, and accessing manufacturing and maintenance premises as needed. The investigation process typically spans over a year, to ensure thoroughness in line with ICAO standards. A preliminary report is expected to be produced in the first phase of the</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1479 investigation, which is 30 days after the appointment of the investigator, while a final report is expected to be produced by the Accident Investigator at the end of the investigation, typically after 12 months. As normally expected after an investigation is carried out and a final report is produced, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation ensures that safety recommendations are addressed appropriately, and preventative actions that are considered necessary, are taken promptly to enhance aviation safety. In addition, the final report is also submitted to ICAO as a guide to future global safety measures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, allow me to highlight an element that is needed for dissemination for public consumption with regards to subsidies. Gau Aerodrome, like several others, including Vanuabalavu, Koro, Cicia, Lakeba, Rotuma and Kadavu, operates under a subsidy. These island routes, which are not regularly serviced by sea transport, are applicable under the air subsidy scheme. These subsidies are not merely financial support - they are investments in connecting our communities, fostering economic growth and ensuring that every Fijian, regardless of their location, has access to safe and reliable air travel. Fiji Airports operates the Nadi International Airport and manages Nausori International Airport and 13 domestic outer island airports on behalf of the Government. These airports are overseen by CAAF to ensure they are safe and secure. This incident, while unfortunate, is a poignant reminder of our shared commitment to safety, our resilience, and our continuous pursuit of excellence. It is through these challenges that we grow stronger, reaffirming our dedication to the safety and wellbeing of every passenger who takes to our skies. I wish to re-emphasise that the objective of the accident investigation is to generate safety data and information to aid with the prevention of future and similar accidents from occurring. It is not to apportion blame or liability. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak in reply. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for giving me this opportunity to respond to the honourable Minister because I had posed the initial question that was supposed to be addressed by the honourable Minister a day before. Mr. Speaker, before the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation gave his Ministerial Statement, he spoke about the recent visit of the President of India to Parliament, and then tried to justify their actions back in 2014 when they were not present in this Parliament. (Honourable Government Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am just responding to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I was sitting there too, honourable Maharaj. HON. A. A MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that when the honourable Prime Minister of India, Mr. Modi, came to this Parliament, the Opposition were missing, but when the President of India came the Opposition were present, although we were not invited for the traditional welcome.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>1480</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, now going on to the substantive matter of what transpired in Gau, it is good to know that everyone is safe. While flying in the maritime areas and navigating through the terrain, especially rough terrain, it is not easy. Mr. Speaker, Northern Airline has been providing services in the maritime areas for some time now. We need to look at the safety, visibility needs to be clear when pilots are approaching the airstrip and Government needs to actually start thinking of investing in the lights at the airstrip. It is much more easier to land a plane in Nadi, Nausori or in Labasa, but it is really difficult for a pilot to land a plane in this kind of terrain. Mr. Speaker, we also note that Northern Air is the only Airline that provides competition to Fiji Link. Previously, Northern Air used to provide a daily service on the main routes - Nadi to Suva, Nadi to Labasa and Labasa to Suva. Mr. Speaker, if we look at Fiji Link, their parent company - Fiji Airways, has lucrative routes to fly to, like Nadi to Auckland, Nadi to Sydney, Nadi to Los Angeles, Nadi to Singapore, et cetera. The profits that are obtained by Fiji Airways are invested in the new fleet. Unfortunately, the Government is using Northern Air as their social responsibility tool to subsidise the flights and fly them to maritime areas. Unless and until we allow Northern Air to fly on lucrative routes, such as Nadi to Suva, Nadi to Labasa, Labasa to Suva … HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do for 16 years?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> It’s deregulated – no restrictions.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> …they are not able to fly out of Suva to Labasa on a daily basis. They need to start flying on daily basis and, at least, three times a day to provide a better competition to the passengers who are actually travelling. Mr. Speaker, before speaking, I did a bit of research on my phone. If I have to travel to Labasa tomorrow and return the day after, the minimum fare that I might be paying to Fiji Link is $350 and the maximum is $1,220. How is this justified, Mr. Speaker, Sir If more conducive environment is provided to Northern Air to fly more on this lucrative flight, they can then invest in the new fleet and not rely on the fleet, as mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister that was more than 40 years old. They need to make profits on lucrative routes in order to invest in the new fleet. And if we are able to produce or give this kind of conducive environment to Northern Air, Mr. Speaker, they can invest in new planes and such an incident can be prevented in the future. That is all, Mr. Speaker, vinaka.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> Deregulated, my friend. They can fly anywhere they want.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> And I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his desigate. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to extend my sincere appreciation to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation for his dedication and relentless effort in leading the investigation related to the unfortunate accident involving a Northern Air Britten Norman Islander (BN-2A) aircraft at Gau Aerodrome, where two crews and three passengers were on board. This is in accordance with section 16 of the Civil Aviation Act 1976 which deals with liability for loss or damage caused by aircraft.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1481 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the timely submission of the preliminary update report to Parliament this morning will be instrumental in reinforcing our commitment towards aviation safety. The detailed insights, as well as the in-depth analysis encapsulated in the report so far, offer us essential tools for the effective prevention of future accidents of a similar nature. Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, the comprehensive nature of the investigation has underscored the need for thorough review of our existing safety protocols, not just at Gau Island, but across the aerodromes domestically, thus, setting in motion the appropriate plans for improvement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the finding and recommendation in the preliminary report, as we have heard this morning, I am sure that necessary steps will be taken promptly to implement the proposed changes. This will be done to improve the safety of our domestic aerodromes, and to continuously ensure the protection of passengers and the crew, alike. Despite, this unfortunate circumstance that led to this, it is commendable that we have turned a challenging scenario into a learning opportunity, thereby, enhancing our aviation standards. Once again, I extend my sincere gratitude to the dedication and the earnest endeavour shown by the honourable Minister during this investigation process. I am positive that with such continuous leadership, we will successfully navigate the improvements, to ensure the safety of our aviation industry in Fiji.</p><h4>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to the Ministerial Statement this</h4><p>morning. MR. SPEAKER.- I only hope that it was not stray dogs that led to that accident in Gau. They usually have a problem with stray dogs there. They took care of it and ate all the dogs. (Laughter) National Sports, Recreation and Physical Activity Policy HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, I acknowledge those sitting in the public gallery and viewers who are watching through television broadcast live from their comfort zone; it is with a profound sense of duty and optimism that I stand before you today, through the Grace of God, to present and discuss the National Sports, Recreation and Physical Activity Policy, which we have recently launched as a Ministry in July 2024. Before, I do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, kindly allow me to congratulate and to thank our men’s Rugby Sevens Gladiators. Congratulations for winning the Silver Medal, and we thank you most sincerely for making our nation proud of your achievement. I also wish to commend our Fijiana Sevens Team and other Olympians representing Fiji for giving their best efforts on the field. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Policy has been a long time in the making, reflecting years of dedication and collaborative effort since 2017. Its launch represents the culmination of a vision that has been patiently nurtured and stands as a testament to our commitment to fostering a vibrant, inclusive and sustainable sports culture for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this policy is not just a formal document, it is a bold and comprehensive plan that reflects our commitment to the future of sports, recreation and physical activity in Fiji. This policy is designed to be a blueprint for the development of sports across all levels, from grassroots participation to elite performance, to ensure that physical activity is woven into the fabric of our daily</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>1482</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 lives. Sports in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has always been more than just competition. It is an integral part of our national identity, a source of pride and a means of fostering unity among our people. With this, we are not only looking to the future of sports, but also addressing the present challenges and opportunities that lie before us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the significance of the National Sports Creation and Physical Activity Policy, the importance of this policy to sports development in Fiji cannot be overstated. Sports recreation and physical activity are essential elements of healthy, dynamic and prosperous society. They contribute to the physical and mental well-being of individuals, strengthen social ties within communities and have a significant impact on our economy. The policy also embraces the fact that sports play a crucial role in addressing the youth issues facing Fiji today, such as unemployment, substance abuse, social isolation, et cetera. By engaging young people in structured sports programmes, we provide them with positive outlets for their energy and creativity, helping to deter them from negative behaviours. Sports teach valuable life skills, like discipline, teamwork and leadership which are essential for personal development and future employment. Moreover, by fostering a sense of community belonging, sports help to build self-esteem and resilience among youth, empowering them to overcome challenges and contribute positively to society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on its economic impacts, the potential of sports as a catalyst for development is immense. Studies have shown in Fiji that for every dollar invested in sports, there is a return of $20. This return comes in the form of economic growth, job creation and the promotion of tourism. Sports events both large and small attract visitors, generate revenue for local businesses and creates jobs across a range of sectors from hospitality to retail, from event management to media coverage. Moreover, investing in sports infrastructure and programmes can lead to long term savings in health care cost. As a nation grappling with the rise of NCDs, we must recognise the preventative power of physical activity. The social and cultural benefits of sports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are equally significant. Sports have a unique ability to bring people together, transcending differences of ethnicity, religion and socio-economic status. They foster a sense of community belonging and shared purpose. Through sports, we can build bridges between different groups within our society, promoting social cohesion and national unity. This policy is designed to ensure that sports and physical activities are accessible to all Fijians, regardless of age, gender, ability or background. By promoting inclusivity, we are not only enriching our sports culture, but also ensuring that every citizen has the opportunity to lead a healthy and active lifestyle. On health and well-being, the health benefits of regular physical activity are well- documented, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Physical activity is not only essential for maintaining physical health, but it also has profound effects on mental health. In a world where stress, anxiety and depression are increasingly common, sports and recreation offer a vital outlet for stress relief and emotional well- being. This policy aligns with our national health goals by encouraging Fijians to engage in regular physical activity which will help reduce the prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases. By promoting active lifestyles, we are making a long-term investment in the health of our nation. This, in turn, will lead to a healthier, happier population, with fewer healthcare costs and a stronger and more resilient workforce. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to delve into the key components of this policy which are designed to address the diverse needs of our population and the various challenges we face in sports development.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1483 (1) Infrastructure Development The availability of adequate and modern sports facilities is the foundation upon which all other aspects of sports development rest. Without proper infrastructure, even the most talented athletes cannot reach their full potential. This policy prioritizes the construction and upgrading of sports facilities across the country, ensuring that both urban and rural areas are equipped with the necessary resources to support sports and physical activities. Through this policy, the Government is committed to ensuring that these facilities are accessible, safe and well-maintained. This includes building new stadiums, sports complexes and recreational centres, as well as upgrading existing facilities to meet international standards. These investments will not only benefit our athletes but also provide communities with spaces where they can come together, be active and enjoy the benefits of physical activity. (2) Talent Identification and Development Mr. Speaker, identifying and nurturing talent is crucial for the future of sports in Fiji. Our nation has a rich history of producing world-class athletes, and this policy aims to build on that legacy by creating pathways for our young athletes to excel. We will invest in talent identification programmes that reach out to schools and communities across the country, ensuring that no talent goes unnoticed. In addition to identifying talents, this policy places a strong emphasis on development. We will provide our athletes with access to high quality training facilities, expert coaching and the resources they need to compete at the highest levels through the establishment of the Fiji Institute of Sports. This includes partnerships with international sports organisations which will allow our athletes to gain exposure to global standards and compete on the world stage. (3) Inclusivity and Accessibility Inclusivity and accessibility are at the heart of this policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The policy states that sports and physical activity should be accessible to all, regardless of physical ability, gender or socio-economic status. This policy outlines specific strategies to ensure that marginalised and under-represented groups are actively included in sports programmes. For example, we are committed to adapting facilities for people with disabilities, ensuring that they can participate in sports without barriers. We will also promote women’s participation in sports, breaking down the stereotypes and cultural norms that have historically limited their involvement. (4) Integration of Sports and Education Mr. Speaker, the integration of sports and education is another key aspect of this policy. Schools play a crucial role in shaping the future of our nation and by embedding sports into the educational curriculum, we are not only fostering physical fitness but also teaching valuable lifeskills such as teamwork, discipline and resilience. The policy highlights the need to closely collaborate with the Ministry of Education to ensure that sports programmes and, in particular, physical education programmes are effectively implemented in schools across the country. These includes providing schools with the necessary resources such as sports equipment and trained coaches to</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>1484</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 deliver quality physical education programmes. By doing so, we will create a generation of young Fijians who value physical activity and carry those habits into adulthood. (5) Good Governance and Safeguarding Mr. Speaker, the policy ensures that sports organisations operate transparently, ethically and with accountability fostering trust and integrity at all levels. In addition, it prioritizes the safety of all participants particularly children and the vulnerable group by implementing robust measures to prevent abuse, discrimination and exploitation. (6) Promotion of Physical Activity Across All Ages Mr. Speaker, promoting physical activity across all ages is essential for the long-term health and wellbeing of our population. This policy supports community-based programmes that encourage lifelong participation in physical activity from youth sports leagues to senior fitness classes. The policy ensures to create a culture where physical activity is seen as a normal and enjoyable part of daily life. This includes initiatives to make our cities and towns more walkable, creating more public spaces for physical activity and promoting active transportation options like cycling and walking. By making it easier and more enjoyable for people to be active, the policy will help to reduce the barriers to physical activity and encourage more Fijians to lead active lifestyles. (7) Strategic Implementation Mr. Speaker, the success of this policy lies in its strategic implementation. This will include the active involvement of all stakeholders, not only the sports community but also businesses, schools, healthcare providers, and community organisations. We have established a robust governance and organisational structure to oversee the execution of the policy. This includes the development of a Policy Action Plan that will guide the implementation of the policy and ensure that the policy’s objectives are met. The Ministry of Youth and Sports, Fiji Sports Council and the Fiji National Sports Commission as statutory organisations mandated for sports development will work closely with the various stakeholders including sports federations, educational institutions, private sector partners, civil society organisations and international partners. By fostering partnerships and encouraging collaboration, we will be able to leverage the strengths of each sector to achieve our common goals. The policy highlights the need to build strong partnerships with these stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has a role to play in the implementation of the policy. (8) Timeline and Milestones Mr. Speaker, this policy is designed with a clear timeline and milestone to ensure that progress is measurable and transparent. We have set specific targets for infrastructure development, participation rates and talent development over the next five years. For example, we aim to have new sports facilities built or upgraded in every major urban center and centralised rural areas within the next five years. We also aim to increase</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1485 the participation rate in sports and physical activity by 20 percent over the next three years with a particular focus on increasing participation among women, children and people with disabilities. (9) Monitoring and Evaluation To ensure that the policy achieves its intended goals, Mr. Speaker, we have put in place a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework. Performance metrics have been established to track progress in key areas such as infrastructure development, participation rates and health outcomes. Regular evaluations will be conducted by the Multi-Sector Coordination Committee (monitoring &amp; evaluation mechanism) comprising of senior officers from the line ministries that will coordinate efforts across different sectors and findings will be used to inform policy adjustments and improvements. This will ensure that the policy remains responsive to changing needs and challenges, and that we are always working towards our ultimate goal of promoting sports and physical activity for all Fijians. (10) Policy Principle Accountability is a cornerstone of this policy. We are committed to transparency and will ensure that all stakeholders are held accountable for their roles in the implementation of the policy. These includes regular reporting to Parliament and the public on the progress of the policy and its impact on the nation. We will also work to ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently, with a focus on achieving the best possible outcomes for our citizens. By maintaining high standards of accountability, we can build trust and confidence in the policy, ensuring that it has the support it needs to succeed. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who have contributed to the development of this policy. Special thanks goes to the dedicated team at the Ministry of Youth and Sports who have worked tirelessly to bring this policy to fruition, including the support from the Fiji National Sports Commission and the Fiji Sports Council. Their hard work, expertise and commitment have been instrumental in shaping this comprehensive and forward-thinking policy. I also extend my gratitude to the sports federations, educational institutions, private sector partners and civil society organisations that provided invaluable input and feedback during the policy review process. Their insights have ensured that this policy is grounded in the realities of our nation and reflective of the needs and aspirations of our people. Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the support of our international partners, who have shared their expertise and experience, helping us to learn from global best practices and adapt them to our unique context. Their collaboration has been vital in ensuring that this policy is not only ambitious but also achievable. There is a call to action, as we move forward, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Fijians to embrace this policy and the opportunities it presents. This is not just a Government initiative; it is a national movement that requires the participation and support of everyone; whether you are an athlete, a coach, a parent, a stakeholder or simply a sports enthusiast, your involvement is crucial to the success of this policy. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Sports, Recreation, and Physical Activity Policy is more than just a framework for sports development; it is a vision for a healthier, stronger and more</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>1486</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 united Fiji. By investing in sports and physical activity, we are investing in the future of our nation. We are creating opportunities for our youth, promoting health and well-being, and building a legacy of excellence that will inspire generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I seek your indulgence and approval to submit a copy of the National Sports, Recreation and Physical Activity Policy for Parliamentary recording purposes and I also offer my best wishes to all stakeholders, all sport organisations, donors and resources providers in expediting the policy objectives. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you honorable Members for your attention and commitment to this important initiative. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you for that Statement, honourable Minister, it is reassuring, since payment as promised by the honourable Prime Minister is still coming. You have indicated that is not part of your budget? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, Sir. We are planning for the national celebration in consultation with the Office of the Prime Minister, before we pay out the rewards for the boys. MR. SPEAKER.- You should have done that when you made that statement. I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise as the Opposition Shadow Minister for Youth</p><h4>and Sports to respond to the honourable Minister’s Ministerial Statement.</h4><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- I hope you would not mind, it is five minutes only. You really went</h4><p>overboard there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I applaud that the honourable Minister’s comprehensive articulation on the ideology of boosting a career for youth in sports, and I applaud all the relevant stakeholders who have been part of this. The National Sports Recreation and Physical Activity Policy was recently launched by the Ministry and the Policy has been in a long time of the making and the years of dedication and collective efforts since 2017 and has also been in line with the National Development Plan 2017- 2026, the Ministry of Youth and Sports Strategic Plan 2018-2020 and the Fiji Youth Declaration 2019. Recognising the multi-sector nature of youth development in Fiji, it takes the whole of Government approach, bringing together key Government Ministries, Departments and authorities to work in a coordinated way towards achieving strategic goals for Fiji’s youth. Implementing this Policy will involve a diverse range of programmes in key areas such as health and wellbeing, education, skills and employment, safety, protection, environment and climate change, participation and empowerment, inclusion and non-discrimination, and strengthening the enabling environment for youth. In developing policies and programmes and in allocating the necessary resources, the Ministry of Youth and Sports needs to also focus on relevant key strategic areas where we need efficient, effective, sustainable and socio-economic and cultural development for youth. Also, in the</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1487 areas of strengthening to develop virtual delivery of education, practical skills, soft skills, education curriculum, and also to improve financial literacy and management in our schools and especially for our athletes. Also, to maintain and build more sporting facilities, as highlighted by the honourable Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must know that the Super Rugby match that was held in Fiji for the first time was between Crusaders and Chiefs on 1st July, 2016. Government needs to realise that hosting international rugby games has boosted economic activity and economic generations for our nation as a whole. It has inspired the younger generation for a future in sports because our youth are dynamic, ambitious, innovative and talented, so as Government, we need to promote various sports in Fiji to unlock this potential. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I look at the Paris Olympics, only two representatives have represented Fiji in the swimming category. Had Fiji had another Olympic standard swimming pool, we would have encouraged more youth to have a career in sports because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot expect our youth to swim or practice in lakes, rivers and in the ocean and dream for the Olympics. That is why I urge the honourable Minister to build the Lautoka Swimming Pool to international career standard so that it is for our youth of the country. I would like to congratulate the Fiji Sevens Team for their achievement and the various other representatives of Fiji. I also would like to congratulate the Lautoka Team for winning the BOG since 2016, although my father called me and said, “ Ba toh Ba hai ”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to urgently look at key areas of school violence where it can be tackled by students being exposed to sports, rebellious behaviours of students in public places, especially in buses where you see buses swinging from left to its right after their celebrations as it is really dangerous for the public. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth also involved in abuse and hate on social media, and I feel like sports is one of the key ways to get students from out of this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth play integral role in the decision making and process and their potential for key agents of social change, innovation and future leadership, providing these facilities and education that increase participation through sports for our younger people, are key factors in achieving this global progress. I have expressed my concerns to the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports in Parliament, and I am hopeful that there is a multi-sectoral approach so that we are able to create a Fiji in which all youth are healthy, respected, safe, included and empowered to reach their full potential and meaningfully engage in and contribute to the civil, political, economic, social and cultural growth our beloved nation. MR. SPEAKER.- I call on the leader of the Group 9 Bloc or their designate.</p><h4>HON. A. BIA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by honourable</h4><p>Minister for Youth and Sports on the National Sports Recreation and Physical Activity Policy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to earlier by the honourable Minister, this will enhance sports and physical activity delivery at all levels of participation. Not only that, Sir, sports play an important role in our national unity.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>1488</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Policy, if rightfully followed as well as executed, can very well provide the pathway for every minor sporting body to achieve high honours in competitions around the region, and even qualification for the Olympic Games of any international competition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that our nation’s passion for sports and support from Fijians and athletes have propelled Fiji onto the global sporting stage. I agree that the honourable Minister mentioned about the many challenges that are there to ensure that the Policy is formulated, is well followed and carried through by various sporting bodies in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just highlight three key challenges that can further consolidate or strengthen the National Sports Policy, in my view: (1) Limited resources and funding - the lack of funding for smaller and minority sporting bodies and also various clubs and sporting teams in our communities. Also, as mentioned by the honourable Minister in his Statement, there has also been a challenge for the various minority sporting bodies to provide acquittals to the sporting organisations that is looking after the allocation of funds to the various sporting bodies. (2) Lack of sporting facilities, which was also highlighted by the honourable Minister and I am thankful that he did mention that in the next five years, Government is looking forward to build more sporting facilities in every community and rural areas around Fiji. (3) Talent Identification and Development Programme: This is very important and also mentioned by the honourable Minister. We need to ensure that every sporting body needs to have a Talent Identification and Development Programme, which will ensure that we have a pool of athletes whom we can groom and train to perform at a level that is required regionally and internationally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the National Sports, Recreation and Physical Activity Policy, and very much looking forward to the progress and its implementation. Efforts to Target Impact Investments in Fiji HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Na Turaga na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; before I begin, I just thought that I also acknowledge the presence of the students from Corpus Christi, who are training to be teachers. All I can say to them is, welcome to your Parliament. Just remember that you have a profession that the whole of Fiji relies on. You will be training the next few generations of people in Fiji. Also, on top of that, some of your very highly respected professionals have ended up in this House as Leaders of the Opposition, Cabinet Ministers, Deputy Prime Ministers, and who knows one day, even as Prime Minister. So, welcome, and I hope you will find today instructive. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to provide a Ministerial Statement on the significant strides that Government continues to make in terms of fostering a robust investment climate to drive impactful economic development and sustainable development growth. I will be talking specifically about one particular initiative that we have developed and has been passed to Cabinet, called the Significant Investment Policy, which forms part of the discussion here today.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1489 As one of the leading nations in the Pacific, the Fiji Government is actively working towards attracting investments that will bring economic benefits and promote sustainable development and inclusivity in our islands. Our approach involves improving the investment climate, strengthening partnerships and pursuing opportunities aligned with our national development goals. Over the last few years, some businesses have hesitated to invest and commit to Fiji. This, perhaps, stems from uncertainty, Government overreach and excessive control, mismanagement, perhaps, and unfriendly business environments. Due to these factors, Sir, there have been challenges which we are trying to resolve. Mr. Speaker, when we formed Government 19 months ago, we promised the people of Fiji that we would listen, and we are listening. We also understand that the economy needs to promote economic growth and development, and we also that we need to make the environment in Fiji a lot more investor friendly and predictable. So, we remain committed, Mr. Speaker, in terms of ensuring that these objectives are met. Mr. Speaker, Cabinet, in its sitting on 7 th May, 2024, approved the Significant Investment Policy framework for Fiji. This Policy Framework will provide comprehensive guide for promoting and managing significant investments in the country. With the focus on enhancing economic development, sustainability, social impact, this framework will serve as a foundation for attracting investments across critical sectors. The policy framework, Mr. Speaker, defines clear objectives for significant investments to align with national priorities, create a conducive environment for attracting and retaining investors in Fiji, and ensure sustainable and socially responsible investments contribute to the country’s long- term development. Under this Policy Framework, Mr. Speaker, Government will provide support on a case-by- case basis to investment projects that meet specific criteria which include: • • • • Economic impact and strategic importance which must align to the country’s priorities and contribute to growth and development. Technological Advancement - Priority investments in new technologies, know-how, or expertise that can benefit local industries, contribute to Fiji's skill development, or enhance our overall competitiveness. Environmental and Social Sustainability Investment projects prioritising environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and community wellbeing will be considered. - Risk Mitigation - Investment mechanisms to mitigate risks and ensure long-term viability, promoting stability and growth in the local market. • Minimum Investment Threshold – For these projects which are considered significant investments will be around $200 million or above. ▪ Local participation - such as partnerships with local businesses and employment of local talent will be encouraged. Local expertise in the architectural, engineering and construction sectors, while sourcing materials and employing local workers is also of keen interest. Under the Policy Framework, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also an Investment Facilitation Committee (IFC) which had been earlier created by this Government which is crucial in promoting</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>1490</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 and facilitating investments in Fiji. Representatives from key Government Ministries and agencies are represented in this Committee. The Committee has the overarching mandate to identify hindrances to investment, and provide guidance, support and coordination throughout the investment process, instilling optimism about future investments in Fiji. I was interested to note a positive comment from Mr. Brent Hill, the Tourism Fiji CEO, talking about a more friendly business experience and I got some congratulations, Mr. Speaker, on that remark. But I told them it is early days, and it is still very much a work in progress, as I will explain in more detail. In addition to this, apart from the Government representatives on this IFC, there are also members from the private sector, who leverage their expertise and resources to assist in investment bottlenecks. By collaborating with other agencies, expediting critical approvals and removing bottlenecks, the IFC will continue to contribute to a more efficient and effective investment process, ultimately speeding up investment and driving growth in the economy. The recommendations of the IFC are channeled through the Ministry of Trade and the Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, who also then tabled these significant investments on the Economic Strategic Committee (ESC). This is another creation of this Government in an endeavour to continue to support high level business activities. Once the investment projects are overseen or considered at the ESC, then the Government moves forward in terms of assisting these significant projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I have just mentioned is something that has never been done in this country and I think it positions us well in terms of the way investment will go forward in Fiji. What does the Significant Framework mean for Fiji and interested investors? Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government, of course, will provide the mechanisms on a case by case basis to look at, obviously, financial incentives, infrastructure development, and take away some of the mystery that normally happens when investors come to Fiji particularly when there are infrastructure requirements. Regulatory and logistical support is also provided, Mr. Speaker, and these are the support mechanisms that are being put in place to ensure that going forward, the investor climate continues to improve. There is already one significant investment on the table, Mr. Speaker, which I will be tabling at the ESC very soon. It is the first of our hope for the many significant investments in the country. It is worth about $300 million and, potentially, it will create 500 jobs, and that is what we are trying to do. Mr. Speaker, I thought I would just touch on the other types of efforts that are going in by this Government in terms of trying to improve the investment climate in Fiji. I would like to talk about the Ease of Doing Business or the reform of our processes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now through the businessNOW FIJI initiative, which is a new initiative to digitise the whole of government business processes. We are actually working at the moment on automating the first or hopefully will be many digital processes in Fiji, starting with starting a business process and also obtaining a construction permit process. If we are able to complete those two processes, there is particular enthusiasm about the second opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is obtaining a construction permit. I truly believe that in Fiji, one of the major obstacles to doing investment in Fiji is how difficult it is to obtain a construction permit.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1491 Sir, you have to comply with documents which are probably up to this level high, make three copies, give it to the Department of Town and Country Planning then it circulates around with all the agencies. Documents go missing, people go missing, everything happens. What we endeavour to do with the new automation, Sir, hopefully by the end of next year, we will actually allow investors to load their documents once and it is processed right through seamlessly by each agency online. If we are able to do that, we will make significant headway in terms of creating the Ease of Doing Business experience in our country. I just thought I would also just like to touch on some of the things that we have been able to achieve. Through the honourable Prime Minister’s leadership, before environment used to be a major challenge in terms of approvals. It was the top most significant issue when it came to Ease of Doing Business. Sir, that is no longer an issue. Delays in approvals have come down to about 20 from what I hear, they are more proactive in terms of their execution. That is credit to the honourable Prime Minister and his leadership that we have brought that down in terms of addressing that particular issue. This is why we are listening. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, immigration is a challenge. The two Deputy Prime Ministers have been working with the honourable Minister for Immigration at the moment and what we are trying to do, Sir, is bring about some transformative changes in the way we are doing processing in terms of work permits and the like. I am hopeful that, that will come through very quickly, we are giving ourselves till the end of the year and I hope that by then the experience and the ease with which we are getting our work permits done will be a lot more seamless and a good experience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this not because I am in charge of investment, but I say this in all sincerity. We are sitting on the edge of a major construction boom in this country. All that my Ministry and the stakeholders has to do is to unlock that potential. We have significant investment in the pipeline, there are about four major hotels about to be constructed, we are now seeing opportunities in the housing sector.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Unlock:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N.

(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, things are looking up.</p><p>Apart from that, one of the things that we have endeavoured to do is genuinely broaden up the Fijian economy. In other words, try to re-engineer the economic architecture in Fiji. When we say that, I talk about what Fiji Water is now doing with commercial agriculture in Fiji. I can confidently say, I have got two other large investors who have met us that are saying that they will also do commercial agriculture in Fiji. If that happens, Sir, we will have an opportunity to genuinely broaden out the economy of Fiji, particularly in economic agriculture. The hope is, Sir, that we will actually be able to reach down into the rural community and create supply chain and the change that comes through from our rural communities and create a stable income for all our people. I have talked about the Kava Bill, I am working very busily with the honourable Minister for Agriculture to bring forward the Kava Bill. Like I have said on numerous times here, it is a billion-dollar industry for our country. I cannot understand why the Kava Bill was not passed by the previous government, but that is okay, we will do it. By the end of this year, it will be done.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>1492</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of medicinal cannabis, I am happy to report that we are at the final stages of starting the legislative process. That, Sir, to me opens up another opportunity for our country, not only in terms of the medicinal cannabis, but the research into the nutraceutical industry. That has a big potential for Fiji. Just imagine, Sir, if we can commercialise things like some of our natural medicines and share it on the national stage.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Deliver:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Deliver:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, they are saying deliver, I am doing this in 18 months, they have done nothing about this in 16 years. I think in terms of the timeline, there is a bit of a disparity when it comes to timeline and execution. Let us not forget Google and also Starlink that is now here, and these are the types of things that create an environment that I believe suits Fiji well in the months and years to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these initiatives are not just about creating economic growth in the country, it is also part of ensuring that development in this country going forward is sustainable, inclusive and beneficial to all Fijians. We are on a promising path, and with continued collaboration and commitment, we will ensure that Fiji attracts significant investments and secures a position as a leading economy in the Pacific. Let us all work together towards a Fiji that is prosperous, has a stable future and of course, a sustainable future. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I only have five minutes, let me just quickly refer him to a World Bank Report on investment in Fiji. Just a line that comes out of it, this is something that is extremely important to create that particular investor climate and I quote: “Risks to the outlook including persistent out migration and skilled labour shortages, global commodity price shocks, and natural disasters. Structural reforms, economic diversification and fiscal consolidation are essential for building resilience, enhancing growth, and reducing poverty.” I hope he takes heed of what is being said there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what can we deliver to the investor? We have to have a ready-workforce but we are facing problems because of migration. I understand the work that has gone on with respect to the digital infrastructure that is going on, I commend him to ensuring that that has actually completed. These are some of the basic incentives that are needed to create a conducive environment. The creation of that investment climate, the one that is friendly and the one that is swift, is extremely important for Fiji. We all know that, Sir, we all want it to succeed. Incentivisation is not quite there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to bringing in more FTIs, especially for those industries that we are actually targeting. Training of our local workforce has to be relooked at. Most importantly, in the current state that we are in, one of the most important things that are actually being looked at is the volatility. There is a way that it is measured, volatility is actually measured. We have to look at how volatile we are. That volatility can be negatived or neutralised if we have something that we can say to the investor that says with confidence that there is one thing that you can rely on and be safe and that is the necessary legal framework that will protect them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our legal system also must be brought up the speed so that investors look at Fiji and not worry about it at all. At the moment, there are deficiencies, et cetera that need to looked</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1493 at importantly and these are the things that create a better investment climate, these are the things that larger companies from overseas look at. They will hold-off on the investment if they see anything dubious that is happening within those particular circles. One of the most important things that are actually looked at by any company that is going to come here is risk tolerance. They will look at that before they invest, they will look at that before they start any kind of investment. They also look at what kind of returns there are in terms of whatever objective to take, they also look at the kind of treatment that they are going to get, the kind of protection they get and I understand where the honourable Minister is coming from; all of these things are important. It is not something that is born today, it was born many years ago, so it is advise that has been given to us by IFC, World Bank, et cetera. It is not just this Government that has to deal with it, we have also had to do deal with it, but gradually it has been done and I must say, Sir, I am glad that the honourable Minister is taking heed of all of these and he will ensure that these particular things are actually dealt with properly in order for us to do it. In terms of business facilitation, the digital Government solutions I know he is looking at, that is also very important, but we must remember that we cannot look at digital solutions with respect to Government from a top-down approach, it must be looked at from the bottom-up approach. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a particular line that I want to quote, Sir, and it comes from the UN Trade and Development Secretary-General, her name is Rebeca Grynspan and I quote: “Investment is just not just about capital in-flows; it is about human potential (which we must look at), environmental stewardship (which he actually just spoke about, it is actually very important) and the enduring spirit of a more equitable and sustainable world.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not just very hollow words, that is very important to Fiji. We have actually ticked the boxes of quite are few of those things. I know the honourable Minister understands exactly what I am saying with respect to the ones that we have not. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Bank recently has supported us with a new package, we have got about US$95 million worth of support that is coming towards our budgetary support. What is more important, Sir, is we must also look at how much of that budget support goes towards creating this better investment climate. Mr. Speaker, I wish him well, it is for Fiji that it has to be done but there are so many other important things and that is just a brief from our side to say that please look at those things when we are actually doing them. MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to the Leader of the Group of 9 bloc or his designate. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the honourable Minister for Trade, I know it is not easy to respond given the two former Ministers for Trade, one has just given his response and also the current Minister for Trade, but I will try my best. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- I am not saying that I am going to be the future Minister for Trade but again Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Trade ….</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>1494</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- It is to do with trade, honourable Bulitavu. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Okay! MR. SPEAKER.- It is to do with trade, you cannot be a win-win situation all the time. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- It cannot be a win-win situation! (Laughter) The big terms that have been used by the honourable Ministers, but I will try to get it down to our understanding to those who will be listening on television. I thank the current honourable Minister for Trade and the Coalition Government for putting in place these investment facilities and committee. It is very important, given that it creates ease of doing business and also the processes that were there. Even the previous administration had also brought in the National Single Window System (NSWS), I think it is still available. It gives that opportunity for those investors. Most of the investors when they come to Fiji, they are somewhat turned back, given the red tapes that we have, but this particular committee will try to remove that and give confidence to potential investors that are coming in. The whole idea, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a way of how we can promote a positive image of Fiji as a profitable investment destination. At the same time also, the systems and processes in Fiji to be more efficient to those investors. Those are the two big links that Fiji needs in its investment policies that needs to be in place. I would like to thank Cabinet too for passing this significant Investment Policy framework given that it provides the guidelines for our local interest and what our interest will be in terms of sustainable development, friendly businesses and attracting those and providing for those investments in creating employment for our local people and the knowledge that they will gain from those who will be coming from overseas. Yesterday I responded to the honourable Minister for Education in terms of TSLS. There is also a provision of the new scholarship on micro grant. That particular policy is for areas where we have a shortage of labour and skills, that particular facility will also encourage competency-based training for our locals so that when these particular investments come in, they are able to fit in and are qualified for those particular jobs. Much has been said in terms of losing our brain-drain overseas, as alluded to by the honourable Koya, but again the Government can take on board something to this effect. It could put in a policy called the “brain drain gain” where we can bring back those in our diaspora overseas, attract them back to Fiji to further invest and provide back to their communities in various ways. We totally support the Government’s policy and the framework that has been announced by the honourable Minister for Trade and Investment this morning. We look forward to more investments coming to our country, creating more employment and also more developments in the various communities where natural resources and the various resources can be developed especially in areas where we can connect roads and other accessibilities so that the people can participate in the bigger economic spin and economic growth.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1495 MR.

The members of the Corpus Christi Teachers College you are also invited to join in with the honourable Members of Parliament. The Parliament adjourned at 12.43 p.m.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>1496</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. Update on Ministry’s Key Capital Programmes HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today to provide an update to this august Parliament on the work of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management in serving the citizens of our rural and remote areas across our beloved nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, the Ministry’s capital development project budget was increased to include the Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Development Programme and the Rural Housing Assistance Programme. These were for $2.5 million and $3 million respectively. Also, there was a budget of $0.5 million for the Seafaring Entrepreneurial Assistance (SEA) Subsidy. The existing programmes of addressing access to clean water and sanitation, new pilot roads, footbridges and footpaths, and economic empowerment for our rural people were maintained. Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Development Programme Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we invest in infrastructure, it helps connect people with opportunities, promotes economic growth, and improves livelihoods. Through the allocation of a $2.5million funding for the ROI Programme in the 2023-2024 Budget, the Ministry was able to implement a total of 50 projects across the country, focussing on three main sectors including agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors. Access to basic infrastructure is key to develop these sectors for farmers, markets, women, children, the senior citizens and those with special needs. The two focussed areas of support that were provided for the agriculture sector in the last financial year, include assistance intended for livestock farmers and the construction of rural farm access roads. The forestry sector is also supported under the Programme to strengthen the manufacturing of logs and mahogany waste, to enhance the key roles of wood carvers, and those operating in processing timber to make household furniture. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to update this august House on how the Ministry's ROI Programme has had an enormous impact and has also helped to transform the lives of our rural communities across Fiji for the better. In the Northern Division, 75.5 kilometres of rural farm access roads were constructed, connecting the interior of Macuata and Cakaudrove Provinces. The road construction, as I had mentioned during my reply to the honourable Minister of Finance’s Budget Address, cuts across three major different routes – the Kedra-Sese Road, the Nasasa to Valevoni Road, and a connecting road to Nubusoqosoqo. Communities in these regions used to walk more than 10 kilometres to reach the main road for transportation. More than 77,000 people reside in these two rural Provinces. In the Western Division, 16.9 kilometres of rural farm access roads were constructed, covering the highlands of Ba in Nadala, Ratalevu, Nadrau, Natawa, Navunitawa and Nasaucoko. The main rural farm access roads constructed in the Central Division were at Mau, Nakavika and Vunidavo in the Province of Namosi. For thousands and thousands of our rural Fijians, these investments are not just farm access roads, but a new lifeline, and a path to a better future. In the Eastern Division, the construction of Rural Farm Access Roads focussed on the island</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1497 of Ovalau kilommetres, covering the communities of Nasaumatua, Vuniivisau and Navuloa. the Lomaiviti Group, with infrastructural development spanning 5 the in Mr. Speaker, Sir, a key component of the ROI Programme is to promote and support value addition activities in the rural sector. This includes the provision of support for the processing of turmeric and ginger powder, cassava and dalo chips, and kava pounding machines in potential areas that have been identified. The procurement of 12 sets of food processing units is the initial step to provide equipment and resources to support value adding economic activities in the rural and outer islands. We do this in cooperation with other Ministries and other agencies, such as the Department of Co-operatives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support the forestry component of the ROI Programme, four portable sawmills were procured through the approval of the Government Tender Board. Under the Programme, the portable sawmill will support resource owners to log and process their own timber for rural housing and other value adding processes. The provision of these equipment is expected to assist the Ministry of Forestry’s logging and milling programmes in rural areas. The portable sawmills will also support the supply of materials and household furniture demanded by the growing rural households across the four Divisions. The Ministry has noted an increasing demand for wood processing machines for value adding activities, particularly from the islands of Kabara, Ogea and Namuka in the Lau Group. These maritime islands are renowned for their supply of wood-made souvenirs to most souvenir retail outlets in Fiji, and this has been considered in this new financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue to improve our ROI Programme, a new component of the Programme will be introduced in this new financial year. This new initiative includes the incubation of our ROI farmers and recipients for the next three to five years. This is crucial to ensure that the Government's rate of return on investments from these Farm Access Roads and the provision of value adding machineries are realised in the next three to five years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this incubation programme will include the close monitoring of their production plan for the next three to five years, facilitation of market access, training and awareness, especially on good governance, financial literacy, leadership, time management and changing mindset towards self-sufficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to measure the impact of the ROI Programme in the future, a baseline survey will be conducted in all our communities assisted under the Programme, to ensure that the programme objectives are realised as planned, particularly in the programme contribution towards addressing rural poverty, improve living standard and reducing rural-urban drift. Mr. Speaker Sir, given the ROI Programme's shift towards result-based development approach, some of our key development partners are now onboard to support the Ministry in this Programme and this is encouraging to note. Rural Housing Assistance Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rural Housing Assistance (RHA) Programme was re-introduced in the Ministry last year through the Coalition Government. The Ministry worked hard to get the necessary resources to deliver the expectations of the Government for our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the Ministry is working on completing the recruitment of all</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>1498</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 personnel, we are pleased to note that the Programme has been able to assist our rural families have access to affordable and safe shelter, whether in the form of full house construction, house completion or retrofitting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 12 months, over 160 applicants have been assisted. These were as follows: (1) Central Division 29 full houses constructed, four houses completed and four retrofitting. (2) Eastern Division 25 full houses constructed, additional five houses completed. (3) Northern Division 23 full houses constructed. (4) Western Division 12 full houses constructed, 12 applied for house completion and 54 applied for retrofitting, which were also completed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last month, I had the opportunity to witness the commissioning of four newly constructed houses in the village of Nadoria in Rewa by the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Minister for Public Works and the honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs. Those were houses that were initially destroyed in a massive fire in July 2023. It was immensely satisfying to personally witness the joy on the faces of the household members as they took ownership of their new dwellings. As we continue to improve our Rural Housing Assistance Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to note that the Ministry recently completed a site visit to New Zealand to physically inspect some of the new models of designing rural housing that will not only improve our rural housing resiliency with regards to cyclone certification due to the quality of materials and construction techniques, but also address fire risks and the impact of termite infestation in the country. The Ministry is also working closely with the Ministry of Housing and our development partners in improving our rural housing design. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also finalising a Memorandum of Association (MOA) with the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) and SOLE FINTECH in terms of supporting our rural dwellers to save and meet their one-third contribution for housing assistance. We are dedicated to ensuring that our people have access to resilient homes and feel safe in their environment. We are working on achieving targets associated with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 – access to sustainable communities. High Risk Water and Sanitation Mr. Speaker, Sir, in aligning to our global commitment to SDG6 on achieving clean water and sanitation, the Ministry remains dedicated to addressing high-risk water and related infrastructure needs. We are grateful to the Ministry of Finance for allocating $1 million, an increase of $0.2 million from the last financial year, to continue this initiative. Since the inception of the programme in the 2021-2022 financial year, the Ministry has implemented more that 70 projects across our rural and maritime communities, totalling $1.3 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had been installing Ecological Purification System recently in various communities across the country, as follows:</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1499 Central Division: 3 villages, benefitting 872 people. Eastern Division: 2 villages and 2 settlements, benefitting 1,047 people. Northern Division: 9 villages and 3 settlements, benefitting 690 people. • • • • Western Division: 15 villages, benefitting 676 people. Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to assist in the reduction of occurrence of diseases and access to better hygienic living conditions, the Ministry provided communities with better sanitation facilities in the following areas: • Central Division: 1 village and 2 settlements; • Eastern Division: 1 village, benefitting 16 families; • Northern Division: 2 villages and 1 settlement; and • Western Division: 3 villages, benefitting 12 families. Investment in Rural Infrastructure Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Government, we are responsible to make sure that our people are provided with good roads and necessary infrastructure, which will allow them access to so many other services to the world out there. With the budgetary allocation of $2 million, the Ministry utilises this for our CARFF Programme in terms of construction of new pilot access roads and construction of footbridges and footpaths where these are necessary to provide safe access to our rural people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the recent financial year alone, the Ministry was able to complete a total of over 50 projects, as follows: • • • Central Division Four new access roads, four repairs and upgrading of existing roads, 11 footpaths and footbridges which benefitted 18 villages and one settlement with a combined population of 4,559 people. Eastern Division One new access road, one repair and upgrading of existing road, six footpaths and footbridges which benefitted eight villages with a combined population of 1,182 members of the community. Northern Division Three new access roads, six repairs and upgrading of existing roads, one footpath and footbridge. These benefitted 5 villages and 5 settlements. • Western Division Two new access roads, 10 repairs and upgrading of existing roads, three footpaths and footbridges and two Irish Crossings. These benefitted seven villages and 10 settlements with a combined population of 6,350 members of the community. Searing Entrepreneurial Assistance (SEA) Programme Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial year 2023-2024 was the first year that the Ministry was allocated a budget for this Programme. With $0.5 million allocated, the Ministry was able to assist 39 applicants across the four Divisions: • Central Division Five boat and engines; one applicant applied only for boat and one applied only for engine.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>1500</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 • • This is under the one-third and two-third scheme. Eastern Division Six boats and engines, three only applied for the outboard engines. Northern Division Five boats and engines, one applied for a boat, three applied for only outboard engines. • Western Division Eight boats and engines and one only applied for boat and four for outboard engines. Empowering Rural Communities Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s Self-Help Programme is one that assist individuals or communities through partnership arrangement of Government, providing subsidy in the form of paying two-thirds of the project costs. In our first year in office, the Ministry has been able to assist over 50 communities across the country. The assistance was in the form of water projects, resource centres and income generating projects, such as bread ovens, bread mixing equipment, et cetera. These projects achieve several multiple objectives under the SDGs, namely, reduction in poverty, food security, access to clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, and decent work and economic growth. In the last 12 months, the Ministry was able to subsidise the following number of projects across the country: • • • Central Division Eight income generating projects, one resource centre, one community solar light project, one waiting shed and one evacuation centre retrofitting. These benefitted 10 villages and three settlements, with a combined population of 1,120. Eastern Division Seven income generating projects, seven water projects and two evacuation centre retrofitting projects which has benefitted 10 villages and one settlement, with a combined population of 1,475. Northern Division Seven water projects, three income generating projects and six evacuation centre retrofitting projects, which has benefitted six villages and six settlements, with a combined population of 1,329. • Western Division 12 water projects. These benefitted six villages and six settlements, with a combined population of 1,329. Resilient Rural Infrastructure Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue to invest towards resilient rural infrastructure, the Ministry is also now working with the Infrastructure and WASH sectors, to establish minimum standard designs that ensures sustainability and resilient rural infrastructure. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is determined to achieve its aspirations for inclusive development for productive and</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1501 resilient rural communities for an integrated manner. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate to make their response. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sir, unfortunately, honourable Vijay Nath is</p><h4>sick and I will respond to the Ministerial Statement.</h4><p>I wish to thank the honourable Minister for clearly highlighting the achievements of the Ministry. Most of these programmes are not new - the six capital projects, and I just wish to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement. I will respond in the same sequence that the honourable Minister delivered his Statement. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Rural and Outer Island (ROI) Programme, we are thankful that now, the Ministry has other options, particularly in addressing the needs out there in the rural communities. I have been listening to few of his previous statements and one of the concerns that I had was the focus on infrastructure, but of course infrastructure is needed as well because initially when ROI was with the Ministry of Agriculture, it was focussing on food security for our people in the rural islands and then, hopefully, graduating them into market-oriented farmers and fishermen, and then looking at other programmes in the other Ministries to pick up from the ROI Programme. But I am thankful for the various programmes and particularly, the inclusion of fisheries and forestry, because when ROI was with the Ministry of Agriculture, perhaps, it was more on the Ministry of Agriculture. The honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture would know this very well. We are thankful that now you are able to buy circular source, and of course, the value addition as well. So, that is very, very good to hear, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On rural housing, I wish to thank the Government for the increased allocation in rural housing. This is something that we have been raising as a Ministry previously because this is good for our resilience programme, particularly when we want to get our people out of the poverty cycle post- disasters. So, it is very, very important that this increased allocation is provided to the Ministry because it will help us in the long term, due to lessons learnt from TC Winston, TC Harold and TC Yasa as well. Some of our people in the rural areas just simply leave. The internal displacement was simply because years of hard work and investing in their homes was just lost within 24 hours or so, and that contributed to the shift. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on high-risk water and sanitation, I just wish to perhaps remind the honourable Minister that this programme he will need to work very closely with the Ministry of Health because this is particularly on the high-risk areas where there is typhoid and other water- related diseases. We have hotspots identified by the Ministry of Health. On Self-Help, perhaps the only comment, honourable Minister, Sir, looking at both budgets, I think I had raised this. Previously, because Multi-Ethnic is back now, the same allocation is also provided with Multi-Ethnic Affairs. So, hopefully in the next budget, we will also have that allocation of $1 million or whatever the amount is available with the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs as well because of the diverse needs out there in the communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the other two programmes – Seafaring and CARFF as well as Self-Help, these are important, but I think going back to my address in the Budget response, we need to focus now on the outcomes. It is good that we are spending the money. Honourable Minister, you had</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1502</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 stated so many times in your previous addresses about taking out people away from the culture of dependence so that they can be sufficient and be able to sustain themselves. This is why the monitoring is so important, so that we can be more focused on the outcomes rather than the outputs which we are delivering, and you have correctly stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think that is very, very important for us in terms of the way forward, and documents such as the Household Income and Expenditure Survey Report and also previous Poverty Reports will help the Ministry in concentrating in the critical areas and in the geographical regions as well, so that we can be more surgical in the way we do rural development. MR. SPEAKER.- May I now call on the Leader of the Group of 9 bloc or his designate. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. Firstly, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the update and the insightful statement. Vinaka vakalevu Turaga Minisita. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need to improve the quality of life for the rural population cannot be overstated. The $9.8 million used on the project as mentioned by the honourable Minister on the six capital programmes is more than a figure. I look at it as a commitment towards equitable development and equitable access to opportunities to all Fijians, a point that was highlighted by His Excellency the President in the Opening of Parliament this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, the programme impacted the lives of around 390,000 people; that is inclusive development. I want to sincerely thank the Government for serving our rural and maritime communities diligently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is encouraging to see that the Government continues to place emphasis on rural housing programme with a new phase, community access roads and the water sanitation programme. I know these are the touching areas with our rural people, and I call on the honourable Minister to ensure all rural communities are assisted. Perhaps at this point, I appeal to the honourable Minister to visit some villages and settlements such as Valewaqa, Tacilevu, Cakaudrove, Nautoloulou, Wainunu, Bua, Nukubolu and Naikawaga, Koroalau, Cakaudrove, the villages in Matuku in Lau and the Uluisavudua community in Sawani, Naitasiri. There are some issues and concerns on their drinking water and access roads. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I want to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I do wish him well and his entire team in the execution of the programmes and upcoming projects planned in the 2024-2025 Financial Year. HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order! MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.</p><h4>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 40 on Ministerial Statements where</h4><p>it says and I quote: “A Minister who wishes to make a statement on a public matter of national importance …” For this particular Ministerial Statement, Sir, I do not think this is really a matter of national importance right now, but I think the statement being made is to avoid being asked the question which is Question No. 126/2024. I think a lot of statements that have been taking place so far are the</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1503 issues that are urgent, national importance. This particular topic, Sir, I would suggest, is not of that nature.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMNET MEMBERS.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> And also at the same time, honourable Usamate, like previously done. When a Statement is made, the questions that we have usually takes care of it. So the question is not raised. It will be a similar one too on this particular case. After she makes her Statement, that takes care of the question that has been proposed here. We used to do that in the past and I hope we will continue doing that; whether it is a matter of national importance, these are the rights of the Ministers. For sure all that they are trying to raise in their Ministerial Statements are of importance to them in their role and to the people that they look after. I hope we can just continue and let us hear her out, but at the same time, as you have alluded to, that will take care of Oral Question No. 126/2024. Fish Cage Culture System HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the honourable Member that this issue or this subject is also important not only for the Ministry, but for the nation as a whole. I know it has been talked about since the Budget Debate, so I am just here to clarify some of the issues and views that the honourable Members on the other side have. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, ni sa yadra vinaka. This afternoon I am pleased to deliver a Statement on the Fish Cage Culture System that are currently being practiced around the world and the challenges we face in the development of this concept in Fiji. Fish Cage Culture of farming involves culturing fish in a captive environment where free exchange of water can take place. The cage has five sides, the bottom, and the four vertical sides are enclosed with nets. These nets are suspended in the water column with a flotation system around the perimeter. Pen Culture is similar to cage culture but with an open bottom allowing direct contact with the water body. We are more familiar with pond culture which involves rearing fish in an artificially constructed pond, where water is maintained in an enclosed area mainly on land and coastal areas and this is currently being practised in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these fish culture structures are globally used including the Pacific Island countries that have ventured into finfish aquaculture and mariculture. As global fishery resources are harvested at an accelerating rate due to technological advancement in harvesting gear, culture systems have been proposed as innovative solutions to counter over-fishing. Increasing pressure on marine finfish resources driven by global and domestic demand encourages many Pacific Island countries to venture into aquaculture of several candidate fish species. The following candidate fish species have been trialled and cultured on a low scale in some Pacific Island countries including Fiji: (1) Milk fish or Yawa – In Kiribati, a hatchery was constructed and sea cage trials were constructed in support from Taiwan and now China. The Government of Tuvalu also conducted fry collection and sea cage trials with support from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The Government of Nauru conducted fry collection and recirculating aquaculture system on land culture with the European Union (EU) support.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1504</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Fiji was also part of this development, conducting fry collection and pond culture in Vitawa, Ra which was destroyed by Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016. Currently, the Ministry of Fisheries is conducting pond culture of milk fish at Caboni Research Station in Ra. (2) Rabbit fish or Nuqa – The government of New Caledonia constructed a hatchery and sea cage culture processing and marketing. The government of Solomon Islands initially trialled fry collection and cage culture. The Ministry of Fisheries is currently undertaking pond culture and broodstock management for natural spawning in a hatchery at Caboni in Ra. This was also trialled in fry collection and pond culture in Raviravi, Ba in the 1970s. Mr. Speaker, Sir, other species currently trialled by our Pacific Island partners include Pacific threat fish, red emperor and yellow kingfish. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fish Cage Culture Research Project previously known as the Makogai Development Project was budgeted for in the 2021-2022 fiscal year. It focuses on diversifying from giant clam culture to culturing candidate fish species such as king fish, coral trout, grouper and rabbit fish in collaboration with local and overseas partners and institutions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, discussions with the South Pacific community were conducted to undertake a preliminary assessment of the economic feasibility of marine fish farming in Fiji and to identify candidate species for culture. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sea and lagoon areas along Makogai Island provide an important and suitable site for fish cage culture. However, the main drawback is the lack of proper modern hatchery and laboratory facilities to undertake finfish culture on the island, along with the need for reliable power supply to operate the hatchery and aquaculture work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020 a request was made to the government of Koren through the Korean Embassy for the development of Makogai Island Research Station. Discussions are currently underway and the Ministry will report back to this august House on the implementation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s aquaculture sector has the potential and demand to grow further due to the rise in global demand for seafood and the over expectation of coastal fisheries resources. The main challenge for marine fish farming in Fiji is the unavailability of the high cost of feed. This is the most significant economic and logistical challenge to be managed for marine fish farming in Fiji. There is a need for more research on feed quality and the development of low cost feed with high nutritional value. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sea Cage Culture Project for milk fish were trialled in Tuvalu with the support from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In one production cycle, which is about 160 days, they were able to produce 3.2 tonnes of fish with a total operating cost of US$72,168. Mr. Speaker, Sir, other adverse factors contributing to the difficulty of establishing cage culture in Fiji include the threat of diseases that vary among candidate fish species. Fiji’s geographical position being cyclone prone also hinders the progress in this aspect of fisheries development due to frequent adverse weather conditions and natural disasters that may destroy the significant investments in marine fish cage culture. Mr. Speaker, despite these challenges, the Ministry of Fisheries is optimistic about the future of cage culture in Fiji. Fiji has potential sites for Fin Fish Sea Cage Culture. Mr. Speaker, it should be noted that fish cage culture in Fiji has several vital aspects that needs to be addressed.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1505 (1) The improvement of hatcheries and laboratories facilities; (2) The establishment of smart partnership with regional and international partners to share ideas and best practices through the South-South Cooperation; (3) Specialised training and internship for staff on feed formulation, hatchery and brood management; (4) Encouragement of investors to invest in aquaculture with noted interest with some potential investors requiring further dialogue; and (5) Research and further development of candidate fish species proudly noting that the Caboni Research Station in Ra successfully produced Rabbitfish in the last fiscal year which was stocked at the Vitawa Aquaculture Farm in Vitawa, Ra. Mr. Speaker, the additional budgetary allocation of $400,000 for the Fiji Cage Culture Research Project is for the establishment of a solar farm at Makogai Research Station. This project will provide consistent power supply for the water pumps and aerators needed for the proposed cage culture species. Makogai Research Station is situated in the bay of the mainland therefore simplifying the monitoring of assets. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of work to be done but the Ministry is determined to deliver what is expected. It will ensure the proper fundamentals are set to support these projects, ensuring its longevity and effectiveness in relieving pressure on our depleted fish stocks. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for her address on cage farming and how the Ministry is addressing this. Mr. Speaker, cage farming is something that has been talked about and there has been a lot of discussion over the years. I think the advantages of cage farming are obvious but she has articulated very well the various challenges that are faced in terms of cage farming; the issues of hatcheries, diseases, proclivity of cyclones that we have in our part of the world and the danger that this has on the cages and the people that have to manage it and also the lack of skills available to be able to manage this. As the honourable Minister has pointed out, this has been going on at Makogai for clams but now they are going into fish and I am glad to hear some of the successes that have happened in the past. The Yawa fish in Vitawa which has cultivated in ponds and also the Nuqa in Caboni. So, there has been some success. I think the big challenge for us in terms of fisheries and a lot of these things, is the ability to take it from research and to make it actually exist where it needs to be done. We are talking about fish, you are talking about anything else. A lot of time is spent in research but you are not able to get to that particular stage to move from the research phase into the extension phase. She has articulated a lot of the challenges. It has been ongoing for a long time. I know that we have in the past here in Fiji, there has been a lot of talks about cage fishing in various place. They always talk about it, for instance, in that pond that you have up in Deuba, the reservoir that you have, there was talk about doing it there in terms of cage fishing and ponds. There has been talk about doing it in places like Monasavu. They can put the cages in on other places of that sort. There is another place that I had here. I cannot remember what the third one was. Also, in Dreketi where we do the rice farming. You have the lake the possibility of doing that in that particular area. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the other advantage of doing cage farming, if you are able to get there is that in some other parts of the world where they have this cage farming of fish, it also has infection to other areas. When you have the fish in the cage farming when they spawn and the eggs</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>1506</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 go out, the fish itself is captured and harvested but the offspring can spread the thousands of eggs, it can be used, it can cover that whole area. So, that also gives fish supply to people who live in that particular vicinity of the area. In other part of the world where you cage farming of fish, it is also an opportunity for tourism. Tourists can come to pay to come and feed the fish or watch the fish where it is in the water, so, there is a whole lot of things that is here. I know that the Ministry has a lot of challenges in retaining its staff. But one of the things that I always mention is the importance of execution. When the Deputy Prime Minister was taking about all his plans, I was saying they are very good plans but the important thing for us is it to execute - not to execute to chop the head, to execute the implementation to be able to deliver things. Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, when the President of India was here, there was a lot of things that was not executed well by that Ministry. There was no invitation for the Leader of Opposition. When she sat down for the kava ceremony, they did not give one Vadawa for her. They did not have a Vada -very small things, but they mean a lot. They gave the wrong kind of fan, the fan that you put on the wall. That is poor execution. Good plans - poor execution. We had poor execution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the bringing of Bills into this House. The Heritage Bill had so many flaws - poor execution. They put a Bill here that is still not been able to come back into Parliament because we have so many problems with it. The requirement for us in Ministries, you have your big plans, you have to have the right people on board, you have to have the right processes and you must have good management of all those processes. If not, you have your big plans and I will tell you, you will produce nothing because you are note executing well. You must have your plans, you must have you outputs and outcomes and you have the right people in leadership. If you have the wrong people in leadership, the wrong person driving the bus, the bus will end up in the wrong place. Have the right people in, make sure that you can execute so you can deliver for the people of this country. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Usamate, that is a lively one. Let us hope we will board the right bus and we get off at the right place. (Laughter) Before I offer the floor to the leader of the Group of 9, I just share a story on this cage farming. So much interest has gone into it. I did put a request to honourable Koroilavesau when he was the Minister of Fisheries sometimes back, if you could bring in some giant clams to be raised in my shoreline in the village of Somosomo. He arranged the bringing over of the giant clams – it was in boxes or cages. So, we had two big cages, one near to the end of the village of Somosomo which is known as Lamini and another one near the hotel. This is to ensure that it could become a major tourist attraction because we do not have any more giant clams in my village, so we had it there. After a couple of months, I visited the village and I went down to Welagi. I met the ladies in the village. They asked me, “where are you going, Sir?” I want to see this cage that we have put here. So, they never uttered a word, they remained silent. Automatically, I knew something was wrong.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1507 When I went there, I could not find any cage, only the bottom of the ocean. I turned around, I saw the ladies there. I said, “Looks like this thing has disappeared.” They never said a word. I said, “Did it taste good?”. The immediate reaction, “Oh, very nice, Sir.” So, the villagers did not have a clue as to what we are trying to do there with this cage. They need to be properly led and properly taught that the giant clams takes a while before it reaches that big giant clam. The other cage that was placed near the hotel, when I visited the site, the same thing - there was no cage there. When I asked the people working in the hotel. They said, “No, it did not grow well here because of the noise of the outboard going up and down. It affected its growth.” I asked, “Was it good?” They said, “Yes, it tasted nice.” (Laughter) So, they ate that. This is again what this new development brings to us in the village, especially for my village in Somosomo, the population has really grown. Even seaweed, the lumi boso, lumi cevata, et cetera, they have disappeared because it is an ongoing thing. Day in and day out, the women are there in the sea to sustain their livelihood. It is our negligence, so to speak, that we are causing all these problems now. I think you better bring some of us to feed on before we start raising these things. I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate to make their contribution. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just add on to the story that you have shared with us. Aquaculture whether it is mariculture, brackishwater culture or even freshwater culture, is an important direction for Fiji. I think it is a direction that the world is taking as we try and ensure that the wild stock of our fisheries is sustained and that our future generation also enjoy what we are enjoying now, to help to regulate the wild stock that we have. There is an important point when we talk about aquaculture. One of the natural spawning places for fishes are mangroves. As we balance between development and keeping our mangroves, when we remove our mangroves, we remove the spawning ecosystem for most of the fish that we catch out in our reefs. So, it is worth also looking at preserving the mangroves that we have. As the story, Mr. Speaker mentioned, aquaculture is not only for finfish but also for non- finfish. I know that in collaboration with James Cook University, the Ministry of Fisheries way back then I was there, looked at sand fish ( dairo ) in Wailevu, Cakaudrove, we hatched them in the hatchery and just take them back to their natural environment which was quite a successful programme. The products that we raised out of fish where we call it cage culture, it is used also to reseed the reefs that are baren or even ecosystems that are running out of fish that we enjoy. So, it is not only for consumption, but it is also to ensure that our ecosystems are revived so that they can last into the future. I also would just like to add to that, perhaps, we should look at the bigger cage fish farming, as you have explained, honourable Minister and see how we can farm perhaps, archipelagic fish which are quite the high-end market of fish and maybe in there would be a niche market, but I thank the Ministry for Fisheries for pursuing this aquaculture direction. It is very good for Fiji for sustainability of our resources and also a source of income for those who are into pond culture for tilapia and prawns, and I wish the Ministry well in its drive towards aquaculture. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Members, please, take note that Oral Question No. 126/2024 on today’s Order Paper will be dropped, as the statement made by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is well enough to take care of that question.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>1508</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024</p></body>
