<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Critical Shortage of Dental Hygienists (Question No. 124/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on the strategies to resolve the critical shortage of Dental Hygienists in public hospitals? HON. DR. RATU. A. R. LALABALAVU. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, in answering the question, allow me to please elaborate on why the critical shortage and the strategies the Ministry is undertaking to address the critical shortages. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Dental Assistants and Dental Hygienists posts and responsibilities are almost the same, it is a one year course dental hygienists. Dental Assistant and Dental Hygienists is a two-year programme. Prior to 1998, there were Junior Dental Assistants graduating from Fiji School of Medicine (FSM) back then with Certificate in Dental Assistant which is a one-year programme and very few Dental Hygienists in Fiji, then, with the total number less than ten while Junior Dental Assistants dominated the dental workforce. In 1998, six month bridging course was developed by FSM engaging dental staff from the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. These all upgrade into junior Dental Assistant in the public hospitals. These junior dental assistants were all upgraded to Dental Hygienists graduating with a Certificate in Dental Hygienist at the end of 1998. Dental hygienists then performed the duty of both, junior dental assistants as well as dental hygienists. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2018, the last batch of dental hygienists graduated from the Fiji National University and the programme ceased from continuing. The reason for ceasing was that there were not many interested in the Dental Hygienist programme and most high school leavers opted for Dental course to become full Dentists or Dental Officers and then the FNU introduced the new enrolment system where all school leavers offers to undertake Bachelor in Dental Surgery programme to undergo the first two years together with those attaining high marks at the end of the second year proceeding to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery programme with a total of five years training to become fully-fledged Dental Officers. Due to the shortage in dental hygienists in Fiji, the government in 2014 offered 20 scholarships, with fourteen being enrolled at FNU and 7 completed the course and graduating after two years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2022, Fiji National University has commenced training of dental assistants in a one-year programme. So, at the moment the total establishment for Dental Hygienists is 80, total filled is 27, temporary vacant is three and vacant post is 50. In answering the strategies, the Ministry is re-engaging dental hygienists retiring at 55, re- employing dental hygienists not vaccinated, re-engaging dental hygienists over 60 but who are certified medically fit, and we are working with our own Human Resource Department and their submission will be made with regards to the strategies in the next few months. Nevertheless, we are being active in those initiatives that I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1509 In terms of there are also plans in creation of the Dental Assistant posts within the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and they will perform duties, roles and responsibilities of Dental Assistants currently undertaken by Dental Hygienists in the public hospitals. So, in a nutshell, FNU has ceased the programme and the Ministry is strategizing how it will cater for the current vacancy as it is. Like I mentioned, re-hiring 55 and above, ensuring that those who were not vaccinated get hired back and ensure that those over 60 who are still medically fit are hired on a contractual basis. Update on Public Service Broadcasting Grant (Question No. 125/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs update Parliament on the Public Service Broadcasting Grant? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before it was brought up as part of our Cabinet recommendation to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, I took a paper up to Cabinet and the release made after that Cabinet meeting said this, and I quote: “To ensure fairness and a level playing field in the Media Industry, the Cabinet has agreed to open up Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) Grant to all the media organisations other than the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation. The Prime Minister said, the People’s Coalition Government intends to engage other service providers to ensure a wider reach on issues of public interest and fair competition in the Media Industry. In the past, the Government had exclusively engaged Fijian Broadcasting Corporation to provide public service broadcasting through radio and TV.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question, I thank the honourable Member for allowing me to elaborate on this issue. Prior to financial year 2023-2024, Government had exclusively engaged Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) to provide public service broadcasting through radio and television at an annual cost of $10.4 million, with the intention to inform and educate the Fijian public. In accordance with the previous PSB contract, a sum of $6,677,400 (VAT exclusive) per year was paid to FBC as fees for producing PSB radio programmes, and operating and maintaining two PSB radio stations, including the AM services. The FBC also paid a fee of $4,600,000, also VAT exclusive, to produce, procure and broadcast an extensive range of PSB TV programmes and for the operation of a brand new non- commercial PSB TV channel - FBC 2. In essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fee under PSB contract is paid to FBC for the production, broadcast and transmission of Pacific local radio and TV programmes that are of benefit to all the people of Fiji. From August 2023 onwards, after considerable deliberation and assessment, the Coalition Government and the new FBCL Board, appointed on 11 th January, 2023, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics proposed a 44 percent reduction in PSB fees to radio and television with the reduced contract price. The contract came into effect from August 2023.</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 The new allocation for the Public Service Broadcast Grant is a total of $7,206,407, inclusive of VAT, for a term of three years from 1 st August, 2023 to 31 st July, 2026. The PSB TV - $2,599,001 (VIP) and PSB Radio - $4,670,406 (VAT Inclusive) with a total of $7,206,407. The main objective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of this decision was to reduce FBC’s reliance on the PSB fees and to build a self- sustaining business as the country’s national broadcaster. This has been done without any disruption to the current operations of the organisation and its people and are now working hard to become more self- sustaining and to operate as a commercially driven organisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that I highlight the allocation that the Government has made for the 2024-2025 Financial Year for Public Service Broadcast (TV and Radio). This is reflected under Head 50 (if you still have your blue book around). You will see that on Page No. 284 - Head 50 – Miscellaneous Services, SEG 5 – Public Service Broadcast (TV) - $3,766.7 million; Public Service Broadcast (Radio) - $6,677,400. So, that is the total of $10.4 million (VAT exclusive) for both PSB Radio ($6.67 million) and PSB TV ($3.76 million). Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet on 15th July, 2024 approved that while $10.4 million will be maintained for Public Service Grant Broadcasting, $6.2 million (VAT exclusive) will be utilised for the engagement of FBC while $4.2 million will be utilised to engage other media service providers. The Government will conduct the required tender process through an Expression of Interest and public tender for the provision of public broadcasting services. In the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government had exclusively engaged FBC to provide Public Service Broadcasting for radio and TV. To ensure fairness and a level playing field, it was stated in the Cabinet Release after the Cabinet meeting, the Government intends to engage other service providers to ensure a wider reach on issues of public interest and fair competition in the media industry. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his elaboration on the Public Service Broadcast Grant. I am just interested to know if there is an allocation already of $6.6 million for FBC and the other is $4 million? Do you pre-determine what is going to FBC and what will be tendered? I am interested because the issue of AM Radio stations which go out into the islands. Is that just given to FBC or is that something that is open for tender amongst all the other radio stations? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, your assumption is correct. That amount to FBC and the rest is opened to tender. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has just alluded to that they want to open up, especially in times of disaster. We know the FBC has the AM station and the reach. So, my question here is, most of our people depend on FBC because of its AM transmitter for information during disaster. With the other service providers, do they have the reach or the capability to provide this service during times of disaster? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ongoing discussions with the Ministry of Regional Development and Disaster Management, I have also taken into account those emergency needs at the time of emergency. At the moment, we have ongoing discussions with some of our aid development partners who will enhance our capabilities in those areas. Whether we will continue to rely on the AM or FM or other frequencies and other systems of broadcasting and telecasting, that will come up in the discussions that are ongoing at the moment. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe I ask the honourable Prime Minister to direct the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communication to look at the Walesi issue because that will help the coverage in the remote islands as well. My question to the honourable Prime Minister is on the Ministry’s specific programmes. I will use Ministry of Agriculture because</p><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1511 they have a Department of Information in the Ministry in terms of the dissemination of information. One of the earlier discussions was the use of FBC, for example, for dalo diseases et cetera, but the charges they give is so high. Is this part of the consideration later on, on Ministries specific programmes to be included rather than just the normal broadcasting that we do? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has now been brought to my attention and I intend to do something about that and make it more useable for those in difficulties. MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communications would like to add to that. It is the high cost for Walesi, it should be free. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not too sure what the honourable Leader of the Opposition is alluding to, but, in terms of the cost of Walesi, once you hook up there is no cost involved. I guess he is referring to the coverage issue. That has been packaged as part of the full review of Walesi at the moment, and I am hoping to bring that to Parliament in September or the sitting after that. I know that they had some coverage issues, I am aware of that, Sir, and we are trying to incorporate that as well, as part of the holistic look at Walesi. Just to add on, Sir, the Walesi going forward is going to be a very professionally-run organisation. We now have a Board that has Taito Tabaleka as its Chair. He is probably the foremost authority on telecommunications in Fiji. I am not sure what they had before, but it is nothing like the calibre of the Board that is there now. I think the assurance in terms of execution to the Opposition, is the execution will be far better going forward. MR. SPEAKER.- We encountered that here and we looked at the streamlining of this and we are hooked up to Walesi and it should be a free to air service, but they were charging our Parliament a really big sum of money. It was in the hundreds of thousands. Every year, Parliament pays them for that service to get this streamlined into their system out into the whole of Fiji. That was Radio Fiji at that time, but luckily that has been stopped by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister coming in and having discussions with both sides. MOU on Defence Pacific Air Programme (Question No. 127/2024) HON. I. S VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between Fiji and Australia on the Defence Pacific Air Programme? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Iliesa Vanawalu for his question on the Memorandum of Understanding between Fiji and Australia on a Defence Pacific Air Programme (DPAP). Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this moment, I would like to begin by expressing our gratitude to the Government of Australia for the support they have provided to Fiji through the Defence Pacific Air Programme. This exemplifies the cooperation that we share under the renewed Vuvale Partnership in the areas of defence and security and the strong bonds between our two nations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to update Parliament that on 27th July 2024, the Government of Fiji signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Australia on the Defence Pacific Air Programme. The MOU provides the overarching governance framework that</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 will facilitate the rotation of the Australian C-27 Aircraft in Fiji. Under the programme. our counterpart the Australian Department of Defence will operate on a rotational basis a C-27 Aircraft within Fiji. The aircraft undertakes a whole range of taskings that are requested by the different government ministries. The aircraft provides support in areas that includes, protecting Fiji’s maritime domain, delivering government services in remote areas, and supporting humanitarian assistance and disaster responses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the success of the Defence Pacific Air Programme is due to the efficient coordination of its operations across government. It is truly a whole of government exercise coordinated through my Ministry. This year a total of 12 government agencies have utilised the aircraft to support their activities. These includes the Ministry of Health and Medical Services likewise the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the C-27 has successfully completed three rotations in Fiji with its inception flight in February this year, with the second flight in April and the third in June. Under the programme, there were over 36 flights to areas such as Rotuma, Labasa, Savusavu and also to Nadi. Through these flights, over 200 Government officials and members of the Disciplined Forces have been transported throughout Fiji to deliver critical services to the communities. Key activities includes: (1) providing emergency medical care; (2) maintenance and repairs to our schools and hospitals; plus (3) engineering assessment of our critical infrastructures to ensure Fijians remain safe. Furthermore, our Military Forces has been able to resupply its remote bases, establish communication links, conduct search and rescue exercises and undertake community engagements. Moreover, five maritime aerial patrols have been conducted for the surveillance of our vast Exclusive Economic Zone and disrupt illegal fishing, identify suspect vessels and respond to maritime hazards and pollution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, most importantly the Defence Pacific Air Programme has assisted the Government in accessing some of the remote areas of Fiji, delivering water tanks, school supplies, communication equipment and training activities to Rotuma. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform this august House that the fourth rotation commenced on Monday, 5 th August and is scheduled to conclude on 17th August. So, the plane is in Nausori right now. This morning the aircraft transported the Ministry of Education and Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji personnel to Rotuma. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight that the rotation present valuable learning and development opportunities for Fijian Government personnel. This rotation enables our personnel to gain diverse experiences, broaden their skills and contribute to their overall professional growth and effectiveness in serving our nation. We will carefully assess the results and the findings from each rotation to inform the Ministry future considerations aimed at strengthening and advancing our potential future air capabilities. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I wish to emphasise that this august House, security continues to be a top priority for the Fijian Government. We are committed to working closely with our development partners such as the Government of Australia to enhance a defence capabilities and maritime security.</p><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1513 HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Just a supplementary question. How do the Ministries access that flight? Do they come to the Ministry of Home Affairs to request or what is the process? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr, Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Yes, you are right. We are only the coordinating centre. The schedule goes out to all the Ministries in terms of the time available that the aircraft will be here. It is two weeks in every two months. It is up to them to give us a list of tasking that they want to use the aircraft for. So, it is operated by the Australians but it is for us to decide the missions to which the aircraft flies. HON. S. KUMAR.- Just a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. What form of air assistance do we get from our partners in the event of disaster in Fiji? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, our defence partners are many, Australia is just one of them, New Zealand is another and France also. In the emergencies of the past, the closer countries that are closer to Fiji would normally provide air support to us whether it be in strategic lift or just normal cargo and people transportation. So, countries like Australia would normally provide a C130 Aircraft. In this case they are providing us with C27 which is a slightly smaller aircraft which can land in much smaller airfields and New Zealand also does. They also have surveillance aircrafts that do surveillance of our maritime zone so they do a survey as well after the times of disaster. Not only but they also have rotary-wings too. So, in the past there have been helicopters that they provide to Fiji from the Royal New Zealand Airforce by the same token as well. The Americans have been here with their Seahawks and Black Hawks and the Australians too. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- My question to the honourable Minister is, how many passengers can travel on this aircraft and whether it can carry cargo? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, this particular aircraft that we have can carry 40 passengers. Of course it can carry a small vehicle like land rover. It can carry a bit of cargo too. If it carries both there is a limitation in terms of how much of which it can take but no cargo 40 people can travel. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, I am not too familiar with the technicalities of the aircraft but there was an exercise that we also had done with the Australians was the status of all our airfields in Fiji. I remember Australia used to have the creamer which is a short take of aircraft and particularly during emergencies. So, I am not sure whether that programme will continue now because of the aircraft that is already in place given that the remote islands needs to be serviced as well, the status of our airfields in the rural areas which the survey has already been undertaken by Australia? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for that question. He is right. Towards the end of the term of the last Government when the honourable Member was Minister for Defence, Government had commissioned the Royal Australian Air Force to conduct a study of the capabilities of all of our landing strips. That study has been completed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have the report. On 26 th May, 2024, under Cabinet Decision 219/2023, Cabinet had endorsed this decision to develop our air capability for Fiji, based on that study that had already been made. Now, Cabinet had already said, ‘yes’, but in the interim before this study is going to be put into place, because that was the study made by the Australians. We have to decide what we need, and we will need experts both from locals and the Australians to help us decide on the kind of air capability that we need. I hope you understand that.</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Right now, we do not have any determination on the kind of aircraft we have, you mentioned Caribou, so Caribou has been replaced by the C-27. It is a short landing and short take-off aircraft. So, you could say that the C-27 is the kind of aircraft that we need in Fiji. That depends if we do need the fixed-wing air capability, but it is actually quite a good aircraft. But until that study is completed, we will not make any determinations in terms of what Government actually needs for its purpose. Government is also thinking that what is the best way to support these capabilities once they come to us. Because if you remember in the past, RFMF had two helicopters and they were the only aircrafts that belongs to the State at that time. So, we need to decide in terms of what we have in Fiji, integrate that with what the Australians might want to offer us in terms of capability and decide what we need in terms of rotary or fixed-wing aircrafts that we could use. But that is already on Government’s pipeline, I want to assure Parliament in that regard. In the interim, before this comes online, Government had decided that it would seek Australia’s assistance under the Vuvale Partnership. So, I have written to the Australian Minister for Defence – honourable Richard Marles, and he had agreed to send this aircraft in the interim for us to use. But in the long term, we will need to finish this study and decide for us the kind of air platforms we need that will get the greatest reach in the way that our islands are spread within our maritime group. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is on drugs trafficking and its getting more complex, more sophisticated nowadays and most of these are done under water. I am just wondering if part of this arrangement and the capability of this service to track those. I know that they use technology, GPS, et cetera, below the sea, could it be part of that? I know most of the drugs coming into Fiji are transported under water. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not quite aware that they are using submarines to comes to Fiji but jokes aside, I think honourable Naupoto will inform honourable Tuinaceva that in the maritime capability, there are these capabilities of detecting what is in the water from the air. That is available, that is not being used in this particular aircraft, except that it also has the capability to do that, if you want it to do that. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just a bit of housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion</p></body>
