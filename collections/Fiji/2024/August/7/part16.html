<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT-SUGAR INDUSTRY TRIBUNAL 2016 TO 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT- SUGAR INDUSTRY TRIBUNAL 2016 TO 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry and Tribunal 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 12 th July, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><h4>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to present the overview of the Sugar</h4><p>Industry Tribunal 2016 to 2020 Annual Reports. The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is extremely thankful to the Ministry of Sugar for submitting the responses to the tabled Consolidated Review Report. The Sugar Industry Tribunal (SIT) serves several and crucial purposes within the Fiji Sugar Industry. This includes: (a) Dispute resolution – the Tribunal mediation resolves disputes between the Fiji Sugar Corporation and cane farmers. (b) Setting standards – the Tribunal establishes standards for mutual rights and obligations between FSC and farmers. (c) Conciliation - it encourages conciliation between various parties. While reviewing the SIT reports, the Committee recommended that the Tribunal has failed to meet its obligation to provide up to-date annual reports. The Committee has found that SIT is performing basic tasks and responsibilities that could be handled much more effectively by the Ministry of Sugar. The SIT should be disbanded and the Ministry of Sugar takes the responsibility to appoint a Tribunal. From the discussions the Committee has had with the Ministry of Sugar, the Committee is confident that the Ministry has the capacity and the expertise to effectively manage Tribunal functions related to sugar industry. This will optimise the resource utilisation considering the industry is insolvent. The review of SIT 2016 to 2020 reports revealed the lack of a centralised database accessible to all institutions in the sugar sector, which is causing confusion amongst the stakeholders. The Committee reviewed the annual reports and is deeply concerned about the various issues that has been identified. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have the list of speakers in front of me provided by the Whips: (1) Honourable J. N. Nand; (2) Honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic and Sugar Industry; (3) Honourable P. D. Kumar; and (4) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House. The Sugar Industry Tribunal was established under the Sugar Industry Act 1984. The function of the Tribunal are prescribed in sections 21, 22 and 26 of the Act. The Sugar Industry Tribunal serves various crucial purposes within the Fijian sugar industry. These include:</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 1530 (1) Dispute Resolution: The Tribunal mediates and resolves disputes between the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) and cane farmers. It ensures fair treatment and adherence to contractual obligations. (2) Setting Standards: The Tribunal establishes standards for mutual rights and obligations between the FSC and farmers. This helps maintain transparency and consistency. (3) Efficiency Promotion: By advising the Minister for Sugar on industry objectives, the Tribunal contributes to improving overall industry efficiency. (4) Conciliation: It encourages conciliation between parties, aiming to prevent prolonged conflicts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the recommendations is that the SIT to be disbanded and the Ministry of Sugar takes the responsibility to appoint the Tribunal. From the discussion the Committee had with the Ministry of Sugar, the Committee is confident that the Ministry has the capacity and the expertise to effectively manage Tribunal functions related to the sugar industry. This will optimize resource utilization, considering that the industry is insolvent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support this recommendation, as over the years there has been numerous complaints from the farmers regarding how the Sugar Industry Tribunal handles the disputes of the farmers. The Sugar Industry Tribunal is having too much authority and a one man show. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as stated earlier on, a crucial process and the purpose of the Tribunal is conciliation which means it encourages conciliation between parties, aiming to prevent prolonged conflicts. I cannot vouch for this, recently due to a dispute, a farmer Mr. Abdul Faroon of Maro, Sigatoka was suspended from the harvesting gang indefinitely. This means that Mr. Faroon has been left with no choice but to harvest his cane on his own. HON. V. PILLAY.- Very poor! Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Faroon even sought the assistance of the honourable Minister for Sugar on numerous occasions but until to-date, the honourable Minister has not responded with any concrete solution. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Follow the process! HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the issue that Mr. Abdul Faroon has raised with me through a viber message, if I can be allowed to read it which says, “since I have been expelled from the gang, I gave a call to the Sugar Minister, he said that he will be coming Lomai Flood Gate. All papers were given to him and he promised me that he will give me a call. This year, 5 th April a meeting was held in the Lautoka Growers Council office hall I spoke there regarding my issue to the Sugar Minister and another person and they promised that they will look into the matter yet after 5 th April till to-date, I receive no response from the Sugar Minister and the other person. HON. V. PILLAY.- Change the Minister! HON. J. N. NAND.- “We are the family of six and no finance for groceries, I have been requesting help from my friends and I even asked you to assist me which you have done. Thank you for assisting me in this matter though you are not the Sugar Minister. Thank you, once again and God bless you.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, 5 th April the issue was raised with the Minister, this is the mid-season of the crushing season, the season is about to end and the honourable Minister is still looking into it.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 1531 HON. V. PILLAY.- Change him! HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my intension is to buy a pair of goggles, a pair of binoculars, microscope and telescope and give to the honourable Minister so that he can see the problems thoroughly and respond to the farmers in a timely and appropriate manner. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not dispute the ruling of the Tribunal, I believe them, but Mr. Faroon is 60 years old and he has been asked to harvest his cane on his own. My question is, if the Tribunal has made a decision, there should be some alternative for the farmer to harvest his cane. How on earth, this particular farmer can hire a labourer and harvest his cane? The season is about to end, I think the honourable Minister will keep on looking into it, when the season will end, he will give him the answer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very sickening and despite numerous calls, the honourable Minister for Sugar has not answered. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the honourable Pillay, to change him and replace him with honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture. He is doing a very good job. Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you do not fire him, give him another portfolio; a Minister without portfolio so that he can keep on looking at the problems, looking busy doing nothing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I fully support the recommendations in the Report. The Sugar Industry Tribunal disbanded and the Ministry of Sugar takes responsible to appoint a tribunal. In this way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmers like Mr. Faroon can be served better. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I firstly like to say one thing to the honourable Member who just spoke, his statement was sickening. That farmer only cuts or harvests 25 tonnes of cane. I know the story about it. I actually went to his place but he had not given the full story to you. Nowhere a gang will get rid of a farmer unless you are a troublesome farmer and he is. So, please do not come and teach me about what happened there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I speak on the motion, I would like to say something about honourable Pillay last night when he finished off. He has been talking about the stoppage of Ba Mill and I think tomorrow morning honourable Bala will also question me on the same issue. But I would like to say one thing, Mr. Speaker, that we really feel sorry for the farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 18 years of the last government, they had not finished the mill. (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Do you know the heart of a sugar mill is its boiler? The boiler has not been replaced and that is the real problem of the sugar mill. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, if the boiler had a mouth to speak, it would have told them the problem. A human being, if his stomach pains, he will go and tell the doctor, “I have pain in my stomach.” But with this boiler problem, once you fix one side of the boiler, something else breaks down. If you had replaced the boiler then the mill problem would have been solved.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>1532 Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, without knowing the full facts, they will try to politicise the farmers. No amount of politics this time will get them any votes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Industry Tribunal 2016-2020 Annual Reports as outlined by Parliamentary Paper No. 77 of 2024. This comprehensive review offers a critical assessment of the Tribunal’s performance highlighting areas which need improvement. I acknowledge the recommendations provided by the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs and I can assure you that my Ministry is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Standing Committee. The Ministry has noted the request of the SIT to establish a standalone database. We agree with the Committees recommendation for a centralised database system and this proposal will be evaluated alongside the current collaboration with FSC which shares a database infrastructure with Sugar Industrial Tribunal. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to the submission to update the Annual Reports, the Ministry concurs with the Committees’ concerns. We are working to resolve the issue highlighted by the auditors to ensure timely and accurate reporting will be done. This includes addressing the backlog of the annual accounts and aligning future reports with the Sustainable Development Goals particularly SDG5 of the Gender Equality. The outdated Master Award, a cornerstone of industrial regulation is also under review. The Ministry is committed to modernise this legislative framework is part of the broader policy overall to better reflect the current reality of the sugar industry. Furthermore, we acknowledge the complexities surrounding the SCGF trust fund. While the Ministry does not directly oversee this Fund, we support the call for transparency and accountability. Discussions will be held with relevant stakeholders, including the Sugar Cane Growers Council and Fiji Sugar Corporation, to ensure that proper management and necessary further investigation is forwarded to FICAC. The Committee’s to disband the Sugar Industry Tribunal and transfer its responsibilities to the Ministry has been noted. It recognised the importance of optimising resources, especially given the industry’s current financial challenges, and this proposal will consider a comprehensive study on the sugar industry by the FAO, as I had mentioned on Monday, with the goal of transparency, efficiency and governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Sugar fully supports the Committee’s Report and is dedicated to addressing the recommendations to improve the sector’s governance and its operational effectiveness. The ongoing reforms and the strategic initiatives will be critical in ensuring a sustainable and a prosperous future for Fiji’s Sugar Industry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I urge all the honourable Members of this esteemed House to support this motion of this important work that lies ahead. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this motion. We all know the importance of Sugar Industry Tribunal. As we have heard, it is a body</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 1533 that deals with dispute resolution. The function of the Tribunal is to regulate a Master Awards, and to ensure fair treatment and adherence of contractual obligations between farmers and growers, and this function is vital for maintaining harmony and co-operation within the sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee reviewed the Sugar Industry Tribunal Annual Reports from 2016 to 2020, and the Committee had put forward eight recommendations, but I will speak only on four of these recommendations, because some of these recommendations was already covered. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a significant concern highlighted in the Report is the lack key performance indicators for most stakeholders in the sugar industry, including the Sugar Industry Tribunal. Sir, just to give you an example, the vision of Fiji Sugar Corporation, and let me read it out, I quote: “The vision of Fiji Sugar Corporation is to transform sugarcane farming to a sustainable and profitable farming activity for cane growers with sugar as a world class brand now and in the future.” What a beautiful vision! And what do we find? Most of these organisations will have their vision and mission, put in a bigger words and staple on the wall, but what is the problem here? The problem is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is no KPI, how will they work towards their vision? HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- All these organisations are directionless, they do not have a direction. They do not know where they are going. The honourable Minister is working hard to improve the industry, I can see that. He has got his mind and heart there, but he alone cannot fix it. That is the thing that I am trying to say. Unless and until all these CEOs of different sugar institutions sitting there, start fixing their area of work, they have to work towards that vision and without KPIs, they lack clarity, they lack focus and what does that do? It results in scattered efforts and wasted resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know this inefficiency hampers our industry’s performance which is actually visible in the sugar sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unacceptable that the Sugar Industry Tribunal and other stakeholders operate without targets, especially when taxpayers’ money is involved. It is not their own money, it is the taxpayers’ money. We need to ensure that taxpayers’ funds are yielding tangible results. They must get value for money, which they are not getting that kind of return, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Committee has also recommended the development of a centralised statistical database which the honourable Minister has mentioned, and our experience is in each and every report when they come up with the Annual Report, beautiful data is given, with graph, with tables, colourful. But when you read one report to another, they are talking about the same thing but the information is different. The number of growers is different, number of hectares of land being used is different. So, that is why it is very important to have this data at one place - at one repository spot, where everyone else can access. The honourable Minister has already said that he is looking into that because with single data, there can be innovation, there can be problem solving because then, you will know what the issue is and you can work towards solving that problem. But when the data is different, you do not know what you are doing with the data. Another critical recommendation which the honourable Minister has also touched on is the outdated Master Award. I believe, and this is my personal believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the critical issue</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>1534 Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 7 th August, 2024 is the Master Award. The 35 year old Master Award, developed in 1989, and we are trying to use that Master Award to solve today’s problem and the farmers are complaining….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> You should have done that 16 years ago.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Yes, we were trying to review. Go and read the Daily Hansard. Honourable Minister, go and read the Daily Hansard which you are not doing. Read the Daily Hansard then you talk in this Parliament. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go through the Daily Hansard, it is very clear that the Master Award was being reviewed but NFP stopped it. And I can assure the honourable Minister for Sugar, NFP will, again, be the spanner in the works because that is sugar politics. What I am trying to say here is that the Master Award is 35 years old, it needs to be fixed and we have already made the recommendation to review the Master Award, along with the new Sugar Policy. So, when the new Sugar Policy is established, review the Master Award and that will set the direction. One of the disputes that the growers normally have is on mechanisation. But mechanisation is not covered in the Master Award. That is how outdated the Master Award is. It does not take into account technological advancement that has happened over the years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also disappointed, very disappointed actually, that the sugar industry, whether you talk about FSC and the various other institutions that exist within the sugar sector, they have failed to report on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on Gender Equality in the Annual Report. This oversight is a significant issue. That is why when you go into any of the sugar industry bodies, you will just find men, everywhere, and that is the state of the sugar industry today. Research has shown that if you have women in the organisation, they will bring different perspective, and they can improve the system because they will look after your homes, they look after the community, then why are they put aside when it comes to sugar sector? Just because it is a men’s job? The worst is, they do not even report because they do not want anyone to pick that up. So, do not tell them, no one will know, but you and I know that it is a requirement of Parliament, it is a commitment to SDGs that it must be reported. So, I am urging all these institutions, please, wake up and start reporting on the SDGs so that we can see whether gender equality is in your organisation or not, whether you are giving equal opportunity to women to work in that organisation. Before I take my seat, there is something else that I wanted to speak about. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard twice in this House, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics has mentioned that when we had politics we were doing well. He has said it. When we had politics, the sugar industry was doing well. He fails to understand that when politics was there, they were getting preferential sugar price. HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- You can have as much politics as you like because you were getting more than the market price for that sugar. But today, we cannot allow this politics, simply because its taxpayers’ money you are talking about.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SIT 2016-2020 Annual Reports 1535 HON. J. USAMATE.– Hear, hear! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Imagine each and every household, when they get a paycheck, their money is deducted and it comes into the Government’s coffers. They can use that money to build their house but no, they are contributing to the Government’s coffers so they must get that return. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to provide some comments regarding the Sugar Industry Tribunal Reports and just a fact that we are looking at the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, basically says a lot, and we do not need to say much more. But, of course, being me, Sir, I want to say a bit more. Firstly, you went around, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday and I used the analogy of the lights that goes on, on the indicator. Honourable Usamate was talking about execution today and I thought I would just respond respectfully to honourable Usamate on execution. Sir, the sugar industry is on the precipice of collapsing and 16 years of that was under the other side - that is execution. The only thing that this side of the House can say, we have seen what the other side of the House can do with execution, Sir, and we will definitely do better. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to raise, just to educate honourable Usamate on execution, the honourable Prime Minister is always very humble when he talks in Parliament. When he talked about the $10 million Public Service Broadcasting Grant, he sort of politely did not really say what he should have said which was, you were giving away $10 million to one entity for 16 years or more. Through the honourable Prime Minister’s leadership, he gave a brief to the Board and said, “you need to turn this entity around, make it self-sustaining”. So, what the Board did in one year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they came back to the honourable Prime Minister and said, “We can live with $6 million. The $4 million is a saving.” The honourable Prime Minister said, “Alright, there is a saving, let us put it back in the pool for the other broadcasters.” That is execution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the report before us, I think honourable Premila Kumar has actually said what has to be said about the Report. It is just very troublesome, it is symptomatic of what has been happening in the industry for some time. Their Annual Reports have not been submitted on time, the Master Award is outdated, the Audit Report from 2016, I believe, were all qualified and we talked about the qualification of the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) report yesterday, and here we go. Sir, in some ways, I will use another, sort of, saying, the fish rots from the top. So, because we failed to actually manage FSC well, that resulted in so much losses for over 20 years, it is happening to all the other entities. So, the need for the report of the FAO, again, something that is initiated by this side of the House will actually plot a way forward for the industry. I thought I would end on a positive note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after all of that. I will just talk a bit about something that I have seen in the industry that can provide a template for the rest of the agricultural sector actually. It is one of the most organised industries in Fiji. It is set up quite well. It has a Tribunal, it has got its own funding mechanisms, it has a council, it has got its own Act, and</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – SRIF 2016-2021 Annual Reports 1536 that is the future for the agricultural sector in Fiji, Sir. We need to commercialise it, bring in these kind of support mechanisms, and then we will see the type of growth that we know we are capable of in the agricultural industry. By bringing in partners, such as Fiji Water, which I have talked about, and some others, we will surely be able to actually execute on them. Through the capabilities of the honourable Minister for Agriculture, you will see some transformational change happening, Sir, certainly in this term of Government and beyond. With those few words, Sir, I thank the Committee for being very honest about the status of the Sugar Industry Tribunal. Perhaps, if anything, my suggestion is, “Let us get a Cabinet paper together tomorrow and shut this down, if it is not working. Let us move on and try and make this industry profitable or at least self-sustaining, and then we can move on and develop the other agricultural sectors that offer so much potential for Fiji. I thank you, Sir. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comments are noted. However, I just wish to talk on the issues that has been raised by honourable Premila Kumar when we were going around visiting the stakeholders in the industry and, of course, meeting up with them – the need for more harmonious relationship between all the various stakeholders in the industry. There is a lot of fragmentation and what I have been saying in the Committee, is the need for all these stakeholders to be singing from the same hymn sheet, to have some sort of clear policy so that everyone will be singing from. So, it is a lesson for those in an industry which is quite huge like this. I think once we have the policy in place, the policy will be directing all the stakeholders to be singing from that same hymn sheet. I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contribution and, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support the motion before the House. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
