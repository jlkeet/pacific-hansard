<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p>Restoration of Water Supply in Parts of Suva (Question No. 128/2024) HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament as to when will people enjoy undisrupted water supply in parts of Suva like Raiwaqa, Tamavua, and Wailoku? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The undisrupted water supply in Suva, Raiwaqa and areas as mentioned, we cannot really 100 percent guarantee that because it will always be disrupted by natural disasters, et cetera. So, the question is really a hypothetical question. In terms of undisrupted water supply or interruptions, of course, it is a matter of significant importance and I thank the honourable Member for that question. In terms of current situation and challenges, the Tamavua Water Treatment Plant is a critical component of these areas, currently operating at a capacity of 75 mega litres per day, despite its original design capacity of 60 mega litres per day. So, this is an overextension, but is necessary to meet the demand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also presents challenges, especially during dry periods, as you have seen, when the raw water sources experience lower yield. Consequently, areas including Tamavua, Wailoku, Samabula and Raiwaqa are directly affected. However, we, as a Government, note the critical importance of this and, of course, extending from the work of the previous government, there are two specific projects – one is to alleviate this situation which is the Elevated Princess Road Water Infrastructure Project. This has already been tendered and we are looking at finalising the contract by November or end of November. This basically is the laying of pipelines from the Sawani Junction to Khalsa Road Junction along the Princess Road. We had a walk through these locations a few weeks ago. The cost is $35 million, project duration is 24 months and it will also benefit any future developments, moving forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it involves installation of new pipelines which will tee off from the existing Viria gravity main at Sawani, and there will be a pump station. From the pump station to Colo-i- Suva Reservoir site and gravity lines. It will involve, as I have mentioned, design and build new gravity pipes of 1.43 kilometres, Diameter Nominal (DN) 630, high density polythene pipe and moving from the Sawani junction to the proposed pump station at Buresasa, which is as you come up Princess Road about halfway before you reach the corner towards Colo-i-suva. Also, the new rising main water pipeline from that pump station to the current Colo-i-Suva Reservoir site where two 5 mega litre steel tank reservoirs will also be built. That is the current project which the Government is working towards with Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) towards alleviating that. In addition to that, there will be performance-based contract initiatives in terms of alleviating the leakage which is 47 percent. Over the next five years, it is targeted that it will be reduced to 20</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1517 percent. Basically, working on hydraulic improvements and also locating the leakages through various methodologies and progressively working on this for the next five years. With these plans, we are looking forward to the improvements in terms of those areas as indicated in the question. Apart from that, the Viria Project is also covering up for the shortfalls in the water supply. I believe there has been noticeable improvements in terms of that. But there are also current water tank assistance for those areas with intermittent water supply. These have been delivered to areas such as those in need in Sakoca and some other areas and it is available there and people have been applying for it. Those are some of the measures taken to address the water disruptions in the areas as questioned. HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question; can the honourable Minister enlighten Parliament that apart from ensuring regular water supply to the metered areas, what plans are there in place for connecting water to the non-metered areas? In other words, how many residential areas have been identified to get connected to the water supply in this financial year? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the list of areas. Of course, there is a list there in terms of those who have applied and also the prioritised areas. For example, just related to Viria, as agreed with the landowners, we have extended the pipeline too. This pipeline covers the villages of Viria, Waitolu, Naqali, Navatuvula, Naqali Government Station and all households and communities along Sawani and Naqali. For those, they need to apply for the water meter connections and WAF is currently going through those community. As the extensions are done, the awareness and also discussions with the communities along that are happening in terms of the applications and facilitating the connections under water meters. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. While we are still speaking about WAF, I would like to bring to the attention of the honourable Minister that the open trench in Kaunitoni Street still exists. It was opened in January last year, it is almost close to two years now. Or vehicles are being damaged, so if he can actually look into that. Along with that, there was a complaint lodged of a leakage in Kaunitoni Street around two weeks ago which is still unattended. Am I being victimised of being an Opposition MP that you are not fixing the Kaunitoni Street? Please clarify. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- My apology for that. That has already been raised with Water Authority of Fiji, but the word “victimisation”, sort of, rekindles bad memories when we were in the Opposition. (Laughter) I do not want to say victimisation specifically, but you should not have raised that because it brings bad memories to some of us here, especially related to Bill No 17 and being taken to CID. (Laughter) Anyway, that is besides the point. As a Government, definitely, we do not victimise or specifically withdraw services from certain areas because of political affiliation, that is not in our DNA. Definitely, we will look into that. (Laughter)</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>1518</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the honourable Minister, I am very interested and I am glad to see that they are targeting non-revenue water from 47 percent down to 20 percent. Can you just explain what are the broad strategies that will be used to do this to get that non-revenue water down? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not really familiar with the technical methodology, but what I understand is the hydraulics will be monitored in terms of differences in pressure and all that to try to specifically identify the areas with potential leaks. I think they are also using infrared with the contractors to try to locate the areas where there the leakages are specifically when there is a difference along one line in terms of water pressure from one point to another; with a significant difference. So, there must be a leakage in between, apart from those ones which are already identified as we move forward. HON. G. E. LEUNG.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to apologise to you personally and to honourable Members of the House for inadvertently breaching protocol when I exited the Chambers earlier today. Please accept my apologies. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, certainly, honourable Attorney-General. But I was thinking of giving you a red card. (Laughter) You traversed the whole Chambers. Thank you, honourable Attorney-General. Progress of Informal Settlement Upgrade Programme (Question No. 129/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the progress of the Informal Settlement Upgrade Programme? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Informal settlements around the country are becoming a mammoth challenge for any government due to their unplanned structure, poor access to basic amenities and infrastructure. To-date the Ministry of Housing has acquired development leases as well obtained consent from the Department of Lands for 48 informal settlements since 2010. Out of these, 44 are located on iTaukei land and four on State Land. These development leases, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are spread throughout Fiji with 13 settlements located in the Central Division, 14 settlements located in the Northern Division and 21 settlements located in the Western Division. Just by way of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very interesting to note that 48 government leases, 31 were acquired in two years (2017 and 2018). Mr. Speaker, Sir, three out of the 48 informal settlements, Cuvu in Nadroga, Ledrusasa in Votualevu, Nadi and Waidamudamu in Nausori have had their upgrades completed in 2022. These settlements are now in the process for lot allocation. With regards to these settlements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cuvu Informal Settlement Lot Allocation Committee had completed assessing these applications. The Waidamudamu sitting residents have submitted their applications for their house blocks as well as their Expressions of</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1519 Interest were accepted until 10 th July, 2024. Upon the completion of the Waidamudamu Lot Allocation process, the Ministry will then commence with Ledrusasa Lot Allocation.</p><h4>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, four informal settlements are presently in construction phase.</h4><p>These are: (1) Sakoca, Nasinu- 174 households; (2) Tavela, Nadi - 68 households; and (3) Field 4, Lautoka - 77 households; and (4) Tore, Lautoka - 59 households. Mr. Speaker, Sir, additional two informal settlements are to commence with construction phase this financial year are Vunika in Labasa with 101 households, and Valewaquyaya in Ba comprising of 35 households. The total cost of these upgrades in these settlements is around $30 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, planning works is underway for 16 informal settlements. These are located in Lovu seaside, Bare, Delaisaweni, Tukutoro, LUluisila, Delainamasi informal settlements in Lautoka; Valewaquyaya in Ba, Vunivau A and Vunivau B, Siberia and Vatia in Labasa and Veivauceva, Caubati River Road, Wakanisila in Nasinu, Sasawira in Nausori and Nadonumai in Lami are earmarked for completion up to engineering plans by the end of this years before progressing into construction phase. The estimated cost towards upgrade of these settlements is around $200 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, completion of preparation works indicates that topographic surveys, scheme plans, EIA, geotech survey and engineering plans are completed, allowing the commencement of construction works. Hence, all settlements are earmarked to be formalised over the next five years subject to budget allocation. The remaining 23 informal settlements are in preliminary phase to begin their planning works in phases over the next five years, subject to budget approval. The preliminary phase includes the acquisition of development lease, socioeconomic survey done by the Ministry officials and preparation of terms of references for consultancy work. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also pays the lease premiums and yearly rentals for the 44 development leases on iTaukei land. The total of $4.1 million in premium had been paid in addition to $921,000 in yearly rentals. I wish to highlight the Ministry of Housing’s informal settlement upgrade programme aims to improve livelihoods through the provision of a 99-year lease to fully service lots to those living in these development areas. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are few informal settlements in Delaisaweni, Nabare and nearby areas. The last meeting with the sitting tenants was held in 2022. The sitting tenants are still not aware of the progress and other details. Is it possible for the Authority’s concerned to have meeting with the sitting tenants to provide them with an update and answer their questions and concerns? I met them two weeks ago, they had lots of questions and concerns and I was not able to answer their questions. Is it possible to meet the siting tenants and answer their questions and concerns? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have also highlighted in my response that some of these areas are on planning stage right now. Based on the request by the honourable Member, there is a need to also go back and share the status of the project so that the residents are also aware of what the Ministry has done or what the Ministry is going to do with regards to</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>1520</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 their settlements. Staff Welfare and Concerns – USP Council (Question No. 130/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament what is Government doing to ensure our Fijian staff welfare and concerns are taken to the USP Council through staff representatives? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to start of with, the Coalition is committed to ensuring the welfare and concerns of our Fijian staff at the University of the South Pacific are adequately addressed and represented at the Council. Just by way of background, being a regional University with 12-member countries, the Council is the executive governing body of the University. It has all the powers and exercises it, conferred on the University by the Charter, subject to the powers, duties and functions conferred upon by its statutes. The Council makes ordinance to direct and regulate the University and its authorities and members. The Council meets twice a year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statutes of the University clearly states the membership of the Council and the determination of the membership. There is also a provision in the statutes of the University of the South Pacific for the appointment of a visitor and I quote: “10.1 The last visitor appointed was Sir James Bruce Robertson who is a retired Judge of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand.” Even the process of appointing a visitor is quite different from the normal expressions of interest because member countries used to nominate names and then once the name is nominated, they are agreeable to their names being nominated, then they are requested by the Secretariat to submit the EOI and their CVs. We currently do not have a visitor because of the process involved. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the USP Council’s Standing Orders, the representatives from Fiji can also call for a special meeting of the Council to be convened and the written request to the Secretary who counselled by the Chair over any member of the Council. The reason for a special meeting and business is to be discussed at the speacil meeting, it must be clearly stated in all requests. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is aware of the concerns raised given that USP has around 75 percent of staff who are Fiji citizens working at the University. There are a lot of issues that has been raised, in particular the strike threat that has been addressed. We also understand that staff that had been terminated had taken the matter to the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations and I would like to leave it at that. Maybe the honourable Minister for Employment may elaborate more on the processes involved in handling such cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the background that I have just alluded to, it is my intension to try and resolve the issues that has been raised and the welfare of the Fijian staff and concerns by calling a special meeting of the University to address the issues that has been highlighted regarding termination and strike threats. I have this morning briefed the honourable Prime Minister on the various issues pertaining to the University of the South Pacific and together with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and maybe with the honourable Minister for Labour, we will be convening a meeting and thereafter requesting a Special Council Meeting as it is my intention to resolve the many cases in</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1521 particular the welfare and concerns of the Fijian staff. We have also taken into account the advice by the honourable Minister that we respect the honourable Prime Minister and all other member countries of the USP Council and to ensure the smooth running of USP with the teachers and students welfare also taken seriously to achieve a healthy environment of learning and employment. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The employment contract of all staff, it very clearly states that proper process with procedural fairness and natural justice is accorded to staff. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament if due process was followed in the academic’s termination case? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I think that is an operational matter which we would not like to delve into but maybe if you allow the honourable Minister for Labour to enlighten the Members in terms of the processes involved in addressing this. MR. SPEAKER.- Before you do so, honourable Minister, honourable Hem Chand, this is a very sensitive case. This will get out of hand because the media may be able to twist things around considering how sensitive the case is. Yes, we will give the honourable Minister for Labour to have a go, but I think that it should remain there rather than us discussing it here because it has not been resolved. We are trying to find ways to get it resolved, we have not really convened the meeting. It is only after that then we can come and talk and say, “alright, this was successful, this was not successful” because staff are involved here. They have a Charter to follow. Can we leave it at that, honourable Hem Chand?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much:</span> Ministry’s Assistance to the Unemployed (Question No. 131/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations inform Parliament on how the Ministry intends to assist the unemployed persons in finding suitable employment locally. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Assistant Minister for asking the question. Given the significant number of students graduating from the different training institutions annually, I acknowledge the important work the team in my Ministry is undertaking in helping secure suitable jobs for unemployed Fijians within the local employment market. We are committed to establishing employment opportunities through partnerships with other agencies, developing effective pathways from education to employment, formulating policies that support job creation initiatives and implementing programmes that encourage the involvement of unemployed individuals in different workplaces. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the financial year 2023-2024, my Ministry successfully executed the Student Employment Exposure Programme in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the Fiji Commence and Employers Federation and the International Labour Organization.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>1522</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the collaboration with these stakeholders on the success of this Student Employment Exposure Programme, which allows workplace placements for Year 11 students, to experience the world of work during the two weeks school holidays. This initiative aims to facilitate the transition from school to employment of Year 11 students and this will be further extended to the Western and Northern Divisions in this financial year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would also organise a Mini Job Fair in the Western Division in Koroivolu Park in Nadi last month. Through the National Employment Centre, my Ministry invited 20 employers and exhibitors to conduct walk-in interviews and offer immediate hiring opportunities. However, the number of employers doubled to 40 on the day of the event, signifying the high interest from our local employers to be part of this platform. Mr. Speaker, Sir, remarkably, the two-day event resulted in the employment of 612 individuals, while a total of 1,582 unemployed persons where registered in the work-ready pool for the participating employers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mini Job Fair serves to strengthen partnerships between the Ministry and the key stakeholders, including private sector employers, educational institutions and international organisations to improve employment opportunities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, my Ministry plans to organise similar events in Suva, as well as in the Northern Division in the new financial year, to ensure inclusivity of all individuals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from this, we also have a Workplace Attachment Programme whereby those who hold certificates, diplomas and degrees can register with the National Employment Centre and we assist them with attachments at suitable workplaces for three to six months. Employers pay 50 percent and we pay the other 50 percent of the weekly wages. Certificate and Diploma holders received $150 a week and graduates received $180 a week. At the end of the three or six months, the employers may decide to employ the worker full time or permanently. Furthermore, in collaboration with the external partners, Cabinet has sanctioned a review of the National Employment Policy of 2018 to tackle economic disparities and encourage self- employment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Policy will be developed through comprehensive consultations, and it aims to align with international best practices, ensuring that it meets the needs of all Fijians and empowers our citizens to engage actively in the local labour market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is committed to developing initiatives to bridge the skills gap among our graduates, ensuring that they possess the necessary skills to meet the labour market demands. We will also be implementing and overseeing policies to ensure fair compensation to our workers in accordance with the established wage guidelines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, we will be working with the various stakeholders to promote the participation of Fijians in the labour market through initiatives such micro-skills training, upskilling, re-skilling and facilitating connections between workers and potential employers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are collaborating with the training institutions, with the TSLS, with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth. Together, we intend to move this forward. I thank you for the opportunity, Sir. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is what is the</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1523 current rate of employment in Fiji at the moment? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Member for the question. I will get the answer for it later on. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I noted from the presentation that there were thousands of students graduating with Certificate, Diploma and Bachelor who are still waiting. We thank the honourable Minister for encouraging these new graduates to be introduced into the labour market. My question is, while they are waiting or while they are enrolled into the areas of work that are opened up for them, is this part of the bond system that is being introduced by the Coalition Government, even though the area they are working in is not relevant to their area of study? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are burdened with the unemployed graduates or Diploma holders because of the poor planning in the past. We did not plan according to the demands of the job markets. We have now got a comprehensive study done by Professor Hitendra Pillay, as was alluded to by the honourable Minister for Education yesterday, and according to that we have a 5-Year to 10-Year plan. We know which areas will be needing graduates and that is the way we are now awarding scholarships to students. Those who are still unemployed, opportunities will come as we go along. That is all I can say now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have also alluded to the fact that we are also reskilling and upskilling people. So, there are opportunities to look at areas where there are opportunities. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The honourable Minister just alluded that because of poor planning, they have graduates not being employed. Could the honourable Minister, please, advice on which areas we have abundance of graduates and where can they get employment? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually the statement came from the other side, that there are unemployed graduates and now let me tell you, Sir. I know one area very well and that is Education because I was involved there. In Education there are certain subjects in the secondary school, the teachers have been waiting for three to four years now after graduating waiting with no jobs. There are other areas where there is extreme shortage. In the primary schools, we have secondary school teachers who are unemployable in secondary schools and teaching in primary schools, filling the gaps because there is big shortage in primary schools. So, that is a clear example. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Poor execution HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Other examples? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one example is enough (Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister in explaining all the measures that they have been taking for employment. I congratulate him, but all those measures, there is nothing new there. Those kinds of measures have been implemented for a long time and he will find that no government is perfect. The world is always changing, and the role of every government is continual improvement.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>1524</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>7 th August, 2024 I am very interested in the 600 that got jobs. Do you have any tracking system later on to get some sort of feedback of how well they have fared so we can do some sort of analysis in terms of the selection process and what the outcome was for those that got their jobs? I am just interested if there are any kinds of studies like those taking place. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that question. Of course, honourable Usamate has been an Educator and he knows. Our National Employment Centre has got all the data, all the information on where the workers are placed now, and we have the ability and the capability to follow and see how they are doing. Update on Progress of Work for Gas Crematoriums (Question No. 132/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry update Parliament on the utilisation of the $500,000 in the 2023–2024 financial year for the progress of works for gas crematorium in Navua, and the Western and Northern Divisions? HON. C. J. SINGH. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning when I heard from the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, honourable Naivalurua that he had 9 plus 2, it gave me a little bit of comfort that I am in a comfort zone in Parliament now. So, I can relax and answer. MR. SPEAKER. – Do you believe that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH:</span> – Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the next voting, we will probably know.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by honourable Sachida Nand and I thank him for raising this question. Indeed, this question gives me an opportunity to highlight in this august House some of the key developments my Ministry has undertaken in relation to the crematorium project so far. As we all know, the funding in the previous budgetary provision was a study project on crematoriums. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a budgetary provision of $500,000 just for the study but I will tell this august House that I hardly use $50,000 for the study because this project is not a new project in Fiji. We looked at the three Crematoriums - in Raralevu, of course, the Dignified Crematorium, so it is not a rocket scientist project. I got the help of the committee of Raralevu and Mr. Rosario who gave me the assistance with my team to see that we can do the project training at a very minimum cost. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have accomplished all the necessary paperwork for the Tuatua Crematorium project, including design and engineering plans and a tender for the project was also called. The tender opened on 9th March, 2024 and closed on 27th March, 2024. It was re-advertised on 4th May, 2024 and closed on 5th June, 2024 as the bidders did not meet the required specifications. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that the evaluation of this tender has been completed and the Ministry has submitted the Evaluation Report to the Government Tender Board for approval. The Ministry is expecting a response from the Government Tender Board by next week.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1525 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, the Ministry also called for tender for supply of installation, commissioning and training of four gas pipe cremators from India. The tender was called on 23rd March, 2024 and closed on 17th April, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to inform Parliament that the Government Tender Board has approved a contractor to supply, install and commission and provide training for the use of the four gas pipes cremators. The Ministry and supplier have signed a contractual agreement on 25th July, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the requirement of the Ministry of Environment, my Ministry is engaging a consultant to develop the Environment Management Plan (EMP) before initiating any construction work at Tuatua or other cemeteries for these gas pipe projects. Just last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry received an Expression of Interest from consultants to undertake the EMP. A successful bidder will be identified by the end of this week to commence the EMP process. Once the EMP process is completed, the ground-breaking ceremony for Tuatua Cemetery will be conducted by the Ministry, hopefully, by the end of this month or early next month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to the installation of other gas pipe projects in this financial year, I am pleased to inform that the Ministry is working closely with the management of Lovu Cemetery in Lautoka, Varoko Cemetery in Ba and Raiwaqa Cemetery in Navua. The committees of these cemeteries are expected to carry out the construction works themselves, while the Ministry will only cover the cost of procurement and installation of the gas pipe cremators. We have completed all due diligent and are in process of completing all mandatory documentation for the project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are processing as per our plans and expect to achieve full implementation before the end of this financial year. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the detailed explanation. Just last week, I returned from Labasa. I was slightly worried that the Tuatua Cemetery where the crematorium has been identified to be erected, what about the parking area? Is there sufficient parking because most of the time, people going to Tuatua Cemetery park their vehicles on the roadside and that is a disaster waiting to happen. Are we providing enough parking for people to come and park inside? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got a parking lot next to the Cemetery itself. So, there is one big lot next to the Cemetery and, of course, when there is overcrowding, then some people park on the road but a lot of people prefer to park on the road because as soon as the body is burnt, they want to get out of the place. But if they part inside the parking lot, they will have to wait for other cars to move out. Construction of Seawalls – Natewa Bay Peninsula (Question No. 133/2024) HON. S.

(Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has completed the construction of a 400 metre boulder retaining wall at Drekeniwai Village, in the Savusavu District. The project marks a significant milestone and the Ministry’s efforts to protect coastal communities from the impacts of climate change and coastal erosion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is working closely with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and anticipates signing a grant agreement worth US$1.5 million for the Nature Based Solutions Seawall projects in this financial year. This donor-funded initiative will fund the construction of six Nature Based Solution seawalls, which include two sites within the Natewa Bay Peninsula in Vanuavou Village, in the Vaturova District, and Navetau Village in the Saqani District. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first quarter of 2024-2025 financial year, the Ministry is set to sign a grant agreement worth US$5million with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Adaptation Fund through the Pacific Community. This project will construct 14 Nature Based Solution seawalls with Tawake Village in the Saqani District being one of the sites in the Natewa Bay Peninsula. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, this project demonstrates the Ministry’s commitment to enhancing the resilience of coastal communities through sustainable and environmentally-friendly infrastructure and the Ministry is grateful for the support of international partners that enable the implementation of these critical approaches. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the update but remember there are villages too on the other side of the bay. Please make sure that they get assistance as well. I will ask the question on behalf of Kanakana Village, Sir. Honourable Minister, you have stated a few projects but Kanakana Village has been on the list for quite a while. Kanakana Village has the same threat as Vunidogoloa because it is at the mouth of the river and, of course the sea as well. I ask the honourable Minister if he can consider Kanakana Village as one of the priorities. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must applaud the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his interest in the Natewa Bay peninsula, in particular, on the other side. Of course, we will include Kanakana Village in the list like you have stated. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question. We thank the honourable Minister for the work of doing the retaining wall for Natewa. He has already mentioned about Viani, Drekeniwai up to Natewa; there is a Natewa Health Centre. In my last visit there, there was evidence of coastal erosion along the boundary of the Natewa Health Centre. My question to the honourable Minister, will that be included or will they relocate the health centre? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Member does not have the same interest like the previous honourable Member. (Laughter) Yes, we will see what the honourable Member has raised is looked into and included in the list, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>7 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1527</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Sugar Mill Operations and Sugar Production (Question No. 123/2024) HON.
