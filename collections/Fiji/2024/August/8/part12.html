<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make</p><h4>a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40, the:</h4><p>(1) Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; (2) Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services; (3) Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection; (4) Honourable Minister for Justice; (5) Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; and (6) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. The Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. I will also invite the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his designate, to speak for five minutes. There will be no other debate. I now call on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to deliver his Statement. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, honourable Usamate stood up to point out that a Ministerial Statement presented yesterday was possibly an attempt to cut out a question that was going to come. This one is also the same, and I apologise to honourable Koya, this is in response or in relation to the question he was going to ask at question time. I have sent in my apology that I may not be present during question time in the afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that has given me time to give honourable Koya the information he is seeking in his oral question. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Measures and Initiatives to Promote Productivity in the Civil Service HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and I also welcome the students and teachers who are with us this morning in the gallery; ni sa bula vinaka, good morning to you all. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to make this Statement, and as I have said, it is in response to one of the questions that was relisted to be asked for oral response this afternoon. As I have said, I will not be available. I will ask for your leave to be absent from the afternoon session to be with the Right Honourable Senator Penny Wong, looking over the Hospital under the guidance of the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, and working on how we are going to renovate the Hospital. It is very fitting that the Government of Australia will be helping us in this, as it is the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, and the war in which many Fijians left our shores and joined the Australian, British and the New Zealand Army. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service is the key arm of the Government machinery and is essential for the effective and efficient delivery of Government services and work programmes approved in the budget to our citizens. The question today is justified, so it demands a good response from Government to keep the people informed of what the biggest allocation in our Budget, those</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1548</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 that come under that allocation are doing for the people of Fiji. The Ministry of the Civil Service is committed to enhancing productivity across the whole of the Civil Service. While recognising the critical link between employee satisfaction and productivity, the Ministry is implementing a series of initiatives aimed at improving productivity. As the employer, the Government continues to provide the necessary support and opportunities to our civil servants. The labour market has evolved beyond the nation's boundaries, and significant efforts have been made to increase the value of the work undertaken by our civil servants. Many of the honourable Members here have had a stint with the Civil Service and they know how hard they work and how important their work is. The Ministry of Civil Service is committed to creating a workplace where individuals feel valued, they take pride in their work, they are encouraged to be innovative without fear and provide an environment that the Civil Service is an employer of choice. By fostering an environment that encourages growth, development and recognition, we hope to attract and retain a dedicated workforce that is motivated to deliver high-quality services to our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent salary adjustment is linked to complex issues affecting the public sector workforce that impact the service delivery and welfare of our people. There are several Whole of Government initiatives aimed at enhancing productivity, standardising processes and adopting common enabling tools and services to support efficiency, collaboration, and better coordination. These initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are part of a broader strategy to ensure that our Civil Service operates at the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to begin with, we continue to experience labour shortages due to labour mobility and demand from developed economies particularly in Australia and New Zealand. The Civil Service has not been immune to this; an ongoing loss of skills in the Civil Service has led to a large number of vacancies in most specialised government agencies. This in turn affects service delivery and, in some instances, leads to existing staff carrying extra workloads to fill the gaps due to increased migration. As the Minister responsible for Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to extend our deep appreciation to those hardworking civil servants who at times have borne the extra workload as a result of vacancies. Government has also introduced an Internship and Graduate Trainee Programme (GTP) to enable graduating students from the various tertiary institutions to join the Civil Service as an employer of choice. The Ministry intends to provide opportunities to at least 50 graduates on a yearly basis to join the Civil Service under that programme, in addition to many others who responded to advertised positions from time to time on placement basis. Mr. Speaker Sir, the recent salary increase is a strategic employee retention measure as well, aimed at retaining our most talented and experienced civil servants. We understand that a lot of those who are receiving our migrating civil servants offer higher salaries than we can even afford. Competitive remuneration is essential for maintaining a motivated and committed workforce. By providing fair and attractive compensation, we are better positioned to retain skilled employees who are critical to the effective functioning of Government. The salary adjustment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, acknowledges the hard work and dedication of our</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1549 Civil servants, thereby enhancing their sense of value and also job satisfaction. A satisfied and well- compensated workforce is more likely to be productive and committed to their roles. Recruitment is also a crucial part of our workforce strategy. Government has been working through dialogue with the public sector unions to address concerns across different sectors, including recruitment practices. This collaboration is welcomed by the unions, and the opportunity for dialogue are conducted in good faith. By working closely with unions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can ensure that the needs and concerns of our workforce are addressed, leading to a more harmonious and productive work environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are aware of workplace trends and the anticipated business transformations that will develop over time. Several initiatives have been identified to promote productivity. We are exploring flexible working hours arrangements within government agencies to manage the various challenges while balancing work responsibilities. Flexible working arrangements can help employees achieve a better balance working environment, leading to increase job satisfaction and productivity. You saw an example or a demonstration of that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when civil servants were allowed to work from home. These arrangements can also make the Civil Service a more attractive employer, particularly for younger workers who value flexibility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent Civil Service Day celebrated the achievements of our civil servants and provided an opportunity to engage with the citizens. Their views and ideas for improving service delivery have been considered. This event will now become an annual occasion for reflection and improvement and overtime hopefully our detractors will accept. Civil Service Day is an important event that allows us to recognise the hard work and dedication of our civil servants and to gather valuable feedback from the public. Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this year, Cabinet approved the establishment of the Fiji Learning Institute of Public Service (FLIPS). This Institute will create high-quality, future focused, learning opportunities to ensure that civil servants are skilled and be productive, thereby also helping to build an experienced workforce. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FLIPS will be a centre of excellence for sharing best practices in a modern robust Civil Service through programmes tailor-made to the need of our Civil Service. This initiative is part of our commitment to continuous professional development and lifelong learning and a dynamic changing environment. The establishment of FLIPS within this financial year will be a significant milestone for the Civil Service. The Ministry of Civil Service has initiated collaborations with the Public Service Commission within the region to explore capacity-building opportunities that will further improve performance. There is a constant need to innovate, encourage the workforce to challenge the status quo, push boundaries and excel. Investing in training and continuous retraining of our workforce and providing civil servants with future skills is crucial for efficient and effective delivery of services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, training and development programmes offered by FLIPS will cover a wider range of topics. These programmes will be designed to meet the specific needs of the Fiji’s civil servants at different stages of their careers, ensuring that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their roles. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be bringing back Induction Training. You and I remember the days of Induction Training when we went straight from school into the Government Training Centre to be</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1550</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 somehow prepared for the Civil Service and we went in as cadets into the various departments. That will be brought back, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Customer services training, middle management and senior level leadership development programme, international relations and diplomacy training, teaching in ethics, governance and eradication of abuse and corruption. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another key strategy for achieving greater efficiency in delivering Government services cost effectively while cutting bureaucracies, red tape and standardising procedures. These measures aim not only to improve productivity, but also to create a more dynamic and responsive Civil Service that can better meet the needs of our nation. Community of Practice Business Process Improvement (BPI) forums are being conducted to streamline processes, align procedures, reduce gaps and evaluate processes for improved service delivery, cost reduction and better utilisation of resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, BPI forums bring together technical advisors and representatives from different Ministries to share best practices and develop streamline processes. By reducing duplication and inefficiencies, we can improve service delivery and ensure that resources are used more effectively that will increase productivity. These forums also provide an opportunity for civil servants to collaborate and learn from each other, fostering a culture of continuous improvements and emphasising the need for working together as a team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recent challenges have highlighted the need for a comprehensive functional review of the Civil Service to ensure operational efficiency and effectiveness. With the support from the Australian Government, a functional review will be undertaken to identify a better performance management system and increase productivity. I wish to acknowledge and thank the Australian Government for their continuing support for capacity building in the public service. I believe that this approach will surely optimise workforce efficiency and effectiveness, establish clear metrics for accountability, and promote continuous improvement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, performance metrics will also serve as a basis for recognising and rewarding high performing civil servants, fostering a culture of excellence and motivating them to deliver their best impacts and results consistently. The review will provide recommendations for short term, mid- term and long-term improvements. The performance management system will include regular performance appraisals, clear objectives and goals and opportunities for feedback and development. By setting clear expectations and providing ongoing support, we can ensure that civil servants are motivated to perform at their best. The system will also include mechanisms for identifying and addressing performance issues, ensuring that all employees are held accountable for their contributions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, our approach includes measures designed not only to improve productivity, but also to retain our most talented and experienced employees, most importantly, to remove fear and give back confidence to our civil servants. By creating a supportive and engaging work environment, we aim to ensure that increased salary investments translate directly into improved service delivery. The Ministry is confident that these initiatives will drive improvements, ultimately benefitting our citizens and supporting the overall development of our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government is committed to providing the support and resources necessary to help our civil servants succeed. By fostering a culture of collaboration, learning and accountability, we can create a Civil Service that is capable of meeting the challenges of the future and delivering high quality services to the public. The Ministry of Civil Service will continue to work closely with other agencies, public sector unions and international partners to implement these initiatives.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1551 We are grateful for the support and collaboration of all stakeholders, particularly our development partners, and look forward working together to achieve our goals. The journey towards a more productive, sufficient and responsive Civil Service is ongoing and we are committed to making continuous and continuing improvements to better serve the people of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, I would like to acknowledge the presence of the Chairman of Post Fiji and the CEO, who have just entered the Chambers. He is a former MP and Minister as well. Welcome, Chairman of Post Fiji Limited. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Members of Cabinet, honourable Members of Parliament, I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for a comprehensive update on the upgrade of the Civil Service. I have five minutes, so I am going to get straight to the point. Mr. Speaker, with respect to the Civil Service, we must respond to the challenges of today, if we are going to improve on our public sector productivity. This helps any Government that is in place because it shows you how productive they are at the end of the day, and in terms of efficiency of the Government. But what are the measurement methods that we have in place with respect to checking on this productivity? Mr. Speaker, currently, Government is engaged in digital transformation, and that digital transformation stands at the core of a very productive Civil Service. Successive governments have faced huge problems in terms of productivity, but this is not due to the civil servants, it is also due to our inability to get ourselves a proper digital platform. I will give you an example, Mr. Speaker. Currently, the Ministry of Lands is not connected to the Registrar of Titles. The Ministry of Lands is not even connected to Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) to upgrade their system in terms of the VanuaGIS. So, if FRA puts up a new road and gives it a new name, that does not reflect in our VanuaGIS. There are many facets of Government that are still disconnected, and this is not a complaint but is a word of advice, that the faster we get our digital transformation done, the faster we can get a Civil Service that is productive. We must redefine the public sector, we must move away from bureaucracy that still exists in 2024. There are a lot of bureaucratic things that actually exist within Ministries. We must also ensure that we engage the new and the old public servants with respect to stopping this building of their own little castles within the Ministries – that needs to stop. We must engage and collaborate more and more within the Ministries, and I think the one thing that does all these for us is digitisation. Mr. Speaker, we must also look at outcomes rather outputs. It is a very important aspect of it. An outcome is an impact of that particular product on the people to whom the product is intended for, and how it changes the lives of our communities for the better and this should be the focus of our Civil Service. Mr. Speaker, we all understand that this will not happen overnight, it will take time to happen, but as I have said, it has to be through a proper digital platform. We have spoken about this earlier. The honourable Minister for Trade is hard at work, trying to dot all the i’s and cross all the t’s, et cetera, and get every single Ministry connected. Mr. Speaker, it would be insane to call for our Civil Service to raise their level of performance if Government does not provide that particular support. It is imperative that we concentrate, and I</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1552</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 urge the honourable Minister for Finance to give as much funding as possible to ensure that the digitisation of Government is actually at the top of the calendar with respect to getting things done. We have very good capable workers. I know we have problems with respect to migration. Many of our young Civil Servants have also migrated, that is also a problem. But we also have very good capable workers who have not achieved their full potential because we expect too much from them. Education also is a huge thing that we need to ensure that we upgrade on with respect to all our Civil Servants. As with all services, monetary reward, Mr. Speaker, should not only be the source of that particular incentive. Deriving satisfaction from knowing that you are actually providing your services to the general public, Mr. Speaker, is a much higher reward. That should also be built in into our Civil Service culture. Mr. Speaker, Human Resource Management is the second part of the equation, and that is something that needs to be looked at very carefully with respect to how we actually get the productivity that we want out of our Civil Service. Mr. Speaker, it is pivotal - we must engage in motivational practices within the Civil Service so that it actually comes to the fore. We must look at serious performance management, which is actually a very complex issue, is not easily measurable and, again, we also must remember that this is an ongoing issue and it will not be a close chapter once this Government says, “Alright, we have done this now.” It will always be an open book for us to look at on another day. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir I rise to deliver my response to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister and Minister responsible for Civil Service this morning. I totally agree with the honourable Prime Minister’s Statement on the measures that have been taken to increase productivity and performance of our Civil Servants. It was long overdue, given the measures that have been announced in the recent Budget where there is a 7 to 10 percent increase for salary earners and also 7 to 20 percent increase for wage earners. It affects over 42,000 public servants employed in the Civil Service. It is about $85 million allocation given, depending on their salary band. I thank the Government for recognising that, given that this was long overdue. Mr. Speaker, making the Civil Service an employer of choice, as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister, and a measure also that will not only increase productivity but also a retention measure where we can retain our senior Civil Servants, especially those whom we are losing out for overseas work. I also welcome the increase of the retirement age from 55 years to 60 years and if the Government can also consider increasing that to 65, given that many at that particular age can still deliver and are more productive in their service delivery. Also, given the wealth of knowledge that they have, we should also consider increasing that from 60 years to 65 years old. Mr. Speaker, on the issue that was raised by honourable Koya in terms of their training and digitisation, I think that has also been covered by the honourable Prime Minister when speaking on the Fiji Learning Institute for Public Service (FLIPS). They will be trained according to the need that is there, according to the work and job description that they have. We also welcome the induction training that will also bring back cadetships, which the</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1553 honourable Prime also mentioned. That will also improve the customer service and service delivery of our civil servants, especially at the divisional level. The idea of bringing back the Civil Service Day will also bring in a new culture and has also brought in that freedom within the Civil Service where they are able to strengthen their bonds with other Civil Servants, especially working with other Ministries and knowing each other well, which will help in the service delivery as per Ministry. Also, the Performance Management System has been brought back and the removal of the Open Merit Recruitment and Selection. The contract system has been removed and permanent employment has given confidence to civil servants, especially going into banks to take loans and other things that gives them security at their work, and they need not fear for any renewal of contract or expiry of contract, and this also improves their performance in their work as they deliver to our people. This particular increase, as rightly mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister, will increase productivity and also service delivery. In most of our debates during the week and even in previous sittings, we always talk about the review of Annual Reports for various Ministries. We always tend to blame previous governments or previous administrations, but it comes down to the civil servants who deliver and implement those policies. So, in providing these incentives and proper working conditions, plus other training, it will help them perform well and also deliver to the people of Fiji what has been passed by this Parliament, especially in the Budget allocation in the years to come and also in this financial year. With those words, Mr, Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your indulgence. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as a result of the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister, please, take note, as he has alluded to, that Oral Question No. 140/2024 on today’s Order Paper will now be dropped. I now call on the Minister of Health and Medical Services to deliver his Statement. Addressing the Burden of NCDs in Fiji HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.– Mr. Speaker Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; ni bula vina'a’ and good morning to you all, and to our visitors in the gallery today, and those watching from home and places of work. I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement today with a focus on the efforts that the Ministry, through the Wellness Division, is undertaking to address the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in our country. Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) continue to be the main disease burden for our people, contributing to 80 percent of all deaths in the country and 40 percent of premature deaths. In the recently published ‘Republic of Fiji Vital Statistics Report 2016 to 2021’, circulatory diseases such as hypertension, heart disease and stroke, diabetes and cancers were the leading causes of death in Fiji in both, male and female in all ages combined. For adults aged 35 years to 59 years, the leading causes of death in men and women were NCDs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCDs also pose a significant burden on our health system and our society. The majority of admissions and treatment at our health facilities are due to NCDs and its complications.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1554</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 Complications such as coronary artery disease or heart attacks, stroke, kidney diseases or kidney failure, vision impairment or vision loss and peripheral vessel disease that require surgical interventions including amputations, bring patients to our hospitals every day, and require ongoing care in our health facilities and in our homes and communities. In 2019, healthcare costs for deaths and disability from NCDs such as diabetes and obesity-related illnesses was estimated at FJ$591million. Mr. Speaker Sir, 95 percent of NCDs are due to lifestyle choices, and the four main modifiable risk factors of NCDs are tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet that is high in salt, sugar, fat and processed foods, and excessive alcohol consumption. These unhealthy lifestyle habits lead to four key changes in our body that increase our risk of NCDs, and they are a raised blood pressure, high blood sugars, high blood cholesterol or fat levels, and obesity or overweight. The Fiji 2021 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey showed a significant level of unhealthy dietary practices in older children, adolescents and adults, which featured the low consumption of nutritious foods, and a high intake of sugar and sweetened beverages. The survey also noted that about one-third of children in Fiji between the ages of 5 years to 19 years were overweight. When uncorrected, the presence of these intermediate risk factors leads to the development of NCDs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the NCD situation in Fiji, the Wellness Division of the Ministry is tasked, amongst its many roles, with undertaking population surveys, often with the support of our partners, to assess the prevalence of risk factors of NCD and its complications in the community. Information gathered from these population surveys guide the strategies of health promotion and NCD prevention programmes that are implemented by the Ministry and the Government to address NCD in Fiji. Recent examples of such interventions include: (1) The Cabinet endorsed the ‘National Policy on Healthy Catering and Sale of Food and Beverages for Government Ministries and Institutions’, which was launched by the honourable Prime Minister in February this year. (2) The increased tax on sugar and sweetened beverages and tobacco which Government had implemented in the last financial year and, again, in this new financial year. It has been pleasing to note that many Government institutions are taking positive actions to adhere to the healthy catering policy, such as Vunidawa Hospital in the Naitasiri Province, whose pictures of deliciously colourful and balanced meals provided at the Hospital are currently trending on social media. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important NCD population survey that the Ministry has embarked on since June 2024 is the STEPS survey. This survey is a World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach is a simple, standardized method of collecting, analysing and disseminating data on key NCD risk factors in countries. factor surveillance, which to NCD risk The survey has been implemented in over 120 countries and it gathers information on risk factors with a questionnaire, followed by simple physical measurements of respondents, which is then followed by the more complex collection of urine and blood samples for biochemical analysis. This is the third time for the STEPS Survey in Fiji, the first one was carried out in 2002, and the second survey in 2011. Ideally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, STEPS Survey should be done in every five years. The 2011 STEPS Survey was a nationally representative population-based survey of 25 years to 64-year-old Fijians, covering 2,586 individuals across Fiji.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1555 The results of the 2011 STEPS survey showed that: • • • • 30 percent of adults smoked tobacco daily; 15.7 percent of adults consumed alcohol within the past 30 days; 15 percent of adults do not meet the WHO recommendations on the minimum level of physical activity for health; and 85 percent of adults ate less than five servings of fruits and/or vegetables on average per day. For the intermediate risk factors: • • • • 32 percent of the respondents were obese while 70 percent were overweight and obese; 31 percent had raised blood pressure; 15.2 percent had raised blood glucose; and 35.8 percent had three or more risk factors. The STEPS survey is among a number of important population health surveys that have been pending over the last decade which the Ministry is keen to undertake to guide its health strategies in the next five years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the support of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the Ministry has commenced the third STEP Survey for Fiji. The survey is in line with our National Health Strategic Plan and the Annual Operational Plan. For the first time ever, the Ministry has engaged the assistance and expertise of the Fiji Bureau of Statistics in carrying out the survey on risk factor behaviours among male and female aged between 18 years to 69 years. Also, for the first time, during the survey, Fiji will be introducing for the rest of the world - (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) a cervical cancer module; a suki and tobacco module; an oral health module an extended nutrition questions; a mental health module and urinalysis. These are all new modules under the STEPS survey and Fiji is proud to be involved in drafting and piloting these assessment modules under this comprehensive survey. By the end of the last financial year, the survey for the Eastern Division were nearing completion, with surveys conducted in Kadavu, Ovalau, Rotuma, and Lakeba in the Lau Group. In this financial year, funds totalling $480,000 have been allocated from the Wellness Division for the completion of the STEPS survey in the Northern, Western and Central Divisions. On the benefits of the survey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the results from the STEPS survey will inform on the impact of the population-based interventions for our people over the last 10 years. The result will help the Ministry to track its progress towards the Global NCD Action Plan of a 25 percent reduction of premature mortality from NCDs by 2025, as well as SDG target 3.4, which calls for reducing premature death from NCDs, including diabetes, by 30 percent by 2030. The survey results will provide further guidance on a number of current NCD strategies by the Ministries, such as the:</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1556</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 • • • • Healthy Settings Programme, which has resulted in communities declaring their villages and community halls tobacco-free settings; workplaces adopting Wellness Wednesdays; our School Health Policy and Health Promoting Schools Programme with the Ministry of Education; and our current effort to establish, with the support of our partner, an electronic information system for recording and reporting diabetes cases. The survey result, together with recommendations from the recently completed Health Survey conducted by World Bank and our upcoming Health System Evaluation Exercise, will guide the Ministry’s future National Wellness Strategic Plans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by reiterating what I have said previously in this august Parliament, in that, NCDs do not start when one is diagnosed inside our hospitals and nursing stations. They start with the living and eating habits that are nurtured at a young age in our homes, schools, villages, workplaces, offices and in the deliberations of this august Parliament. The NCD burden we have will require our collective effort and determination to control and stop. I wish to encourage all Fijians around the country who are approached to participate in the STEPS survey, to fully participate and complete all the steps of the survey. I wish to acknowledge and thank all our partners who are supporting the Ministry in completing the survey in 2024. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER. – Honourable Members, I now wish to suspend proceedings so we can adjourn for tea. Mr. Sakiusa Kaitani and your colleague, you are all welcome to join the honourable Members for tea. He is a very hardworking member of the Government, whether he belongs to PAP or SODELPA. He is from Lomaiviti but born and bred in Rakiraki. We now adjourn for tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.33 a.m.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1557 The Parliament resumed at 11.00 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the honourable Minister for Health and thank him for his Ministerial Statement, especially on a very burning issue, that is, NCDs in our country. Mr. Speaker, as we say, prevention is better than cure. For any country to prosper, it will need a healthy population. Unfortunately, in Fiji, it is not the case, and it is very shocking that more than 80 percent of deaths in Fiji is because of NCDs. These are very worrying numbers; both for the general populous as well for us, as policy makers. Mr. Speaker, a large chunk of National Budget is devoted towards treatment of NCDs when rightfully, more funding needs to be provided towards the prevention of NCDs. Mr. Speaker, NCD places a huge burden on our already strained healthcare system. The Ministry of Health, for years, has devoted money, time and effort towards treating patients suffering from NCDs rather than focusing on building state-of-the-art facilities that can provide special service. Fijians have to fly out of the country to get treatment that is not available in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, we cannot and should not blame the Ministry of Health for not providing these special services. One must look at the core problem that has led to a situation that is at hand at the moment. As citizens of this country, we need to take responsibility for our health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCDs can be prevented. We do not have to end up in a hospital once we have acquired diseases such as diabetes, kidney failure, heart-related issues, et cetera. If only we control what goes into our tummy through our mouth, we would not be caught in the web of NCDs. We need to ensure that it is everyone’s responsibility to live a healthy life. We need to take our 30 minutes’ walk on daily basis. Mr. Speaker, Fiji has a very active young population. Almost anywhere, you will see young Fijians out on the field but, unfortunately, our life has come to a standstill when we reach the age of 30. This can be due to many reasons such as work, family commitment and being career focused. Fijians at the age of 30 and above tend to get busy with work as they become career-oriented or get busy with their family life and children, and without realising it, physical activity which was almost 100 percent on daily basis during their high school and tertiary institute days has declined drastically or zero percent over a number of years. This is the time when NCDs start to knock on our doors at this stage of our life. By the time we realise it, it is too late, and we are already diagnosed with NCDs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, not just the above, but we need to focus on our family members and provide guidance to those who are involved in drugs, and I must say this, yaqona as well. We can see how our young generation are spoiling their future by spending their entire nights having grog. This does not only deteriorate their health conditions, but also affects their social and family life. Mr. Speaker, one of the major reasons of families getting split up is because the husbands are having grog sessions the whole night and not devoting time towards their families. It is a social issue that is creeping into our society. Mr. Speaker, we need to even bring in new medications and not the outdated ones that are</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1558</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 existing in our Essential Drug List (EDL). We need to review our EDL that is used by the Ministry of Health so that we can have new medications that are available in the market to treat NCDs. Mr. Speaker, we need to work together to combat NCDs in Fiji and I urge us, as leaders, to take the lead role. One of the things to change in this Parliament is, we need to move away from morning tea to healthy break. Now, we are having two tea breaks and one lunch break. We can have morning tea and fruits.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Healthy break:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Yes, healthy breaks, as they do in other jurisdictions.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, I also urge us, as leaders, to take the lead role and devote, at least, one hour during Parliament session and lead by example, so having a touch rugby match between the Government and Opposition side during lunch break. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, this is not something to laugh about. If we laugh here, people will not take us seriously outside and that is why this burden is on our healthcare system. We need to lead by example, we cannot be sitting idle and expecting the general populace to be looking after their health when we do not do anything. So, from September, Mr. Speaker, I urge the Government and Opposition MPs, let us have a friendly touch rugby game for, at least, one hour per week. MR. SPEAKER.- I think you should speak to your colleague there, honourable Ketan Lal. He was the one who pleaded in the House Committee that we bring back the lunch and everything. Maybe, he is getting good advice from honourable Koya. They want to have lunch again in the House and all that, and now you are saying ‘no’ to morning tea.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A.

RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to respond to the</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1559 statement from the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. I appreciate the honourable Minister's attention to NCD and the insights provided by the STEPS Survey that was conducted. I believe the last one was in 2011 when honourable Usamate was the Minister for Health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the data presented this morning is, indeed, alarming and our health system needs restructuring to meet the present health challenges and to create legislation that aids the process is undeniably a step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, reviewing legislations and reviewing health promotion is merely part of the solutions required. Health system evaluation is a complex undertaking, and a detailed multi-pronged approach is required. The evaluation must not only involve health outcomes, but also take into account professional viewpoint, our patients’ experience and the influence on the systemic social issues - the real issues affecting our people. Importantly, health promotions should not just be about circulating message of healthy practices but should also address the social determinants of health, and this is where legislative and intellectual play a vital role in a formative policy development. We must consider vital factors, like the income level of our people, the effects of raising VAT on ordinary Fijians, the level of education, employment status and the acceptable minimum wage, also with housing condition and the access to a balanced nutritional diet which is mostly expensive, all of which influence our physical, mental and our spiritual health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to neglect these factors, we would be failing to address the root cause of many health problems in our nation. Furthermore, the focus should not be only battling the disease but also investing in preventive strategies. I strongly believe that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, let us put our answers in the right place. By encouraging early screening, regular health check and promoting healthy lifestyle, we can help prevent NCD and improve the health outcome of our citizens. Lastly, the data presented this morning by the honourable Minister through the STEP survey should form a bedrock of our policy decision. It is essential that the survey findings are not only considered and appreciated but to be effectively integrated into our national health intervention (as alluded to by the honourable Minister), the National Wellness Strategic Plan. So, having that strategic plan and the right resource level is required, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While I commend the honourable Minister for Health’s effort to tackle NCDs, let us not lose sight of the bigger picture. It is not just about improving our health system or creating legislation, but about building a healthier Fiji. It is a mammoth task but can be achieved if we start now. Our people are dying prematurely - wives, husbands, with their children left behind. It is a heart-breaking experience, and in many cases, children go astray in the wrong path in search for the love they lost permanently due to their loss. I encourage each honourable Member and every Fijian alike, let us work together towards a vision of a healthy Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, in listening to your debate on this issue of health, we should all be proud that today sees to the coming in of the new Emoluments Agreement, especially to do with health cover. This was one of the things that interested me in the way you were discussing the Emoluments Programme and, especially, where I came across two cases where two of our honourable colleagues almost died here - honourable Prakash and honourable Joseph Nand, who was sent on a separate case to the hospital and had to pay from his own pocket about more than $3,000 because he was not covered. In the previous Parliament, we used to be covered and that kind of protected us. So, please,</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1560</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 as from today, make an effort in trying to find the group that best suits your individual party sides, or come to an agreement that you have a common policy that covers all of you, honourable Members. I am not covered, as well as others who are not Members of this Parliament, but for Members of Parliament, you are covered under this new agreement that comes into effect this week or today. That is also something that I want to share. Members of the public will not realise what is happening here. We have very serious cases of people collapsing, severely suffering and taken to the hospital. They are already sick, and they have to pay extra expenses again. To have test results, tests undertaken at the CWM Hospital, you have to pay from your own pockets, like honourable Joseph Nand and our colleague honourable Prakash, who is recuperating in prison somewhere in Fiji. They suffered as well, but they had to pay from their own pockets for the tests, et cetera. Honourable Members, you do not realise this until you are admitted. You have to pay for everything, and if you are covered, be grateful to the honourable Minister for Finance that this has come through. This is to take care of you. I hope I am clear on this. There is a big work to be undertaken by each and every one of you in trying to identify what product that will work well for you and also for your own pocket. Back-to-Back Meetings - Pacific Women Leaders Meetings in the Marshall Islands HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and our viewers who are watching online; muru le’a bula, namaste, noa’ia e mauri. I am pleased to share today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the highlights of Fiji’s participation in the 15 th Triennial Conference of Pacific Women, the 8 th Meeting of Pacific Ministers for Women and the 3 rd Pacific Islands Forum Women Leaders Meeting. These significant events happened back-to-back from 22 nd July, 2024 to 26 th July, 2024 in Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I attended these forums, along with our Acting Director for Women. Before I do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to share a personal reflection. This being the first time I have set foot in the Marshall Islands, I have only read about it, I have only heard about it, but to be present and to somewhat comprehend it, it is nothing short of emotionally overwhelming. And I am referring to the nuclear legacy that the Marshall Islands have endured and continue to deal with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Americans tested a total of 67 nuclear bombs in Bikini Atoll, and to this day, there is a concrete nuclear waste storage facility, which is apparently leaking. This is the backdrop, Mr. Speaker, to understand the context of the repercussions on the health, the livelihoods and the very survival of the people of the Marshall Islands. I wish to take this time to remember those who lost their lives in a most horrific way, and the families who continue to endure the effects of the fallout for the last few decades. Mr. Speaker, Sir, stories are told about the first nuclear bomb being detonated and the immediate fallout, and the villagers in the nearby atoll ran out as they saw what they called, “snow falling from the sky.” They had never seen it before. They played in the “snow”, only to experience the burning effects a few minutes later. From there, they were taken to ships where they were then observed and stayed on for months. Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with the people of the Marshall Islands as they continue to advocate against the injustices they face and the fight for climate justice, not just for the people of the Marshall Islands, but for our entire Blue Pacific.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1561 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Triennial Conference of Pacific Women, which was funded by the Pacific Community (SPC) is a remarkable assembly that brings together policy makers, women’s rights and civil society organisations, development partners and relevant institutions from across our region. Since its inception more than 40 years ago, this Triennial Conference has been a cornerstone in our pursuit of gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls. Every three years, we come together to assess our progress and advance our efforts towards gender equality. Of course, the adoption of the Pacific Platform for Action for Gender Equality and Women’s Human Rights 2018-2030 has provided a clear roadmap for our efforts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year’s conference was especially significant as it coincided with the global commemoration of the 30 th anniversary and review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (Beijing +30). This highlights the importance of this Triennial Conference as the primary mechanism for monitoring our progress of the Beijing Declaration and the Pacific Platform for Action. Mr. Speaker, I will share with this august House that this momentum will continue building through to November 2024, as I have mentioned, in support of the moving of the Parliament Sitting from November to December. This is happening in Thailand for the Asia and Pacific Regional review, leading up to the Commission on the Status of Women in New York in March next year. Mr. Speaker, on that note, I am pleased to report that Fiji actively participated in this Triennial Conference through engagement at multiple high level plenary sessions on relevant topics, bilateral meetings and, of course, interventions during the Pacific Women’s’ Ministers Forum. Mr. Speaker, notable was the attendance of the only Pacific Head of State, the honourable Prime Minister of Tuvalu, Feleti Teo, who is also the Minister for Women. On this note, I thank our honourable Prime Minister for agreeing to act in my absence as the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, showing his continued commitment to gender equality. Our collective discussions, Mr. Speaker, confirmed that, of course, gender-based violence continues to be a great issue for all of us. We continue to have the same statistics of two out of three women, compared to the global average of only one out of three women. It is deeply concerning that we are underrepresented in leadership roles across all sectors in our political systems. Mr. Speaker, on this note, I wish to thank you and thank the Parliament of Fiji for hosting the Women Mock Parliament over a week ago, that saw 55 women from across the country, here, convening the second only Women Mock Parliament in the history of Fiji, the first being in 2016, Mr. Speaker. I am the only alumni that is in Parliament today and I challenge the women who attended the Women Mock Parliament that, hopefully, there will be more of them who will join us in this august House. We are also battling the high rate of reproductive cancers, as well as ongoing issues related to HIV and AIDS and teenage pregnancy. All these challenges are happening against the backdrop of a climate crisis, which always disproportionately affect women and girls. Mr. Speaker, as part of Fiji’s Country Statement, we underline our progress in preparing for Beijing+30. Strong policies and legal frameworks have been crucial in safeguarding women’s rights here in Fiji, and creating an environment where Fijian women and girls can thrive. Notably, female students now make up 57 percent of our graduates in tertiary institutions, outplaying male students at 43 percent. However, as we all know, women are still under-represented in labour force, so it is not converting into jobs, even though we outnumber males in graduates.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1562</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 Although we celebrate this educational achievement, we need equal participation in the formal economy, access to financial resources, and leadership roles in both, public and private spheres. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, we underscored Fiji’s commitment to our continued work on a whole of Government evidence-based and transformative approach. As you know, we continue to implement the National Action Plan to Prevent Gender-Based Violence against All Women and Girls in developing the upcoming Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment National Plan. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to share that following the Country Statement, Fiji also took several important interventions. So, at this Conference, there was the introduction of a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Framework so that we can monitor and evaluate the work to advance gender equality in the region. And we asked that there be a creation of a knowledge hub, where we can access information, as Women Ministers do not continue forever but when there are new Ministers that come in, they can access this information and be updated as to what is happening in the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, additionally, we advocated and proposed for the creation of a regional working group to specifically focus on technology facilitated gender-based violence or online which, as we know, Mr. Speaker, is now the crime of the 21 st century. We emphasise the importance of collaborative approaches so that we have laws and policies that hold to account not only perpetrators, Mr. Speaker, but also technology companies - large tech companies, that profit from online activity. We also need to look at our regulatory bodies, Mr. Speaker, and our laws to be reviewed so that we can protect our people from technology facilitated gender-based violence. Mr. Speaker, if our honourable Members have not heard a word I have said up to this point, I would like to proudly share that for the very first time, after we lobbied last year at the Pacific Women Ministers Meeting, the Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is leaving Geneva for the first time. They have always met in Geneva, but upon Fiji’s lobbying, they have agreed to not only leave Geneva but to come to the Pacific to convene an extraordinary session, and this will be taking place in Fiji in April next year. We announced this at the Women Ministers Forum in the Marshall Islands. This proposal, Mr. Speaker, allows us to host this special session in Fiji and, of course, preparatory work will commence with SPC, the relevant Government agencies and other partners, to ensure that this extraordinary session is successful. The CEDAW Committee, Mr. Speaker, comprises of 23 independent experts and women’s rights from around the world, and they are monitoring the implementation of the Convention on CEDAW, which 12 Pacific Islands Countries have ratified. Mr. Speaker, this is really significant, following the endorsement by our Pacific Leaders on the Gender Equality Declaration and, of course, the launch of our 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent in which gender equality and social inclusion are regional priorities. We concluded, Mr. Speaker, the conferences and Ministers meetings with outcomes documents that encompasses reflecting on how far we have come and what are our unique challenges that we now face in the 21 st century. In this period, Mr. Speaker, we, the Ministers for Women, on behalf of our governments, affirm our commitment to the effective implementation of the Pacific Gender Equality Pledge and Beijing Declaration and Platforms for Action. And we did get personal commitment from the honourable Prime Minister of Tuvalu, that as he attends the Leaders Meeting this month, that he will certainly be our advocate to present our outcomes document.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1563 Fiji’s participation and engagement at the Triennial Conference, as well as the Pacific Women Ministers’ Meeting, underscores the importance of our collective efforts in achieving our gender equality goals. Of course, the historic event of hosting the CEDAW Committee next year here in Fiji, shows Fiji’s active involvement in continued advocacy and dedication to addressing the critical issues - gender-based violence, women economic empowerment, women in climate justice and, of course, women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights and women’s health. We will continue to do so, Sir, as a flagship initiative and an example to the Pacific because we do a key whole of Government and whole of society evidence-based approach which our Pacific Island countries wish to learn from and, of course, fostering partnerships with our Pacific Women Ministers and Civil Society Organisations to continue progress in this regard. Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I thank you, honourable Members, for your attention. Vinaka vakalevu, dhanyavaad and faiaksea. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen; I would like to first, thank, the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection for your comprehensive update on the Triennial Conference of Pacific Women in the eighth Pacific Women’s meeting. The convening of this significant events in the Republic of Marshall Islands underscores the collective commitment of our region to advancing gender equality and human rights. The Triennial Conference of Pacific Women has long been a cornerstone for evaluating our progress and addressing the persistent challenges in achieving gender equality. The adoption of the Pacific Platform for Action for Gender Equality and Humans Rights has provided us with a robust framework to guide our efforts. This year’s conference is particularly momentous as it aligns with the global review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, re-enforcing our dedication to these critical issues. Despite the progress made over the past decade, it is evident that gender discrimination and equalities remain deeply entrenched in our societies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, women in the Pacific continue to face significant barriers, including disproportionate representation in low wage jobs, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, high rates of violence and low political representation. These challenges are complex and multifaceted, requiring a concerted and sustained effort from all sectors of society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we know, violence against women and girls is one of the world’s gravest human rights violations. As alluded to by the honourable Minister, globally, one in three women experience physical and sexual violence from a partner in their lifetime. Fiji has some of the highest rates of violence against women in the world. We know that two in three women in Fiji have experienced physical or sexual violence from a male intimate partner in their lifetime. To address this alarming rates of violence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needed to take a bold step to accelerate prevention efforts already underway. In 2020, we embarked on the historical journey as a nation to become the first Pacific Island country to have a National Action Plan to prevent violence against women and girls. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look forward to the comprehensive outcomes document from the Conference, it is imperatives that we consolidate the critical priorities and commitments identified. This document will serve as a strategic guide for our regional efforts over the next three years,</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1564</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 shaping our priorities, leading up to the 69 th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women, and informing our statements in both Bangkok and New York. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are talking about improving the lives of our women, children and girls, I am a bit disappointed with the recent delays in the social welfare allowances recently, Sir, especially to those elderly who are vulnerable citizens who entirely rely on the allowances for their daily needs. The Ministry’s statement attributing the delay to the transition of the Government’s new financial year is not sufficient to alleviate the frustration and inconvenience caused. While we appreciate the Ministry’s apology and efforts to expedite the process, it is crucial that such delays do not occur in the future. Our people deserve better, and it is imperative that the Ministry of Finance improves its systems and communication to ensure timely and reliable disbursement of funds. We ask the Ministry to prioritise the needs of our social welfare recipients and take immediate action to prevent any further delays. The wellbeing of our citizens should always be the top priority. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the efforts of all delegates, civil society organisations, development partners and UN agencies for their unwavering commitment to gender equality. Together, we can foster sustained progress towards achieving gender parity in the Pacific, ensuring that every woman and girl can exercise their human rights and live up to her full potential. MR. CHAIRMAN.- I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. Mr. Speaker Sir, at the outset, I thank the honourable Minister for a thorough and comprehensive update on her Report on the 15th Triennial Conference of Pacific Women and the Pacific Women Ministers’ Meeting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this gathering marks a crucial milestone in the region’s ongoing pursuit of gender parity. Sir, I fully agree with the honourable Minister on the importance of this meeting and how vital it is towards providing empowerment and equal opportunities for women in Fiji and around the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do understand that in 1994, the Triennial Conference adopted the Pacific Platform for Action (PPA) for the advancement of women, and given Fiji’s position in the Pacific, we play a key role in taking key actions regarding the PPA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this PPA we, as a nation, still have a lot of work to do, to ensure the equal participation of women in aspects of development and decision-making in workplaces and other areas of life. As a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must take a lead role in empowering women in the Pacific and in the Oceania Region, and Government should be at the forefront of playing an active role in providing a safe environment for our women to prosper. Sir, a woman will only prosper if we work together as a nation, the leaders and community to provide an environment that is very conducive for our women and, at the same time, boost their confidence and excel in all areas of life in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can have as many conferences as we can, engage people in numerous awareness sessions for equality towards women participation, but if we do not provide the right</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1565 environment and offer the support they deserve, we will not achieve our goals and ambitions for equality of women participation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection for attending the Conference and I also would like to thank the hard work that she is doing in her Ministry. Vinaka va’levu, honourable ‘Auvu. Initiatives Undertaken by the Fiji Corrections Service HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Group of 9 Block and its leader and honourable Members of Parliament; ni sa bula vinaka, Saka. Bula vinaka to those of you who are listening from the comfort of your homes and around the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is with profound honour and a deep sense of responsibility that I address this august Assembly today. As the custodian of justice in our beloved nation, the Ministry of Justice has been steadfast in its mission to uphold the principles of justice, integrity and accountability. The Ministry’s accomplishment over the past months are not merely milestones, but indicative of our relentless pursuit of excellence in the public service. Unwavering commitment to the rule of law and our dedication to serving the people of Fiji underpin the very initiative and every effort that we undertake. The realm of public governance - the Ministry of Justice, stands as a beacon of hope and a pillar of democracy. Our endeavours are guided by the strategic vision. It seeks to harmonise the inspirations of our citizens with the imperative of justice and the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me outline the initiatives undertaken by the Fiji Corrections Service. The Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service has unveiled a robust reform plan, aimed at transforming the Fiji Corrections Service organisation structure and operations. This initiative addresses critical challenges relating to leadership, staffing and procedural alignment with the budgetary allocations. The fifth focus of the reform include: (1) The organisational restructuring - the organisation will review and restructure to align with the budgetary allocation approved by Parliament, addressing issues of overstaffing and leadership gaps. (2) Capacity building - an assessment and enhancement of capacity of Senior Managers and Corrections Officers will be conducted to support and drive the necessary reforms. (3) Staff training - ongoing training programmes will be implemented to ensure staff are equipped with up-to-date correctional practices, keeping pace with the evolving profiles of offenders. (4) Safety and rehabilitation - Fiji Corrections Service will strengthen the core functions of safety and security within the facilities while integrating effective rehabilitation processes. (5) Principle of Accountability Measures - there will be rigorous accountability measures which will be enforced on all levels of the service to ensure adherence to policies and procedures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to guide this reform over the next year, a transitional team comprising of experienced former Fiji Corrections Officers has been established. The mandate includes developing a detailed reform agenda and a proposed staff establishment, which will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. At the end of the transition period, a new management team will take</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1566</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 over to drive improvement in the Fiji Corrections Service over the next five years. On the realignment of security and standard of discipline, this concerns the enforcement of discipline to inculcate the habits of good behaviour, more accountable and transparent in the treatment of offenders, especially the provision of safe, secure and humane facilities in line with international best practices. The Fiji Corrections Service is also undertaking its legislative reform and review of its own legislations. There have been discussions with the honourable Attorney-General on the review of the Corrections Act. Also, a key part of this overview is the review of the prison industries. This has been pursued to propose commercialisation of Fiji Corrections industries, transitioning them into public enterprises managed by a Board of Directors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, the Fiji Corrections Service operates several industries including joinery, tailoring, piggery, poultry and farm produce, generating about $100,000 per month. Due to Government controlled pricing and outdated machinery, there are constraints on productivity and quality. The rationale of commercialisation stems from the financial stability and profit retention. To increase profitability, commercialisation will allow Fiji Corrections Service to operate with greater financial autonomy, setting competitive prices and expanding market reach. We will also talk about re-investment and rehabilitation. Profits can be retained and re-invested into Corrections facilities to enhance rehabilitation programmes, update machinery and provide post-release support. What are the expected outcomes? First and foremost are the financial benefits – increased revenue and cost saving. The commercial prison is expected to significantly boost revenue and enhance efficiency, contributing to national economic growth. On social and rehabilitative impacts, it is important that we enhance rehabilitation and job creation. Improved training facilities and expanded service will lead to better reintegration outcomes for inmates and increase employment opportunities within the Corrections system. The commercialisation of the Fiji Corrections Service industries presents a strategic opportunity to boost financial stability, improve rehabilitative outcomes and expand services of offering. Consultations will be with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Trade will proceed in the future. One of the major initiatives that has been proposed is to convert the Rakiraki Temporary Corrections Centre into a permanent rehabilitation centre. The practised temporary deployment during the cane cutting season places a lot of demand on our resources. This conversion focussed on the implementation of comprehensive farming programmes designed to provide inmates with available skills and facilities and their integration into society. Apart from cane cutting, the inmates can be engaged for planting throughout the year. They have engaged with key stakeholders, and we are working on a joint Cabinet paper with the Ministry of Sugar to secure government approval of this initiative. This project is a testament of our commitment to create a sustainable and effective rehabilitation opportunities for those in the correctional system as well as contributing to national economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I touch on the challenges posed by hard drugs. The drug trade in Fiji involves two main groups - drug trafficking and drug users. Drug trafficking typically have the financial means to establish and maintain supply lines from source countries to Fiji. Meanwhile, the</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1567 user base, predominantly consist of young people including students who fall into the addiction and often become distributors themselves to support their drug use. This cycle of dependency and distribution is particularly alarming. One of the most concerning outcomes of this cycle is the rise in HIV positive cases directly linked to the sharing of needles amongst drug users. This practice exacerbates the public health crisis we are facing. Within our correctional facilities, we are struggling to maintain the use of smuggling of drugs. Our remand centres in particular, face significant challenges due to the high turnover population. Inmates under the influence of hard drugs often exhibit aggressive behaviour, creating a volatile environment for both, staff and other inmates. Despite stringent security measures, drugs continue to be confiscated from various drop off points around our facilities. The increasing use of needles for drug injection is primarily contributed to the spike of HIV among inmates. This, coupled with the deterioration of mental faculties among drug users presents a substantial challenge for the Fiji Corrections Service. We remain committed to addressing these issues through rigorous measures and heightened vigilance but recognise the need for border community support. We call upon parents, educators, community leaders to join in combating this crisis. Preventing drug abuse begins with education and awareness. By working together, we can help prevent the spread of addiction and its associated harms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may highlight and acknowledge the hard work done by few individuals in the organisation namely Kalesi Volatabu, Drug Free World in Fiji. I also endorse the community leaders, church leaders for honest conversation of this issue. I also endorse the hard work done by Raymond Tabuya Foundation, who works with young drug users in Nabua. In terms of the collaboration with development partners, in our continued efforts to enhance the Fiji Corrections Service, we have sought collaboration with international development partners. We are in discussion with the Australian High Commission and other stakeholders to secure support for constructing a specialised rehabilitation facility. This facility will cater for drug and sexual offenders, mentally ill inmates and provide skilled-based training programmes. We are also seeking a secondment of an expert from our development partners to assist in the scoping phase of this project, ensuring that we align with the global best practices in corrections and rehabilitation. What are the future development plans for the Fiji Corrections Service? The development of a drug rehabilitation centre, the establishment of the proposed Rakiraki Corrections Centre, extension of the Levuka land boundary, establishing partnership with New Zealand to support sniffer dog capability and to restrain control training, the commercialisation and partnership with private entities, the digitisation of staff and prison records, staff training and resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to continue my Ministerial Statement but outlining some of the success stories in terms of the service by the Ministry of Justice. In 2013, a lady born on 1 st January, 1958 became bedridden at the age of 55. By 2018, when she turned 60, her family sought financial assistance from Social Welfare. However, they faced a significant hurdle, the need for her birth certificate. Despite visiting the Ministry of Justice’s office five times, they received no response. The previous government continually turned them away, this family had travelled all the way from a maritime island making their plight even more challenging. During one of my talanoa session at Raiwai Community Hall, the family brought this issue to our attention. The Coalition Government committed to addressing such injustices took immediate innovative action to assist the family. Through the concerted efforts of my Ministry, we ensured that the lady finally received her birth</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1568</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 certificate. I am proud to report that she is now one of our social welfare recipients. This story is a testament of our Government's dedication to serving the people, especially those who have been neglected for far too long. It highlights the positive changes we can achieve through empathy, commitment and proactive governance. There is another story, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share. A compelling story that illustrates the dedication, innovative approach of our current Government in serving the people of Fiji. A male child born in Fiji on 27th March, 1975, tragically passed away in Ethiopia in November 1984 at a young age of nine. His body was brought to Fiji for burial. Since 2014, his relatives have been travelling from overseas at a great expense to obtain official confirmation from our government that his birth record is now marked as deceased. Despite their efforts, the previous administration failed to take any innovative steps to assist them. During one of my talanoa sessions in Koronivia on the 3rd Sunday of July last month, the relatives shared their heartbreaking story, they expressed that they had lost all hope. I advised them to visit the Registrar General’s Office assuring them that our current officers are capable of thinking outside the box and willing to assist. Following my advice, my officers at Registrar General’s Office took immediate action to assist the family. They were able to confirm the deceased status of the birth record through liaison with the Fiji Corrections Service, brining immense relief and joy to the relatives. This crucial step now allows them to proceed with the necessary legal process for their family properties in court. Mr. Speaker, this story highlights our Ministry’s commitment to creating meaningful change. We are dedicated to ensuring that all Fijians can witness the positive transformation from being implemented by this Coalition Government. Our innovative and compassionate approach is making a real difference in the lives of citizens, restoring their faith in the system, enabling them to move forward with their lives.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
