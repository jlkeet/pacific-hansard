K.K. LAL.- Thank you Minister:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> Recognising the importance of education and the right of every child to receive it, we took swift action. I am pleased to announce that the child has now received his birth certificate and he has enrolled in Year One at Saint John Bosco Primary School, Nepani. This achievement not only marks the beginning of an educational journey but also restores hope for his future. Mr. Speaker, this story exemplifies our commitment to ensuring that every Fijian has access to their fundamental rights and opportunities. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Vinaka ex-AG! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Our Government's dedication to addressing the needs of our citizens… HON. S. TUBUNA.- Listen, listen! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- … especially the most vulnerable is transforming the life, enforcing a bright future for all. Mr. Speaker, this morning, we heard the honourable Prime Minister, measures being taken to uplift the service commitment of our Civil Service. All we are saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of execution, you just have to be humane, nothing more, nothing less. Respect your officers, give them the dignity and that includes inmates who are in prison because one day they will be released. I would like to share too, that I have had a wonderful opportunity of exchanges with some of our inmates who had spent over 20 to 23 years in prison. There are plans in terms of going into a farming project in Naitasiri and my Ministry is committed to assisting them because all we want is to see change. I recall reading through the speech of the Prime Minister of United Kingdom. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he brought in as his Minister for Justice a businessman who had a business of employing ex- offenders. What they shared is, “we are so committed into the issue of sentencing, punishment, punishment, punishment. It is time to look the other way around and that is what we are committed to do at the Ministry of Justice and this Government is to care for those members of the society, the young, the old, the sickly who are in prison and provide them another opportunity. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to highlight some of the activities undertaken by the Ministry of Justice. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate.</p><h4>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am representing the Opposition Bloc 16, that includes</h4><p>the plus two.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Minus two:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as the Shadow Minister for Justice...</p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1570</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 HON. K. K. LAL.- … I acknowledge the Government’s recent efforts to introduce new policies within the Fiji Corrections Service. While, Mr. Speaker, these initiatives are commendable, it is crucial to ensure that they uphold the fundamental rights and dignity of all individuals, both within and outside the prison system. Recent events and incidents such as the unauthorised release of a photo involving the suspended of Commissioner of Police...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.-..:</span> by a Corrections Officer underscores significant concerns regarding privacy, dignity and human rights. These incidents, Mr. Speaker, Sir, although investigated by the Corrections facility, highlights a broader issue of respecting the privacy, rights of all Fijians. It is imperative that the Government implements robust measures to prevent such breaches and to ensure accountability when they occur.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, privacy is a fundamental human right and it is not a hogwash. (Laughter) Enshrined in international human rights standards and must be respected for all Fijians whether they are incarcerated or living freely in society, it is vital that our Corrections policies reflect this commitment to human rights and privacy protection ensuring that every citizen’s dignity is upheld. Mr. Speaker, Sir, any new policy must, therefore, prioritise the well-being and rehabilitation efforts of prisoners, ensuring they are treated with dignity and respect. Also, reports of violence perpetrated by a Prison Officer and overcrowding in Remand Centres demand urgent attention. The use of violence within Correctional facilities is unacceptable and undermines the very purpose of this institution which is to rehabilitate and reform individuals. It is vital that we establish and enforce strict guidelines to prevent such occurrences and hold those responsible accountable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister for Justice, overcrowding is another critical issue that exacerbates the challenges faced by our Correctional system. It poses significant risk to health and safety of both inmates and staff while also hindering the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes. We need comprehensive strategies to address this issue including exploring alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offences and investing in infrastructure to accommodate the growing prison population. It is incumbent upon the Minister for Justice to ensure that justice is served to all citizens of Fiji, regardless of their circumstances. The recent shortcomings within the Fiji Corrections Service highlights a failure in leadership and oversight. It is the honourable Minister’s responsibility to guarantee that every individual’s rights are observed and protected whether they are free citizens or incarcerated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of action in addressing these issues, such as privacy breaches, violence and overcrowding in our correctional facilities, reflects a troubling disregard for human rights and justice. The honourable Minister must be held accountable, ensuring that the Corrections system operates with integrity and in alignment with our nation’s commitment to upholding the dignity and rights of every individual. Failure to do so, undermines public confidence in our justice system and the Government’s ability to administer fair and just policies.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1571 Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I support initiatives aimed at improving our Corrections Service, I urge the Coalition Government to place a stronger emphasis on safeguarding privacy and human rights. Let us ensure that our policies, not only manage correctional facilities efficiently, but also uphold the values of justice and human dignity for all Fijians. Vinaka. MR. SPEAKER.- No wonder, I see your picture in the court house everyday. I will now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc, or his designate. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is difficult to be speaking after the honourable Minister for Justice and his Shadow Minister here because all that needs to be said on the matter at hand, I think has already been discussed by both of them. But I will just offer very short remarks on the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all striving to do business better, work better, be more efficient, do more with less, and in the Corrections Service, their return of investment or profit is about a successful rehabilitation and the release of inmates for a successful re-integration back into their homes and into the community. That is really the ROI for the organisation. The functions of the organisation is as follows: (1) (2) (3) for the safe and secure custody and care of those who are incarcerated in prisons; a very effective and humane rehabilitation programme; and is really an organisation that is not only a professional organisation, but an organisation that is staffed or have people who have the heart to change the lives of others who have gone offtrack. By this, I mean, they are really captains of lives - captains of lives that inmates would see, trust, believe and have the confidence to hear them and, perhaps, be influenced so that there is a change that takes place in their lives. So, these captains of lives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a key character is really to be ethic solid. You cannot be the captain of lives of others if you cannot be the captain of your own life. So, I am happy to hear there is a now a bigger effort in capacity building, in the training of staff, in these new reformed journeys that have been initiated by the new Commissioner and the honourable Minister for Justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Corrections, from my very limited experience, we can have all the best laws, we can have all the best people, but at the end of the day, it is that element of humanity - a respect for those who have gone offtrack and are given an opportunity to be taught, cared for and returned back to their homes and to their families, and they do not re-offend or come back. That would be the biggest challenge for any Corrections organisation including Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, my appeal to the honourable Minister is that as we journey to improve the way we do business, we care for those who are under our care inside the walls. It is very important that we keep to the very basic fundamental principles of: (1) that there is greater humanity within the Corrections Service. We have the right people who are put in place as good captains of lives who are ethic solid and can change the lives of those who are under their care. I applaud the honourable Minister and the new Commissioner for the work that they are undertaking to reform, change and move the organisation forward. I am a simple believer in changes - changes that are propelled forward, and it is about moving forward and doing things better.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>1572</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 I do not know any changes that takes us back, so it is very important that we have the right people in place that can drive these changes within the Corrections Service. That is the key for a professional organisation that can change the lives of others and return them back into the community successfully. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Update on the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, viewers who are watching this television broadcast live from their comfort zones; we stand at a crossroads. The great Martin Luther King Junior often spoke about institutional and systemic racism, saying that “true racial equality cannot be reached without radical structural changes in society”. However, if we are to unpack this in our context, whether it be race, religion, provincialism or whatever we use to segment ourselves, first and foremost, of the need for all our people to agree on what equality actually means, this was the key in the involvement of the Ministry of Youth and Sports in supporting the Ba Provincial Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival. Mr. Speaker, the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival can be best described as a transformative event that brought together the vibrant and diverse youth of the Ba Province, allowing them to emerge into a unified force for positive change. Just as a caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis to become a butterfly, this Festival served as a pivotal moment of transformation for our young people. It was a resounding success, showcasing the resilience, creativity, unity and potential of the youth in the Ba community. The Festival provided a platform for young people to showcase their talents, build connections and contribute to the development of their communities. Mr. Speaker, the primary objectives of this Festival is to: (1) Promote social cohesion and unity. By celebrating our cultural diversity, we aim to foster mutual respect and understanding among our youth, which is essential for a harmonious society. (2) Encourage active participation in sports. Physical activity is crucial for the wellbeing of our youth, and through these festivals, we are promoting healthy lifestyles while instilling values such as teamwork, leadership and discipline. (3) Provide a platform for artistic and cultural expression. Our youth festivals are an opportunity for young people to showcase their talents in dance, music and arts, thereby, preserving and promoting our rich cultural heritage. (4) Strengthen the respective Provincial and District Youth Councils. These festivals serve to rekindle the flames of youth development that has been dormant for the past many years, ensuring that youth become a force to reckon for community development. (5) Engage youth with stakeholders. The festivals service as a bridge between youth and various Government Ministries, NGOs and other stakeholders, providing access to resources and support on education, health, employment and social services. In alignment to the Ministry’s strategic direction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth festivals are a direct response to the National Youth Policy and the National Sports Physical Activity and Recreational Policy, which emphasises the importance of inclusive development, empowerment and active participation of young people in nation building. The policy outlines several strategic goals, including promoting healthy lifestyles through sports, encouraging artistic and cultural expression, and ensuring that youth from all ethnic backgrounds have equal opportunities to thrive. These festivals serve as a platform to actualise these goals by bringing together youth from diverse communities, engaging them in sports, arts, and</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1573 exhibitions, and providing them with the tools and opportunities to showcase their talents. As part of the Festival, the Ministry also organised a youth symposium focussed on unity, diversity and inclusivity. This symposium provided a forum for young people to discuss the challenges and opportunities related to these crucial themes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, participants engaged in thought-provoking discussions, shared their perspectives, and worked collaboratively to identify solutions that would enhance social cohesion and inclusivity in our communities. Mr. Speaker, the Festival featured a variety of events, including the Government Ministries and company roadshow, traditional music and dance performances, and a youth symposium focussed on important issues facing today’s youth. Mr. Speaker, participants engaged in discussions, workshops and activities aimed at promoting understanding, respect and unity among individuals from different backgrounds. In addition, to address the issue of drugs in our community, the Ministry of Youth and Sports is now ensuring that contents of Youth Festivals conducted in every Province to incorporate crosscutting objectives and the discussion of important issues that cut across our nation. Mr. Speaker, the festivals will include sports activities for youth to involve themselves in sports, showcasing their talents and urging them to participate in sports rather than involving themselves in illegal activities. Mr. Speaker, a good testament to this was the Vueti Kadavu Youth Festival that was held in Vunisea in December last year and opened by the honourable Prime Minister. In the same event, Sir, Kadavu Rugby Union was officially launched with the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation being the first woman president. From then, we have witnessed that a lot of our youth in Kadavu are now greatly engaged in rugby and other sports with the support of the Vanua, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very excited to report that the Vunisea Police Station has indicated yesterday a decline of 59 percent in the cultivation of marijuana and those caught in possession of marijuana. Mr. Speaker, the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival also included exciting competitions such as netball, rugby and volleyball tournaments, where teams competed fiercely for the top spots. The winners were awarded prizes and accolades for their outstanding performances and sportsmanship. The Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival concluded with a symposium that brought together youth from diverse backgrounds to discuss and address issues related to unity, diversity and inclusivity. Participants engaged in meaningful discussions, workshops and activities aimed at promoting understanding and acceptance of diversity. At the end of the three-day workshop, Mr. Speaker, Sir, participants of the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival symposium handed over their declaration to the Government of Fiji and to the Province of Ba. This declaration was carried out by all the youth of Ba who participated in this symposium, put into paper by the different races in the Ba Province. An emotional moment occurred when a young Ms. Lorenza Prakash, fluent in the Ba dialect and dressed in traditional iTaukei wear handed over their declaration to the Government and to the Province on Ba. The impact of the Ba multiethnic youth festival, like the others before it, has been overwhelmingly positive. The festival succeeded in bringing together youth from diverse</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1574</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 backgrounds, fostering a sense of unity and mutual respect. It provided an inclusive platform for youth to engage in sports, express their creativity, and access valuable resources and information. Feedback from participants and stakeholders has been encouraging, with many expressing their appreciation for the opportunity to be part of such a vibrant and inclusive event. The Festival has also sparked new initiatives and collaborations among youth groups, Government Ministries and NGOs, all aimed at furthering the development and empowerment of our young people. The success of the Ba festival is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, as well as the support and co-operation of our partners and stakeholders. It is also a reflection of the potential of our youth to contribute to the development and progress of our nation. At the end of the Festival, the Ministry donated more than $8,000 to the Ba Youth Council to help them in their operations. All this money was collected during the event from gate takings and other events during the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival was a celebration of unity, diversity and talent, bringing together young people from different backgrounds to create positive change in their communities. The Ministry extends its gratitude to all the teams, players, sponsors and supporters for making this event a memorable one. Mr. Speaker, I wish to extend my deepest gratitude to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, for graciously officiating the first ever Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival in Lautoka. With a significant portion of the population falling between the ages of 15 and 35, the Festival celebrated the diverse cultures and talents of the youth in the Ba Province. I would also like to thank the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government for supporting the event in my absence. My heartfelt appreciation also goes out to the dedicated staff of the Ministry of Youth and Sports for their exceptional efforts in organising the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival. Their unwavering dedication to fostering unity and celebrating diversity among our youth is truly commendable, and I am proud to have such a devoted team working towards the betterment of our nation. Mr. Speaker, moving forward, the Ministry of Youth and Sports is committed to continuing the Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival across Fiji. We recognize the importance of this event in promoting social cohesion, fostering talent and providing youth with the resources and support they need to succeed. We are also exploring ways to expand and enhance the Festival, including introducing new sports and activities, increasing the involvement of stakeholders, and providing more opportunities for youth to engage in meaningful dialogue on issues that affect them. The Ministry is also committed to ensuring that this Festival is accessible to all youth, regardless of their background or location, and we are working to bring this event even to the most remote areas of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival being conducted across Fiji, is a vital part of our efforts to empower our young people and promote unity and inclusiveness in our society. The Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival, like those before it, has demonstrated the power of these events to bring people together, celebrate diversity, and provide youth with the opportunities they need to thrive.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1575 As we continue to organise and expand these festivals, the Ministry of Youth and Sports remains committed to supporting the development of our youth, fostering their talents, and ensuring that they have the tools and resources to build a bright and prosperous future for themselves and for Fiji. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to provide this update and I look forward to continue to work with all stakeholders to support the development and empowerment of our young people. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports for highlighting the events at the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival. Definitely, the thematic area was Honouring Ancestral Wisdom and Empowering Women and Children, and it was a platform for youth to display their talents, resilience, creativity and potential to showcase their abilities to boost their networking and build potential collaboration with other like-minded youth, as well as work towards the development and betterment of society and our nation as a whole. Such platforms are critical to also boost the awareness of critical issues faced by our youth, such as the rise in criminal activities, drug use, human trafficking and the spread of HIV which is, sort of, on the rise. The Ba Province alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has a youth population of around 84,751 and this has shown participation of youth from the rural and the urban and had various ethnic groups involved. We can talk a lot about policies, festivals but the real demand is the call to action. If you look at it from a macro perspective about the youth, we, as legislators, cannot turn a blind eye to the issues currently faced by our youth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight in Parliament the complaints of violent behaviours in schools and school students who are seen in public places in their uniforms up to 8.00 p.m. till 9.00 p.m. as well. There are youth who have been victims of drugs. I am glad to see that the question I raised in Parliament about the drugs test kits has made headlines, with the honourable Minister for Education responding to some of the questions coming to him. Mr. Speaker, Sir, youth are also victims of being harassed and blackmailed on social media and I have raised this with the honourable Attorney-General as well on how we need to secure and restrict some of our networks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier last week, I visited Naloto District School. They had water contamination issue, and I would like to thank the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and our honourable Prime Minister for his very prompt response to my email. He reached out to the school and assured the school to look into the critical issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, suicide cases for the youths are high as well. Two days ago, someone had sent me a screenshot of a message of a Form 4 student, the late Mr. Terence Powell who committed suicide as what the message states. The youth death toll on our roads is also a concern as a 21-year- old from Tavua has been the recent victim. The youths want an education system that is not enslaved to political agenda. There were complaints about the TELS 50 percent penalty as well. The youths wanted an increase in allowance to be able to meet their daily expenses, and they are calling on the Government for urgent and strict measures with the drug issue and crime rate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youths demand a better healthcare system. I am sure the whole of Fiji was aware of the recent case of the late Miss Harshika Devi. Youths have raised concerns about youth unemployment as well. Majority of the youth have left for greener pastures, and we need to overturn this brain drain into brain gain. One of the recommendations for Government is to host a Youth Innovation Summit that pioneers innovation for a sustainable future, bringing together</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1576</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 thousands of participants from around Fiji; a platform that engages to bring outstanding young minds of Fiji to address some of the most pressing issues and challenges and propose innovative solutions. We need to empower the youth, provide them with the toolset and engage them in impactful projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to promote dialogue between youth, Government departments, NGOs, CSOs and other stakeholders. Provide them with awards and grants to make their visions come to reality. I believe in the potential of our young people to transform our beloved nation for the better. I believe in our young people, so should all of us as legislators. Mr. Speaker, Sir, are we doing enough for our youths? That is the question we need to ask ourselves. If this Government does not do it, we will do it in time to come. In a nutshell, young people everywhere deserve the power to get information, to connect and ask hard questions about justice, equality and opportunity and it is our job to listen to the youths and answer their concerns about education, employment and empowerment. I support the honourable Minister’s inclusive approach towards ethnic unity for all Fijians, and I assure the youths we are here to raise your voices and concerns and together we can work towards a transformative change for the betterment of our beloved nation. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports’ Ministerial Statement on the Ba Provincial Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival that was held in Lautoka on the 25 th to 27 th July, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I must commend the Ministry’s initiative in organising such an event and especially in bringing together the youths from various ethnic backgrounds in the Ba Province. Ba Province is perhaps the largest Province in Fiji, which occupies the North-West segment of the main island of Viti Levu and such event will enable the Ba youth to emerge into a unified force for a positive change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by the honourable Minister that the Ba Multi-Ethnic Youth Festival aims to address the rise in criminal activities, such as drug abuse, human trafficking and the spread of HIV/AIDS among youths in the Ba Province. With all that is happening in our beloved Fiji today, I strongly believe that these social issues must continue to be addressed amongst our Fijian youths and children as it hinders the progress of our nation. As alluded by the honourable Minister, the festival also provided a platform for youths to showcase their talents, build connections and contribute to the development of their communities. We need more of such events that will bring forth a change in the mindsets of our youths and enable them to work with groups from different ethnic backgrounds and contribute positively towards nation building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one important topic, apart from just promoting healthy lifestyle through sports that is often being overlooked is on healthy living lifestyle, simply promoting a well-balanced lifestyle to our youths. I urge the honourable Minister to include this topic in their workshops and any upcoming youth festival or event. The Ministry must take the lead role in advocating on healthy living. When youths take charge of their health, it will bring forth positive changes to our homes, communities and the nation. As mentioned by the honourable Minister, the extending of such festivals to other provinces is greatly welcomed.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1577 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.31p.m.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1578</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.31 p.m. Signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on US Tuna Treaty HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, I rise to deliver my Statement on the recent signing of the Memorandum of Understanding among the governments of certain Pacific Islands States including Fiji and the Government of the United States of America regarding fishing access terms for 2024; better known as the US Tuna Treaty. Mr. Speaker, in 1987, the Pacific Island Parties (PIPs) and the United States Government engaged in the 1987 Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America. Currently, parties to the treaty have been voluntarily applying the 2016 Amendments to the Treaty, which was developed in Fiji on the 3 rd December, 2016. Mr. Speaker, this Treaty was built on the aspects of fisheries access to the US per se in tuna fishing fleet in the Pacific Island countries and was reciprocated with financial distributions towards the promotion of economic development in the Pacific region. These Pacific Island Parties are the Governments of Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Mr. Speaker, the Treaty was primarily developed on the concepts of regional solidarity under the membership of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA). With the FFA being the Treaty’s administrator and PNG, being the depository. Mr. Speaker, all of the members benefitted based on the abundance of the highly migratory tuna stocks within their waters and the relative US purse seine, associated with fishing activities therein. It should be noted that within the FFA membership, exists the members of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) where the greatest fishing densities occur, and where there is more to gain from the Treaty. Mr. Speaker, please allow me to elaborate on the Memorandum of Understanding signed and agreed amendments to the Treaty. Under Article 9 of the Treaty titled the “Amendment of the Treaty” references that an amendment to the Treaty must be adopted on the approval of the parties and shall come into force upon receipt of the depository. Mr. Speaker, in order to allow for the fishing arrangement for the year 2024 to proceed, six amendments have been made and have to be signed off by the FFA membership. The amendments cater to the following: (1) Facilitation of observer services which allows for Pacific Island Parties to provide observers directly to the US purse seine fleet; (2) Agreement on adjusted fishing days which shall have an Upfront Days payment for the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) and can be negotiated later; (3) Adjustment of the Exploratory Pool of which Fiji is a member shall be paid US$6,000 for each fishing day;</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1579 (4) The five-day notification period to the FFA/PNA/Cook Islands on a new entrant of a US vessel to the Cook Islands; and (5) Standard text that nothing in the MOU shall prejudice the participants to the Treaty. Mr. Speaker, in order to fully appreciate this and the benefits to Fiji in real terms and noting Fiji’s pivotal involvement in the US Treaty negotiations, through the honourable Semi Koroilavesau, we saw US$16 million being provided each year to the FFA membership over the next 10 years based on the US Purse Seine activity in their waters.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, the present formula for distribution is:</h4><p>(1) $315,000 is paid as a management fee to the Secretariat, that being the FFA. (2) $950,000 is paid to the Secretariat to cover administration costs. Any unused funds are returned to Members with each Member receiving an equal share of any funds returned. (3) $2.5 million was held by the Secretariat for Project Development Fund payments with each Pacific Island Party receiving $156,250 under the last extension. (4) A payment of US$8,469 per day paid upfront to Pacific Islands Parties that contribute days to Vessel Day Scheme (VDS). (5) The remaining funds are distributed equally among the Pacific Island Parties. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to advise that on 24th July, 2024, having acquired Cabinet's endorsement, I had signed amended texts within the margin of the 23rd Annual Ministerial Forum Fisheries Committee at the FFA Headquarters in Honiara, Solomon Islands. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been advised with the process and to provide the same to the Treaty's depository in Papua New Guinea. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to-date, Fiji has received a total of US$1.7 million, monies received to close off the last six-year licensing period which was from 15th June, 2017 to 14th June, 2023. Note that the signing event will open the way to Fiji's share of the US$60 million, over the next 10 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the high turnover in the Ministry, these funds shall be allocated to upskill and capacity build incoming staff, and develop e-systems and reportings to allow for more ease of doing business in fisheries to our valued stakeholders and allow for an effective monitoring and evaluation system that shall properly identify the Ministry's contribution to GDP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in noting that this support, under the US Tuna Treaty, shall continue over the next 10 years, I will ensure that the necessary technical and structural supports are provided to our people, in relation to fisheries, reinforcing the concepts of supporting established Private Public Partnerships and co-operatives with the aim of commercialisation, whilst ensuring the sustainable development and the provision of alternate sources of protein to the nation. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first I wish to thank the honourable Minister for the Ministerial Statement concerning the US Tuna Treaty that was signed recently. As alluded to by the honourable Minister, the honourable Koroilavesau was given the responsibility to lead the negotiation. It was at a very difficult time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it was during COVID-19 when they started and most of the updates to the other member countries were done virtually because of the restrictions in travel back then. Of course, the subsequent meetings that was held in Denarau in 2021, that brought for the first time (while the negotiations were ongoing) all the parties</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>1580</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 beneficiaries, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, the members of the Forum Fisheries Agency which has its headquarters in Honiara. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what was interesting in that meeting in Denarau was the request made by the member countries for the increase in allocation and that led to more intense negotiation. But thankfully in the 2022 meeting in Palau, they were able to come to a comprise. Instead of $100 million, they came down to $60 million but perhaps the big challenge then (and I am thankful to the honourable Minister for clarifying this), was in the proportion of the distribution of the funds once it is secured. There was a lot of demand from the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) member countries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of their argument that most of the purse seine fisheries activities were happening in their fisheries area. They were demanding for more of the allocation and that was one of the very sensitive issues in the negotiations. But as alluded to by the honourable Minister, regional solidarity is so important and that was the lead role that Fiji took in trying to bring everyone together, even to a stage where they considered having the old formula for what was the previous rate and then later on, they can sort that out, but I am thankful that this has been sorted out. Madam Minister, you have highlighted how these funds will be utilised in the Ministry. Perhaps, just an advice or recommendation, as a former Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appreciate the funding, but it is given to the member States for a purpose, particularly for the development of the fisheries sector. When I was the Minister, I used to wonder how the funding for the Fisheries staff was sourced from because they were attending almost meeting in the region. I later found out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that instead of using these funds for the utilisation of the development of the fisheries sector, most of these funds were just utilised for the travel purposes of the staff. I put a stop to that. I asked the Permanent Secretary who is responsible for the finance, every time there is a request for these funds, we need to discuss it because we need a lot of funding to develop the seaweed, aquaculture and mariculture. This is the purpose in which it was given, and I hope, honourable Madam Minister, that you will have a tight control over this because it will benefit us a lot in the long term, particularly in development of the fisheries sector. Thank you, Madam Minister for the statement. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you honourable Minister for the Statement this afternoon. This Treaty is one that is always difficult to negotiate, the 17 Member States of FFA with United States of America. The Treaty, for those who do not know, it is a treaty where we allow the US purse seine vessels to come in and fish in FFA member country waters. Purse seine vessels, their target species is skipjack, and skipjack like in warmer waters, which means they fish more in the equatorial regions at the big EEZ of PNG, Kiribati and the Micronesian countries. Our target tuna species in Fiji is Albacore, it is deeper. Albacore likes a little bit more colder water. In the negotiations, it is usually difficult because those that have skipjack in abundance in their waters usually asked for more, but it benefits in Fiji in a sense that that chunk of money that is distributed equally, we get a share of it because we are members of FFA, even though they do not come down to our waters to fish because our target species is Albacore. I would like to congratulate the Ministry and FFA in general for negotiating this increase. There is always this big argument that the fish that the US purse seiners take out of our waters is</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>1581</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 much, much more than what they are giving us as a fee for their access to our waters. And tuna is a commodity, it is almost like whale when you think about how tuna is traded around the world. Tuna is a lucrative market because it is considered as a much healthier protein option than meat. The Pacific region, especially the FFA member countries’ waters is abundant in this tuna supply. I have been part of the negotiation a few years, when I was in the Ministry of Fisheries and Forests and I understand very much the difficulty, one, in negotiating with the United States, and two, because there are the other groupings within FFA and PNA members, and those countries like Fiji who do not have Skipjack, they do not come in and fish, but we still want to have our voice in there, but we are thankful that we get a share of the funds that are distributed equally to the Member States, even though we do not get funds from the fishing base because they do not come in and fish in our waters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have one suggestion or request to the Ministry, that in the money that is allocated to Fiji, that you should think about the Maritime Surveillance Centre. It requires a lot of money to buy the software, and a lot of the surveillance now for fisheries in our waters is done from there electronically. It is much cheaper but very effective. All the vessels that come in and fish in the FFA waters have vessel monitoring systems and it will be good if you can think about also assisting that Surveillance Centre with the money that we get. Congratulations on that negotiation and that increase is very much overdue. I am sure the negotiations in future, we will still try and get value for the amount of tuna that they take out of our waters, which is always difficult but not impossible negotiation. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the point provided by the Leader of the Opposition, I think it is very important to us here, to redirect the funds to other activities. It does, kind of, touch on the very idea that it was supposed to be used for. We saw the glaring example in the COP meetings. When you sit around, they will ask, “Where are you from?” We say, “We are from Fiji.” Then you ask around and found out they were funded by some groups in Fiji, SPREP, et cetera, or in the Pacific. So, we are not talking to each other, yet we are finding lots of people there. Even some have gone to the COP meeting by paying their own air fare. There is this gentleman in charge of the IRB. He paid his air fare there, he was not part of the Ministry’s delegation, but he went to there to try and learn as much as possible, and we were trying to help him since he was there. I really do not know, Deputy Prime Minister, how you will scrutinise all these. Really, it is a fairly new thing, having served for some time. You fully understand the protocol if go through, even if you want to attend this kind of meetings. If it is not part of your job description, then just stay out, let the others who should be there to be there. I am just kind of adding to the sentiments raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. You have the fund, let us hope it is not misdirected. We do respect your decision and your appointment in that position as Minister for Fisheries.</p></body>
