<body><h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3><h4>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members as usual we are nearing 4 o’clock, it is about time we do a bit of our housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with Standing Order with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of Government in Parliament to move his Suspension Motion. HON. LEADER OF GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move under Standing Order 6: That so much of Standing Order 23(1) is suspended so as to allow the House to sit beyond 4.30 p.m. today to complete the remaining items listed on today’s Order Paper.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we still have</p><h4>one or two questions including the written questions and also the motions before us.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion, if any. I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply. HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Thank you, Sir, I do not have any further comments. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I will now suspend proceedings and we will adjourn for tea and return when the bell is sounded. The House is adjourned. The Parliament adjourned at 3.56 p.m.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1595 The Parliament resumed at 4.30 p.m. State of Infrastructure – Sigatoka Valley Road (Question No. 138/2024) HON. A. N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister update Parliament on the state of the infrastructure regarding the bridges and roads in remote areas, in particular, the Sigatoka Valley Road? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sigatoka Valley Road is 77.16 kilometres in length, of which, 24.8 kilometres has been sealed in multiple sections. The seal starts from Sigatoka Town till Dreke Village Road Junction, which is approximately 23.1 kilometres. The Raunitogo School, Naviyago, Nalebaleba villages and Keyasi Government Station sections have also been sealed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are nine bridges and 17 crossings along the Valley Road. It includes the newly constructed and commissioned Matawale Bridge. Recently, works have been completed in upgrading the Tokotokoniga Crossing and repairs to Draiba Crossing, as most of these structures have exceeded the 50 years design and repairs and replacements are being planned to be included. In the budget for the current financial year, sealing works have been planned or earmarked for Koronisagana Village frontage. Survey and design for seal extension works will also be undertaken from Dreke to Nabaka (3 kilometres) section and Nabaka to Raunitogo (3 kilometres) in the current financial year. Renewal of Vatanabalavu Crossing has also been planned for this financial year or earmarked. The approach deck overlay is required to extend the structural integrity of the existing crossing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the design and specification works of Naqalo Crossing near to Nalebaleba Village on the way to Keyasi has been included in this year’s programme. The replacement of this crossing is required as the existing structure is not able to accommodate storm surges. During floods, there are no alternate routes, therefore, people are forced to wait until the water recedes. Logging and gravel extraction haulage in the area during the rainy weather gives more stress to the current road infrastructure. We will review the timelines for this Naqalo Crossing as appropriate given its critical role as far as the people of Navosa are concerned. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the current financial year, Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) has budgeted $120 million for the progressive cycle and periodic maintenance of road, bridges and jetties infrastructure; and $114.5 million for renewal of roads and services, bridges and crossings throughout the four divisions where part of this will cover the development of the Sigatoka Valley Road. In addition, $5 million has also been allocated to the Public Works Department to compliment the FRA on rural roads, institutional and community roads. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is regarding the road condition in some rural remote areas in Lautoka. I will name the areas; Viseisei Back Road, Vuda Back Road, Vaivai, Navula, Wairabetia and Paipai. There is also one bridge which is in very bad condition, that is, Vuda Back Road. It is dry season in the West, and I believe time is right to carry out the maintenance work because this road is used by the students, the farmers, the old people and the workers. What is stopping the maintenance of road in these areas? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you honourable Member, I had prepared the answer specifically for Sigatoka Valley as per the question. That is a new question, and I have not got an update for that one in terms of the information, but definitely, that is included in the cyclical</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1596 programme and maintenance. I have to admit that it is not perfect and in terms of the delivery of the rural roads currently handled by the private contractors with the Divisional Engineer West, which I met last week, and I also went through some of the areas to plug those gaps. As per the budget last year, we have started to receive the equipment for PWD and moving forward, definitely there will be improvements in the gaps between the current private contracts and what PWD will cover. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, this is not a question but just a comment. The Ratu Dovi Road from Coca Cola Factory to Sekoula Road, it is almost a perfect road, but FRA was repairing it and they left it in the middle of the works, therefore, causing a lot of havoc to the public and delays traffic and prone to accident. Can the honourable Minister look at that road and ensure that it is sorted out as soon as possible, please? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Is that the one in front of the Coca Cola factory onwards?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Correct:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I have expressed my disappointment with them and, definitely, not only you but other members of the public have expressed their concern. We have an issue with the supplier of the materials essential for making roads which is bitumen and asphalt. The sole supplier of bitumen in Fiji and some Pacific Islands is Technix Pacific (Pte) Limited. Priority of supply depends on the volume and demand from clients. He has ran out of bitumen for the last three weeks and expect to restore supply in the next three weeks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA has directed its contractors to source their own bitumen and some have ordered stocks to be shipped here. Long term solution, we are tendering into the local and international market. Currently, we are maintaining our sealed roads with other alternative materials. In the meantime, Ratu Dovi Road will be temporarily fixed with some asphalt overlay but will be completed when the new stock arrives in three weeks. HON. V. NATH.- I thank the honourable Minister for his comprehensive answer. Honourable Minister, there was a plan for Nabaka bridge and the road from Valley junction to Nabaka Primary School. I believe it was a priority when FijiFirst Government was there, but you have re-prioritised your plans on that. Of course, another bridge is Waya Bridge where during heavy rain, it does get flooded. What are your plans on these two bridges and road? HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, we have moved from Sigatoka Valley to all over Fiji, but I do not have details for that. We have provided as an answer to the written questions the plans. I mean, plans are plans, if there are you know urgencies in terms of changing situations or inclement weather, that definitely will be looked at.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Take him for a road tour:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yeah, that is right.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. The honourable Minister is beating around the bush. These two Bridges that I have mentioned it is on Valley Road. Nabaka is along Valley Road, as well as Waya Bridge.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.:</span> He doesn’t know.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1597 HON. V. NATH.- Yes, he doesn’t know. Do not beat around the bush!</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- It is all over Fiji now, honourable Nath. The way the questions have been</h4><p>put to the Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> As already explained, I will look into that too.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in Valley Road, Sigatoka.</p><p>Before that, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for … MR. SPEAKER.- I thought you were moving to Labasa now. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p>Before that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to the honourable Minister for upgrading the Caralevu/Kawakawa/Nabekavu/ Dogorua Road, thank you, honourable Minister. I would also like to thank the h1 Minister for Sugar for upgrading and fixing the Caralevu FSC Bridge in Labasa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kavanagasau Road which is on the East Bank of the Valley Road and runs from Laselase to Nabitu, and it goes through the settlement of Naroro, Yelava, Somosomo, Nawamagi, Nalagi, Narata, Nadrala, Kaisau, Mauvua, Raiwaqa and Nabitu. In these settlements, there are 32 vegetable farmers, 80 i-Taukei villagers, five primary schools, one secondary school and one health centre, hence with a population of more than 2,000 people. My question to the honourable Minister is that when will these roads be upgraded properly with proper drainage and at the sametime, in near future, if this road can be tarsealed? Thank you. HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, the short answer is that, it is included in the programmatic maintenance, as I have already explained. It is also in our list of roads as per the maintenance programme. as I have mentioned, it might probably be late or not up to what is normally expected and that is something we will work to address. Thank you. MOU with Peace Corps Fiji (Question No. 139/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Peace Corps Fiji and the Ministry? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. Firstly, allow me to provide some background information about the partnership with Peace Corps Fiji. We signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), following the approval by Cabinet on 15th July, 2024 and the signing ceremony will be done next week on 16th August, 2024. The signing coincides with the visit by the US Peace Corps Executive Leadership next week from 13th August to 19th August, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let me provide some background information. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Peace Corps was established</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>1598</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 in 1961 by the then President John Peace Gerald Kennedy, six weeks after his inauguration as President. On the back of two World Wars, America was yearning for peace and President Kennedy, by a Presidential Order, established the Peace Corps. The Government of Fiji and United States signed an agreement on 25th June, 1968 regarding the Peace Corps programme in Fiji. I believe many of us here know about the Peace Corps. Many of us have had the experiences with the Peace Corps. Some of us have had teachers who have been in Peace Corps and others like us in Verata, during the Verata Beef Scheme, we had Peace Corps volunteers helping us with the Verata Beef Scheme at the time. It is an organisation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that coordinates United States of America volunteers in Fiji to work with rural communities on projects that are focussed on economic development. The Peace Corps volunteers have worked in a variety of sectors including forestry, fisheries, agriculture, business development, health, education, technology, water and sanitation and youth development, to name a few. Their goal is to support community organisations, such as women and youth groups, to improve their project design and management skills. They have had a long, active and rich history of collaboration with the Ministry, Mr. Speaker, Sir. For the last three years, the Ministry has been a member of their Project Advisory Committee which meets quarterly and helps drive the direction of their volunteer service and relevant Peace Corps programme. The partnership arrangement between us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here are three main categories of the work that they are going to do. The first is they have response volunteers. They are under the Response Volunteer Programme. There is a pool of experienced professionals and former Peace Corps volunteers. There are seasoned professionals who come for a shorter term and can serve up to three to 12 months in high impact assignments identified by the Ministry. Second, is the Virtual Peace Corps volunteers. They are experienced professionals who can spent five to 15 hours per week, virtually supporting the Ministry’s teams and participants on improving economic empowerment initiatives. An area that the Ministry is keen to tap into is the digitalisation of our project proposal online system where project proposals initiated from the District levels are automated and mainstreamed through various approving officers in the Division to the Ministry’s Headquarters, and then to the Office of the Permanent Secretary for endorsement. We note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this plan has been long overdue. Past management have deliberated on it but, unfortunately, due to certain reasons, did not eventuate but now, we could see that it could foster an enabling environment for this initiative to come to fruition. Thirdly, the Peace Corps shares a common issue of co-operation with the Ministry on their community economic empowerment programme. While the Ministry’s income generating project has been in existence for a long time, it lacks many supportive mechanisms to ensure sustainability and scaling to gradually progress from subsistence to semi-commercial and then to commercial status. We see the Peace Corps volunteers having a great part in doing this with supporting the Ministry in project management training, income generation, financial literacy and personal money management through this partnership. Through these proposed agreements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will support the</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1599 community economic empowerment, driven by a Peace Corps volunteer in a particular rural community through the Self-Help Funding Programme. That Peace Corps volunteer with provide the necessary capacity building, project management training and financial literacy, and monitor and report back to the Ministry of the progress of this business initiative. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the Ministry is achieving its intention of Sustainable Development Goal 17 which is partnerships for the goals, that implementation of MOU between the Ministry and Peace Corps will certainly contribute to improving socio-economic opportunities and quality of life of our rural and maritime communities. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question. Some communities did have volunteers until COVID-19, their volunteers were withdrawn. Are there opportunities that they will be provided with Peace Corps volunteer since now, the MOU will be signed? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will certainly have a look at those communities that had their Peace Corps volunteers withdrawn and see how far the programme has progressed, and will take it on from there. MR. SPEAKER.- Also including Australia, I think? HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, I think a lot of us have had experience with Peace Corps in the past. We have been taught by Peace Corps. I had the pleasure of teaching with one when I was still a school teacher for two years. I am wondering honourable Minister and you might be aware whether it is limited to your Ministry or this advent of Peace Corps is across all other sectors? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there are some arrangements there that they can work with other Ministries as well, but this MOU is in particular to the programmes that we run in the Ministry. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the nineth Oral Question has been dropped in view of the Statement that was made earlier this morning. We will now move to the next Oral. You will notice, honourable Members, that there are lot more questions for today, given that we had a very short day on the visit of Her Excellency the President of the Republic of India. (Question No. 140/2024) withdrawn. Fiji’s Sustainable and Resilient Recovery Programme (Question No. 141/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Fiji Sustainable and Resilient Recovery Programme? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. The Sustainable and Resilient Recovery Programme was supported by Asian Development Bank (ADB) from 2021 to 2022, and this Programme has continued. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ADB has been a key strategic partner for development for Fiji for a very,</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>1600</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 very long time since 1970 and Fiji has partnered in numerous projects including roads, water, climate change related projects, budget support operations, and liquidity support for the national airline during COVID-19 and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ADB for core leading Budget Support Reform operations together with the World Bank. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are other possibilities now with the ADB and the World Bank and working with other development partners as well on some of the major projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are aware, the Government, on last Thursday, signed a loan agreement that will enable Government to receive a very concessional financing of US$70million from the ADB through the Budget Support Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget support financing is a new modality for accessing finance from development partners. This has been a great support for the Government after COVID-19, and in the last so many fiscal years. Some of these concessional financing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and budget support also refers to policy reform and it is useful for Government and for the country as a whole to use these budget support opportunities to undertake key policy reforms. In the last 18 months we have completed a number of policy reforms across different Ministries. The programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, supports Fiji’s efforts to restore fiscal sustainability and inclusive climate resilient growth, both undermined by COVID-19 pandemic and disasters. While building fiscal community and climate resilience to climate change and global shocks, it builds on the achievements of the reform programme, and one aspect of this programme was completed in 2020. The Government policy reforms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, falls in three areas. I will quickly and very briefly talk about those three reform areas: (1) Public Financial Management for fiscal resilience and debt sustainability. This includes review of the Financial Management Act, formulation of the Mid-Term Debt Management Strategy as part of the Fiscal Strategy which is presented to Parliament. Of course we had the Climate Change Act, the implementation and perhaps review of that Act and establishment of new tax information system for FRCS. (2) Public Policy for Community Resilience included gender-responsive budgeting which has been rolled-out to all Ministries as part of the budget process. The Social Assistance Policy was also part of this public policy for community resilience reform area and also the launch of the new market-based climate risk parametric, microinsurance project which is the first for the Pacific. (3) Enabling environment for resilience, private sector recovery. This supported the recovery of businesses and fostered a creation of new enterprises including the establishment of a two-year subsidy loan through the RBF, new regulations under the Companies Act and National Payment Systems Act. Some of the other details of the Budget support programme, for the Government is in coordination with other development partners is actually outlined on pages 58 to 66 of the Budget Supplement of the 2024-2025 Budget. So, if Members want to see more details, then they can refer to that.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1601 HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his elaboration on the Fiji Sustainable Resilient Recovery Programme. I think there has been a lot of good work done. I am particularly interested on the Public Policy for Community, the issues that you mentioned about gender-responsive budgeting, micro-insurance and the social system policy. I am just wondering, are there any plans, one of the things that we find sometimes in the past when you do something, when the good donor goes away, it tends to die down. I am just wondering whether all those things which are very important, are there plans to progress it further if it is going to be done internally within Government and how do you plan be able to do? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is a very important point that honourable Usamate has made that sometimes you have donors come in with a policy agenda, policy reform and once that is done, the sustainability is questioned, even with the projects that are funded by donors. I can assure honourable Usamate that the on-going programme includes building on some of those policy reforms and when we complete the policy reforms as part of the budget support, we make sure that it remains part of the agenda for future budgets. For example, since last year we produced the citizens budget. It is part of the reform agenda to provide readily available information demystified from the budget language and estimates. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- There are there before as well! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The first time we started last year as far as this Government is concern. To honourable Usamate, these are continuation of some of the policy reforms that had been undertaken. But it is important as you said quite rightly that we do not just leave it once the reform is completed as part of the budget support. Budget Support for Small-Scale Sugarcane Farmers (Question No. 142/2024) HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on the specific details on how the budget will support small-scale sugarcane farmers from larger producers? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, before I reply properly to honourable Pillay, I would like to go back to last night’s contribution by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in the two motions about the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji and Sugar Industry Tribunal. I am very impressed with the honourable Leader of Opposition that he had spoken on one particular subject that the sugar industry, although his bleeding and has been bleeding for so many years, but there is a social responsibility on the part of Government to keep this industry going because we have got 200,000 plus people who are directly and indirectly dependent on this industry. Mr. Speaker, but on the other side, if the sugar industry collapses, I will be out of job. One of the things that I did discuss with the honourable Prime Minister last night that we need a bipartisan approach on this industry. The honourable Prime Minister has agreed that down the line we can put up a Committee which we will be proposing shortly to Cabinet and we want both sides to work together for the sake of this industry. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects)</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>1602</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 HON. C. J. SINGH.- Of course, we will have one each from the other side (the two blocs) unless you want to be the third one because you are saying you are independent but you do not have any sugarcane farm. MR. SPEAKER.- We used to have that in the past, I used to Chair the Committee.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Well, I will check the register with the Tribunal.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question by honourable Pillay regarding the budget support for our small-scale sugarcane farmers, I want to offer my deepest condolence to the family of the locomotive pointsman from Tavua who lost his life yesterday after serving with FSC for more than three decades and a senior locomotive driver is admitted to the hospital in a critical condition. I wish him full and speedy recovery. The unfortunate accident happened in Tavua, Bridge No.15 where the locomotive derailed from the bridge and fell in the creek. I also want to thank the brave firefighters and the hardworking medical teams and each and every one who provided assistance and support that was needed at the time of the accident and I am indeed grateful to them and I thank them and the whole team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question, I want to assure the honourable Member that we value all farmers equally irrespective of the volume of cane they produce. We are committed to supporting all sugarcane farmers with detailed attention to small scale producers who make up a majority of our industry. It is imperative to acknowledge that approximately 75 percent of the 10,800 active farmers in Fiji are classified as small-scale farmers. Our programmes are crafted to be inclusive and accessible to every farmer regardless of their production scale. This inclusivity is not just a principle but a practice that we uphold with unwavering dedication. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our strategic focus of supporting small scale farmers ensures a credible assistance particularly for those who lack resources of their own as compared to their larger counterparts. For example, the majority of our farmers do not own tractors and implements necessary for sugarcane planting. To address, this Fiji Sugar Corporation has established tractor service providers in all the mill areas who assist farmers with planting without requiring an upfront payment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these service providers are later compensated under the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance Programme implemented by the Ministry. Furthermore, the programme includes a cap limited access to grants for up to five acres per farmer. This restriction prioritise small scale producers, preventing the large scale producers from disproportionately benefitting from the grant. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is fundamental to be practical. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is fundamental to be practical. To promote the commercialisation of the farms, we have developed policies that continue to support small scale farmers whilst also focussing on large scale farmers as we move towards a more commercialised industry. We accept the recommendation by the Standing Committee for Economic Affairs in their Consolidated Review Report of the FSC Annual Reports which underscores the necessity of achieving commercial viability in the sugar industry. The traditional 10 acres farm model establish by the CSR in the 1960’s is increasingly outdated in today’s dynamic economic landscape. The Committee recommends formation of small-scale farms into larger farming units to enhance efficiency and productivity. While the Ministry agrees with the recommendation, we recognise the</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1603 practical and legal challenges involved. Therefore, we proactively introduced a farm sharing agreement as a temporary measure. These agreements enable larger farmers equipped with necessary resources to manage smaller surrounding farms under the profit-sharing agreement. The sharing agreement offers significant benefits to both larger and smaller producers. The larger producers having achieved a total scale in exchange efficiency to smaller producers to this profit-sharing model. This symbolic relation not only optimises the resources utilization but also ensures that advantages of scale equitability distributed enhancing the overall productivity, profitability of the industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to share that I have personally pioneered these initiatives, managing additional 11 farms alongside my farm in Labasa. This hands-on it involvement demonstrates my commitment and our commitment to the practical solution that will alleviate the industry. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while our programme remains equally accessible to all farmers, we acknowledge the necessity of eventually commercialising the sugar industry. We are committed to working towards this goal, ensuring the farmers are equipped to complete and succeed in the global market. This transition is critical for the future sustainability and prosperity of our sugar industry, and we are dedicated to making it a reality. Let us all work together, embrace these plans and confidently strive towards securing a sustainable and prosperous future for the sugar industry of Fiji. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr Speaker, Sir, this season, farmers have seen a huge drop in cane production for both small and large scale farmers, mainly due to continuous heavy rain in the beginning and later on continuous dry weather. My supplementary question is, what are the required support or what plans does the Ministry of Sugar have to bring back the production to 2023 levels or higher than that? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have firstly allocated a big chunk of money from the budget proposal. That programme was there last year, and that programme continues this year as well. As we understand that we have got a special advisor in FSC, Mr. Lakshman from India. He had predicted that we will have an increase in cane production. Because of drought and from the latest figures, we may even lose a few hundred thousand tonnes of cane. This is his prediction. Let us hope that good weather comes back and we are currently, honourable Pillay bringing in some new technologies from China. There was a team of people who came and gave us some new form of fertilizers and chemicals. They are saying that it could probably increase production if we used their chemicals, it could increase our production by 30 percent. So we brought them in and we are testing on a few farms and if it works well, then we will be in good shape. HON. V. PILLAY.- Sir, on my own farm I have experienced a drop of 70 tonnes and I have seen small scale farmers harvesting about 70 to 80 tonnes and this year, they have gone below 50. I just hope they will be provided the required amount of fertilizers, chemical and also the order they give for rice and sugar will be given to them so that they can bring back the production next year. MR. SPEAKER.- That is a plead. He is pleading with the Ministry. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure the honourable Member that we will look after all the sugarcane farmer in Fiji and as you know that we have got this new CEO with the Sugar Research, Dr. Vinesh Kumar who is very active. The last trial that he has done with the Sugar Research on Mr. George Shiu Raj’s farm with the new variety of cane and new fertilizer and in</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>1604</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 Labasa they have done on my farm. Because what is happening Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farmers do not want to move away from the normal fertilizer that they have been putting, they are a bit scared. So, Mr. George Shiu Raj has volunteered to give his farm, and I have volunteered to give my farm to do the trials. If it works well, it goes for everyone. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the area of supporting small scale farmers, there is support for new farmers as well. So, I would just like to ask the honourable Minister to inform Parliament within his term of two years, what are the numbers of new farmers that have taken up the initiative of sugarcane farming in Fiji? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the exact number but we have incentives Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the new farmers to come in and we provide them with the additional premium up $7,500 or 30 percent whichever is lower. We have given almost to 900 farmers but to give you an exact number of how many new farmers have come in, that number I can provide later. Update on the Co-operative Development Fund (Question No. 143/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the Co-operative Development Fund and its execution? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be very brief. Basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Co-operative Development Fund is a new initiative from the Ministry of Trade. It is specifically trying to target assistance to co-operatives particularly and try and ensure that there is specific focus given to co-operatives. The CDF works within the guidelines, it essentially involves the maximum grant or funding that can be provided, it is up to $100,000. For businesses or co-operatives that are less than three years, the funding is limited to $20,000 and of course the established co-operatives must show the normal compliance that is required in terms of tax compliance and other requirements and of course are required to provide financial statements. For newer co-operatives, the requirements are not as onerous but obviously the threshold of funding dictates what is available to them. We are just about to advertise the grants online and through the dailies, we have already advertised all the other MSME Grants and that is already available. For those who are listening in today, please ensure that you apply, and of course, as usual the applications will go through the normal screening process and generally it involves an assessment committee that is chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Trade, that is, after the initial screening process. One of the interesting things that has come out of this grant is the Ministry, through its IT Department, is trying to develop a software that can be used to process grants a lot faster, and should that be successful, we will roll it out with the other grant programmes as well. HON. P. D. KUMAR. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, normally with cooperatives, there is a high failure rate, for many reasons. Normally, the reasons are related to management skills, handling money, et cetera. My question to the honourable Minister is, what measures are being taken to ensure sustainability of cooperatives, now that they will receive this funding?</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1605 HON. M. S. N KAMIKAMICA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any cooperatives receiving grants, we generally take them through the normal business financial literacy training just to ensure that they are, sort of, ready to utilise the grant. That is normally one of the main things we insist on to give their new businesses. There is a lot more monitoring that is now happening, even though, I think I suspect the way the cooperative movement is growing right now in the country, we will probably need a bit more resources soon. However, right now, there is enough resource on the ground to continue to do the monitoring - the handholding, counselling and advising in terms of ensuring that the grant is used properly. HON. J. USAMATE.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, as just been expressed before, the grant, we understand, is for diversification from what cooperatives are currently doing to move into new fields. Just a simple question, what criteria do the cooperatives need to qualify, in order to be able to access the funds? HON. M. S. N KAMIKAMICA.–Clearly because the thresholds, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is an existing cooperative, which has been operating for more than three years, obviously, they can provide more information in terms of their operations. So, they will have well-prepared financial statements, tax compliance is normally insisted upon and any other compliance that is required for that particular business to operate. So, those are really the criteria that is generally used for the types of assessments, and there is also interaction with the applicant, if required, to actually assess the business a bit more closely. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.– Honourable Minister, in your response to the previous question, you did mention about handholding and capacity development. Is this something that is provided from within the Ministry, or is it outsourced? We have talked about how Bank of South Pacific (BSP) provides this for their clients. So, in terms of the cooperatives, could you, please, elaborate on this? HON. M. S. N KAMIKAMICA. – Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do have our own resources in the Ministry that does the training for cooperatives, in terms of the initial awareness and training on financial awareness. The good thing now is that there are other support mechanisms. So, sometimes, some cooperatives might need some more training around marketing, for example, and generally, the Business Assistance Fiji has been helping as well in that regard. So, it just depends on website development and those kinds of things. But in terms of the hard-core initial training to be able to be a grant recipient, that is normally handled by the Ministry Officials, who are quite experienced. Solutions to Mill Breakdown Issues (Question No. 144/2024) HON. P. K. BALA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on how the mill breakdown issues are being addressed? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I know honourable Bala was busy yesterday in Nadi, but had he been around in Parliament last night, he would have heard the explanations that I gave about Ba Mill. However, for the benefit of the honourable Member, I shall also let him know. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Bala’s inquiring about measures taken to address the mill breakdown issues. Before we go into detail, it is crucial to understand the context in which these</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>1606</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 Mills operate. All our mills are over 70 years old and face a number of challenges, including the persistent effects of the Sugar Technical Missions, the projects which were incomplete. The presence of the excessive trash and materials on the cane and a high percentage of burnt cane and the persistent of boiler issues and the loss of technical skills are the problem. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the observations that FSC has reported to us is the burnt cane. When these original mills were planned and designed, they were designed with a carrier to carry long stocks but with this burnt canes, they carry a lot of trash with the cane and when the canes are dropped in the carrier, it clogs the carrier itself. In particular, at Ba Mill, that has been a problem for quite a while, and we have to upgrade the carrier itself. Of course, the second upgrading will be to get a new boiler because the boiler has done its age. That is the initial problem there, but much of these issues, as I have explained in the last two days, despite these impediments, the FSC Mills are passed with operating continuously for 24 hours during the crushing season, inevitably leading to mechanical problems and breakdowns. Our Mills are probably the oldest in the world, as I have said yesterday. In my earlier written response to Question No. 123/2024 by honourable Pillay, I had emphasised that FSC has invested about $29 million over the past five years, to ensure the Mills are operational. These investments aim to minimise inside stops and improve the overall efficiency. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I emphasised that the number of inside stops, more commonly known as breakdowns, was 2,163.6 hours in 2019 and the lowest point was in 2023 to 1,558 hours, which has substantial reduction of 605 hours or 28 percent which is a notable improvement. However, the figures are still significant, and we are committed to continually reducing the down time, acknowledging the challenges posed by our Mills which is, as I have said, essentially old infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must also acknowledge the issue of insufficient cane supply, as previously highlighted, hampers our efforts. More cane means more revenue, allowing us to plan for the establishment of the new factories and plants, be it secondhand at an approximate cost of $125 million, or if you get a new one which will cost about $250 million. These plants are contingent and on a sufficient cane supply, underscoring the need for FSC and the farmers to collaborate closely to meet the growth objectives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address the Mill breakdown issue, the Fiji Sugar Corporation has implemented strategies concentrated on preventative maintenance, inventory management and continuous improvement. Critical spare parts are procured and stored at our local mill centres, ensuring immediate availability to minimise down time. Before crushing commences, FSC conducts thorough planned activities based on condition monitoring reports and physical analysis and it notifies potential issues earlier, allowing for timely interventions. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC consults, expressed for highly technical issues, applying temporary solutions while permanent resolutions are developed. A comprehensive listing and replacement schedule for essential machineries are maintained, with replacement typically acquiring after five or seven years or sooner, if necessary. The Corporation properly assesses and defines the processors, effectively addressing challenges and enhancing mill efficiency. These combined efforts underscore FSC’s commitment to minimising operational disruptions and ensuring the sustainable growth of the sugar industry.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1607 Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently my Ministry had engaged a professional Indian company known as Indian Sugar Engineering Corporation (ISGEC) to carry out a comprehensive review on the three Mills. The consultants have been instrumental in providing strategic guidance, proposing remedies and conducting technical audits to optimise the milling process. Their expertise has been invaluable in enhancing operational capabilities. Through these measures, we will ensure that FSC is dedicated to minimising downtime, ensuring personal safety and maintaining continuous mill operations. This unwavering commitment not only supports the sustainable growth of the sugar industry, but also benefits the communities in Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the beginning of the crushing season, nearly every week, there is a breakdown and machines are machines we know there will be breakdowns. But my question is when there is a breakdown, why are the lorry drivers not informed about it? Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have to wait for days. Some cane lorry drivers cart their cane from Vunikavikaloa to Rarawai, which is about 150 kilometres away, and once they reach Rarawai, they find that the Mill is not working. So they have to spend days there without proper facilities. So why are these drivers not informed that there is a breakdown so that they can make necessary arrangements. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, well I sympathise with the drivers and I sympathise with the farmers. have been getting a lot of calls myself from the drivers and farmers and they complain. But what I am saying is that when the mill is crushing, obviously, the engine does not know that something is going to breakdown right and by that time, the driver leaves his house. I was saying last night here that the machines do not have a mouth to speak. If it is a human being, he will say my stomach is paining or my head is paining. With the machine, if you fix one thing today, you will not know what will happen to it tomorrow. What I am saying is this, somehow down the line, we will have a robot which can fix the machine from inside. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his response. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is really a critical issue. I mean, it is good for the honourable Minister to explain in detail the plans but, currently, what the farmers and lorry drivers are facing is really in a bad situation. I would say from bad to worse. There are three things that happen when the mill breakdown. One is, less quota given to farmers, so there is delay in harvesting. Lorry drivers had to sleep at the Mill, as stated by my colleague, the honourable Member, and then farmers had to transport their cane from the Ba Mill area to Lautoka. I agree with some of the explanations by the honourable Minister and also his explanation in terms of plans. I mean, jokes aside, for Government, it may be funny but those farmers and lorry drivers who sleep at the Mill, they know what is happening. So, is there any definite plan or any timeframe? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, have we not close the Rakiraki Mill, at least, the farmers could have a certain Mill to deliver their cane. The problem started when the Rakiraki Mill closed. Before, when the Ba Mill closes, they take their cane to Rakiraki Mill. Now, the Ba Mill closes, you take the cane all to Lautoka Mill. So, the problem started from that side. Now, we are going to rectify, so give us some time.</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>1608</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, on this side, are very serious about the sugar industry. That is what I am saying, we are getting the bipartisan thing now so that we can work together. What else you want? HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the performance of Rarawai Mill and Lautoka Mill is the worst this year, compared to previous years. My question is, what level of assurance is there to the farmers? Looking at the performance of the two Mills, that all harvested cane will be taken by the Mills this season? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can give assurance that the Mills will only close once all the canes are harvested. HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Minister for his very good answers. I just ask him not to follow the example of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, the question comes here, and he talks about something else. (Laughter) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the mill breakdowns, the processes are interrupted, so sometimes there is a lot of sugar juice that is left there. If my understanding is correct, sometimes those sugar juices are dumped. So how is it that we are taken into account the environmental considerations, the consequences of doing that sort of thing and how is Government and FSC trying to address this issue to minimise the impact on the environment? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, lately, there was an article or perhaps the Farmers Union had put a complaint to say that the juice were dumped. But, in fact, if you have been reading the comments of the Chairman and the FSC CEO, that was not the case. It was something, not the actual juice, it was something different that was there. HON. P. K. BALA.- What were they? HON. C. J. SINGH.- You read it, it’s in the paper. I will bring the paper tomorrow, you read it. HON. P. K. BALA.- Don’t lie! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not want to see the juice flowing into the river, we do not want to see the losses, and we are responsible about it. Whatever had happened was totally a different thing altogether. You are too young. You do not know politics. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are fully responsible to see that the Mill and products amount are well specialised, and we give the money to the farmers. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a very good supplementary question asked by my colleague, honourable Bala, about the timeframe that would be taken to resolve all these issues. He, in a very sarcastic way, ignored that issue by saying that we closed the Mill in Rakiraki.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1609 The similar situation is faced by the lorry drivers and the farmers up in Vanua Levu. Can he use the same excuse to explain to the farmers in Vanua Levu that we closed the Mill in Rakiraki. That is why you are supposed to suffer this side. Is this the level of answers coming from by the honourable Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Maharaj has not been Labasa for some time. I get reports every day, the Labasa Mill is the best Mill running so far. MR. SPEAKER.- He is very busy.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J.

S:</span> TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the establishment of the United States Agency for International Development Office in Suva? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent agency of the US Federal Government that is primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance. As was pointed out, this was formed around the same time as the Peace Corps by the same President Kennedy in 1961, who thought to unite several existing foreign assistance organisations and programmes under one agency. Sir, USAID became the first US foreign assistance organisation who primary focus was the long term socio-economic development. Sir, USAID is one of the largest official aid agencies in the world and accounts for more than half of all US foreign assistance. As an official component of US Foreign Policy, USAID operates subject to the guidance of the President, Secretary of State and the National Security Council. It has missions in over 100 countries, primarily in Africa, Asia, Latin</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>1610</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 22 nd July the Biden-Harris Administration announced the US Government‘s commitment to deepen its cooperation in the Pacific region. One of the commitments included the opening of the USAID Pacific Regional Mission in Suva by 2023. On 15 th August, 2023, during the visit of USAID Administrator, Mrs. Samantha Power, a soft launch of the USAID office was held at the US Embassy pending the finalisation of the Bilateral Framework Agreement, which formally establishes the USAID. The organisation has ongoing engagements with various Government agencies and local partners on initiatives such as providing support for municipal elections, technical support on climate change, meeting obligations under Paris Agreement, expansion of digital connectivity, cyber security partnership, modernising Fiji’s digital policies and cybersecurity measures and supporting loan facility to finance MSMEs to further stimulate sustainable economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally notified the Unites States via a Diplomatic Note of Cabinet’s approval for the Fiji Government to enter into the USAID Bilateral Framework Agreement with the US for the establishment of the USAID Office. The Ministry is currently awaiting the USAID’s availability to discuss the signing of the above-mentioned agreement. The Bilateral Framework Agreement is the standard agreement the US enters into with countries that host USAID Offices around the world. The agreement contains provisions pertaining to the granting of diplomatic immunities and privileges to US personnel, their family members employed by the USAID, including exemptions from tax, customs duties and other similar charges. Benefits of hosting the USAID office, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is obvious. It opens up opportunities to enhance the level of bilateral co-operation between US and Fiji and improves Fiji’s access to US development assistance. The office is going to be the Pacific Office, and it would serve Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, RMI, FSM and Palau. Obviously, as the honourable Prime Minister said sometimes ago that with this, Fiji’s role and status as the hub of the Pacific is going to be further enhanced. Fiji’s support towards the establishment of the USAID Office also shows the strength of Fiji’s relationship with the US, it will demonstrate the importance Fiji places on the commitment shown by the US Government to deepen its level of cooperation and engagement. I also, want to take this opportunity to thank the United States of America for supporting Fiji through the Multilateral Development Banks such the Asian Development Bank, World Bank and IFC because their support including the support of Australia and other countries for Fiji and the Pacific in these multilateral institutions is very, very important. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of potential that Fiji can draw on from this move to strengthen our engagements and the establishment of the USAID Office is going to not only benefit Fiji in a big way but also benefit all the Pacific Island countries that will be served by the Pacific USAID Office here in Suva. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, my question may be a little bit forensic, I am not sure if the Minister might be able to answer or not. Some of us here may have been recipients of teachings from Peace Corps teachers. My question is honourable Minister, will our Education Ministry be benefiting from the USA with respect to some Peace Corps teachers being made available to our own schools in Fiji?</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1611 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the programme is going to be all encompassing. It depends on the individual needs and request from different countries, and I do not to rule out any particular type of assistance that we could get. As the honourable Minister for Rural Development indicated earlier, there are specific projects-based support, but it does not exclude us going through USAID Office to look for assistance in other areas as well. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- We appreciate the assistance that the USA will provide but we understand the geopolitics behind all these. Most of our friends are coming back into the region because of China, this is the reality. It is the geopolitics that is bringing back our partners in there. So, the honourable Minister playing smart within this, what specific areas are we looking at? China is giving us $300 million to assist us in our infrastructure development, Australia is giving us so many others including budget support. Let us be specific, which specific areas are you looking at in terms of getting these assistance from them? Hopefully, it is not just flying the flag for the sake of being here in the region. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes for those who engage with these development partners, the motivations can always be a matter of debate as part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade has explained many times. We have signed the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, there are obviously potential to get a lot of benefits in terms of trade. So, geopolitics was always there in different forms as the honourable Prime Minister says, metamorphosis does takes place even in those relationships as well but as I said to you, there are specific areas, for example, initiatives in municipalities, technical support on climate change, meeting obligations under the Paris Agreement and expansion. The US Aid itself has certain areas but as I have said, it does not stop us not being able to put our proposals, look at specific areas but the areas that I have pointed out, these are important areas for Fiji as well. I also said, Mr. Speaker, that the support that we get from the US and other partners within the international or multilateral banks such as the ADB, World Bank and IFC as well is important because a lot of the funding, particularly grant funding, concessional funding is contingent upon competition amongst different countries. It is always good to have major development partners support us in that. So, honourable Leader of the Opposition these are the areas, but it does not stop us from looking for other areas as well.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>List of LTA Capital Projects for 2024-2025 (Question No. 146/2024) HON.
