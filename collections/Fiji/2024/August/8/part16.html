TUNABUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am humbled to present the Ministry of Forestry’s Annual Report of the fiscal year 2019 – 2020, 2020 – 2021 and 2021 – 2022 and provide an overview of its performances, key activities and financial status. The Ministry focuses on forest conservation, sustainable management and enhancing biodiversity. 1 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 146/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure I. 2 Reply to Written Question No. 147/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure II.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1613 Key achievements 2019 – 2020 afforestation projects, successful planting of new forest land contributing to increase forest cover. The implementation of measures to protect endangered species and their habitats, and on community engagement, launching of community-based forestry initiatives to involve local population in conservation efforts. Sir, in 2020-2021 on forest management, development and implementation of improved forest management practices to enhance and sustainability and resilience. On illegal logging, Sir, increase enforcement and monitoring to combat illegal logging activities resulting in reduction of illegal operations. Through climate actions, the initiative to align forest practices with climate action goals including carbon sequestration projects. In 2021-2022 reforestation success, the expansion of reforestation efforts with the focus on degrade land and rehabilitation. For sustainable practices, the introduction of new sustainable forest practices and certification to promote responsible forest management. In technology integration, the adoption of advanced technology such as satellite monitoring to improve forest management and the conservation strategies which includes the use of drones. Sir, there were challenges faced in the period under review from 2019-2020 as far as reforestation continued issues with deforestation of forest degraded impacting biodiversity and eco- system services. We also had funding limitations as far as budget constraints with the scale which affected the scale and scope of conservation projects. In 2020-2021 the pandemic impact of COVID-19 disrupt and led to the delay in some of the projects and the challenges in the field operations. As far as resources management, Sir, the difficulty in managing the allocated resources efficiently due to increase demand and reduce funding. Sir, in 2021-2022 adverse effect on climate change including increasing frequency of forest fires and pest outbreaks. Coordination issues, there were needs for improved coordination between different stakeholders and agencies involved in forestry management. On financial overview, the Committee noted with appreciation that the Ministry had unqualified audited opinions throughout the years of the Annual Report. Overview of the Ministry’s Budget allocation that expanded across the three fiscal years was also affected by COVID-19. Key areas of expenditures included forest conservation programmes, reforestation programmes and community outreach. The Way Forward, Sir, enhanced funding, seek additional funding with the resources to support the expansion, to expend successful programmes and initiatives, to strengthen enforcement, to improve enforcement of forestry laws and regulation to combat illegal activities and protect forest resources, provision of technical expertise and equipment for value adding products to make use of timber residues and reduce mill wastage. The initiatives provided by the Ministry in providing technical and skilled training on carpentry and joinery for resource owners is highly recommended. Youth groups who are resource owners benefit from this income generated programmes through sales of furniture and artefacts made from timber residues. The Committee strongly recommends that this initiative expanded to other divisions and also benefit other resource owners and provide income to the individual families. In conclusion, the Ministry of Forestry had made significant strides in forest conservation and management for the past three years. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Chairperson. The floor is now open for debate on</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>1614 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 8 th August, 2024 the motion, and I have the list of speakers provided by the Whips, is follows: (1) Hon. J. N. Nand; (2) Hon. Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; (3) Hon. V. Naupoto; and (4) Hon. Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister’s. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House and in my capacity as being one of the Members of the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a five-day site visit to the Central, Western and Northern Divisions was undertaken in May to provide insights into the challenges the Ministry faced, the achievements of the targeted programmes, the issues faced by the Divisions and the overall performance of the Ministry during the period under review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will briefly discuss the sites that we visited, the discussions that took place there and what were some of the pertinent issues that need addressing and some of the issues that has been addressed. The first site visited was the Research and Training Division in 9 Miles, Nasinu. We managed to find out that there are 14 mahogany stations, and the sector is focused on making use of the residues of timber after it has been processed. The Ministry of Forestry deals with the forests that are licensed to be harvested. In 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was 48 percent sawmill recovery. This had improved from 41 percent that was achieved in 2019. It is encouraging to note that the Government and the Ministry has a desire to build a mahogany town at the Saivou Junction. We also found out that the Research staff needs further training. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our next visit was to the Forestry Research Unit in Colo-i-Suva. We managed to find out that research in the Ministry is not at the desired level due to the laboratory facilities there. At the moment, this is not suitable to achieve its high level potential, but it is encouraging to note that the Government is trying to construct a research lab in Colo-i-Suva, to ease the problem of laboratory testing and lab work. We also found out that the more mahogany and pine needs to be planted. At the moment there are 81.9 percent of natural forest which covers about 1.1 million hectares. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on to the Ministry of Forestry Headquarters at Takayawa Building, we had a good discussion there and found out that the forest reserves need assessments. It was suggested that the community should receive direct fees from the investors and the Government funds to be issued to the landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also visited the Vunimaqo Forestry Station, and we gathered information that two out of three staff positions at the Station were filled. We were informed that the station used to have a total of six staff. This indicates a shortage of personnel physically present in the field to conduct monitoring activities. Insufficient staff on the ground can hinder the Department’s ability to oversee operations effectively, leading to potential gaps in the monitoring compliance with the regulation or addressing environmental concerns. Also, there were some concerns raised by the Forester. The Forester expressed worries regarding the monitoring of native trees, particularly the mahogany field designated for Fiji</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1615 Hardwood Corporation. The primary concern revolves around the alleged non-payment of stumpage rate, royalty and also associated fees. This raises issues of compliance with financial obligation and potential, which signifies a breach contractual or regulatory agreement. Also, we managed to find out that there is also a need to look into the mahogany industry regulation policy and implementation. We note that the Ministry is working towards that. We also visited the Fiji Pine Limited and we managed to find out that Fiji Pine is owned 90 percent by the Fijian Government and less than 1 percent of shareholding is owned by the landowners, that is, the Pine Trust. It is encouraging to see that the dividends are paid only to the landowners and landowners get money from the stumpage, that is, 5.5 percent, plus two other payment types. The biggest worry and problem there is the lack of trees. We found out that Tropik Woods is owned by the Fiji Pine Limited. Fiji Pine Limited almost went bankrupt post-2000, and at that time Tropik Woods had to basically run out of Fiji Pine, but it has now recovered. The major payments were done during the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government at that time, and that rescued the industry. Nowadays, we do not have logs in Viti Levu to run Tropik Woods so they are sourcing from Vanua Levu, and looking forward to get materials from the maritime zone mostly. We also managed to find out that there is no matured forest in Viti Levu. This situation arises because there was no planting of trees done 20 years ago. As a result, there is lack of mature forests in Viti Levu, which is Fiji’s largest island, which could have provided a sustainable timber resource. Also, the plantation in Viti Levu, is unable to meet the mill demands. Despite existing plantations in Viti Levu, they are insufficient to meet the demands of the mill. The sawn logs in Viti Levu are unable to sustain mills. The sawn logs available in Viti Levu are inadequate and it is hard to sustain the operations of the mill. On the setting up carriage sawmill and harvesting other species, in response to these challenges, the company is considering establishing a carriage sawmill and harvesting other species of trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also visited the Forestry Office in Rakiraki where there are two staff manning the office. They feel that they need one or two more staff there. We also managed to find out that they have the highest number of seedlings produced in the communities in Ra. Some of the challenging issues identified was that the landowners were not consulting the Ministry on licencing issues and procedures. This indicates the lack of communication and collaboration between the landowners and the Ministry responsible for issuing licences and regulatory procedures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also the awareness on the impact of illegal activities. This refers to efforts aimed at educating communities and stakeholders about the negative consequences of engaging in illegal activities. We also visited Taveuni and had a good discussion with the Forest Guard there. We found out that no forest harvesting is taking place in Taveuni, at the moment.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>1616 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 8 th August, 2024 Also, there is a very big project going on, the reafforestation in Bouma, where each mataqali is planting 2,000 trees. Their aim is to get more yavusa and mataqali involved in their replanting of trees. There was a very good discussion about the blue line, which is the line that demarcates the place where tree felling should stop. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the forestry sector has vast areas of operation and needs more resources such as technical expertise in the outer stations, transportation and staff quarters. Some machines are very old and they need new machinery to ease the workload. The Acts are old and need to be fast-tracked and reviewed, and more awareness on the full utilisation of the funds for Land Owning Units. More police engagements is needed because of thefts of logs in the forest. The Ministry to strengthen monitoring on the cutting of timber in the forest. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairperson, honourable Tunabuna, and all the honourable Members of the Committee and the Secretariat Team led by Madam Akanisi for the preparation of this Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to visit these sites. I fully support the motion before the House. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, Honourable Members of Parliament, and ladies and gentlemen; firstly, I would like to thank the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry of Forestry 2019-2022 Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has continued to deliver on its mandate over the past three years, despite the challenging circumstances that Fiji has faced. I would like to take this time to highlight some of the Ministry’s important achievements, which is a testament of the hard work of the Ministry and its collaboration with our stakeholders and landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, the continuation of the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years Programme, which was officially introduced in January 2019, in the 2022-2023 financial year, a total of 4.8 million seedlings were planted. The seedlings planted included native species, pine, mahogany, teak, sandalwood, mangroves and fruit trees. Since the beginning of the Programme, Mr. Speaker, more than 19.1 million trees have been planted, including almost a million mangroves within more than 17,200 hectares of land. This means that we have planted more than 60 percent of our target in less than six years of the total 15 years. This tree planting initiative contributes to Fiji’s green economy and recovery from the ongoing impacts of climate change and is helping the country meet its international commitments through the REDD+ initiative and the World Bank’s Emission Reduction Programme. Mr. Speaker, through this programme, we are also contributing to reforestation of degraded forest. This is an attempt to utilise degraded forests to address broad thematic areas of need in Fiji, including carbon stock enhancement, connecting forest corridors, coastal restoration, food security, flood mitigations, stabilisation in riparian systems, catchment restoration, enrichment planting, community woodlots, and industrial planting.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1617 Mr. Speaker, the numbers achieved are a positive testament to the diligent work being carried out by the Ministry with the support of our communities and also our partners - Fiji Pine Limited, Fiji Pine Trust, Fiji Hardwood Corporation and the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight, again, the Ministry’s work on our Maritime Pine Schemes. The Maritime Pine Project has supported communities to develop their pine resources, as well as processing timber for houses across Fiji’s maritime communities. Through investments in machines, skills training and an inventory of pine resources, the project aims to ensure the sustainable utilisation and management of maritime pine resources, generating significant value and volume of wood products and improving the livelihoods of our maritime communities. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has continued to make excellent progress on Fiji’s Emission Reduction Programme. Fiji’s Emission Reduction Payment Agreement is a pledge to reduce Green House Gases (GHS) emission from within the agriculture, forests and other land use sector by 2.5 million tonnes, as its contribution to the global target of reducing global surface warming of 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial temperature under the Paris Agreement. Mr. Speaker, our REDD+ readiness assessment was completed in 2022 and this supported the Fiji Government’s engagement in a carbon trade agreement under the Emission Reduction Payment Agreement. Our team has identified 15 different sites that could be used in the Emission Reduction Programme, as well as plantation areas. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Forestry has completed our National Forest Inventory, and this will provide policy on sustainable use of forest resources. In light of this, the growth of forestry- related exports in particular, has been optimistic. The Ministry moved from a manual system to an online digital licencing system for exports and imports. In 2021, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics data showed that wood related exports exceeded $100 million for the first time, with the value more than doubling between 2019 and 2021. It is important, Mr. Speaker, to note that the contribution of the Forestry sector extends beyond forestry and logging itself, including other value adding processes. The total economic contribution of the Forestry Sector is $140.4 million, which is equivalent to 1.4 percent of Fiji’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Mr. Speaker, the Ministry also continues to support the development of small-scale cottage industries in Fiji. This has included the registration of a cooperative in Sote - Gaunavou, which has also received approval from the Ministry of Trade to use the Fijian Made Brand. This co-operative, Mr. Speaker, manufactures beds made from mahogany for Courts Fiji. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to congratulate the Ministry in obtaining an unqualified audit opinion for all their reporting years in the Consolidated Report. Last but not the least, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the former Minister, honourable Ravu, for his guidance and leadership. I would like to thank our development partners, the Government, for their continued support in assisting the Ministry to continue to work towards the sustainable management of Fiji’s forests. Thank you for the opportunity to speak, Mr. Speaker. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my short contribution to the motion at hand. The Forestry Sector is a very important sector for Small Island Nations like ours. There is a big connection from the forest right up to the reef, with the Ridge to Reef Programme that I see in the</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>1618 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 8 th August, 2024 Report. I would like to congratulate the Committee for this Report and is also available to the public. It contains a lot of very good information for those that want to delve deeper into the Forestry Sector. And there is always competition, if you like, between trying to earn money out of our forest and, at the same time, conserve it. It is because of our forest that we have very clean drinking water, and we leave those forests to stand so that they preserve our water sources. I would just like to float this idea that in order to compensate those that allow their forests to stand so that we can enjoy clean drinking water, I hear the WAF is going to be a commercial company and, perhaps, if two cents from every dollar that we pay for water bill goes into some sort of a fund to compensate the forest owners who will have to leave their forests to stand so that we can enjoy clean water in Fiji, would be an idea. We thank those forest owners who allow their forests to stand so that we can enjoy the clean water that we do. If we value our forests, yes, we earn money from our exports but if we also put a dollar value to all the services that our forests provide - protecting our land, climate change, keeping our water sources clean, the dollar value goes very high. So, we should not be too disappointed when we see the amount of money that we get from what we sell out of our forests products. But if we put money into the other services that our forests provide for a small island nation where the ecosystem is so fragile, the dollar value is so high. I thank the Ministry for the big work that they do in looking after this very critical sector for our nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Committee for this Report. I like the wealth of information that is in there, which is not only for us here in Parliament, but it is also available to the public. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for the excellent Report that they have presented. Basically, I would just like to cover three areas that have been highlighted in the Report. One of the recommendations the legislation/regulation/policies. Given the overarching ambit of the Ministry covering so many legislation, perhaps, they need to strengthen the legal aspect and may be appoint a legal officer to specifically address some of the legislation that needs to be amended within or under the Ministry. that has been made the review of is on I noted some of the achievements that have been made. One of the activities, one of the projects that I saw here is ‘say no to legal logging’ pledge, which was initiated by the Permanent Secretary in 2022, aimed to curb illegal logging through community and public awareness in collaboration with the Fiji Police Force. By the end of 2022, 324 pledges were received. There was another project, the planting of 30 million trees. I think that has been alluded to by the honourable Minister. So far, they have planted 18 million trees. The Ministry plans to re-strategise its forest beat process and community engagement through plantation establishment, their protection and community initiatives. I noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of evidence in the linkage between some of these projects, perhaps, that is an area that needs to be strengthened. Another area that has been highlighted was empowering the landowners. I think that has been also alluded to by the honourable Minister - empowering landowners and support cottage industries for iTaukei. In the 2023-2024 Budget, the Ministry of Forestry was allocated a budget of $200,000 to support forest businesses. The lessons that we have to learn from the failures in the past was the</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 1619 need to have someone to be undertaking business management particularly iTaukei and those people who are wanting to go into business. There has been the call for the involvement of iTaukei in business, but I think with the need to ensure that we have adequate technical capacity to manage this. I think honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communication has already talked about MSMEs, BAF has an important role, but you need to have adequate technical and financial capacity to manage some of these new initiatives. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was looking through the report and one of the areas that I was always interested in is, agroforestry. I think I have already mentioned this in the past. Agroforestry combines growing trees with other food crops and cash crops. It is an approach that communities can use for better managing their vanua from ridge to reef for the benefit of everyone. Agroforestry is not a prescription or formula that is developed and imposed from outside, it is an approach where people can learn the principles and develop their own system, their own special combination of trees and other crops that is suitable for the environment and meets the needs and aspirations. Agroforestry does not take away the best land that farmers are already using successfully to grow their crops. Agroforestry can be used to restore degraded land which has been exhausted by too much burning or taking away too many crops without replenishing the soil with fertiliser crops, rotation of fallow period. Agroforestry can help to bring marginal and underutilised land into profitable production. The trees in agroforestry do various useful things. At the beginning, we plant fast growing trees like vaivai which helps to stop the soil erosion. They improve the soil with nitrogen and organic matter and they provide shade to protect the other trees, seedlings, and crops as well as supressing lushes and other weeds. Next come fast growing hardwood trees like teak and tavola that provide fence post and building post for houses and other buildings. After a few years, the main trees like vesi and tavola become mature providing permanent shade and protection as well as timber for local use or for sale. We do not need to wait for the trees to grow large, in the gaps between the trees, we grow crops that will give quick returns in the market like cassava, sweet potatoes and pineapple. As the soil becomes better, we can produce dalo and yaqona, as well as fast growing fruit trees like papaya, banana and vudi. The next trees start to produce fruits and nuts, we can initiate other crops such as avocado, vutinikana and noni. Then we can get other products from ivi, tavola, dilo, et cetera. There will be sustainable income from Agroforest at all stages as it grows. This is not a new thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Our grandfathers used to practice this. This is the farming systems but now we are facing so many challenges, maybe this is the time to adopt some of these traditional knowledge. An important strategy in agroforestry development is to ensure markets and market chain connections for all the products as the system is established. We already have buyers for main agroforest products, such as coffee, cocoa, vanilla, noni, dilo, et cetera. Coffee and cocoa can provide the foundation for the system with large established markets available that can be relied on for many years. Some of these products can be partially processed in the community, adding value for extra income to their community members, because agroforestry involves selecting many possible trees and products. There is less risk of saturating any market and the prices do fall because of the changes in the market. Producers can change to alternatives.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>1620 Consolidated Review Report-MoF 2019-2022 Annual Reports 8 th August, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has a growing domestic market as well as different export destinations which increases options and resilience. The new opportunity for farmers and community is developing with the carbon markets. The companies around the world produce a lot of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide will pay farmers and communities who have land available to plant trees. These trees capture the carbon dioxide and turn it into wood and carbon in the soil. Once a long-term agreement is set up with the help of the Government, the overseas companies will pay communities who undertake agroforestry get some money each year for the carbon they have captured in their trees. In this way, agroforestry offer farmers and communities a new way to farm that improves their environment and assures diverse source of income for the entire community. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the honourable Members for their contributions and support for the debate this afternoon. I also wish to extend our deep appreciation to the staff of the Ministry of Forestry for the use of their resources including facilities and staff during COVID-19. I have nothing else to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today. I want to thank you all for your great contributions, especially the honourable Prime Minister, being able to go through his difficult arrangements for the day, yet still able to come and join us again. I thank you, Sir. I thank each and every one of you for the questions you have prepared and also the reports on the Committees.
