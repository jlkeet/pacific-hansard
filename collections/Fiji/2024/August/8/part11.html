<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2019-2022 Annual Reports HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to present this Consolidated Committee Report for the review of the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 Audit Reports on public enterprises and other entities. The 2019-2020 Report covers audits of 11 Financial Statements of eight public enterprises and three other entities. Out of the 11 audit opinions that were issued, one was from the 2015 Financial Statements, two from the 2018 Financial Statements, five were from 2019 Financial Statements and three from the 2020 Financial Statements for the various entities. The Office of the Auditor-General had issued 10 unmodified audit opinions and one modified or qualified opinion. The 2021-2022 Report covers audits of 30 Financial Statements for 10 public enterprises and four other entities. Twenty-five were issued with unmodified audit opinions and five were issued with modified or qualified opinions.</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1545 The Committee deliberated and noted some of the significant matters that need to be brought to the attention of the House for consideration and these include: • Addressing significant delays in submission of quality draft financial statements for audit which is warranted by those respective Boards and those charged with governance of State- owned enterprises, including the Permanent Secretary and the Minister. ❖ ❖ In the 2019-2020 Report, the quality of four entities out of eleven, were found to be ineffective, while for timeliness, seven entities out of 11 were ineffective. In the 2021-2022 Report, the quality of two entities out of 30, were found to be ineffective, while for timeliness, seven entities out of 30 were ineffective. • Modified audit opinion issued for the Financial Statements audited every year on public enterprises and other entities reflected negatively on the entities concerned, its Board, the Permanent Secretary for Public Enterprises and the Minister responsible. Urgent and close attention needs to be given to address matters which have been highlighted in the Auditor’s Report. • • • The Auditor-General also needs to be the external auditor for all State-Owned Entities and should have the power to carry out audit, whether financial or performance, on those organisations that directly or indirectly receive funding from Government, to ensure that the findings can be reported to Parliament. Therefore, those falling outside the ambit the Auditor-General should review the decision. The long-term financial sustainability of some of the entities without Government assistance continued to be questioned, let alone the ability to provide an acceptable return (dividend and/or growth) per annum to Government. Hence, Management and Board should ensure to provide strategic direction for long-term financial stability of entities to minimise the heavy reliance on Government grant or assistance. Improving risk assessment processes to achieve the entity’s objectives and forming a clear basis for determining how risks are managed and needs to be strengthened as well. • Ministry of Public Enterprises need to improve overall monitoring of the entities, including the establishment of independent internal audit functions and a Board Audit Committee, which could assist in identifying the gaps in controls for necessary action. • There is also potential for these public enterprises and State-Owned Entities to be a development agent and earning sector of its own, like the Local Governments, to support development and investment targets for Fiji. In the Asian Development Bank’s latest Report, ‘Finding Balance 2023 Key Findings for Fiji’, the following was noted which, we believe, can be improved substantially: ❖ Number of State-Owned Entities: 20 ❖ Dominant industries: power, aviation and banking ❖ Book value of assets: $4.2 billion ❖ Total fixed assets in the economy: 16 percent to 22 percent of GDP ❖ Average portfolio contribution to GDP: 3.7 percent ❖ Average return on assets: 2.1 percent ❖ Average return on equity: 4 percent</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1546</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 • With a $4.2 billion in assets and average return on equity around 4 percent, again, there is potential and what we saw was that these enterprises were not strategically governed, managed and supervised in the last 10 years to 15 years, and we believe it needs a Ministry of its own. • There is also potential for these public enterprises to be the prime contributor to our planned sovereign wealth fund, apart from our natural resources. The Committee strongly encourages the current Executive Management and Board of relevant public enterprises and other entities to take responsibility for the deficiencies that have been found and identified, even though most of the audited reports are old and were under the auspices of the previous Minister and Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the clarifications provided, forward commitment expressed by the current Management and the Board, and improvements seen by the Committee, revealed that these entities have taken the Auditor-General’s recommendation positively and are taking necessary actions to resolve significant matters that were highlighted. Overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Executives of the 17 public enterprises and other entities for providing its written responses to the audit issues that were raised and measures that have been put in place to resolve the issues identified. Also, I wish to commend the staff of the Office of Auditor-General for providing technical clarifications on those issues, as well as accompanying the Committee to all the consultations around the country. A special thanks goes out to the staff of the Ministry of Public Enterprises and the Permanent Secretary, for the provision of updated figures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to extend my appreciation as well to the honourable Members of the Committee who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report, namely: honourable Sakiusa Tubuna - Deputy Chairperson, honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand. I also wish to thank honourable Ratu Isikeli Tuiwailevu, honourable Vijay Nath and honourable Taito Matasawalevu, who stood in as Alternative Members, pursuant to Standing Order 115(5), and participated in the Committee consultations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few words, I commend this Committee Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. E.
