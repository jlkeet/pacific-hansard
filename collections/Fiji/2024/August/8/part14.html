<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Measures for MSMEs (Question No. 118/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1582 Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the monitoring and evaluation measures in place for the micro, small and medium enterprises that have received assistance and funding? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Tubuna for the question. Firstly, I am happy to report that the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications does conduct regular monitoring and evaluation of grant recipients. It is interesting to note that since inception of its current programme, there has been about $107 million invested in MSMEs in terms of the broad spectrum from young entrepreneurs, women, co-operatives and the like. The Ministry has developed quite a comprehensive programme that actually monitors the progress of MSMEs. The framework is, obviously, data driven - it works on data analysis, doing visitations and tries to measure the grant impacts in terms of employment created, livelihood supported, growth in revenue, increase export markets, for example, for the National Export Strategy (NES) and contribution to the SDGs. Over the last two years, Sir, there has been about almost 2,000 visits covering various assistance programmes. They use a software called Kobo Toolbox to do the analysis and there are some interesting statistics or findings from the reports, for example, in terms of the Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRDP) and Northern Development Programme (NDP) which have a success rate of 90 percent and 95 percent respectively. That is quite pleasing to note because they are quite popular programmes and particularly the fact that they reach right into the rural areas. On average, IHRDP recipients creates about nine jobs whereas the NES creates about 13 jobs and NDP three jobs. On average, for the NES recipients, some of them are generating up to $65,000 in sales and should be noted, of course, that this varies by sector as well. I thought I just share some specific examples, just to demonstrate how impactful these programmes are. Of course, it was started by the previous Government. In 2021-2022, Mr. Samisoni Manewa was supported by IHRDP for a three-tonne manual truck. This assistance has allowed him to improve his product. A recent visit to Mr. Manewa’s farm has shown a 12 percent increase in sales, which is great and it is, of course, demonstrating the impact of the funding on the farm. Ms. Alumita Tuila of Goodness Investment was supported through IHRDP with baking equipment and is from Galoa Village in Kadavu. Through the baking equipment, she was able to produce about three batches of freshly baked loaves of bread in a day for 150 households. From that, she was then able to secure a loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) of about $5,000 to expand her business. The business expansion, of course, has been made possible through her sales. I am told she is now selling to Vunisea Secondary School as well, Sir. I guess the monitoring of these businesses is showing that a lot of the money is being put to good use, Sir, which is positive and right now, we are trying to, sort of, create a database for the national MSMEs around Fiji. With that database, we can actually then much closely track on an automated basis the MSMEs and ensure that the money that we are investing in MSMEs is well spent. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I understand that you would be doing monitoring and evaluation of these MSMEs. In terms of evaluation, their effectiveness and their success is one of the things that you would be able to ascertain. If we have found ones that are effective and we ascertain that they can do better, what are we</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>1583</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 actually doing in terms of redirecting or directing them to take them to the next level in terms of growing as a business? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question, honourable Member. The story about Mrs. Tuila is a good sort of example of that kind of process where we inject some initial funding and because the business is doing well, there is an opportunity to generate more funding opportunities, for example, through concessional loans through FDB. What we are trying to do, Sir, is to guide the SMEs as they develop. Right now, one of the things that we are blessed with is that there is starting to be a lot more options for financing for MSMEs. Fijian Holdings has come up with two products, the Vanua Financing and also the Marama Financing. Before for SMEs, you have to do equity contributions. There is a product now at HFC that they just launched last week where you do not need equity. You can actually go and provide a proposal if the proposal is good, then you actually just lend the money. There is a guarantee that is in place with BLP that actually covers the equity component. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we are trying to do is to handhold the businesses from the beginning. There are some that are just so good, they actually take off quite well. A lot of time we encourage diversification of income. So, you are actually looking at other opportunities, particularly, in a village setting. You can be doing bread, like in Mrs. Tuila’s case. She actually owns the shops that sells everything else in the village. So, it is sort of a progressive evolution of the business. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, what kind of support and guidance is provided to MSMEs to help them meet the monitoring and evaluation requirements? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the current monitoring and evaluation methodology that is in place, that was in place when I got there. From what I have seen of it, it is quite robust. I think what is desperately needed at the moment there is, an actual proper tracker so we can actually know, like for example, if you ask me, how many MSMEs are in the country, I have no idea. I think that should be the starting point as we try and develop the new MSME ecosystem. So, then we will be able to track each business, and would it not be wonderful to be able to track something from micro and you can see it become a small business and then it keeps growing. We are starting to see a lot more interest coming into the office. There are some businesses that are doing juice are doing it very well. Now they are saying they want to do restaurants, so it is how do we handhold them through that process. There are some very good expertise, a lot of staff particularly the MSMEs space are being well experienced. They do a good job of handholding a lot of our aspiring entrepreneurs through that process. Right now, there is probably not a need to review but certainly as we need to create a database. I believe there might be a need to relook at the valuation methodology again. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, just on the back of your answer earlier on, I see all the institutions that you mentioned were basically its our own FDB, our own HFC. The question is, have you been able to get some traction from the other commercial banks et cetera because this is a huge area for us the MSMEs. We all know what they do for a country and its development. For many years, I think a lot of the commercial banks have steered clear of that particular issue. Have you been able to get some traction with these other commercial banks apart from our own HFCs and FDBs because we simply to be forever left with the burden (not a burden) but at least getting the assistance to these MSMEs.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1584 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question, honourable Koya. Put it this way, it is an ongoing discussion, clearly each bank has their own risk appetite, Mr. Speaker, and that dictates what to serve the market. From what I can see, HFC and FDB have actually started escalating their desire to participate in those markets. Obviously FDB traditionally has been the mainstay of MSME support, HFC is there. It is an ongoing discussion with some of the other banks, I know BSP is very good in the MSME space. I think there is a rural banking subsidy that we provide to them so that they can create the rural presence. So even with BSP, for example, they already have an accelerator incubator programme. In a year, they will put three lots of 25 businesses through formal training from financial reporting, how to manage your business and costs. The bigger Australian banks tend to work with the larger MSMEs, so it is really down to their appetite, but it is just an ongoing discussion. Clearly you have to do more. I think the numbers that I saw, there is about, if I am not wrong about a pent-up demand of about $200 million or $300 million of desire for MSME funding. It does not have a place to go. Some of the things that are happening in the marketplace, will create that opportunity for more funding and therefore more business by default an economic growth. MR. SPEAKER.- On the issue of incubators, that was something that struck the group that recently visited Indonesia. It was the universities that drove the project of young entrepreneur bachelor students. They registered themselves and they register what they want to do. It is the university that carries them, and they are selling wonders from the various kind of things that you drink to take away your sickness by mixing herbs, ginger and things of that nature that is in the market. The only issue there is they have a very big population and they are a market to themselves, about 300 million and they are doing very well in MSMEs. I do not know if we can learn to take a leaf out from that. Perhaps on your next visit to Indonesia, I would strongly advice that you liaise with the areas that we visited, and our Ambassador in Indonesia is very knowledgeable of what is happening there. Progress of Registration - Traditional Title Holders (Question No. 120/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the progress of the registration of vacant traditional title holder(s)? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 6,216 traditional vanua positions, 214 Turaga iTaukei, 1,375 Turaga ni Yavusa and 4,627 Turaga ni Mataqali. As at January 2024, 90 Turaga itaukei positions were filled or 42 percent, 670 Turaga ni Yavusa were filled or 49 percent and 2,305 Turaga ni Mataqali were filled or 50 percent. Therefore, about 3,065 positions were filled or 49 percent of the positions. The vacancy rate was 51 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a long time the vacancy rate in traditional titles, positions was about 50 percent. More than half of the vanua structure lacked leadership. A major reason was because the procedure for filling vacant positions is always led by the vanua. There is no movement if they decide not to act. When a vacancy arises, members of the Tokatoka, Mataqali or Yavusa decides who the next title holder should be, then they inform the relevant provincial council office which in turn notifies the Veitarogi Vanua. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year the Gret Council of Chiefs (GCC) changed that procedure. After choosing Rewa as the pilot province for poverty alleviation, the GCC instructed the Veitarogi Vanua</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1585 to visit the villages in Rewa where vacancies existed. Development would be effective and meaningful only if the vanua leadership is strengthened by filling the vacant posts and providing the awareness and training to the title holders. Mr. Speaker, Rewa Province vacancy rate was 57 percent, with 43 percent of positions being filled. The Veitarogi Vanua visited 50 of Rewa’s 55 villages. The visit reduced the vacancy rate from 57 percent to 29 percent or 71 percent of all positions are now filled. The success in Rewa prompt the Veitarogi Vanua to visit Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove. The first was Bua, which had a 44 percent vacancy rate, but by the end of the exercise, the vacancy rate decreased to 16 percent, with 84 percent of all positions in Bua now filled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Macuata initially had a 39 percent vacancy rate, which decreased to 12 percent resulting in 88 percent of the positions being filled. Lastly, Cakaudrove had a 59 percent vacancy rate which decreased to 12 percent with 88 percent of the positions now filled. Last week, the Veitarogi Vanua visited Serua. Before the visit, Serua had 48 out of 81 positions vacant or 59 percent vacancy rate. After the visit, 67 positions are now filled with Serua vacancy rate reduced to 18 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary 258 out of 343 positions in Rewa are now filled; 331 out of 391 positions are now filled in Bua; 414 out of 470 positions in Macuata are now filled; 439 out of 499 positions in Cakaudrove are now filled; and 67 out of 81 positions in Serua are now filled. Following the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) intervention, the overall vacancy rate decreased from 49 percent to 44 percent, with 56 percent of all positions now being filled. For the first time in a long time, we have now surpassed the 51 percent mark. This was our target before the end of the last financial year, which we have achieved. We plan to visit all the provinces by the end of this financial year. At the current rate, we project that 88 percent of all positions will be filled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC reinstatement has been less than a year, yet its profound wisdom and guidance are already felt. We have seen the success of taking the services to the community instead of waiting for them up here in our office. We will work with the vanua to ensure that most of the 6,216 traditional title positions are filled. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, thank you indeed for the response and let me congratulate your Ministry and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs for the progress made, and we all know how important this is. Just a quick question, in the numbers that have been filled, you have detailed the different positions; Turaga i Taukei, Turaga ni Yavusa and Turaga ni Mataqali. With those that have been confirmed now, is it more with the Turaga ni Mataqali or Turaga ni Yavusa because sometimes the higher up we go, the more the complication is in our communities. Out of those numbers, is it more on Turaga ni Yavusa or Turaga i Taukei or Turaga ni Mataqali? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, the latest one that we have received is mostly the Turaga ni Mataqali that has been filled and we are working on that. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister on the huge progress that is being made. This has been a long-standing issue that people have talked about at great length, and I know it also affects me from Lakeba and what happens in there in our mataqali, na yavusa. But if I heard correctly, the statement that you made was that the instruction was given by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) to the Veitarogi Vanua. If that is correct, then to my mind, it seems that the GCC is having a direct impact on operational matters, or was that a my</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>1586</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 misstatement on your behalf? If that could be just clarified? HON. I. VASU.- Honourable Usamate, that has been the resolution from the GCC. When we took the reports of the China trip to the GCC, the plan was to trial in Rewa. When we took Rewa to be the pilot province, then they advised us if the Veitarogi Vanua, instead of waiting for the vnua to come, if we can take the Veitarogi Vanua to the Rewa province. MR. SPEAKER.- Could we have something on that, honourable Attorney-General or you want to shed some more light on that? The honourable Usamate is concerned of the role that GCC plays here to the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. HON. G. E. LEUNG.- Mr. Speaker, thank you for the question. As far as I am aware honourable Member, it is well within the remit and the jurisdiction of the Great Council of Chiefs to give advisory opinions or recommendations with respect to matters pertaining to Fijian culture and customary practices. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, just a supplementary question through you, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his submission to the House this afternoon. We usually know that the Veitarogi Vanua comes where there is a dispute, but I am grateful to the Great Council Chiefs that now they have come to the vanua. I just want to know Mr. Speaker, what sort of programmes they normally do when they come and visit the vanua? Do they hear disputes, or they clarify titled positions as to who should be the holder, just for the Fijians who are listening to our conservation this afternoon? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, what the Veitarogi Vanua will always do is, receives all the records of those who have got the request for the Veitarogi Vanua to look after the issues in regards to the Vanua. Then we liaise with the Roko and the timeframe that the Veitarogi Vanua wants to visit each province, then the Roko will organise with the Veitarogi Vanua the list that they have got, if they can advise them that they are coming. At the same time, they can look at the disputed boundaries and other things like that, they cover all those. Next week, they will be travelling to Kadavu. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu, honourable Minister. I must thank and congratulate you and your Ministry for the great work that has been undertaken. Again, I kind of kept to myself when I look towards the Attorney-General since he was a member of the review team of the GCC before he became the AG. The actual role is of the Chiefs collectively. When they come together, they sit, discuss and come up with these kinds of resolutions. There is a speedy way of finding a way through the hard yards, especially in the Vanua and I am so thankful for that since you have reduced everything down to about 18 percent or something. That is a huge achievement, and I must congratulate you and your staff for that. Thank you very much. Payment of Additional VAT on Imported Goods (Question No. 121/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament on the additional VAT on goods received from overseas?</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1587 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that question. I was thinking of giving one very simple answer because I think the question itself is a bit flawed. There is no such thing as additional VAT, but I know the intent of the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the intent of the question appears to be on the recent policy changes on personal imports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget, the threshold for personal imports under Code 212 has been reduced from $2,000 to $1,000 and 15 percent VAT is now levied on that effective from 28th June. Previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, personal importations were treated under Concession Code 212 under Customs Tariff Act whereby the importer did not pay fiscal duty, Import Excise duty and VAT on all personal imports up to a value of $2,000. This, Sir, before the threshold was $500. During Covid it was moved to $2,000. So, what we have done Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to reduce that from $2,000 to $1,000, which is still much higher than the $400 that existed prior to the COVID pandemic. So, the intention of that measure during COVID was to provide a temporary relief to those who wanted to import at that time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue with respect to this was that we found a lot of instances of misuse where certain individuals, retailers had imported and sold goods avoiding VAT, creating unfair advantage. So, you could import every week if you had the money, and some people were running businesses from home. It is not fair to those who cannot import online and use other mechanisms because they have the money. Those who go and buy locally, would obviously have to pay the VAT. So, it is a measure that will bring about equity, it is not going to treat others unfairly. That is the rationale for closing that loophole and removing that COVID measure that there. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand the rationale that he has given, but the concern is, on one hand the Government talks about the remittances they received and on the other hand, the people who live abroad have been supplementing families’ income by sending food items which they cannot afford, whether it is a wedding, whether it is a funeral or whatever, whatever. But my question to the honourable Minister is which he has just said now that the VAT came into effect on 28 th July, 2024. This is the Budget Book which is an official document and on Page No. 30 it says, and I quote: “VAT comes into effect on 1 st August, 2024”. Which one is correct, honourable Minister? Is it this book or what you are saying in Parliament? My second question is, how are you going to provide that remedy now to the consumers? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, honourable Premila Kumar’s understanding of the way in which the VAT is applied... (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-...and the way in which Customs duty comes into effect is the day the Budget is announced HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Why did you write 1 st August?</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>1588</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Obviously, she does not understand what..., HON. P. D. KUMAR.- It’s 1 st August, here! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I said very clearly, under the Customs Tariff Act where the importer did not pay fiscal duty, import excise duty...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Admit you made a mistake. It is an official document:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.:</span> Listen, listen!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...that comes into effect on the day the Budget is announced:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Why did you write 1 st August? MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that honourable Premila Kumar’s understanding of how VAT is applying...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I do not know:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- …is actually quite bad. This is an example to prove her understanding of how VAT is applied, which is actually wrong. She put out a Facebook post on 26 th July, 2024, “this is an example to proof her understanding of how VAT is applying...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Is actually wrong:</span> She puts this Facebook post “Unbelievable butter price has the result of 15 percent VAT. 500 gramme butter is almost the price of chicken.

PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, VAT is a one- off thing. When it was introduced last year, first of all, it was not a 15 percent, it was moved from 9 percent to 15 percent... (Hon. Opposition Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! You asked the question, and you want to provide the answer too?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> If I just explain, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He is beating around the bush:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.:</span> It is not beating around the bush because now, she is caught.</p><p>She is caught lying as a Member of Parliament as to how VAT is applied. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when VAT was increased last year, it takes effect, after that, the increase or</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1589 decrease in the prices is not based on VAT, is based on other factors. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Answer the question! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The prices, for example, in October 2023, the landed cost went down by 12.83 (16 percent). Would she said that this was caused by increase or decrease in VAT? HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- And for an honourable Member to go out and put a misleading post... HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely wrong! (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … this is the kind of lies they tell, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, when she was asking the question, the question itself was flawed, because she does not understand the VAT. There is no such thing as additional VAT, but it is the VAT at a point in time. Anything that happens in terms of the fluctuation in prices, thereafter, is dependent on other factors, whether it is freight cost, whether it is the cost of raw materials, that is how VAT is applied. However, coming back to the question, I have answered that, customs duty and import duty come into effect the day the Budget is announced, and I have explained this in Parliament previously. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether it came on 20 th or 1 st, it really does not matter to me but what actually does matter now at the moment is, after this policy was implemented, what this courier company started doing, and this is what they are telling people, is that they did not have anyone to process the VAT in their company. Now, it is an additional burden. I have a common example, if you actually import something, on $100, if you are paying $15 as VAT component, there is an additional charge of $20 as agency fee or administration fee. So there is an additional $20 being charged by the courier companies on top of the VAT, which is a burden. It is there, I am requesting the honourable Minister for Finance to, please, investigate and if this is true, please, get the courier companies to stop charging this additional $20. The other misconception is, if they actually open a particular consignment, they also need a Biosecurity Officer to come and inspect with an additional $5.25. So, they are paying much more to the courier company at this point in time to what they are paying as a VAT component, if they are actually buying something worth FJ$100. If the honourable Minister for Finance can look into this. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to facilitate VAT payments, electronic pay systems, like M-PAiSA, MyCash and internet banking can be utilised. Freight companies are seamlessly managing this through freight companies, ensuring that there is a streamlined process without additional burden. We have also asked the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service to deploy additional staff to assist freight companies. Options like, pre-clearance and pre-payment are available for courier companies and freight stations to enhance operational efficiency. But we will also check on what additional charges they are putting on.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>1590</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for a lengthy no good answer. He has mentioned that customs duty and fiscal duty comes into play, in fact, it went immediately. I totally agree with it. But the question was on VAT. VAT, as per the blue book, states that it will come into effect from 1 st August. When the Budget was announced the VAT on personal imports came into effect immediately. That is the clarification we want and that is what you need to answer. Do not go beating around the bush, get to the point and answer the question. MR. SPEAKER.- He has answered that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- He did not answer the question:</span></p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- No, he has answered your questions by stating what you have just said,</h4><p>honourable Sachida Nand. So, let us move on. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the blue book is very clear. What he said, is not what he has answered. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister needs to learn when he answers a question, just answer it. Stop depreciating and making personal attacks on people. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, have a bit of decorum. Have a bit of decorum! Have some spine and be strong and be still. Here is the question, has the honourable Minister consulted freight companies and recipients about the challenge they face due to the new personal import requirements? Because they have things cluttering up their warehouses, people are not being able to take them out because of these changes that you have made. If so, what feedback has been received on how this has been addressed? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just informed them that FRCS has deployed additional staff. They are working with freight companies and there would have been initial teething problems as you introduce new systems. They are working on the freight companies, and I am sure those problems are sorted out. Installation of Telecommunications Towers (Question No. 122/2024) HON. K. V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament of the process that was undertaken to facilitate the installation of telecommunication towers in our rural and maritime areas? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, to be honest this is probably one area where we are really keen to get going but let me just to explain where we have gotten to. Basically, when I took over the Ministry of Communications, the whole Department was gutted, Telecommunications Authority of Fiji (TAF) was really in disarray, so we had to start rebuilding those institutions. So, we went out and selected the right people. We have a very capable Chairman, Mr. David Eyre, who is a former Telecom Senior Manager and he is there with some other well-known telecommunications people, such as Tomasi Vakatora, who was a long time Executive of ATH. They have now started to progress this exercise well.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1591 I would like to assure the House that we are very committed to actually get the rest of the country connected. We are going to use the universal service fee which is available and there is quite a bit of money there, and we are also having conversation with some donor agencies to see whether we can top that up so we can move through very quickly. Basically, we actually had to go out to do an Expression of Interest or tender to the telecommunications industry. That is now done. There is now conversation where we had to actually solicit some expertise from the USAid - their Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership (DCCP) programme, which provide us with some expertise in terms of financial modelling to decide where we put that infrastructure. That is now all in place and I can confirm that towards the end of December, we will start deploying the towers. Right now, because of Starlink, Sir, it has created another option for the Ministry in terms options for connectivity, so we are looking at that as well. But rest assured, Sir, I am really trying to ensure that before the end of this year we start connecting up. The idea is to connect the maritime region first and at the same time look at some of the more marginalised provinces such as Ra, Bua, so that is the kind of progress we are trying to make. This will be quite a wonderful thing to do and I just like to assure both sides of the House that are working very hard to get this done. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, with respect to the installation of these particular towers, will we also be allowing the commercial companies that currently exists in the telecommunications industry to piggyback onto these towers and provide the particular services that are required for FMA, et cetera, all the kind of stuff in the rural maritime areas? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, yes, we are looking at some other options as well. Pacific, for example, has a full solution that includes a solar system that actually powers up the tower. So that is another option as well that has been looked at. The options that can be looked at, the team is working very hard to ensure that we get to the right landing point and to honourable Usamate’s point about execution, that is going to be quite important to make sure we get it done correctly. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the work that he is doing in addressing this issue. It has been a longstanding issue, and Ministers will have realised as you go around for your talanoa session this is what people perennially talk about. I am glad to hear also that the focus is on the rural and maritime, places where companies have been reluctant to set up towers because of the huge cost and the low returns. Of the around when we were doing the assessments, there are about 300 blackspots all around Fiji. So, roughly in terms of the rural and maritime the blackspot areas, what percentage do you think you will be able to cover within this financial year and the next financial year? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, that is quite a good question. I do not have that data one me to be honest, but I will get that and provide it to honourable Usamate. (Question No. 136/2024 withdrawn) International Standards - Building and Construction Sector (Question No. 137/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>1592</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to adopt more international standards and guidelines in the Building and Construction Sector to make the industry more effective and efficient? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems like I am monopolising question time today but it is really because I did not have the chance to answer the questions from Tuesday. Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree that the building and construction industry is one of the most vital industries to the country and the need to continue to have sustainable practices and standards is very important in ensuring, you recall that I have been talking a lot about investment and the need to have good standards to be able to support the construction is quite important. Historically, there was a guideline for improving building safety and resilience for new single storey houses and schools in the rural areas that was launched by with the World Bank. Also, more recently there has been standards such as the standard on re-enforcing materials which is AS/NZS 4671 that was introduced and that was just to look at reinforcement standards. At the moment, there is a discussion going on in terms of wind load standards, Mr. Speaker, and that will be quite important in terms of the ability to have insurance cover in the future. There are some activities going on with the engineers and also the stakeholders at the moment, in terms of that particular proposed standard and once we are in a position to bring that forward, we will. Some of the other standards that we are looking at include plywood standards, Mr. Speaker, and even bamboo standards. That is just to create more options in terms of construction, particularly in terms of the bamboo standard. So that is being looked at the moment and I think overall, as we continue to evolve as an economy, the need for good building standards will become more and more important. The Department of Trade Measurements and Standards, I call them the silent heroes in the Ministry of Trade. We do not hear them that much in terms of visibility like other fancy areas like Trade and Investment, but they are doing quite a bit of work in trying to ensure that standards in the country continue to be of a good level, good standard, because it does ensure that we have, not only resilient construction but also buildings that last. Finally, just a note of interest, I guess the attempt to regionalise a lot of these issues, Fiji now Co-Chairs the Pacific Islands Standards Committee, which is another avenue to discuss standards and ventilate standards across the region. The Department of Measurement and Standards will continue to work with the rest of the Pacific in terms of supporting standards, Sir. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, obviously the need for improving our standards to make sure that we have good buildings that are effective and the manner in which we build buildings are effective and efficient is highly laudatory. As I was listening, Mr. Speaker Sir, I was wondering establishing the standards, there has been a lot of work done recently on the National Building Code. National Building Code has always been under the Minister for of Health. Over the past few years, the Ministry for Public Works has taken the lead on this. I am just wondering as you look into the standards, how is that integration with the building code, how is that working at the moment? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for that question. In terms of when the consultation on the standards happen, I am trying to remember the position, but the Government architect gets involved in actually the establishment of the standards, he is also a member of the Fiji Institute of Engineers Association. That cross check and discission is currently happening. There is</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>8 th August, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1593 another discussion that is probably going to happen very soon on the Building Code as we go forward because of some of the automation requirements we will require next year, but that is a separate exercise. For now, there is cross consultation in terms of ensuring that the standards are robust. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, it is great to see that the honourable Minister is actually going to improve the international standards and guidelines that are going to be used within the building industry. One of the most important parts of all of this is the Department of National Trade Measurement and Standards as you have mentioned rightfully, Sir, critical component; very silent but very critical component. Will you be fortifying the department so that we can actually monitor properly what comes into the country and we are compliant in terms of the materials brought to the country? Will you also be ensuring that the authorities concerned that are involved in this particular process (I am talking about the necessary councils) are brought up to speed quickly about what can be done, what can be used and what cannot be used? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The short answer is, yes,we are trying to sort of fortify the department and that is involving reaching out to some development partners to assist strengthen the expertise which is quite important. Also, one of the other things that is being done to actually fortify is actually trying to partner up with some of our donors partners in terms of standards. As you know, we rely a lot on the New Zealand standards and that will continue. And now we are actually in the process, now that we are actually in the process of creating a bit more of a closer relationship with the New Zealand standards one just to ensure that we are on the right track. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, I raised this issue too earlier during the week about the legislations that we have because the honourable Usamate stated that the building code, although they have assigned the responsibility to the Director Building but in our legislation it is still with and from NDMO perspective, this is one of the problems as well particularly with the standards not only in the schools, but housing in the rural areas and even some in the urban areas. So, will that be something that will be part of the changes that will be considered honourable Deputy Prime Minister? The changes in the law. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not going to open up that discussion because I had not had the conversation with the honourable Minister for Infrastructure who looks after the national building code particularly. But there are some things that are possibly going to change but what we are doing at the moment is trying to align up the standards first, make sure that they are clear. As you will recall, we have been talking about the automation of the building permit process and what we are trying to ensure is the building code and whatever requirements in there are actually aligned closely to the automation that we are trying to do. So, there is going to be a conversation, but I just have not had the chance to talk to the honourable Minister yet. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has mentioned most of the things but the component of a building code, there are two very important things which I feel should be included in there. One is water, as you know that water is very important and, in any disaster, or there is a water cut but we experience a lot of water cuts. If that happens then you will find the whole building needs to be closed because of health and safety, he did not mention that. Solar light is very important now. I hope these two components are included in the code. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request the honourable Minister to please elaborate on that? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure whether that is a question or a statement but I will just say that we note the comments of honourable Nath and we will make sure that we have the appropriate discussions.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>1594</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>8 th August, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- He is trying to have that included in the building code but that should be directed towards the Minister for Infrastructure.</p></body>
