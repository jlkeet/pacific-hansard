<body><h3>DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THEPRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3><p>DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move: That this Parliament thanks His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to also acknowledge those Fijians all over the country who are watching us on livestream television or hearing us on radio, and also visitors to Fiji - our tourists. We welcome them most sincerely and thank them for their support of our country. I hope that those who are listening in or viewing us are having good reception wherever they are. We also acknowledge their keen interest in the affairs of our nation and the proceedings of your Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my distinct honour and privilege as Prime Minister to move the motion now being debated in Parliament and, that is, to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Address while opening the 2024 Session of Parliament on Monday, 4 th March, 2024. May I also congratulate Ratu Meli Derenalagi and our Drua Rugby Team on their victory over the Canterbury Crusaders at Churchill Park in Lautoka on Saturday. I am fortunate to have watched all their three victories at home here in Fiji, the first two by the very slimmest of margins and also in the last minute and the last match was quite a comfortable ten-point margin. I also congratulate the coaching staff and management and all who contributed to the performance of the team and to the big crowd that came to see them play. I also thank the Administrators of Lautoka City and the Fiji Sports Council for looking after the venue for such a great morale-boosting event. Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of us celebrated Father’s Day in our churches and at Wesley, we also celebrated Harvest Sunday. I congratulate all the farmers in Parliament and all fathers in Fiji, and to all those who were able to present their fruits of their first harvest this year. Congratulations - ke se vo na i tei, qai kau mai vale. At our Father’s Day worship yesterday, we also remembered the fathers who departed this life during the year since our last Father’s Day. One of the speakers in church reminded the fathers</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>14 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 that many of the social ills of today, such as drug and alcohol abuse, violence against women and girls, ill-discipline in schools, et cetera, have all stemmed from the failure of fathers to exercise loving but firm leadership in families and communities. In his Address, His Excellency encouraged us, as democratically elected representatives, to listen to the voices of our people, not only to those who have elected us, but all our citizens - young and old, men and women. He urged us all to faithfully embrace with resolve the principles of democracy and humanity as enshrined in our Constitution. By doing so, we respect the integrity and dignity of our Parliament and honour all Fijians. His Excellency further urged us that while we acknowledge and recognise our differences, we must be united with one common resolve to ensure that we live in a peaceful, progressive and prosperous nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency reminisced on his days as a boy growing up in his village and its environs and the people. I am sure we can all relate to his story. He spent several happy years of his youth in Macuata with the farming families during sugarcane harvesting season. Their multiethnic and multicultural integrated community in Macuata taught him many important lessons in life which included hard work, respect for elders, family unity and respect for other ethnic communities. The two major ethnic communities in Fiji have mostly lived in harmony together. His Excellency, however, rued the unfortunate fact that some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust among our communities, for their own political ends. This has led to the perception of communal differences within our society, and His Excellency has pleaded with us, honourable Members of Parliament, to continue to promote harmony and embrace diversity in our nation. When I was a young boy attending Drekeniwai District School in my village of Drekeniwai, Navatu, Cakaudrove, where my father taught, our house was the Government workers’ billet when they passed through the village or came to work in it. There were two mail carriers who worked for the post and communications department at that time. They traversed the coastal villages between Matakunea and Natewa on the Eastern Coast of Natewa Bay riding on their faithful horses. One was Mamaj and the other was Lachmaiya. They brought their own pots and pans and some cutlery and utensils because, as my mother told me, they would not be able to eat food prepared in pottery, et cetera, that have been used to cook or serve food that were forbidden in their religions, but my sisters and I could eat any of the food that they prepared for themselves and sometimes, my mother would allow them to cook for the whole family. They were very kindhearted, honest and cheerful for us the young children in the village, many of us even called them Kuku Mamaj or Kuku Lachmaiya and they loved that. We were family. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not blame any honourable Member who might have looked my way when His Excellency mentioned those words and I quote: “…some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust among our communities for their own political ends.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I cannot change my past, I can contribute to our joint efforts to change the future of this country, and I will. His Excellency reminded us of the importance of respectful debates as it has an impact on inter-ethnic relations of our different communities in Fiji, implored us to leave aside our differences and strive for the common good of our people and to focus on our shared destiny, our commonality rather than our small differences. He believes that we can all aspire to these fundamental truths that demonstrate what true leadership is all about. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency also mentioned his belief that financial literacy will empower our people with financial security and self-reliance, encouraging a culture of financial responsibility that can have a positive impact on national prosperity and ensure for all, a secure future.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 15 Before the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister Finance went on his recent official visit to India, I asked him to study the development introduced by Prime Minister Modi to ensure that every person in India (1.408 billion of them) has a bank account. Every market and street side vendor had a portable credit card terminal or Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) as part of their Financial Literacy and National Savings Encouragement Programmes. He came back and he told me that he had very fruitful discussions with them and ready to introduce some ideas to the Parliament. I was inspired to ask the honourable Professor Prasad to do that in India when I noticed a young caddy pulling a golf player’s bag on a qiqi or trolley and I said to my caddy, “how much of the $40 fee paid today will get to your family?” He replied, “Probably none, Sir.” I told him that $40 would have made a positive impact on a family’s weekly income in Wailea or Nanuku Informal Settlements. We can emulate what Prime Minister Modi has done in India by providing access to comprehensive financial literacy, supported with the enabling environment and necessary financial resources. We all can make informed decisions about savings, investing and managing our finances effectively. While His Excellency would like to see Jone who is a dalo farmer and Ram who sells sweets at his cart learn how to manage and have access to finance, I would like the young caddies in golf clubs around Fiji and all market and street-side vendors to be able to do the same, and at the same time, encourage a culture of savings which will allow the development of a sustainable investment plan for their families’ long term security. I, like His Excellency, would like to see members of our communities learning and sharing from each other’s expertise and experiences so we can all prosper together. There is a young man, originally from Taveuni, now living in the Wailea Informal Settlement. He has a weak right hand. People in the area pay him to pound their yaqona, and he does it one- handed, using only his left hand. When I saw him in church a few weeks ago, he has a very well- developed left arm, strong biceps and triceps and a healthy bank account which a good Samaritan had helped him with. His name is Iowane (not Naivalurua), and I met him many years ago while we were both picking up plastic bottles from along the Suva-Laucala seawall. At this stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all civil servants, Government workers and Provincial and Municipal workers and leaders, captains of industries and the business communities who have come forward to support the Government’s efforts to formulate a new National Development Plan. The views of all members of our communities are now being heard through meaningful consultations and these meaning consultations dialogue will lead to better outcomes, foster ownership, inclusiveness and social cohesion. He also mentioned the Ocean of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the vision for a united and cohesive Fiji is dovetailed very well with the vision for the Ocean of Peace for the Pacific. I, on many occasions at home and internationally continue to champion the concept of Ocean of Peace. I sincerely hope that the Pacific leaders will discuss and embrace the concept in its next meeting this year to be held in the Kingdom of Tonga in August. My vision is that we must all come together to promote and elevate peace for our vast maritime area which is the Blue Pacific. The aim is to promote peace as the highest virtue in the Pacific. We must continue to embrace the Pacific Way of patient dialogue and consensus building as our common heritage and core to our Vuvale - the Pacific family. The Government will work with other nations, through the Pacific Islands Forum to ensure that the concept of an Ocean of Peace will enhance and not reduce each State’s full sovereignty rights.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>16 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Our Foreign Policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is guided by three key pillars which focusses on our sovereignty, security and our prosperity. We are currently in the process of developing a framework for our Foreign Policy through a White Paper. The White Paper will clearly define our identity and values, while setting a new direction in expressing our goals, our priorities and our ambitions. The intent is to better position Fiji in its role in the region and globally with clarity in our responsibility as a member of the Blue Pacific Continent. We have reviewed our Vuvale Partnership that was signed by the Australian Prime Minister and I in October of last year, and last week through that Vuvale Partnership, I received on behalf of the Government of Fiji, the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Republic of Fiji Navy a Guardian Class Patrol Boat, the RFNS Puamau in Perth, Australia. This new addition will enhance our surveillance capability at a period of growing concerns of transnational crime, smuggling and illegal fishing in our EEZ. In addition, it will support our effort for rescue, emergency response and rehabilitation during and after disasters. The Government and the people of Fiji would like to convey our deepest gratitude to the government and the people of Australia for this timely assistance in building our capacity. This is in addition to the budget support and other assistance they have provided. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is now in consultation with the New Zealand Government to review the Duavata Partnership following the election of a new government late last year. Beyond Oceania, we are building stronger ties and cooperation with our development partners including the United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Japan, Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, UAE, Saudi Arabia and the European Union. On Clime Change and Environment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must all recognise that climate change is a cross-cutting issue and is an existential threat to our very survival and identity. This is the very reason I strongly support a bipartisan approach in addressing all issues relating to climate change because it requires all hands-on deck. On Good Governance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of my immediate priorities or our immediate priorities on assuming office as the Government and as Prime Minister in my case, is to ensure collaborative, transparent and accountable decision-making processes in Government. In 2023, the Coalition Government put into place a strategic, robust and clear decision-making machinery to support better coordination, formulation and implementation of policies and programmes. As part of our commitment to good governance and empowerment of local communities, we will work towards the review of the Banaban Settlement Act. We also plan to hold elections for the Rabi Island Council, complete the naturalisation processes for Rabi and Kioa islanders and at the same time, we will urgently address the socio-economic needs of the Melanesian Vasu-i-Taukei community. The Small Grants Scheme under my portfolio will continue to support local communities to improve sustainable livelihoods. I have made the assurance that all commitments made by my predecessor to the communities will be honoured by the Coalition Government. Development Assistance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will also be focusing on the development and implementation of the Vanua Levu Upgrading and Sealing of Roads Project. I cannot hear any “about time” from the Vanua Levu Members of Parliament.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 17 (Laughter) This is a flagship project of the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Fiji, to improve access to markets and promote economic activities on Vanua Levu. It is estimated that the upgrading and resealing of 80 kilometers of roads will cost FJ$300 million. On Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service plays an integral part in delivering cost effective Government initiatives to our people. The removal of the contract arrangements and increasing of the retirement age to 60 has brought more confidence to our civil servants. We have confirmed a lot of acting appointments that have been acting for over six months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, amendments have also been implemented to relevant civil service guidelines that will allow ministries to increase the salaries of its deserving officers based on their performance. On public enterprises, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the State-Owned Entities and public enterprises will continue to be supported to improve financial performance, and return, on investment. The re-establishment of the Higher Salaries Commission which came into effect in October last year will promote transparency and consistency in the salaries of CEOs of all State-Owned Enterprises. There will also be a review of the Fiji Mahogany Industry which will be a key initiative undertaken in 2024. The review will identify the necessary structural reforms to enable an efficient business environment for all stakeholders, in particular, to encourage resource owners to participate in value addition in the processing of mahogany products. In addition, the Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 and Mahogany Industry (Licensing and Branding Act) 2011 will be reviewed to ensure transparency, accountability and provide optimum return on the industry. On Information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also hold the portfolio of Information and National Archives of Fiji. The availability of timely and accurate information is critical in modern society. The public must be informed of all the activities undertaken by their government. The Department of Information will continue to provide timely and effective dissemination of Government’s development agenda and activities as and when it happens. The Department of Information will continue to nurture improved working relationships with the mainstream media, and this is in respect of the Government’s commitment for free and independent media. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President’s Address at the Opening of Parliament reminded us to focus on our common purpose and not on our differences. It is my hope and prayer that we work together to build a stronger nation with social cohesion and unity of purpose. I urge you to deliberate with intention towards unity, thoughtfulness and inclusivity. To have a meaningful debate, we must commit ourselves to respect one another in considering Government’s legislative agenda, policies and programmes as outlined in the His Excellency the President’s Address. May the people of this land that we all love be the ultimate beneficiaries of our collective effort. Together we are stronger. God bless Fiji, God bless us all. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, take note that we will follow the Batting Order accordingly and be reminded to keep to the timing. The first bell will be rung at 18 minutes and the final bell at 20 minutes. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>18 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; ni bula vinaka s aka and a very good morning to you all. I also wish to take this opportunity to convey our congratulations to the Drua Team for the win over the Crusaders during the weekend. We convey our best wishes as well for a belated happy Women’s Day to our women and a happy Commonwealth Day as well. I also wish to remind Parliament that as we celebrated Women’s Day, our Hindu brothers and sisters celebrated Maha Shivratri last weekend and I am also advised that tomorrow, the month of Ramadan starts with our Muslim communities. May I, on behalf of this august Parliament, convey our best wishes to our brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith. It is an honour for me today to stand again in this august Parliament to deliver my response to His Excellency’s the President’s most gracious Address delivered on Monday, 4 th March, 2024 on the occasion of the opening of the second Session of the third Term of Parliament of our beloved Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while doing so, I am mindful of the fact that this response is being delivered in my capacity as the Leader of the Opposition for the first time, and I endeavor to approach it from the lens of national leadership, putting at the forefront the best interests of the nation, and those who call Fiji their home. But first, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would have been beneficial to this Parliament if some references were made to areas of His Excellency’s Address at last years’ Opening of Parliament that has been achieved, which ones have fallen by the wayside, and those that have spilled over into this years’ Address. Government owes this to His Excellency and to this House - the people’s House. My view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to take my role as Leader of the Opposition in a very positive light. Consistent with the vison of my predecessor, I aim to provide leadership from this side of Parliament that guarantees stability, equality, security and opportunity for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the more I delve on the issue, the more I have come to realise the important role that Oppositions play in a Constitutional and Parliamentary democracy as a check and balance for Government. It is an instrument that provides an opportunity for citizens to be heard, and to be enlightened on Parliamentary systems and processes. On the issue of check and balances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time that our parliamentary system takes serious consideration in reviewing and with the aim to strengthen its accountability framework. Mr. Speaker, Sir, accountability involves the ways in which public officials, including Members of Parliament, Ministers, and all public sector bodies can be called to account to answer for their actions. In the absence of accountability mechanisms, the people are unable to ensure that government act wisely, lawfully and fairly in serving their interests. This accountability framework, Mr. Speaker, Sir, includes parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary oversight which are essential for effective democratic governance. I wish to acknowledge your high office, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for taking the lead in this very important area. With that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel it is important that we, the Members of this august Parliament, are fully aware of our roles as representatives of the people of this nation. We are not here for ourselves. Previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a tendency by Members of Parliament to focus on issues of adversarial politics rather than examining matters that are in the public interest and affect us as a nation. This is unfortunate and must change. As the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my team and I will be working hard. We will ask ourselves tough questions before critiquing Government. We will aspire to work</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 19 with the Government to advance the interests of all Fijians. We will give credit where its due, and strongly criticize where necessary and Members of the other side of Parliament should expect that to commence in our deliberations over the next few days. We will ask Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we work together on the things that unite us as a nation rather than those that divide. But how much we can do and how much our political conversation evolves for the better will be dependent on two key issues, which are: • the quantity and quality of information that is shared by the Government both in Parliament and in public spaces; and • by their willingness to listen to and implement the alternative ideas that we may suggest. This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the essence of His Excellency’s plea for members of this august Parliament to “…work across the aisle, find common ground on critical issues facing our nation and put the people first…”. Allow me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to speak on a number of key issues that were raised by His Excellency in his Address. We will agree that as a nation viewed from our historical past, we have had many wasted decades. Members of this august Parliament as current leaders of this nation, it is our duty together with our community leaders and our economic and intellectual elites to look several decades ahead and map out what we would like our future to be, what our national needs are, the challenges and opportunities that will provide us the strategic perspective to guide our nation moving forward. This should be the impetus for our new National Development Plan (NDP). Mr. Speaker, Sir, to only limit our thinking to our four-year term in office is detrimental to our progress as a nation. In any case, I must thank the Government for having taken the initiative to develop a new National Development Plan, whether this was totally necessary considering that one had been in existence is beyond me. Regardless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my hope that the new National Development Plan espouses the high values advocated by His Excellency in his Address and which I fully endorse. This includes the need for Parliament to continue to listen to the voices of the people and that we all aspire to achieve a common goal of a peaceful, progressive and prosperous nation and adhere to the basic values of hard work, respect for our elders, family units and for other ethnic communities. Those values, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are the requisites for a peaceful, progressive, prosperous and inclusive Fiji. It is thus our responsibility to ask ourselves regularly if we should adhere to these values both in and outside of this august Parliament. On the same token, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for the Government’s commitment to accountability, transparency and the tenets of good governance. These are noble commitments but they must be practiced and demonstrated to mean anything to the people of this nation. The actions must match the rhetoric. I would, therefore, urge the Government to continue to respect the guidelines and procedures for the appointment to key positions in Government including leadership in governments statutory organisations and the appointment to our foreign missions. By flouting these processes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are denying career civil servants and deserving candidates the opportunity to utilise their experience and expertise to the fullest of their abilities in the process of nation building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be able to transform our civil service into an effective and efficient administrative organ, the Government will need to ensure that duly qualified individuals are recruited to key positions within the Service and the way to do that is to follow the established recruitment process. Similarly, appointments to Government Boards and Statutory Organisation must follow suit.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>20 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to register my concern at this point in how political allies of the current Government are being appointed …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame:</span></p><h4>HON. I.B.SERUIRATU.- … to represent Fiji at our foreign missions.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- This was an observation raised as an Achilles heel with past administrations where individuals with very little experience were appointed to such important positions:</span> It does not augur well for our development as a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I call on the honourable Prime Minister as Minister responsible as well for Foreign Affairs to reconsider the process of the appointment of our Heads of Overseas Missions. Having the wrong people in positions of leadership in Government agencies and in our foreign missions leads to wastage of resources, lost opportunities, a disgruntled workforce and ultimately an inefficient and chaotic work culture. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to acknowledge the Government for the Legislative and Policy Reform Agenda that they have in place, but I would suggest that they ensure that due consultations are carried out to ensure that all Government Legislative and Policy Frameworks are inclusive and have considered the views of all our communities. However, perhaps more importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need to accelerate development, and again I call on the honourable Minister for Finance to pay particular attention in areas where they are most needed. The Government is of the view that they are unable to do this due to our current debt levels, but that to me is rather clumsy. National progress is dependent on the ability of Government to take risks and invest in development and at the same time investigate ways to broaden its revenue and economic base to be able to mitigate those risks. That takes critical and innovative thinking. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, tourism has rebounded quickly following the opening up of international travel – thank you FijiFirst. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Projections are that tourist arrivals will surpass a million this year. This is welcome news for our economy. The rebound in tourist arrivals may be credited to hotel operators being able to ramp up capacity quickly, but accommodation capacity has its limits, and investments in new capacity is low. Consequently, tourism is slowly losing competitiveness as cheaper alternative destinations such as Bali and Phuket come online. An industry contributing about 40 percent of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) must be supported. In his Address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has emphasized a culture of financial responsibility for individuals and households which the honourable Prime Minister has also spoken on. The same responsibility should be expanded to managing public finances by our Government. A stronger focus on reducing waste, minimising duplication and eliminating “red tapism” for the expansion of the private enterprise is critical to fostering growth in our national economy.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 21 Speaking on promoting a culture of financial responsibility for individuals and households, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Government puts in place mechanisms to support our people and families in the management of finances received through personal remittances from families and friends overseas which had risen to a staggering $1 billion by 2022. Of course, how those funds are utilized is the choice of the recipient, but the Government has a responsibility to ensure that they are duly informed before they make those choices. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the local front, His Excellency the President correctly points to the rich natural resources we have at our disposal. The question is when and how we can utilize those resources to maximum effect so as to support sustainable growth. As an agriculturalist, Mr. Speaker, Sir, now is the time for Government to explore new ways of promoting and boosting agricultural production to support both our rural and national economies, whilst ensuring food security to local consumers. I am aware that a particular Government company is sourcing raw agricultural resources from overseas to process, promote, and distribute as local products. Our hotels continue to import agricultural products to meet their demands in terms of volume and quality. These are not matters of choice. We simply do not have the ability and capacity to supply those markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to critically look at innovative ways to address this issue and I call on the honourable Minister for Agriculture to take the lead in this regard. Export markets are critical to our economy. In efforts to meet export market demands for dalo and tavioka, in particular, the negative impacts are felt locally with the exponential rise in local market prices due to shortage of supplies. This is a trend that will continue to persist if no action is taken to address low agricultural production. I see the need for investments in capacity building and mechanisation so that we can acquire the necessary skills, capabilities and specialised needs to grow our agricultural industry. Just as important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fisheries and the Forestry Sectors ought to be developed so that economic opportunities in these areas are maximised. Sugar supported the Fijian economy from colonisation through to independence. However, the industry has relied on price support for survival more recently, but the sugar industry must be helped to transition to a financially sustainable state over the next decade. Relative to these areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government needs a vibrant Trade Policy to provide an enabling environment and details key policy objectives and strategies that positions Fiji as a trade hub within the Pacific region and recognises trade as a key driver for growth and development. The Trade Policy should aim to enhance diversification by placing emphasis on new products and markets. We should seek to gain competitive advantages through incentives and other benefits to have the edge over the other players in an open market environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful that Government saw it fit to develop a White Paper on our Foreign Policy. Our Foreign Policy must place primacy on Fiji’s interests while seeking long term mutual cooperation in our bilateral and multilateral engagements. While I am aware that Government is also conducting the National Defence Review, we are strongly proposing that in order to make sensible decisions about the defence and security capabilities, it is essential to start with a hard-headed reappraisal of our foreign policy and security objectives, and the roles we wish our country to play, as well as the risks that we face in a fast- changing world. The two must work in tandem, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>22 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fail to understand the reasoning behind the concept of Ocean of Peace being championed by our honourable Prime Minister aimed at safeguarding our waters and resources as a region. The concept would appear to overlap with existing regional commitments such as the 2018 Boe Declaration and the Blue Pacific 2050 strategy that recognises the increasingly uncertain and volatile security landscape in the region, and which has already envisioned a Pacific Region of Peace. I call on the honourable Prime Minister to clarify the difference between the concepts of the Ocean of Peace and the Pacific Region of Peace. I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the honourable Prime Minister that he place more emphasis on the more pressing issue of Climate Change rather than coining new concepts which may mean very little to us as a nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all agree that the most critical phenomena threatening peace in our region is Climate Change. The well-being of the Pacific region is threatened by the intensification of the climate crisis. As demonstrated during the review of global performance to deliver against the ambition of the Paris Agreement at COP28, efforts to reduce emissions and the consistency of political commitments with these objectives have continued to fall short of what is needed to avert major consequences for vulnerable countries. We must take action to scale up our domestic response to existing impacts while accelerating our progress to build the resilience needed to address future impacts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, peace is fundamental to human existence and welfare. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been mooted. I would beg to offer an alternative approach which can be mainstreamed into our everyday life thus creating better understanding and cohesion between our communities. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Government consider establishing a comprehensive, ongoing and well-resourced civic education system at different levels of the community to raise awareness on democracy and governance, multi-culturalism, peace building and law and order amongst other things. I would envisage the benefits emanating out of such a system as being more effective and more far reaching than those coming out of the touted Commission. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to end with these three remarks. Firstly, with all the commitments being made by the Government through His Excellency the President’s Address, the bottom line is, there is an urgent need to return our nation’s finance to a sustainable footing. That must be a priority. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our policies and programmes of Government must result in tangible positive outcomes that address the basic needs and alleviate the sufferings of the grassroots of our nation. Thirdly, the people are calling for good governance, transparency and for inclusiveness in the governance processes to eliminate dubious and corrupt practices that result in the wastage of our already scarce resources. Those are the challenges we have on our hand, and which falls squarely on the shoulders of the honourable Prime Minister as the Leader of the Coalition Government. I call on the honourable Prime Minister to show leadership and find the answers to these challenges. Everything rises and falls on leadership. May God bless our beloved Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, after thanking the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Prime Minister for his motion, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea. We will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 10.22 a.m.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 23 The Parliament resumed at 11.55 a.m. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to extend my greetings to the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, members of the public sitting in the gallery and all those tuning in live on the Parliament’s Facebook channel; ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in response to the Opening Address by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, na Turaga na Tui Macuata, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, at the 2024 Session of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would, firstly, like to thank the Almighty God for His guidance and direction for the past 14 months. To my family; my husband Aminiasi; to my children - Sanaila, Sakiusa, Alowesi, Ruth, Vasiti and Makereta; to my parents, my extended family from Cakaudrove, Bua and Kadavu; and my relatives and my friends; vei kemuni kece na kaiciqu, lavo kai, ako kai, lovara kai; vinaka vakalevu na nomuni vei’okoni vinaka. As we convene for the commencement of this new legislative session, we are not merely witnesses to a procedural formality, but stewards of our nation’s destiny. The decisions we make, the policies we craft, and the debates we are engaged in will reverberate through the corridors of history, shaping the course of our future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the State Opening of Parliament for the 2024 Session has signalled the dawn of a new era, one defined by resolute commitment to unity, democracy and progress. We are reminded about the paramount importance of representing diverse voices and upholding the principles of democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nation as richly diverse as ours, the pursuit of unity amidst diversity stands as an indispensable pillar of national progress. As His Excellency has eloquently echoed, the need of fostering harmony among Fiji’s ethnic communities and cultivating a spirit of respectful discourse and cooperation among our leaders, indeed, embracing our collective diversity not as a source of division but as a well-spring of strength which is paramount to our journey towards a more cohesive and prosperous society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bedrock of any vibrant democracy lies in representing diverse voices and upholding the principles of democratic governance. It is not enough to pay lipservice to the notion of democracy but rather, we must actively strive to ensure that every citizen of Fiji is not only heard but is also genuinely represented in this Chambers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I proudly stand in this Parliament today and having just commemorated International Women’s Day, it is my hope that I serve and inspire more women with the same ability and the same passion to serve. The local elections being brought back by the Coalition Government can very well be the pathway to more women participating in our democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the heart of our collective aspirations lies the vision of an inclusive society where every Fijian irrespective of their background or circumstance has the opportunity to thrive and contribute meaningfully to our nation’s progress. Inclusive development calls for securing social progress and resilience for all people and ensuring that it will be sustainable in the long run. I, therefore, fully support the Coalition Government’s agenda efforts on the formulation of the National Development Plan which is being</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>24 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 consulted at the grassroots level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tourism Sector stands as linchpin of our national economic vitality, serving as a beacon of opportunity and prosperity for countless Fijians. As we reflect on the remarkable growth and resilience of this pivotal industry, it is incumbent upon us to redouble our efforts to ensure its continued success and sustainability. The statistics speak volumes. In January 2024 alone, Fiji welcomed 70,324 international visitors, marking a 104 percent increase from the previous year. Such robust growth not only bolster our national GDP but also creates myriad of opportunities for employment and entrepreneurship across our islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, we expect 1 million visitors for the first time. As His Excellency noted, more visitors mean more demand for products and services and also means more revenue for our economy and more Fijians with jobs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation for their hard work and dedication for the past 14 months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, This year, the Ministry launched the National Sustainable Tourism Framework. It calls for tourism that is sustainable, resilient and inclusive. It will guide the sector in accelerating a prosperous visitor economy, ensure communities are empowered and part of that, prosperity. It calls for greater attention to our diverse cultures and safeguarding our greatest asset, which is our pristine environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know and have seen that when tourism does well, so does other sectors. Next week, we will be hosting the first of three ‘Farm to Fork’ workshops in partnership with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The initiative essentially aims to familiarise hotel key decision-makings with the produce that are available locally, including fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat and sea food, and introduce farmers to key decision-makings of the hotel and explore opportunities to enhance utilization and procurement, as well as managing expectations of chefs, food and beverages managers and procurement officers. In this way, the dalo farmer, as His Excellency had mentioned, they too can secure markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Trust of Fiji to promote more linkages to creative arts and heritage. Most recently, we have supported the installation of heritage panels around Suva City. We will continue to support such synergies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government made strong commitments in support of regionalism. I am pleased to share that in May, we will be hosting the South Pacific Tourism Exchange (SPTE), along the margins of the Pacific Tourism Organization Board of Directors Meeting. This is the first time the SPTE is being held in the Pacific, making Fiji the first in the Pacific to host the event. The SPTE was previously held only in Australia and New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, the financing of the Fiji Tourism Development Programme in Vanua Levu was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors. This is the first of three projects planned over 10 years to help deliver its vision for more sustainable, inclusive and resilient tourism in our second largest island. The first phase of the programme led by the Ministry of Tourism focuses on bolstering tourism in Vanua Levu, including Taveuni, by improving access to and climate resilience of essential</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 25 services such as drainage, sewage and transport infrastructure. This includes the Labasa and Savusavu domestic Airports, as well as an upgrade to the 95-kilometre road connecting the two towns. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Aviation, I am pleased to share a number of legislative reforms we aim to deliver this year, beginning with Fiji’s First Civil Aviation Master Plan. We will also be reviewing our National Draft Aviation Policy to ensure it meets current needs. Mr. Speaker, airport infrastructure development is equally important to support and sustain our economic development. Today, Fiji Airports manages approximately 6 million square kilometres of airspace with two international airports. Greening of Fiji Airports is one of the key strategies for 2024 and beyond. Mr. Speaker, solarisation and reduction of carbon emission activities include purchase of electronic vehicles and changing all the external lights to solar lights and setting up a 3.5 megawatts Nadi Airport Solar System as well. More initiatives are being looked at by the Sustainable Team. Digital transformation is an important strategy as we move towards contactless passenger services - the use of Artificial Intelligence and the use of Advance Aviation Technology to achieve efficiency and enhance safety security and passenger experience. Construction works at Labasa Airport terminal will commence mid-2024 at the current location of the terminal building and more land around the airport is required for future expansion for a larger passenger terminal in future. This has been identified in the Na Vualiku Tourism Development Project. Mr. Speaker, Fiji Airports will be embarking on the development of its 10 Year Strategic Plan of 2025 to 2034 in the next few months. The Plan will inform its three-year rolling Business Plan and Capex Plan aligned to its Master Plan. The future of Fiji Airports remains promising. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Nadi Airport Master Plan, Fiji Airports is in the process of acquiring a piece of land to access a new cargo facility on the North-West precinct of Nadi Airport. The Sales and Purchase Agreement has been signed. There are plans for a transit hotel, retail and commercial space, and this will be progress as part of the landslide development at the Nadi Airport. The tender is out for the Master Plan consultancy for the landslide at Nadi and Nausori. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 25 percent of our total income comes from commercial and helps fund our core airport operations and infrastructure which is quite costly. Fiji Airports has invested around $7 million in purchasing three new Airport Rescue Firefighting Trucks for Nadi International Airport. One has arrived in December 2023, and two are expected in July 2024. The works are underway for the replacement of the fire trucks in Nausori, Labasa, Savusavu and Matei, and three new Water Rescue Boats for Nadi by 2026. Mr. Speaker, Sir, five new aerobridges, costing a couple of million dollars are being procured and these will become available in 2025 because of the length of time it takes to manufacture them. Mr. Speaker, Nausori and 13 other outer island airports are owned by the Government of Fiji and managed by Fiji Airports without any funding from the Government. It costs approximately $15 million in 2023 to operate these airports. Income derived from these airports account for only 25</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>26 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 percent of the annual operating cost. This is apart from the capital expenditures spent by Fiji Airports to upgrade some of them. Mr. Speaker, as we stand on the height of a new chapter in Fiji’s history, let us reaffirm our unwavering commitment to fostering growth, enhancing connectivity and championing sustainable practices in the tourism and civil aviation sectors. Let us embrace the opportunities that lie before us with courage and conviction, mindful of the trust placed in us by the people of Fiji. Together, let us forge a path towards a brighter and more prosperous future for all. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your dedication, your service and your unwavering commitment to the ideals of democracy and progress. May we continue to work tirelessly in the service of our nation and its people. May God bless us all, may God bless Fiji. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Opposition Members and my fellow Fijians; ni sa bula re, namaste, as-salamu alaykum, and a very good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Speech of His Excellency the President has raised some very pertinent issues. And like me, other Fijians have expressed the need for many of these issues to be highlighted and voiced out in this august Chamber. Mr. Speaker, in a span for over 14 months, this dysfunctional and delusional Coalition Government has not only failed to fulfil the promises they had made before the Election. They are the very reason why this country is suffering an economic meltdown. The lack of investment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and continued brain-drain of thousands of our skilled Fijians is a sign that Fijians no longer have confidence nor the trust in this Collation Government which twisted the truth just to get into power. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. K. K. LAL.- The Coalition Government was given a very stable economy and we must give thanks to the former Prime Minister, Mr. Bainimarama, and the former Minister for Economy, Mr. Khaiyum. but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what has happened now is, we can that this Government is unable to cope with the new world challenges and the demands of the Fijian people. It is evident that they lack the practical skills needed to run an economy and a country as a government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let us face it - our people are suffering. Among other things, the high cost of living has caused many young Fijians and their parents to re-evaluate their livelihoods and their futures, especially in our rural communities, like Taveuni and Cakaudrove. The elephant in the room, so to speak, Mr. Speaker, is the mishandling and mismanagement of the economy by the honourable Minister for Finance, who is more of an academic than someone with practical experience and knowledge. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a Minister for Finance who requires committees to determine</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 27 economic policies and then give tax breaks to multinational companies, like Fiji Water, while our local companies suffer. Forget about sound economic policies when one lacks common sense. Mr. Speaker, before the 2022 Elections, there was a slogan by the National Federation Party (NFP) and I clearly remember. The slogan was, ‘time for a change’. All those NFP politicians were going on and saying, “It’s time for a change. It’s time for a change”. Boy-oh-boy, Mr. Speaker, the change people got was brutal. Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many Fijians are left wondering why they supported a political party like NFP, that did nothing to reduce the prices of goods but, in fact, added more burden to the people who have children in schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they claim to provide monetary relief with the ‘Back to School’ assistance and mind you, the truth is that that initiative was started by the FijiFirst Government. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. K. K. LAL.- But then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they take more from Fijians, like this Government’s fake promise of free education when, in fact, primary and secondary schools are now charging levies, adding more burden to parents and further straining our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that when responding to issues raised by the FijiFirst Movement, the honourable Minister for Finance starts making personal attacks and unprofessional remarks as opposed to focusing on the issues raised. They seem to have forgotten some basic economics, Sir, but let me teach them some economics today. Higher taxes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, result in an economic slowdown. The social security nets and the automatic stabilizers have not been rolled out efficiently and effectively to mitigate the impact of higher taxes. There are more potholes on our streets and lawlessness has increased.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.:</span> Sit down! MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order being raised. HON. M. S. N. KAMIMKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order 60 on relevance. The motion was to discuss the most gracious Speech by His Excellency the President. He is meandering everywhere. He is trying to follow his leader when he was in Government, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, if you want to stand on a Point of Order, I would implore you, please, quote the Standing Orders, so it will help me and the Secretariat to follow the concern raised by mentioning the Point of Order. In future. if one raises a Point of Order and does not, kind of, clearly make out the Point of Order that he/she is highlighting, then I will ask you to resume your seat for the speaker to continue. Honourable Lal, the floor is yours.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Acting Commissioner of Police cannot even manage his Police Officers who have been committing crimes. How can he be expected to efficiently manage crime prevention</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>28 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 in our communities? Yet, the picture being portrayed to the rest of us is that we are a safe country. No, we are not, Sir. I, myself, do not feel safe. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government harps about democracy, human rights, safeguarding the vulnerable such as women and children, yet they see it proper to endorse genocide being carried out by Israel on the Palestinian people, including the mass killing of innocent lives, aid workers, hospital workers and thousands of women and children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a Coalition Government which is selective in its application on policies on fundamental human rights. We have a coalition Government which lacks humanity. The NFP was once known for its unity, equality and fulfillment of promises on policies. Their founding members spoke out whenever a wrong was done and fought for the rights of everyone. The silence on the part of NFP on the issue of Fiji supporting genocide speaks volumes of how low this once a great Party has become under its current leadership. (Honourable Members interject) HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, therefore, no surprise why some of their own supporters have turned against them. The Coalition Government has become a joke to the outside world and in the international arena. We have Ministers who are tasked to protect and look after the welfare of Fijians, they are being disciplined for God knows what, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But I am sure many Fijians are reading the media articles. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have received complaints daily about the deteriorating road conditions and potholes, but it seems the honourable Minister concerned does not care and is too busy opening projects that were initiated by the FijiFirst Government in the whole of last year. In a recent issue brought to the attention of the FijiFirst’s Opposition Chambers by residents of Muaniweni, some residents complained that they had no bus service. According to the residents, the bus company said they will not operate because the road conditions are worse than ever before, thus depriving residents’ access to much needed transportation. Is this the change promised by the Coalition Government? Meanwhile, the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs has proven to be a colossal waste of taxpayers’ money. Over the past year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a glaring absence of any meaningful plans, actions, policies or direction from his office. Frankly speaking, Sir, his performance has been nothing short of pathetic. There was no need to establish such a Ministry to begin with, neither is the Ministry performing, nor its Minister. Then we have the sugar industry issues. Perhaps, if the honourable Minister spent more time in Fiji with our farmers addressing their concerns rather than overseas, then he may be making some meaningful contributions in that area too. But sadly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has also failed to perform his duties yet retains one of the most crucial portfolios which impact the lives of our hardworking farmers and their families. But to also put a spotlight on NFP again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians demand an explanation from the NFP leader as to why his Party Manifesto is not uploaded on their Party’s website. The 2022 Manifesto is a crucial document that outlines the Party’s vision, goals and promises to the people. It is essential for transparency and accountability in governance. I do not know the reason behind this omission, Sir. When can we expect to see this Manifesto made available for public scrutiny and evaluation?</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 29 Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have seen with this incompetent Coalition Government is the improper use of authority or perhaps, even bribery involved in the windmill project case. However, Sir, we do understand that an investigation is underway. We note that the Permanent Secretary Fisheries has been terminated by the Public Service Commission (PSC) but the Chief Executive Officer of the Fiji Sports Council, who had also signed has not been suspended by its line Minister. Where is the accountability? Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do understand that this agreement was also endorsed by two Cabinet Ministers, namely the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the honourable Minister for Sports. But we want to know from the honourable Prime Minister why has there not been any announcement on any investigations on those Ministers and why is it taking such a long time. If there is any investigation afoot and if persons are found culpable, then they must be terminated and must be referred to FICAC. However, there is a big question here, is someone else behind those Ministers? Something is very fishy, and God knows what, Mr. Speaker, Sir. However, on another note, I would like to raise, again, on the basis of transparency and specifically a question to the honourable Minister for Agriculture, is it alright for a Minister to use Government vessel to transport his family and father’s ashes to the Lau Group? At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as this Coalition Government gets hammered by the powerful Opposition, a question in Parliament was raised by the honourable Rinesh Sharma last year with respect to another Minister, namely the honourable Minister for Fisheries and his involvement in the issuance of licence to his own company. The question is still unanswered, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Prime Minister, is this what transparency looks like? God knows when this question will be answered. This is going to be the legacy of this Coalition Government. They have talked a big game when they were in Opposition but now it is time to walk the talk. They must continue to protect the 2013 Constitution and continue to follow this important document. We must stand for what is right and stand for justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Equally concerning is the decline in youth-focused policies by the Coalition Government. It appears that the ship of our nation is sailing without a compass, lacking a clear direction for Fiji’s youth. The lack of new initiatives and projects means a dearth of employment opportunities for our young people, further giving the challenges they face in building a prosperous future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very emotional, but I am not alone in saying this, that vast majority of Fijians do not support the Coalition Government’s support of Israel in the Palestinian-Israel war. Why is this Government more concerned about supporting Israel and genocide, and not support what is right? Where is the humanity in all these coalition partners? Regardless of our religion, I know for a fact that all of us Fijians are deeply religious people, and we remain deeply connected with each other. If we see are neighbour in trouble or in a problem, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we help out – we do not see what religion they are from or what religion they practice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, God fearing and God loving people will not support the killing of innocent people. God does not teach us to kill innocent people. If this Government supports genocide, then they lack compassion, love, and above all, they lack humanity. In conclusion, as we stand before this august Chamber, we are reminded of the weight of the</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>30 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 responsibility of the people we serve. Today, we have witnessed not only the unravelling of our economy, but also the betrayal of trust bestowed upon us by our fellow Fijians. The Government’s incompetence has led us down this path of despair, where families struggle, businesses falter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and dreams are shattered. But let us be clear, we are not here to simply point fingers or assign blame. We are here to demand accountability, to uphold the values of integrity and justice, and to fight tirelessly for the welfare of our nation and our Fijians, Sir. As representatives of the people, it is our duty to hold those in power and, especially the Coalition Government accountable, to speak the truth to authority, and to advocate fiercely for the betterment of our society. We will not falter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will not yield, and we will not rest until justice is served and the voices of the people are heard. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Lal for that very, very vicious contribution. (Laughter) Honourable Members, may I remind you that the motion was delivered by the honourable Prime Minister, based on His Excellency’s Speech and as such, please, confine your speech to those two issues - the Speech by His Excellency and the motion by the honourable Prime Minister. Now, since I have allowed honourable Lal to go on his spree of vilifying everyone that has come across him, including NFP, the issue of Israel on the Gaza, et cetera, as such, I hope you will take it on because I will now allow for responses to come from the other side of Parliament based on what I have allowed to continue from the speech by honourable Lal. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise in this august Parliament to lend my support to the motion by the honourable Prime Minister to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech during the Opening of the 2024 Parliamentary year on Monday, 4 th March, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency’s reminder about our responsibilities as elected representatives within a democratic framework is timely. It is a challenge to us all, the Members of this august Parliament, as well as all of us who call Fiji, home, that we all grasp the paramount importance of the duty assigned to us in terms of upholding the principles of democracy and humanity with unwavering determination and resolve. By embracing inclusivity and unity, we can truly fulfil the aspirations of our people and we can then begin to build a better future for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in December of last year, the Coalition Government marked its one year in office. I can admit that the initial 12 months presented significant challenges for the Coalition Government. However, under the steadfast and decisive leadership of the honourable Prime Minister and the able assistance of our honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, I am pleased to acknowledge the substantial progress we have achieved together as a nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we have slowly progressed as a nation in the past 14 months, I am deeply dismayed that some of us have sadly found it necessary to use the tactics of division and disunity, employing disinformation for political mileage. Regrettably, some elected representatives have even resorted to lies and propaganda to mislead the general public. I heard that honourable Lal, in his previous contribution, has contradicted his leader in everything that he said regarding the need to work together in building up our nation. If I were the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I would be weary of the saying, “something is rotten in the state of Denmark”. There are some talk of</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 31 instigation in his ranks so it would be best, Sir, for him to start investigation in that direction. I hope that we can all take heed of His Excellency’s most gracious advice and rise above such pettiness, to reach across the political divide in bipartisan cooperation so that we can work together in the noble cause of nation building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming into Government came with its challenges; there were a lot of expectations to deliver. However, on the back of a post COVID-19 economy and inheriting extremely high debt levels, it was an uphill battle for the Coalition Government. Whilst we acknowledge that meeting every expectation within the first year of office would not have been feasible for any government, I would like to reassure the general public, particularly those in our rural and maritime communities, of our unwavering commitment to their wellbeing. We remain resolute in our dedication to our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial for the general public to understand that the People’s Coalition Government remains diligently committed and we are, all of us, working very hard to ensure a safe, secure and prosperous Fiji for all. Despite the increase in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent on specific goods and services in the last year, we are pleased to observe a decline in the inflation rate from 5.1 percent at the end of last year to 3.6 percent in January 2024. This indicates that the rate of the increase in prices has slowed, compared to December last year. We also made sure that we kept the zero rate on 21 basic food items and added prescribed medicines to that list. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the insightful overview of our economy's trajectory and the projections shared by His Excellency the President regarding our anticipated growth rates for the upcoming years. While the road ahead may be fraught with challenges, it is incumbent upon us to adopt a nuanced approach integrates fiscal prudence with strategic investments aimed at fostering inclusive and sustainable growth. I am confident that with prudent fiscal management, strategic investments, and collective resolve, we can steer through these uncertain times and emerge stronger and more resilient as a nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the hard work and effort put in by the Ministry of Finance through the Strategic Planning Office in the formulation of Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP). The NDP will provide a visionary roadmap for an inclusive integrated effort towards nation building. I note with appreciation the multiple consultations that are currently underway to ensure that the voices of diverse stakeholders including communities, civil society organizations, private sector entities and development partners are heard and integrated into the planning process. This inclusivity fosters a sense of ownership and collective responsibility towards national development goals, promoting social cohesion and resilience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative that any government agency also re-strategises and aligns its course to the new dynamics in anticipation of the NDP that will be launched soon. It is with this regard that my Ministry is also reviewing its 10 Year Strategic Plan 2021-2031. Given our role in the rural and maritime areas, we are also mindful of the upcoming review of the iTaukei Administration, the re-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs and the various statutes that govern the modus operandi of the iTaukei communities, not forgetting other Fijian rural communities which comprise the majority of the population that my Ministry serves. Mr. Speaker, Sir, significant achievements have been reached in the last two years of implementing our Strategic Development Plan. The five Strategic Priority Areas outlined in this Plan</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>32 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 focussed on supporting our vision of sustainable and inclusive development for productive and resilient rural communities in Fiji. These broad strategic focussed areas reflect the major development priorities and needs of our rural and maritime communities. These development priorities are expected to remain with minimal revision but with the inclusion of the Coalition Government’s vision and priorities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the framing of the four core roles of the Ministry, in itself, strategically reaffirms and empowers the Ministry’s staff to live up to what the role describes them to be. The four core roles for my Ministry are: Rural Development Facilitator and Coordinator; Relationship Manager; 1. 2. 3. Knowledge Broker; and 4. Risk Reduction, Response and Recovery Coordinator. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to provide some remarks in response to climate change and disaster management. Fiji is ranked as the 12 th most hazardous country in the world by World Risk Index on the basis of high exposure to natural hazards and relatively low coping capacity. In this current cyclone season, we have been fortunate not to experience the impact of a major cyclone. However, we have observed that low depressions bring substantial rainfall leading to flooding and landslides. It is crucial to acknowledge that we are not exempt from any disaster, as the potential impact on our community and economy remains significant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, echoing the sentiments expressed by His Excellency in his most gracious Address, the Government maintains its unwavering commitment to enact robust policies that effectively address the compounding challenges arising from climate change and disasters, particularly impacting our vulnerable communities. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) underscores Fiji's significant exposure, estimating a 70 percent likelihood of experiencing impactful disasters related to natural hazards annually. Research indicates that cyclones and floods could result in average annual losses equivalent to 5.8 percent of GDP. These statistics underscore the urgency of the upcoming new Disaster Bill, earmarked to be tabled in Parliament later this year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is an important milestone for all Fijians and partners, incorporating valuable lessons from past disasters to ensure a legal framework that is adaptive and responsive to the evolving nature of such crises. This august Parliament might be interested to know that the honourable Prime Minister was also the Prime Minister at that time in 1998 when the current Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 was last passed. The proposed Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is in alignment with international best practices and standards for disaster risk reduction and management. It ensures that Fiji's approach harmonizes with global strategies. A notable demonstration of this alignment occurred during the Inaugural National Simulation Exercise conducted last year as part of our National Disaster Awareness Week (NDAW) 2023. The event brought together 13 Pacific Island Countries and key partners, fostering collaboration to strategise and test capabilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, NDAW, 2023 witnessed the NDMO testing the national and sub-national coordination mechanisms in response to varying scenarios, such as, tsunamis, earthquakes, oil spills and marine search and rescue. This inclusive and comprehensive approach, integral to the new Bill, reflects its robust, forward looking and visionary nature, positioning Fiji to effectively navigate and mitigate the effects of disasters, if and when they do happen.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 33 Mr. Speaker, Sir, with over 70 percent of our population residing within five kilometres of the coastline, the vulnerability to climate and disaster risks is undeniable. According to the Pacific Risk Profile for Fiji, from 2011 to 2020, the Government has responded to nine major cyclones, impacting 854,449 people or 95 percent of the population, and causing total damages amounting to US$771.52 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given this high level of exposure, the Government remains committed to advancing its social protection programmes. This commitment involves augmenting these programmes with coverage designed to address the impacts of climate and disaster shocks. One significant initiative in this regard is the establishment of Fiji’s Anticipatory Action Framework, the first of its kind in the Pacific. Developed in collaboration with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and other UN partners, this Framework allocates US$2.3 million of the Central Emergency Response Fund for preparedness activities. It adopts a ‘no-regret’ position in releasing funds to the affected members of the population once various triggers are met, aiming to provide timely assistance to forecasted areas prior to disaster impact. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unrelenting threats of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, especially for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), such as Fiji. We know that inhabitants of SIDS are 15 times more likely to die from climate disasters. Sir, SIDS are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events and changing rainfall patterns. These impacts can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and pose significant challenges to sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the relocation of Nabavatu Village is a clear indication of the escalating impacts of climate change on our vulnerable population. We express appreciation for the recent approval by Cabinet to proceed with the relocation of this village, and we eagerly anticipate witnessing the transition from their current tent village in which they have been living in since 2021, to their new Category-5 certified homes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project is one of the many that the Government will have to undertake in years to come. His Excellency the President has already stated that an additional 44 communities are out there to be looked into. There is no guarantee that the number will remain at that, and the chances of it increasing is high as the rate of impact of climate change bears itself on our vulnerable Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the Fijian economy, especially on Fiji’s tourism sector. We are encouraged by the news that visitor arrivals have exceeded pre- COVID-19 levels, and they continue to be strong. Given that tourism plays a pivotal role on our economy, we must collaborate with relevant stakeholders to guarantee a safe, welcoming and secure environment for our visitors to enjoy their holidays. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 44 percent of Fiji’s population reside in rural areas. While these areas may be regarded as resource rich, high poverty rates and rural urban drift persist in these areas. To help address this disparity, I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development is currently working on initiatives that will empower our rural communities and enhance their ability to turn their God-given resources to generate and accelerate wealth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in support of His Excellency’s statement about providing access to financial literacy, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime development and Disaster Management, through our</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>34 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Self-Help Programme and Rural and Outer Island Development Programme (ROI), will significantly contribute towards this effort. The Ministry provides support to income-generating projects and this year is going to engage with organisations through Public-Private Partnerships that will provide the necessary expertise for improving financial literacy in the rural and maritime areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges that changing mindsets and introducing a savings culture in rural communities cannot happen overnight. It will require good governance, commitment and passion on the part of the people, as well as effective coordination and cooperation between Government agencies, the private sector, and our religious organisations. We are encouraging and supporting the establishment of more co-operatives so that the idea of solesolevaki is maintained and enhanced. This is the strength of our rural people, and we need to maximise those strengths with more income-generating activities and nurture them to become self- reliant and move away from the dependency culture that was the common practice in the last 10 years. Whilst financial literacy is crucial, ensuring that there is market access for these small businesses is equally important. Our Ministry is doing its best through our existing programmes to ensure that the supply and value chain for any type of business supported is monitored closely to ensure market access and maximum benefits for our clients. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has already been engaging with local, regional, and international partners to provide support in this area. Apart from engaging with Government agencies, we are also exploring opportunities available with regional organisations. Our engagement with the People’s Republic of Korea for piloting of Saemaul Undong and Saemaul Geumgo initiatives are examples of initiatives that the Ministry is implementing as tools for economic empowerment and growth. The Saemaul Geumgo is a development initiative that will promote the financial cooperative concept among our rural and maritime communities. Under the programme, our rural and maritime dwellers will be trained on financial literacy, savings culture, community leadership, and income generation projects. Promoting financial literacy not only enhances individual wellbeing, but also fosters economic resilience, and contributes to sustainable development in communities and societies, especially in our rural and maritime areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Saemaul Geumgo initiative or a modified version of it, using our own solesolevaki principles, will be piloted in rural communities and later on, embedded into the existing ROI programme due to its successful contribution towards rural development in South Korea and in other developing countries of the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the decision of the Coalition Government to institute a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This initiative is not only timely but also essential as we endeavour to advance collectively as a nation. It is my firm belief that to move forward together, we must first address and reconcile the wounds of the past. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry was once a stronghold of the Fiji economy. The initiatives planned to revitalise this vital industry are indeed promising. The targeted increase in cane production to 1.8 million tonnes for the upcoming season demonstrates a proactive approach to enhancing productivity and securing the industry's sustainability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s ROI programme is also targeted at assisting subsistence farmers in our rural and maritime communities who have the potential to contribute to economic</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 35 growth. This is the first year of implementation and we are committed to not only support but enhance productivity through the provision of machinery and equipment, as well as facilitating discussions for market access. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s programme of Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF) is an enabler for ease of access to transportation and markets. In addition to this, the Ministry is also administering the Seafaring Entrepreneurship Assistance Programme to provide subsidies for purchasing boats and engines that are used for transportation, as well as for fishing businesses. The Ministry also contributes to addressing health issues through its Rural High-Risk Water and Sanitation Programme. This is a programme that enables access to clean and safe drinking water and better sanitation facilities for rural and maritime communities. Recently, there has been assistance provided to schools through the construction of Ecological Purification Systems (EPS) for access to clean drinking water and the construction of ablution blocks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am delighted to be part of a government that is people-focused on uplifting living standards and, at the same time, working with the people to transform the way they think and empower them to be resilient and productive. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our outreach, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management has consistently and constantly challenged our rural dwelling citizens to co-operate with members of our staff in preparing their Community Development Plans and Disaster Management Plans for their communities, whether it be villages or settlements, and organising themselves to address challenges when they arise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we embark on another parliamentary year, I urge my colleagues in this august Parliament to reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental purpose of our roles which is to serve, rather than to be served. We must remain firm in our dedication to listening to the concerns of our people and using our platform to address their plights effectively. With that, Sir, I commend and fully support His Excellency’s most gracious Speech. HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of Opposition and Members of Parliament; a big bula vinaka and greetings to those who are watching from the comfort of their homes and to all Fijians tuning in from anywhere around the world. Mr. Speaker, please, allow me to greet out iTaukei viewers who are tuning in today. Ni sa bula vinaka.

Mr. Speaker, I promise to be very brief. I am honoured and grateful to be given the privilege to reply or express my thoughts and opinion on His Excellency’s Address while opening the Parliament Session for this year.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>36 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Mr. Speaker, while going through His Excellency’s Speech, I ensured that I look into it not as a politician or a Member of Parliament, but I challenge myself on how I can look at it like an ordinary Fijian sitting at home. A farmer may be asking; how relevant is this to me? A fisherman may ask; how will this benefit my family? A carpenter will want to know whether the changes and initiatives will influence their weekly salary or how are we going to bring about positivity, confidence and growth to the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, at the outset, my response today is based on this statement, “When the people are well looked after, the country will prosper, and the nation will grow stronger”. Mr. Speaker, no matter how may forums, summits, meetings and consultations we do, if we continue to neglect the people and turn a blind eye to their voice and needs, there will be no progress, there will be no economic prosperity, there will be no growth and development. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. A. BIA.- A reminder to the Government of the day, “You are there because the people entrusted their hopes and aspirations of a better family, better community and better Fiji to you”. Mr. Speaker, as policymakers, we need to ensure that the people of this country should always come first because they are the very reason we are represented here as Members of Parliament. We are not here because of certain businesses and businesspeople. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. A. BIA.- We are not here because of some companies or Non-Government Organisations (NGOs). We are here for the very people whose votes gave us the power to become Ministers and Members of Parliament. To the Coalition Government, you need to stop the ‘blame game’ and habitually imputing the past practices of the previous Government as a reason to get away from the expectations of the people. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. A. BIA.- Stay true to your purpose and never deviate from the vision of the great leaders that have gone before us. You need to be bounded by the unity and faith of the people of Fiji, irrespective of their gender, race or ethnicity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes we hear words on the streets saying, “We need to accept that some of the promises made during the election campaign will not be fulfilled because this is a Coalition Government.” HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. A. BIA.- Let me be frank with the Coalition Government, stop focusing on the issues within your Coalition partners, stop fighting for survival within the Coalition Government, but fight for the survival of ordinary Fijians who are living from paycheck to paycheck and hoping for a better Fiji. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 37 HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time to call for a stop of just using people for our very own political gain. For too long, some of us politicians are only seen during election campaign, visiting people and going out hearing the voice of the people, but when we are in power, we tend to totally forget the people who voted for us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we visited their doorsteps in trying to win their votes but when they come into your various office space, they are told to make appointments and at times, they are given the biggest run around of their life. Some have found it easier to talk to God than even trying to meet the Ministers in person. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, some Fijians even ran out of credit after having their phone calls being transferred about five to six times, just to converse with the Ministers. HON. K. K. LAL.- Yes, very poor! HON. A. BIA.- Some people thought they are emailing the guardians of the galaxies because it takes months for Ministers to even respond to their email. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to be at the forefront of serving the people, irrespective of their class in the society. Try and avoid using the pipeline system to process issues and concerns of the people. As Ministers, you need to go out more locally, not internationally. You need to hear the heartbeat on the ground, engage ordinary Fijians in talanoa session and see the reality of what the people are facing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are elected to defend the interests of the people of Fiji at all costs. If it takes us to do some sacrifice in our decision-making, do it because of the people and there should be no two ways about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I have observed in the last Parliament sitting, we have spent a lot of time in ‘political talk’ and less ‘people talk’. We are wasting our time trying to talk about the previous administration, we are too fond of trying to find fault about each other. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the danger of this when we are too focused on each other, we will forget the people we serve and what is required of us to carry out our roles and responsibilities. We need to honour our promise and words spoken during the election campaign, the people of Fiji are observing and listening, watching every move we make. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji need to have the assurance that they are not given false hope but are guaranteed that their interest is well served with the current Government. It is important that we remind ourselves not to expect perfection but be committed towards progress and improvement. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. A. BIA.- To this august Parliament, let us stand together, shoulder to shoulder, with every citizen of this beloved country, no matter what they are, we will need to fight corruption at every turn. We should always stand for the very best and quality delivery for all Fijians, caring for all citizens and move our country forward with dignity and honor. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude with the saying, “If not now, then when? If not us, then</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>38 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 who?” May God bless Fiji. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker. Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistance Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and all online and television viewers - bula vinaka and good morning to you all. I am privileged to reflect on the insightful themes presented in the inaugural Address of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, Turaga Bale Na Tui Macuata, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere during the Opening Session of Parliament for 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the key messages articulated by His Excellency covering education, tourism and civil aviation. I echo the sentiments expressed by His Excellency the President, indeed, education will continue to be a priority. The Coalition Government has not changed its stance since we came into power to ensure that no child is left behind in our planning and policies in place at the Ministry of Education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know that TELS debt amounting to a total of $650 million, owed by some 53,725 students was written-off in 2023. These are 53,725 families across this nation. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Under the new Fijian Scholarship Scheme with a total budget of $148.2 million has catered to 8,720 new students and continues for the 9,148 existing students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, no country in the Pacific today provides scholarship for its people like Fiji through the Coalition Government. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> No country, no country, only Fiji with the Coalition Government.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No debt to the student:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the repair job is huge.

GAVOKA.- ... and the Government Quarters were in a sorry state:</span></p><p>For the information of Parliament, under the $200 Back to School support for 2024, a total of $42.5 million has benefitted 212,740 students from Early Childhood Education (ECE) to Year 13. Did I hear them saying that FijiFirst did that too? HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- No! (Laughter) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the successful Fiji National Education Summit, which I opened on 19 th September, 2023 had established a strategic direction which will transform our education system, thus building and supporting resilient Fijians. With a new direction, the Ministry must revamp its vision and mission statements along with its guiding principles, values and</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 39 responsibilities. For the information of the august Parliament, the last Summit was the Suva Declaration in 2005 and it after 18 years then another Education Summit has been staged. The outcome of the Fijian Education Summit is the 10 years Denarau Declaration which entails its implementation phase and is taken into consideration its alignment to SDG4 and the National Development Plan. The Denarau Declaration launched on 10 th November, 2023, focussed on seven major thematic areas: First, the Curriculum &amp; Sustainable Development which endeavour for learners at all levels of education to access high quality relevant programmes with inclusive examinations and assessment practices and processes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
