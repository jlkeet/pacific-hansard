<body><h3>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-</h3><h4>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-</h4><p>Secondly, the Quality Assurance and Assessment Systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this one, the previous government removed scaling, effectively making our children severely disadvantaged in comparison to other children globally. The Ministry of Education is effectively working to reverse the decision with the re-introduction of scaling of examinations.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- You have destroyed the Ministry:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- The third area is enhancing the Teaching Profession and Leadership:</span> Our Ministry intends to strengthen an inspired, empowered and productive teaching workforce. Our Coalition Government with the intention to motivate and retain staff in the civil service, through the Ministry of Civil Service Circular 2/2024 and Circular 5/2024 mandated all Government Ministries that the retention measures through regularisation of acting appointments, allowing step movements, filling of re-evaluated positions and utilising of alternate pool be effected. Our Ministry’s regularisation processes began and successfully concluded the exercise. We have currently confirmed that 1,420 out of the 1,958 officers that have been on acting positions both in the teaching and non-teaching administrative posts. Some of these officers have been acting for two years up to 20 years from the Vice Principal and below.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N.

V. R. GAVOKA.- Last week during a seminar at Pacific Harbour, a few women leaders walked up to my Permanent Secretary and conveyed their acknowledgement to the Ministry and stated this is what they said to us: “We were about to resign and leave for overseas, but because of the regularisation process, we stayed back.” There were several other messages received by our staff on the same issue. The Ministry will re-introduce Teacher Competency Framework and discussions have begun with our stakeholders. Teacher qualifications of Secondary Teacher Training Certificate (STTC) and International Diploma in Tertiary Teaching (IDTT) are now regularised as of 7 th February, 2024. The arbitrary non-</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>40 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 recognition of the STTC and IDTT by the previous government in 2021 severely disadvantaged our teachers in many ways. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to strengthening Early Childhood Education (ECE) and Inclusive Education to ensure that every young child sent to ECE or kindergarten has access to an equitable, safe and healthy learning environment. We have planned and are beginning to roll out a restructure that will have dedicated Senior Officers position at the Director level for Special Inclusive Education (SIE) and ECE. Additionally, in the recent Coalition Government’s decision in 2024 on the roll out of regularisation and step up, this enabled our Ministry to step up the salary of 739 ECE teachers. Fourthly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Education, Financing and Effective Governance is another priority area which includes the review and development of policies, regulations and resource allocation while working collaboratively with all internal and external stakeholders including our education partners. Fifthly, is the Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Non-formal and Lifelong Learning. Resurrecting the Unit is crucial as we need to meet the shortage in skills in the current labour market including Tourism. The Ministry is working closely with the Higher Education Institutes to offer relevant TVET courses while we try to resolve the legal matters pertaining to the failed technical colleges under the FijiFirst Government. In 2023, 32 vocational centres were operational, for 2024 we have scoped and will re-open 13 more vocational centres. It is our intention that every province will have a vocational centre. The Bose Levu Vakaturaga stressed the importance of having skilled young people; skills-set that is contextualised according to their community needs. For example, in the Nadroga/Navosa Provincial School that was converted to a technical college but has been idle with state of art vocational equipment will re-open soon as we work with the Nadroga/Navosa Provincial Council on this issue. We will offer vocational subjects focused on hospitality, carpentry and joinery and even automotive engineering offering viable alternatives for employment and entrepreneurship for our people on the Coral Coast. Scoping has also begun for Lomawai Secondary School, this is an example of what is happening in one province. In addition, under the New Scholarship and Grants Scheme, 1,800 grant awards has been allocated for micro-qualification in construction, automotive and tourism and 400 grant awards for apprenticeship incentive scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also prioritising Digital Learning and Transformation, Information Technology and cyber safety. Internet connectivity and accessibility to digital resources is important for all the children in Fiji. The Ministry will need the support of communication providers and relevant stakeholders for connectivity and digitalisation of our remote and maritime scopes. The initiative by the Coalition Government and partnership with Starlink will see the pilot of Starlink in 15 schools for 2024. Development of content for the digital platform needs the partnership of genuine education partners to ensure that all schools access e-learning. The final seventh thematic area is strengthening of the Education Policy, Planning, Research and Data. Evidence-based research and data is needed for the Ministry to make informed decisions in consultation with the policies and legislations in place. This essential unit was also dismantled in the last 15 years, so there was a lack of planning and directions for the biggest Ministry in government. The absence of the unit impacted planning, monitoring and evaluation of educational activities. Just this past weekend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry had our First Senior Management Staff Planning Workshop to finalise our Costed Operational Plans (COP) for the fiscal year, and Staff</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 41 we had not done since 2016.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Lying:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Denarau Declaration which governed the new direction for the Education Ministry will only be fully implemented when the Education Act, relevant laws, policies and programmes are reviewed. The Minister for Education has already started working in consultation with the Office of the Attorney-General. I have asked the honourable Attorney- General to delve into this in his address later this week. Collaboration with the Office of the Attorney- General is critical. The legislation must be current, applicable and futuristic. If we are to be relevant in the evolving global education landscape incognisance of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reassure this august Parliament that a talented and very competent team at the Ministry of Education ably led by the Permanent Secretary with the passion for education have been working diligently to ensure the old newly developed policies adhere to the required processes and procedures. An example is the appointment of the new Education Commission and part of their task is to renew the current National Curriculum Framework (NCF). Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rome was not built in a day, so it is crucial for the Ministry to get the right bricks, to lay the foundation of the Denarau Declaration framework for the future of the education system for our beloved Fiji. Tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share a significant impact of tourism and civil aviation on Fiji’s economy. Fiji’s economic growth continues on the back of a strong tourism sector, the key driver. In 2023, Fiji’s pandemic economic recovery was marked by an estimated growth of 8.2 percent. This growth is expected to continue, bringing our economy above 2019 levels of GDP by the end of 2024. Last year, we broke records and welcomed 929,740 visitors up by 46.1 percent compared to 2022 and by 4 percent compared to pre-pandemic arrivals in 2019. Markets such as Australia, New Zealand, United States of America and Canada have exceeded past years. Tourism earnings reached $1.7 billion cumulatively in September 2023 surpassing the corresponding 2019 level by 9.5 percent. In January 2024, visitor arrivals exceeded previous records for the same month with a record of 70,324 visitors. As shared by His Excellency, for the first time in Fijian history, we expect to welcome one million visitors in 2024; that would be a first for us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our connectivity with the rest of the world is not only being restored but also enhanced through our national airline. The 2024 capacity outlook is expected to grow between 8 percent and 10 percent compared to 2023. Fiji Airways has also considerably invested in its fleet, with the addition of two new A350 aircrafts in 2023. Fiji Airways newest destination is the Nadi to Noumea route with two weekly services. Fiji Airways currently operates in 24 destinations including 10 regional and 14 international destinations with discussions underway to expand more routes. The focus now is to increase code sharing through marketing arrangements with other airlines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is undertaking initial discussions for a Civil Aviation Master Plan for Fiji, intended to be rolled out this calendar year. This could be the first Civil Aviation Master Plan established for Fiji. Additionally, Fiji has an Aviation Policy which is outdated and will now be reviewed in line with imminent changes in the aviation industry. To meet the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) resolution relating environmental protection, we are working in collaboration with Fiji Airways, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, Fiji Airports Limited on reviewing</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>42 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Fiji’s State Action Plan on Carbon Dioxide Emissions. This State Action Plan to ICAO elaborates on the activities Fiji is undertaking to address CO2 emissions from international aviation and to enable ICAO to measure Fiji’s progress towards meeting the global goals. Our advocacy for sustainable aviation practices was underscored by my chairmanship of the Third Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels in Dubai, culminating in a landmark commitment to reduce carbon emissions in international aviation by 5 percent by 2030 towards net zero by 2050. Fiji’s efforts to reaffirm the acceptance of Fiji’s bid to host the office of the ICAO for the Pacific Small Island Developing States and the subsequent signing of the host State Agreement in May 2023 will solidify our role in regional aviation governance. The office will be established in Nadi with ICAO Pacific Island Small Island Developing States officer taking up residence in Nadi in October 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of tourism investments leads, we are looking at 42 projects valued at $3 billion. This will bring in 4,824 rooms. There are about 1,627 rooms in the construction stage and a few hundred within the next few years. There are nine tourism project developments planned for 2024, three in 2025 and four in 2026. We are working with big brands such as One &amp; Only Resorts and seeing local investors such as Punja’s Group, expand into the sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the medium-term growth outlook is expected to return to the pre-pandemic trend and average around 3 percent. The loss of labour could negatively impact productivity, while constraints in hotel capacity and high prices could weigh in the growth of tourism in the near future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as shared by his Excellency and the honourable Assistant Minster for Foreign Affairs and Civil Aviation, we will soon be launching the National Sustainable Tourism Framework (NSTF) 2024-2034. The Framework lays out a clear policy direction, consisting of a high-level framework accompanied by an initial three-year Action Plan (2024-2027). One of its priorities is to create a competitive destination with diverse experiences. This includes actions such as prioritizing infrastructure and connectivity to less visited tourism regions. We will also focus on expanding products and experience, training, mentoring support for start-ups, business development training, peer-to-peer mentoring and advisory services. Target niche and experiential growth segments such as luxury, health, wellness and medical tourism; Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE); sports, tourism, educational tourism, film productions and experiential and immersive tourism. Essentially, our focus is not only on diversifying the economy but also on diversifying the tourism sector itself to be able to sustain ourselves. Our new brand platform, “Where Happiness Comes Naturally” and the associated global launch campaign have continued to resonate and perform strongly. Fiji’s media placements continue to drive impact with our recent billboards in New York’s Times Square. I am also pleased to share that Tourism Fiji’s social media following is now over one million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last year we have elevated the Fijian brand by hosting major events. 1. 2. 3. First Spartan Fiji - brought a total of 25 countries with over 3,370 attendees, contributing FJ$6 million to the economy and FJ$2.6 million in media value. First National Rugby League - sanctioned rugby league match delivered a $6.15 million boost to Fiji’s economy. The World Surf League Fiji Pro will return after three years.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 43 In the spirit of inclusive dialogue, last year we hosted the Fiji Tourism Convention and envisaged this as an annual event. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tourism and civil aviation sectors play a pivotal role in Fiji’s economy. The Government is committed to fostering growth, enhancing connectivity and ensuring sustainable practices in these sectors. The President’s Address has provided us with a roadmap for building a more prosperous, inclusive and sustainable future for Fiji and its people. For us in Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation, we heed his call to action and work together across political divides and national boundaries to realise this vision for our nation and for the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may the God Almighty bless our beloved nation. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch. When we resume, the honourable Deputy Speaker will be presiding over the sitting. We adjourn for lunch. The Parliament adjourned at 12.17 p.m.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>44 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 1.56 p.m. DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, we will continue from where we left off. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and fellow honourable Members of Parliament, ni sa bula sia. It is an honour to deliver my response to His Excellency’s most gracious Speech in the Opening of this Session of Parliament. It was His Excellency’s last Address to Parliament as his first term in office would come to an end in October this year. It was, indeed, a privilege to have voted His Excellency in 2021 as the FijiFirst nominee for President. His Excellency as Head of State, a figure above politics, in a very difficult position had to respect the democratic will of the people and be sworn by the Coalition Government. Madam Deputy Speaker, I totally agreed with His Excellency. As democratically elected representatives, we need to listen to the voices of our people and not only those who have voted us. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency made the same call in opening the 2023 Session where he stated that the views of all members of our communities must be heard and the Coalition Government must ensure that draft laws are deliberated in consultation with relevant stakeholders, particularly through the Standing Committee process. His Excellency used the mandatory ‘must’ and not ‘may’. Madam Deputy Speaker, apart from the Appropriation Bill tabled in July 2023 with 14 Consequential Bills, the Coalition Government in 2023 introduced an additional 15 Bills in Parliament and only one Bill was referred to the Standing Committee for public consultation. This statistic shows that His Excellency’s reminder was not followed. Madam Deputy Speaker, when Bills are not referred to the Standing Committee, it means that we are denying the people’s rights to participate in the law-making process. Madam Deputy Speaker, if the honourable Prime Minister had not directed the honourable Attorney-General to withdraw the Heritage Bill 2023 which was moved under the Standing Order 51, the statistics would have shown that no Bills was ever referred to the Standing Committee in the last session of Parliament. The honourable Speaker had acknowledged the swift moved by the honourable Prime Minister, given it would facilitate bipartisanship. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency in Opening the Parliament Session last year outlined that the principled iTaukei statutes will be reviewed. This was to include the iTaukei Affairs Act, iTaukei Lands Act, iTaukei Land Trust Act, iTaukei Trust Fund Act and the iTaukei Development Fund Act. From the five mentioned Acts, only the iTaukei Land Trust Act and the iTaukei Affairs Act made it to Parliament and the rest did not. The other 25 iTaukei related laws that was a core message of the Coalition Government when they were in Opposition are still nowhere to be seen. The iTaukei Affairs Bill came through Standing Order 51 in November 2023 with a new amendment that removed the GCC’s veto to appoint five of the eight iTaukei Trust Fund Board members. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the last Parliamentary session, the Coalition Government did not introduce any new Bill to establish a new industry or create a new area to enable investment. For example, the FijiFirst Government in 2021-2022 introduced new Bills such as the Bill for an Act to</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 45 provide for the development of informal settlements in Fiji and other related matters; the Investment Bill; Climate Change Bill; the Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants Bill; and the Industrial Hemp Bill, to name a few. In 2021, the FijiFirst Government initiated the drafting of the Childcare and Protection Bill and the Child Justice Bill which is now undergoing executive consultations. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Traditional Knowledge and Cultural Expression Bill which is currently going through executive consultation will complement the Heritage Bill 2023 which is still before the Committee and was initiated by the FijiFirst Government in 2017. The Committee has had roundtable discussions with the consultation team led by the Permanent Secretary for iTaukei Affairs and its consultant, Mr. Tuiloma, so that both Bills can be improved specifically to identify any overlaps and gaps. Madam Deputy Speaker, repeated calls have been made by the people that Bills be translated into the vernacular and disseminated widely through CSOs, Provincial Offices, District Advisories for them to understand and prepare a submission before the Standing Committee comes around to conduct its public consultation. Translation of the Bills should be prioritised by the Solicitor- General’s Office and the line Ministries will administer the Bill in collaboration with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs before the Bill passages to Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, I humbly request the honourable Attorney-General to strengthen the work relationship between the Office of the Solicitor-General’s drafting department and the Standing Committee. This has been a challenging area, given the Standing Committee’s communication to the Solicitor-General’s Office are not actioned on time. In addition, when a Bill is moved in Parliament, like in other jurisdiction, the Terms of Reference (TOR) and the full report of the executive consultation is referred to the Committee. This makes it easier for the Committee to do its oversight. This was the practice during FijiFirst Government, and it provided a clear guideline to assist the Committee in formulating its workplan. Madam Deputy Speaker, when a Standing Committee scrutinises a Bill, it will need the cooperation of the drafters and consultants so that it reports back to Parliament in a comprehensive form of a Bill while it maintains its original intent per the TOR. This process is very important because it prevents any law from being subject to amendments time and again. Madam Deputy Speaker, there is also a need for a parliamentary drafter to be based in Parliament, not only to assist Standing Committees on Bills, but also to assist in drafting private Members’ Bills, as provided by the Standing Orders. Madam Deputy Speaker, the FijiFirst Government, in a session of Parliament, passes an average of 40 to 50 Bills. The Coalition Government, as I have mentioned earlier, have not introduced a new Bill so far but only repeals and make amendments to existing laws. In its first year in office, the Coalition Government only brought in 15 Bills, apart from the Budget Bills and all the other 15 Bills that were originally part of the FijiFirst legislative programme. In this Parliamentary session, the Coalition Government, as outlined by His Excellency’s Speech, intends to review only 11 existing legislations, including the Traditional Knowledge and Cultural Expression Bill and the other Bill that was alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister this morning - the Banaban Settlement Act that will also be reviewed, so there would be a total of 12 legislations to be reviewed.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>46 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the Opposition stands ready to assist the Coalition Government to identify laws that need improvement, given the arising needs, and share ideas so that new Bills enabling the expansion of our economy can be enacted and through it, allowing every Fijian to fulfil their dreams and aspirations. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency shared his experience as a youth in Macuata, spent with Indo-Fijian families during sugarcane harvesting season. The honourable Speaker would be very familiar with this experience having served at the then Native Land Trust Board (NLTB) in the Western and Northern Divisions. Most of the iTaukei in the Western and Northern Divisions speak fluent Hindi and even the Indo-Fijian community do speak the local dialect. Madam Deputy Speaker, our two major ethnic communities in Fiji have always lived together in harmony. As national leaders, we must set the tone so that many of our political followers can spread the same message. Unfortunately, most of us sitting on this side of Parliament and also our supporters face direct and racial discriminatory attacks online - keyboard warriors constantly labelling FijiFirst as an Indo-Fijian Party or anti-iTaukei. Madam Deputy Speaker, the reformers post-2006 coup reviewed the iTaukei institution under the process of the People’s Charter so that the iTaukei Affairs Board, iTaukei Land Trust Board and the iTaukei Trust Fund Board play the role of the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) in formulating policies that were for the good governance of the iTaukei people. Many saw these changes, not done with the prior and informed consent of the indigenous community as anti- iTaukei. Madam Deputy Speaker, in fact, if FijiFirst was anti- iTaukei, then the time the Coalition Government came into power in December 2022, all the investments of the iTaukei Trust Fund would not be there anymore. The FijiFirst Government expanded the iTaukei Trust Fund investment portfolio, and many benefitted in terms of leadership training at Nadave, indigenous studies, publication of traditional writings, et cetera. This has enabled the iTaukei Trust Fund to explore heritage tourism, partnering with UNDP under the Business Ready Support Scheme and most importantly, funds that were invested by FijiFirst for the iTaukei people has now been used to host the GCC meetings. Madam Deputy Speaker, FijiFirst in 2015, rolled out the iTaukei Land Development Grant. In 2017, it established the Seed Fund for iTaukei landowners to provide an opportunity for them to participate in any income generating projects of their choice. Now, the Coalition Government has established a Wealth Fund from the10 percent of iTLTB’s annual earnings to allow landowning units to buy properties and start business ventures. The FijiFirst Government introduced the equal lease distribution policy. Now, the Coalition Government has reintroduced the percentage distribution of Turaga iTaukei, Turaga ni Yavusa and Turaga ni Mataqali. The landowning unit members still get their same share basis and the minor’s fund for children to withdraw at the age of 18 which was introduced by the FijiFirst Government is continued by the Coalition Government. Madam Deputy Speaker, every time a Bill is introduced in Parliament to amend or repeal an Act that was enacted by the FijiFirst Government, the Coalition Members, like small children celebrating a revenge, make sweeping statements such as, “this is due to the mismanagement of the previous Government or “these draconian laws by the previous Government” or “today is the day of freedom”, et cetera. Madam Deputy Speaker, these types of statements has fuelled communal differences within</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 47 our society. Labelling FijiFirst as anti- iTaukei and making us look like criminals does not assist in trying to establish walking across the aisle. Madam Deputy Speaker, the incoming Chief Executive Officer of Fiji Revenue and Customs Service works in New Zealand and could be accorded an expatriate rate if he takes office. On the one hand, honourable Ministers of the Coalition Government are encouraging top jobs to be given to locals but on the very opposite, other honourable Ministers are bringing in people from overseas. There needs to be consistency. Madam Deputy Speaker, we must give credit where the Coalition Government has implemented policies that are for the betterment of all Fijians, something that the FijiFirst Government had prioritised during its term. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the last session of Parliament, the Coalition Government focused a lot on FijiFirst’s shortcomings during its term in Government and not the good developments done by FijiFirst that it can further improve and serve the people better. Madam Deputy Speaker, no Government is perfect and for the last 14 months, the Coalition Government has made its own shares of mistakes and blunders. Ministers are under investigation, like we see in today’s paper where the Attorney-General is under the spotlight. We heard about the chartered flight to Israel. Many complaints we read online where Ministers are promising Boards and even intentions to replace the honourable Prime Minister by one of the Deputy Prime Ministers. The SODELPA General Secretary makes a press conference while another Party member goes against it. Some have gone publicly to say that their Party is unfair. This kind of party politics prevents Government from serving the people better and slows progress. Madam Deputy Speaker, the slow response in service delivery has been one of the people’s growing concern. Other hot issues are the cost of living, food prices, unemployment, lack of development, road problems, water and power breakdowns, poverty, drugs and crime rates, to name a few. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coalition Government should not only talk about the achievements that they have achieved so far but also improve on what they can do better. The Coalition Government needs to develop policies that will allow our various communities to integrate, and I would also like to thank the honourable Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management for bringing in the Financial Literacy model from China and also the one that the honourable Prime Minister talked about this morning, the model from India. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is encouraging to hear that our domestic economy will surely return to the pre-pandemic level. It shows that the post-pandemic economic recovery plan initiated by FijiFirst Government in 2021 is bearing fruits. The Coalition Government needs to focus on new capital development, given the current 2023-2024 Budget had no capital expenditure but only continuing the projects under the FijiFirst Government. Many have been commissioned and opened by the Coalition Government and what we want to see is that people have access to these facilities whether it is a road, a bridge, hospital or water projects. Let us put people first. Madam Deputy Speaker, despite our debt which is around $9.9 billion due to the pandemic, what was more encouraging is that Fiji, in 2022, became one of the fastest growing economies in the world and this was due to the FijiFirst Government’s economy recovery plan. The Opposition stands ready to assist Government on ideas to grow the economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Province of Macuata is so thankful that the relocation of the</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>48 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 people of Nabavatu in Dreketi to their new village site in Nadoiviri will commence this year. The FijiFirst Government had begun the initial talks of securing the new village site and now the Coalition Government will complete the full relocation process. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- The relocation will be funded by $5.9 million from the Climate Change Relocation Trust Fund. The FijiFirst Government, in 2018, had set up this Trust Fund to support the relocation in Fiji through the Climate Relocation of Communities Trust Fund Act 2019 and the Climate Change Act 2021. Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji Airways plays a key role in the increase of tourist arrival to Fiji and today, we are reaping the rewards of the FijiFirst Government’s decisive leadership during the pandemic when it supported the loan guarantee for our national airlines, despite many Opposition Members objecting to it at that time. This is the type of issues where His Excellency has asked us to rise above petty politics and be patriotic. Madam Deputy Speaker, on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the mechanics of it must be very clear as it will be dealing with many complex cases filled with high emotions. The Civic Education Awareness programme that was alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in his speech this morning, is very vital. The South African TRC model had a very simple set of procedures where victims would tell their stories of atrocities that they have not spoken about for years, then the perpetrators are given a chance to own up to their crime and by doing so, are eligible for amnesty. All they must do is to tell the truth and do not even need to say sorry, no apologies, no remorse, no justice and no prosecution. Madam Deputy Speaker, to move this through the Coalition Government with the assistance of its development partners need to bring forward a Bill like the South Africa’s Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 1995, to establish the TRC, its objectives, roles, functions and powers that will guide the process and at the same time, consider the interests of the victims and the perpetrators. Madam Deputy Speaker, many of the iTaukei landowners who have made their land available for sugarcane leases want an increase in CBUL rates. That was an initiative of the Bainimarama Government in 2008 and the review of the land rentals which still sits at 6 percent of UCV. Landowners in Macuata, honourable Minister for Sugar, are still waiting for the CBUL payment that was due in December 2023. The last payment was made in June 2023 and the FijFirst Government used to pay it out in every six months basis. (Hon. C. J. Singh interjects) HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- That is according to the mataqali members in Macuata. You better do that. If not, they will not vote for you again. (Laughter) Madam Deputy Speaker, it will be challenging for the GCC to be politically neutral, but it should now play a more meaningful role in making recommendations for the welfare, economic empowerment and good governance of iTaukei people. It must conduct wider consultations to all Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) members and get their free and informed consent before deciding on any questions relating to the iTaukei. The Coalition Government must ensure that the GCC does not threaten the State’s role as protector of public interest.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 49 Madam Deputy Speaker, people in the rural areas want speedy responses to their applications and requests in terms of Government programmes. The Coalition Government must ensure that civil servants at divisional and district level as enablers to the implementation of these programmes are very efficient and effective. Decisions on applications should be assessed in a timely manner and communicated to applicants conveniently. Most of our people in rural areas get frustrated due to poor services provided. We need to improve these areas and the Turaga ni Koro and Advisory Councillors to be used to make communities aware of the various assistance available – where to get the application forms, the progress of each application in various areas, et cetera. I urge the Coalition Government to pay out the Turaga ni Koro, Nasi ni Koro and Mata ni Tikina allowance on time as they have been complaining recently on the delays. Madam Deputy Speaker, we thank the Coalition Government for continuing the campaign on the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years initiative that was started in 2019 by the FijiFirst Government. I agree that our Foreign Policy should maintain that we are friends to all and enemies to none, and it is important that we always promote peaceful solutions. This has been a subject of debate, criticism and emotions boarding on our religious beliefs in terms of Fiji’s stance in the International Court of Justice. The Israeli and Palestine situation can only be resolved through a two State solution and premised in the Oslo Accord of 1993. While both need their self-determination as a Sovereign State, a progressive withdrawal of Israel in the areas occupied by the Palestinians should be based on negotiations and mutual trust so that both States are protected and co-exist. Madam Deputy Speaker, I totally agree with His Excellency that as Parliamentarians, we need to work across the aisle more often. To conclude, Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency rightly reminded us by saying, and I quote from His Address on Page 10 of the Uncorrected Daily Hansard on Monday, 4 th March, 2024: “Let us not see challenges as mountains but common missions to ascend and resolve with open and constructive dialogue, with a view to rebuild social cohesion.” To achieve that, we must move forward, and we cannot be stuck to the past. The Coalition Government has identified few areas that it will prioritise in this Parliamentary year, and it needs to focus on it and given that most of it are continuous programmes from the FijiFirst policies, then more sharing of ideas can happen across the floor. On the new programmes and policies, the experience from both sides of Parliament can be harnessed to constructively put together ideas that will progress every Fijian. I will end by the words of the late Nelson Mandela who said, and I quote: “I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered that the secret after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal the view that surrounds me, to look back at the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk to freedom has not ended.” Madam Deputy Speaker, what worries me a lot is the inabilities of leaders to understand that</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>50 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 no one person has the answers to everything. We must move away from the idea that only “me” can do it because it is not true. To the Coalition Government, it is only four years. Run your leg well as FijiFirst has passed the baton to you after successfully running the last lap. We are team Fiji, and you will pass the baton to the next team Fiji runner. To the Coalition Government, team Fiji can only win if we play as a team. Team Fiji needs to establish a legacy for our future generations. We are the custodians of their hopes and aspirations. It is our finest hour! HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentleman; a very good afternoon to you all. I rise today with humility and gratitude to deliver my response in this august Parliament to the esteemed Address delivered by His Excellency the President in my capacity as the Assistant Minister of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. Firstly, I extend my sincere appreciation to His Excellency the President for his insightful remarks and unwavering commitment to the prosperity and wellbeing of our beloved nation. Madam Deputy Speaker, I echo the sentiments expressed regarding the importance of inclusive governance and the need to listen to the voices of all our citizens. Indeed, it is our solemn duty as elected representatives to uphold the principles of democracy and humanity enshrined in our Constitution, and to work tirelessly to ensure the integrity and dignity of our Parliament. His Excellency the President’s emphasis on promoting harmony and embracing diversity resonates deeply with me. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is incumbent upon us as leaders to foster an environment of mutual respect and understanding, transcending our differences for the collective good of our people. I wholeheartedly pledge to continue advocating for unity and inclusivity in all facets of our governance. I will try to refrain from being adversarial, but I wish to make a comment in reply to honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Aliki Bia’s statements. They made wayward statements and generalisations. The Coalition Government has done so much to start fixing the mess with debts of the last 15 years. We cannot do miracle in one year. By attacking the Government, they are exposing their own hypocrisy and the failure of the FijiFirst Government. Fiji has been saved with a change of government. Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend the Government’s progressive agenda outlined by His Excellency the President, particularly the ongoing formulation of the new NDP. The NDP serves as a blueprint or a roadmap for our nation’s growth and development, guiding our collective efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It is imperative that we prioritise inclusive and sustainable development ensuring that no one is left behind as we strive towards a more prosperous and sustainable future. As we embark on the task of formulating a new 3-year, 5-year and 20-year NDP, I am reminded of the critical importance of this endeavour in shaping the future trajectory of our country. The Government is fully committed to ensuring the successful completion and implementation of the new NDP. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of past policies and initiatives, engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders and segments of the society across all sectors, and aim to incorporate valuable feedback from our citizens through nationwide public consultations. I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made in the formulation of the new NDP.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 51 At the onset of the formulation of the NDP, a total of 275 consultations have been planned by the Ministry, starting from 14 th February till 21 st March, 2024 teams from the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will be travelling around the country across the four Divisions - Central, Western, Northern and Eastern, to gather views and feedback on the development priorities, policies and strategies for the NDP. As of last week, Madam Deputy Speaker, the teams have completed a total of 250 consultation meetings. We have consulted a total of more than 11,150 people during this period, of which, around 39.1 percent are women and 32.5 percent are youths. Madam Deputy Speaker, we can see the lengths the Ministry of Finance has gone to consult as many people as possible and receive valuable inputs for the formulation of a robust NDP. The people who our team had consulted were very grateful for the Government to hear their pleas, and these people have gambled their hopes to have their needs addressed. The new NDP will be a dynamic and forward-looking document, tailored to address the evolving challenges and opportunities facing our nation, a plan that is the People’s Plan. It will set out a clear vision and strategic objectives for the next three years, five years and 20 years, with a focus on promoting sustainable development. Madam Deputy Speaker, based on the consultations we have had so far, key priorities identified through our consultations include the need to modernise our legislative framework, strengthen public sector service delivery and address critical issues such as infrastructure development, health care, education, police, water and drainage, roads, social and climate resilience. Madam Deputy Speaker, it has been identified that in the next three years, we the Government need to continue to get our basic rights which will greatly resolve many of the issues that our Fiji citizens are currently facing. Basics, Madam Deputy Speaker, such as continue to fix the drainage issues, ensuring consistent supply of clean water, providing good health care facilities, improving law enforcement through resourcing the Police and enhancing access to education. Additionally, there is a strong emphasis on promoting private sector-led growth, enhancing skills development, fostering youth empowerment to drive economic diversification and innovation. We have also taken proactive measures to ensure gender mainstreaming and inclusivity in our policy formulation process, recognising the importance of empowering women and marginalised groups in our society. Madam Deputy Speaker, the new NDP is envisioned to be completed by June this year. Madam Deputy Speaker, at the heart of the NDP lies its alignment with Fiji’s international commitments, notably the UN Sustainable Development Goals. By seamlessly integrating SDGs into our national development agenda, we reaffirm our unwavering resolve to address global imperatives inequality, environmental sustainability while championing sustainable such as poverty, development and inclusive growth. Madam Deputy Speaker, while the new NDP will align with SDGs, Fiji is linked to the international commitments, necessitating the need to achieve our SDG targets. The Second Report of the 2023 Voluntary National Review (VNR) openly presents Fiji’s progress and need to address data gaps in achieving the SDGs. Fiji views the 2030 Agenda, Madam Deputy Speaker, not merely as a global commitment, but as intrinsic to our own development goals. The SDGs have become the cornerstone of our national development planning, guiding our efforts to build a resilient and sustainable future for all. Fiji’s significance stride towards achieving the SDGs is commendable, however, more needs to be done.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>52 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, 128 indicators have sufficient data, however Fiji risks missing 75 percent of the 97 targets that we could measure. Urgent action is required to accelerate progress and strengthen global partnerships are essential to secure greater financial assistance, capacity building, technology transfer and system enhancement across all 17 SDGs. Madam Deputy Speaker, with the most disciplined ambitious of fiscal policies, it was challenging for us as a developing country to meet all the SDG targets, in particular, the data and definitional gaps. I am happy to announce that the assistance of multilaterals in this regard especially the UNESCAP is valuable, and they are happy to continue to assist us about the data and the gaps. This is by no means a criticism of the SDGs themselves, in reflecting holistically with the benefit of the 20/20 vision, we can now embrace the new lens and ambition that we have evolved to adopt, when realising that a more prosperous and sustainable developed large ocean state like ours is within reach. Madam Deputy Speaker, let us acknowledge the resilience of the Fijian economy amidst unprecedented global challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing geopolitical tensions and the escalating impacts of climate change. Despite these adversities, Fiji has grown remarkable resilience and determination to emerge stronger. Our economy is poised for a broad-based growth of around 3.8 percent and 3 percent for 2024 and 2025 respectively. It is crucial to acknowledge that we are not immune to the economic headwinds facing the global economy. Our economy, Madam Deputy Speaker, like many others has felt the impact of the pandemic, disrupting trade, tourism and investment flows. Additionally, as a climate-vulnerable nation, Fiji faces heightened risks from extreme weather events, rising sea levels and environmental degradation, further complicating our economic outlook. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the central pillars of our economic strategy is fiscal sustainability. We recognise the importance of maintaining sound fiscal discipline to ensure the long- term stability and prosperity of our nation. Prudent fiscal management is essential to instil confidence among investors, maintain macroeconomic stability and safeguard the wellbeing of our citizens. However, achieving fiscal sustainability requires a delicate balancing act. Madam Deputy Speaker, on one hand, we must address the urgent needs of our people, invest in critical infrastructure and provide essential services. On the other hand, we must exercise restraint and discipline to prevent excessive borrowing and accumulation of debt that could jeopardize our fiscal stability in the long run. The Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that debt levels remain sustainable and manageable. We have implemented measures to improve debt management practices, enhance transparency and strengthen oversight mechanisms to prevent debt distress. Additionally, we are actively exploring opportunities for debt restructuring and other innovative financing mechanisms to ease the burden on our economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, while fiscal sustainability remains paramount, we must also prioritise economic growth and climate resilience. These objectives are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary. Sustainable economic growth is essential to create jobs, reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for all Fijians. At the same time, we must integrate climate resilience into our development agenda to protect our people, infrastructure and natural resources from the escalating impacts of climate change.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 53 Madam Deputy Speaker, the path ahead of us is fraught with challenges but it is also brimming with opportunities. I am confident together we will all overcome these challenges and build a brighter, more prosperous future for all. Early this year, Cabinet had approved the Growth Re-set Initiative Package which is a new phase of economic reforms to be undertaken by the Government. The Growth Re-Set Initiative builds on the work that has already begun through national consultations through the National Economic Summit, Fiscal Review Committee and the Budget development processes. It is focussed on a first phase of economic and regulatory reforms which are relatively easy to achieve by combining knowledgeable public and private sector skills and experience. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government must be seen to be taking the decisive step to encourage new economic growth measures and should take advantage of being new and changed, and also modernising our law and policy on essential topics including foreign property ownership, investment restrictions, short term and long- term immigration, energy generation, environment and planning laws is very essential to increase private sector participation in our economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Growth Re-set Initiative is jointly managed and implemented by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, SMEs and Communications and I update this august Parliament that progress has been made so far in achieving the objectives under the initiative. At this stage, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the three sub-committees for meeting regularly and trying to look at ways to improve the current processes and areas for efficiency: 1. Sub-Committee on Immigration and Investment Law and Processes Reform; 2. Sub-Committee to Review Electricity Sector; and 3. Sub-Committee on Lands, Environment and Planning Law and Process Reforms. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you are aware that the Coalition Government has re-established the Strategic Planning Office which is ensuring better coordination and formulation of a strategic and a robust development agenda. The Office will be further resourced in the next financial year to deliver its core outputs especially strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of capital projects and key government initiatives and ensuring value for money. The Cabinet has endorsed the use of guidelines and user manual for the preparation, appraisal and approval of projects under the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP). This will assist in future decision making on projects to be done taking into consideration value for money and better returns. Madam Deputy Speaker, a major change from the current practice of appraising new projects, which the guidelines introduce, is a two-stage process. One is the Early-stage Preparation (Stage One) which involves initial identification, research and discussion for the preparation by budget entities of a relatively simple screening note to be evaluated by the Ministry to determine if a detailed appraisal study (Stage Two) is warranted. I reiterate the Coalition Government’s steadfast commitment to crafting a comprehensive and inclusive National Development Plan that engenders enduring national unity, fosters a shared vision and propels socio-economic advancement across our beloved Fiji. Through the NDP, the Government will aim to address multiple facets of our citizens plea. Together, let us redouble our efforts in building a more prosperous, resilient, and sustainable future for all.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>54 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen – a very good afternoon. Madam Deputy Speaker, International Women’s Day was celebrated on Friday 8 th March. Women are pillars of strength in our society. We should always love and respect them. Women embody strength, courage, fearlessness and above all resilience. Happy belated International Women’s Day to all women including women Members in Parliament. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to comment on some of the key features of the statement made by His Excellency the President of Fiji at the opening of the new session of Parliament on Monday, 4 th March. His Excellency the President had briefly touched on the focus and future development direction that the Government will embark on or continue to pursue in this Parliamentary session. Unfortunately, Madam Deputy Speaker, the state of affairs under this Government for approximately the last 15 months has been abysmal. The future also looks bleak. The Government has been simply plodding along with no direction. The only direction they seem to have in common is the Nadi Airport Departure Lounge. (Laughter) No cohesive set of policies, no cohesion amongst the Ministers. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Each pulling in different directions:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- I feel sorry for the honourable Prime Minister because it would appear that his individual Cabinet Ministers are each doing their own thing:</span> Of course, the former Prime Minister Bainimarama did not have that problem. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President mentioned that we need to focus on development and be people centric. As was confirmed to us at the Budgetary briefing by the Ministry of Finance’s staff at the Opposition office and as the budget books speak for themselves, not a single cent has been allocated in the budget delivered by the honourable Minister of Finance and supported by the honourable Prime Minister on any new projects.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.:</span> We are a developing country, we need development, we need new projects and we need new infrastructure. Please do not tell us that there are billions of dollars of private sector funds lined up for immediate investment. Most of these supposed new developments simply have attractive artistic impressions on paper only. We cannot simply rely on private sector investment. We also need public sector investment to provide more modern day infrastructure which the FijiFirst Government had started. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 55 HON. H. CHAND.- My colleagues from the largest single party on this side of Parliament will talk about these in more detail. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who wrote your speech?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- I wrote it:</span></p><p>Honourable Prasad, please do not use debt as an excuse. In fact, debt under you has increased without any single new project or a pandemic.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- You lack understanding and know-how to run a modern day economy:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear! HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, please let me give a simple example on how the non-allocation of funds or even an ongoing maintenance is impacting ordinary Fijians. The general public including students from Viseisei Back Road, Saweni, Vuda Back Road, Dreketi, Vuda Point, Vaivai, Saru, Navula, Wairabetia and other parts of Fiji have raised serious concerns regarding bus services to their areas and pathetic road conditions. Madam Deputy Speaker, two elderly citizens aged 80 and 81years reside at Viseisei Back Road, and they are both sickly. They have to hire a taxi at least twice a week to go to Lautoka City or to the Health Centre and they pay $30 per trip. They spend $60 a week on taxi fare, and this is because there has been no bus service in the area since last year. Sometimes these old men are dropped off 500 metres away from their homes because the Government road is in a pathetic condition. Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not blame the taxi drivers but the lovo pit potholes and the Government. This was brought to the attention of the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport. Well now in the 1980s mode, renamed public works, unfortunately the public works has not benefitted from the honourable Minister for Public Works because this matter has not been addressed by him since it was brought to his attention last year. His Excellency the President spoke about commitment to accountability, transparency and good governance practices in all public sector entities including Public Enterprises. I agree with His Excellency the President, but I do not believe the message had been received well by the Coalition Government. Madam Deputy Speaker, since day one, this Government has been assaulting ssection 123 of the Constitution, which sets out how transparency is created and must be adhered to in the Civil Service. It states in section 123(i), and I quote: “Recruitment and promotion based on - (i) (ii) objectivity, impartiality and fair competition; and ability, education, experience and other characteristics of merit.” This Section of the Constitution, like a number of others, appear to be simply on display by this Government.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>56 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the lack of adherence to the supreme law and, therefore, undermining the rule of law has meant lack of transparency which, in turn, has also meant that service levels to the members of the public have dropped. People are holding positions when they should not be and for this very reason, many have and are leaving the Civil Service and, indeed, many Fijians have even left our country. Madam Deputy Speaker, as an example, the honourable Acting Minister for Education’s recent announcement to regularise all acting positions, is not just a misguided move, but exposes his and the Permanent Secretary’s complete disregard for the supreme law of the land,... HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. H. CHAND.- … the Constitution, in particular Sections 127(8)(b) and, of course, Section 123, and equality provisions under Section 126. Madam Deputy Speaker, this regularisation has been carried out in an ad hoc manner by the Ministry of Education. The violation of the supreme law of the land has meant, as expected, that the Ministry of Education has created more uncertainty in an already unstable environment. A number of deserving teachers who were acting in the leadership positions and who applied for transfer for good reasons in 2022 and in the beginning of 2023, have missed out during this regularisation because they do not meet one criterion and, that is, they must have acted in the position for the last six months. Madam Deputy Speaker, this morning, I heard from the honourable Minister for Education that some teachers have been acting for the last 20 years. That is a lie, and I think he had miscalculated it. Despite the Ministry of Education’s guidelines having no provision for regularisation, they still went ahead with the irregular regularisation process, with no transparency but all subjective, meaning, it becomes a free for all. Anyone with the right connection will get what they want, and many deserving teachers will lose out. This is what happens when the rule of law is not adhered to. Chaos, corruption and unchecked power will reign. Madam Deputy Speaker, many deserving teachers are so disturbed and disheartened because posts have been confirmed without providing opportunities to those with the right qualification and experience on merit. As a result, teachers have lost confidence in the system, are frustrated and even more are planning to seek opportunities overseas. They are being welcomed, in particular, in Australia and New Zealand where these Fijian teachers can work in an environment where rules and the processes are actually transparent; with the values of fairness and equality and where selection, appointment, promotion and even regularisation are not determined by your ethnicity, province, religion or whom you know. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President in his Address, mentioned that education will continue to be a priority. We, on this side of Parliament, fully endorse that education should be topmost priority. Madam Deputy Speaker, education, and more importantly, access to education is the cornerstone of individual and societal development. It plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of individuals and societies, and it assists those individuals and societies to thrive in an ever-evolving world.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 57 Madam Deputy Speaker, if education is a priority, why did the Ministry of Education not give priority to teacher transfer and appointment of teachers before the beginning of the 2024 school year? It is the teacher that makes the difference, not the physical classroom. Madam Deputy Speaker, students were in classrooms without teachers for weeks and in some cases even months. HON. K. K. LAL.- Very poor! HON. H. CHAND.- The Ministry of Education created that chaotic situation for not only the teachers but also for the students, for the parents and guardians, and for the schools. Madam Deputy Speaker, because of the Ministry’s gross negligence, students lost many days and weeks of learning. Has the change in Ministers had an impact on the output of the Ministry? What are the highly paid advisors, mainly political mates who have no idea on how to run a modern education system and who were actually appointed without transparency doing? Madam Deputy Speaker, what are the plans to recover the lost teaching hours?. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- No plan! HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, we also sit in amazement to hear not a peep out of the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, supposedly the great father of teacher union representation. His silence is deafening. Madam Deputy Speaker, by the way, honourable Minister for Education, the Fiji Teachers Union have clarified that there has been no agreement on the irregular regularisation process contrary to your claim that there was collaboration and partnerships with teachers’ unions. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. H. CHAND.- Who is telling the truth? Maybe, honourable Minister, you spoke with only one teacher union and thought that that was enough. The word ‘consultations’ has a hollow meaning under this Government. Madam Deputy Speaker, talking about transparency and accountability in Government and public enterprises. We still do not know how a private owned company - Poly Tech, is suddenly getting government grants. Suddenly, vocational courses that were offered by FNU, which is another debacle, is being offered and preferred by Government to be Poly Tech, the institutional choice. Madam Deputy Speaker, Poly Tech is not Monfort Boys Town or Corpus Christi or Sangam or USP or University of Fiji or even FNU because these organisations that I have just mentioned are not private companies. I do not know if there is a joining of the dots here. What was also interesting, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that for the catering at the unnecessary fanfare last year, the advertisement for expressions of interest went out on Friday, 5 th May, 2023 and closed on Sunday, 7 th May, 2023, just two days. Again, this, I believe, is most certainly not the transparency that His Excellency was talking about. Madam Deputy Speaker, how fair and transparent and merit based were the recent appointments of town and city council Special Administrators? Special Administrators who have</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>58 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 been appointed are mostly failed candidates and supporters of National Federation Party (NFP), People’s Alliance Party (PAP) and SODELPA. Similarly, Madam Deputy Speaker, Advisory Councillors have also been appointed in this manner. Many who were very efficient and very effective, had experience and were service oriented to all, were removed to make room for the political lackeys of mainly NFP. Where is effective governance?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Very poor! Nepotism.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Shame on you! HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, municipal councils, state-owned enterprises, public enterprises, advisory councillor bodies and statutory bodies are not there to give jobs to politicians and supporters of those politicians. Madam Deputy Speaker, these entities have a particular purpose, and they are there to provide a service to public or generate sustained profits. If these organisations are operated effectively, efficiently, with professionalism by those selected on merit and have no bias in dealings and process, then it will give confidence to ordinary Fijians. Madam Deputy Speaker, it will give confidence to business houses and investors, both local and foreign. However, the opposite is happening because the end game by this Government is to treat all State apparatus as means of looking after themselves and their political supporters. (Chorus of interjections) HON. H. CHAND.- That is the end game for them. Whether organisations do well, or they do not do well is secondary to them. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji who may be listening to this broadcast through Walesi or livestreaming on radio today, may I begin by acknowledging Na Turaga na Tui Suva, the ancestral owner of the land on which the people’s Parliament stands and the generations past, present and future. Vinaka saka vakalevu na veimaroroi. I also stand in unison with the honourable Prime Minister in congratulating the Drua Team, the Coach and Management, for its victory on last Saturday. All I can say is that the next 15s World Cup cannot come sweet enough. It is with a deep sense of honour, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I rise today in support of the motion of the honourable Prime Minister to thank His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, Ratu Kiniviliame Maivalili Katonivere, Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata, Taukei Bolatagane, for his most gracious Speech. After one year, two months and 17 days or 444 days since committing to serve our beloved country with all its challenges and learnings, Madam Deputy Speaker, I remain very committed to serving my country to the best of my ability. In doing so, I shall first endeavor, Madam Deputy Speaker, to provide some insights into parts of His Excellency’s most Gracious Speech before providing a stock-take of what the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has done and plans to do in 2024-2025.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 59 Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall when I made my Maiden Speech last year, I prayed for the wisdom of King Solomon. His Excellency’s Speech exudes the same wisdom. His Excellency asked us: 1. To listen to the voices of all the people of Fiji; 2. Respect the dignity and integrity of Parliament; 3. Guard against unscrupulous politicians sowing divisions and mistrust amongst us for their own political ends; and 4. Work across the aisles to find common ground on critical issues facing our nation and to put our people first. From the People’s Coalition's perspective, Madam Deputy Speaker, we could not agree more. The People’s Coalition Government, from the get-go, committed to several key actions with an assurance to the people of Fiji that we would involve them and, of course, listen to their views. There has been the fiscal Review Committee, the Economic Summit and the Education Summit. This approach of listening to the people works well and will continue into the future. We cannot say the same for the other side. We ratified on a bipartisan basis the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Pillar 2 Supply Chain. The honourable Prime Minister invited the honourable Leader of the Opposition to COP28 and honourable Koya attended a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka in November last year. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- So! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am also happy to note that the National Taskforce on Pornography was approved in Cabinet and will be approached on a bipartisan basis.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> I am coming to that also, honourable Premila Kumar.</p><p>The signs are positive, and I am sure that we will do more of the same together, heeding the call of His Excellency. Madam Deputy Speaker, on His Excellency’s plea for us to guard against unscrupulous politicians who wish to sow divisions in our beloved nation, the honourable Prime Minister has graciously commented that we may be well forgiven for thinking that it may be him but we know it is not him. I say this, Madam Deputy Speaker, with the best of intentions. If there is anyone of us in this Parliament that is sowing seeds of division, my humble message to you is this, you have no place in this august Parliament, nor in the new Fiji. When we look at His Excellency’s most gracious Speech in totality, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is really talking about rebuilding Fiji from infrastructure, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, speeding up the green transition, updating legislation, et cetera. The question is, why? It is very easy. It is because of the mismanagement of the last 16 years on the other side of Parliament. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have an unsustainable debt issue. We have a massive drug problem in our country. We have a broken-down health system in our country…</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>60 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.-… an education system which requires work, et cetera. But I will honour the exhortation of His Excellency, Madam Deputy Speaker, and say this. We have a major task ahead of us and we can only solve it if we work together starting from this august Parliament. In the pursuit of progress and prosperity, let us be guided by the principles of justice, equality and compassion. Let us continue to rebuild Fiji together where every individual has the opportunity to prosper and progress. Allow me, Madam Deputy Speaker, to share in this august Parliament some of the work achieved and plans by the Ministry I am honoured to lead and plan to do, as we navigate the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead. In terms of global outlook, His Excellency correctly points out the return of the nation’s economic activity to pre-pandemic levels with an anticipated growth of 3.8 percent in 2024 and 3 percent in 2025 which is positive. This is against the continued global risks, like the Ukraine War and the escalating tensions in Gaza, which will remain challenges. At present, debt to GDP stands at 75.6 percent and as we all agree, is still unsustainable. To this end, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry which I am honoured to lead will do its utmost to try and achieve a higher GDP growth of, at least, 5 percent, hopefully, working together with all the agencies of Government, the private sector and civil society - another concept that the other side does not understand. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Our Ministry believes that this can be achieved by pushing for an investor friendly environment, drive opportunities for investment and trade growth and push for total digitisation of the Fijian economy. Some of the areas where our focus will be to: • • • • • continue to strive for an investment friendly environment, especially ease of doing business, collaborating with the private sector; continue to drive closer and stronger, broader trade and investment ties with all our partners; continue to drive for genuine economic diversification; continued focus on regional hubbing agenda; and continued focus on ICT or communications in Fiji. I wish to touch on the investor friendly environment and the ease of doing business. Some of us may recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, that when we got into office, a major investor in Fiji had its FJ$30million project at Nadi Airport on hold for some inexplicable reason. This investor has spent at least $800 million, Madam Deputy Speaker, in Fiji over the years and sends as least $30 million in foreign exchange every year. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, to have a key investor treated in such a cavalier manner was not acceptable and was a major concern for investors around Fiji at that time. Together with the honourable Gavoka and the honourable Prime Minister, we immediately</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 61 allowed the investment to proceed which sent a very clear message to both local and foreign investors that the People’s Government was keen to drive investment. Since then, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have not stopped with the change in Investment Fiji’s mandate from being a regulated to facilitator of domestic and foreign investment, we are making good progress in terms of driving investment in Fiji. The current investment pipeline stands at $3 billion and growing. There is a mood to invest in the country from renewable energy, commercial agriculture, tourism and expansion of existing operations such as Fiji Water recently. We have created an Investment Facilitation Committee which is an inter-agency committee which looks at investment bottlenecks and tries to fix them. If they do not move, the Minister gets involved. We have a taskforce to aid with the setup of commercial agriculture and we hope to make some positive announcements soon. The automation of business processes relating to starting a business and the building permit approval is underway. This pilot phase aims to automate 25 processes over 16 agencies. Whilst automation of these processes are underway as alluded to by the honourable Assistant Minister, there is another exercise to look at business processes in other key agencies such as immigration, environment and land called the “growth reset” before automation. We have assistance from the private sector on this initiative, again something that the other side never did. Together with these continuous reforms, the Ministry is also getting ready for the World Bank successor to the Doing Business Report, “ Be Ready” as it is called which is on the horizon with data collection expected to start at the beginning of this year. Madam Deputy Speaker, for investment growth, we are also looking at Policy Frameworks such as one which will guide significant investment and also a policy framework for diaspora investment. This is being considered to promote and attract strategic investments into Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government does hear the frustration of the business community and I can guarantee you, we are taking action. In terms of the broader trade investment relations, to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, we do have a pretty good trade policy which we inherited from yourselves, it would be tweaked but it is quite good. Fiji’s strategic decision to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), a 14-member economic club representing 40 percent of the global GDP underlines our readiness to play a proactive role in shaping regional, trade and economic architecture. As the only Pacific country to join this initiative, Fiji has actively engaged in negotiations across all four Pillars on cooperation, trade, supply chain resilience, clean economy and fair economy. We intend, Madam Deputy Speaker, to bring two further Pillars of the Agreement through this august Parliament on a bipartisan basis namely, Pillar 3 on Clean Economy and Pillar 4 on Fair Economy. The entry of Google can be seen as part of the IPEF early harvest, Madam Deputy Speaker, and there are plans Trades Pacific Investment Missions to Singapore and United States of America on the back of this economic club. We also plan to relook at Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER Plus) but I have to emphasise with full consultation with the private sector. The Interim Economic Partnership Agreement ratification subject to Cabinet approval will be brought forward this year which will provide better access for Fiji exports into the European Union. Our trade missions have been active, Madam Deputy Speaker. In 2023, our Trade Commission based in Australia facilitated over $70 million in exports to these markets and an increase of 15 percent over the previous year adding at least 8.5 percent to the value of Fiji’s overall</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>62 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 exports to Australia and New Zealand. This year, the Trade Commission aims to facilitate further exports by at least 20 percent. The Trade Commission also contributed to key events such as Spartan Fiji; an adventure tourism race (the first major post-pandemic event) which will continue in 2025. Last year, we also completed a Trade and Investment Mission to New Zealand and hosted a business forum in Australia. This, we will see reverse missions into Fiji this year which will stimulate more opportunities for investment and trade. The Trade Mission of North America has had a remarkable year starting with the inauguration the new office in San Francisco Bay, North America. It also played a crucial role in the transformative Google Submarine Cable project, as well as the diverse landing station and data centre investments that will occur over the coming year. Some of our major commercial agriculture ventures are arising from USA. We are planning a Fiji-North America Business Mission this year aiming to potentially visit four states in America and Canada fostering investment and trade opportunities. Madam Deputy Speaker, there are 100,000 diaspora in Canada. The Trade Commission in North America has also been instrumental in supporting Fiji’s exports and conducting market research for key exports to North America. Notably, it facilitated the purchase of over 50 metric tonnes of mature ginger by the ginger people, a much-needed market for farmers who had been over promised and their crop was not bought last year. For China, we have secured some potential investors at least round about US$45 million covering noni commercial farming and forestry apart from other areas of investment. In terms of economic diversification, Madam Deputy Speaker, the development of the Medicinal Cannabis Industry as well as a broader nutraceutical economy including the potential billion-dollar kava industry is a key focus of the current Government. With advent of Google and second subsea cable, this should drive an expanded ICT industry. There is a massive opportunity to create very good paying jobs through the ICT industry. In terms of the BPO industry, which is a key sector, it has undergone very good growth in 2023. We believe it can rival tourism and have been supporting this industry to-date. Moves to reinvigorate the mahogany industry is supported by the Ministry. This as well, is a multi-billion dollar industry. Finally, I am also looking at SMEs as a major sector in terms of economic diversification. It is already 18 percent of GDP. The Ministry is very committed to develop and harness SME growth. We just had our first MSME Conference last week that was organised by Business Assistance Fiji and it gave us policy makers another opportunity to hear directly from the MSMEs and take stock of what needs to be done. Our bid to improve access to capital for businesses, the Ministry is working with the Reserve Bank of Fiji and the Asian Development Bank on an Access to Capital Bill which will be presented later this year. This will narrow the financing gap and unlock more investments into the private sector. Madam Deputy Speaker, in parallel with this, working with UNESCAP, we are developing an MSME Strategic Plan that will pave a roadmap to grow the MSMEs. We cannot talk about MSMEs without talking about the co-operative business through the solesolevaki concept, it is a very positive way of developing business particularly amongst the iTaukei community. Last year, we conducted over 200 awareness meetings, registered 77 new co-operatives and provided training to</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 63 over 800 Fijians with a notable 85 percent increase in co-operative registration compared to the same period last year. Critically as the economy diversifies, there is a need for strong standards and will continue to be a priority. Standards in the various sectors of climate change mitigation, construction, food safety and energy management not only will enhance trade opportunities but also ensure that safety, quality and reliability of goods and services. The Department of National Trade, Measurement and Standards will play a key role. In terms of regional hubbing, Fiji’s status as a regional hub continues to grow. It has developed hubbing capacity in shipping and aviation, medical support and education. From an ICT perspective, again the Google Cable initiatives will bring about a major shift in terms of a regional hub for Fiji from an ICT perspective. Finally, in terms of harnessing ICT in Fiji, Madam Deputy Speaker, we believe that digitisation remains an essential driver to social economic development in our country. The Government’s focus is unwavering to provide an enabling, conducive and secure ICT environment for private sector-led growth and to empower our people through financial inclusion and essential digital services. Alongside Google, the licensing of Starlink will provide options for our people. We are also actively collaborating with the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji to penetrate the final 5 percent to 10 percent of our isolated communities. Finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of its Global Risk Reports of 2024, it is stated that cyber security is a significant risk. The People’s Government is committed to putting in the necessary policy, legislative and regulatory framework to ensure a safe and secure cyberspace exist for our people. Likewise, the development of the Anti-Scam Taskforce has come forward as a result of recent scamming and cybercriminal activities. In closing, Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge us all to rebuild Fiji together. We owe it to our children and to their children. May God bless Fiji, may God bless His Excellency the President, may God bless the honourable Prime Minister and fellow Members of Parliament and may God bless the people of Fiji. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minster, honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise this afternoon to contribute in response to His Excellency the President’s speech for the Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament. Greetings and a very good afternoon to each and everyone present here today, at home and to those listening via other mediums. Before I start my speech proper, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to remind honourable Kamikamica that we have been selected by the people of this nation and we are the single largest party representing this country. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the security of a nation is the most solemn responsibility of any Government and the first priority of every Prime Minister and the same sentiment has been shared by His Excellency the President on Monday, 4 th March, 2023. Madam Deputy Speaker, crime rate has risen remarkably high within the 14 months of the Coalition being in power and the behaviour of our Police security is questionable. Why I said that the Police security is questionable is because under the leadership of the Acting Police Commissioner and with tight security, methamphetamine was stolen. If this can happen in Police stations, then what can one expect from the honourable Minister for Home Affairs? Our citizens have little or no faith in the security system of our country and I am requesting the Government to take some precautionary measures so that their livelihood is protected at all times.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>64 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President said, and I quote: “At the same time, encourage a culture of saving which will allow the development of a sustainable investment plan for their families long term security so we can all prosper together.” Madam Deputy Speaker, how can it be possible for the iTaukei Land Trust Board to advertise public consultation on State freehold land to be converted into iTaukei land? Is the honourable Minister for Lands aware of it? What will be the consequences? Madam Deputy Speaker, the Crown grant is transferred subject to provision of the Crown Grant Act upon thorough investigation of the need of a particular State land to members of the mataqali. It is done when there is scarcity of land to the members of the mataqali and not for the sake of some politicians own political gain which seems to be the main reason behind public consultations. The advertised consultation in the newspaper show the calibre of people who are involved in this exercise. Does the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs know what is happening under his nose? (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I am coming to it:</span></p><p>Madam Deputy Speaker, what will happen to the existing sugarcane farmers who have settled on this land, and I know of a few in the Western Division and Vanua Levu. I can assure the honourable Prime Minister that the conversion will have a long-term negative impact to our economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have cane cultivation in Volivoli, Rakiraki where it is almost around 5,158 acres of State land where majority of Fijians are cultivating sugarcane on this land. In Drasa, Vitogo has 2,296 acres of flat land under sugarcane and producing a good tonnage of cane. We have other cane cultivation areas such as Vatumani with 744 acres, Tovatova has 213 acres and another 6,935 acres, Koro No. 2 has 1,247 acres, Varoko has 103 acres, Vadravadra has 844 acres and for the honourable Minister for Sugar in Rara, Wailevu in Vanua Levu is 1,291 acres and Mosara has 413 acres beside other land listed for consultation. Madam Deputy Speaker, what will happen to the honourable Minister for Sugar who is harping about increase of cane production? How will he now face the farmers who are leasing on State land? The lessees will be insecure and will reduce planting of cane and production will decline which will affect our sugar industry. Similarly, the same happened with the non-renewal of native lease in the past. Madam Deputy Speaker, farmers are living peacefully in their leased land from the State but if this transfer of Crown grant takes places after consultations, it will take away the current lessees’ livelihood who have been staying since the CSR Colonial days, built houses and have carried out massive developments to the land. Most of them are aging farmers and will not be able to develop the new allocated lots given to them. Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, what about compensation to improvements such as buildings, fence, roads, et cetera? Who will compensate the farmers in the scenario if the mataqali members want to cultivate the entire portion of land? We will be discouraging investment, and the conversion will take our country back in terms of growth. The financial institutes will be reluctant to even mortgage these leasehold land due to uncertainty of its terms and conditions. Honourable Prasad and honourable Kamikamica know that presently there is no big investment taking place in our country except the casino, if approved and if I am not wrong, honourable Kamikamica, due to uncertainty with the Coalition partners.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 65 (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. S. KIRPAL.-Madam Deputy Speaker, the best way to sought the shortage of land to mataqali unit is to have a consultation with the honourable Minister for Lands as they have land available which are in breach of lease conditions and the mataqali can lease from the Lands Department. Madam Deputy Speaker, I strongly request the honourable Prime Minister to look into this and please consider my request to stop the consultation of State freehold land for the sake of the poor farmers who have been suffering all their lives and struggling for a better livelihood. HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL. - I know better:</span></p><p>The honourable Prime Minister is not here, being a farmer’s son and coming from a remote rural area of Marasa, Nadi, my parents toiled hard to feed my two siblings and Igave us a good education and how I struggled to succeed in life. As for Schedule A and B, they can proceed with due process, there is no problem with that. Madam Deputy Speaker, as His Excellency alluded to good governance, where is good governance when the delivery level to the public sector is pathetic? For example, Ministry of Lands has yet to provide the sales data for properties sold in Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, if the honourable Speaker was here this afternoon, he will understand the difficulties registered valuers faced at the moment as they are unaware of the real estate market and where our country stands in the real property market. It seems that the Permanent Secretary, Director and the Chief Valuer have no clue of when the Ministry of Lands will give this vital information to the valuers. I cannot understand, without the available data, how is the Valuation Section on the Ministry of Lands assessing rentals and carrying out valuation? It has been more than a year since they have been finalizing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS) and Registrar of Titles. Madam Deputy Speaker, I raised this question in the previous sitting and if you remember, the honourable Minister of Lands said that from January this year everything will be sorted out but nothing has been sorted out so far. Is this what we call efficient service delivery? Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency spoke about informal settlements. Can the honourable Minister of Lands highlight this as what I could gather nothing has been done so far despite being in Government for more than fourteen months. Madam Deputy Speaker, on service delivery the Office of the Attorney-General must be proactive. Getting a certified title and lease copy takes a few days and people coming from the rural areas cannot be coming to Registrar of Titles Office twice or three times a week as some are poor and cannot afford the bus fares. The lack of service to our fellow citizens are alarming and delays their small projects mainly those who want to take loans to invest or improve their standard of living. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Minister of Finance has always complained of the debt level of previous governments. However, this Coalition Government</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>66 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 has significantly increased the debt level despite increasing Value Added Tax (VAT) and putting further burden on our fellow Fijians with no progressive developments to our nation. The honourable Prasad said that they are increasing VAT to 15 percent so that they can reduce the debt level but in actual fact the debt level has increased, and prediction is that by 2026 the debt level will increase significantly to US$5.2 billion which is about FJ$11.76 billion. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. S. S. KIRPAL. – Madam Deputy Speaker, this Coalition Government has further burdened our poor fellow citizens with high cost of living, increased cost of basic food items while the Ministers are enjoying overseas trips with hefty allowances. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! HON. S. S. KIRPAL. – Madam Deputy Speaker, some Fijians only enjoy a single or two meals a day while the wealthy Ministers enjoy lavish meals at a cost to poor fellow Fiji citizens. Honourable Prasad, where is your so-called strategy to reduce national debt and bring the cost of living down which you have been harping about since you have been in Parliament?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> 25 percent.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. S. KIRPAL.:</span> Is this one of your many false promises to reduce the price of lamb chops so that you can ride in a black ministerial vehicle? HON. K. K. LAL.- Lamb chops price? HON. C. J. SINGH.- (Inaudible interjection) HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Why, you want to give me some from your supermarket? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Stop pointing! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President said that Government is committed to greater accountability, transparency and good governance. I have been requested by the people to ask if the honourable Minister for Fisheries accepts or denies that he is one of the shareholders in the bech-de-mer exporting company on any of the fishing companies in Fiji? I hope to get a reply from the honourable Minister in his response which is tomorrow where the whole nation can know the truth. (Honourable Members interject) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order! Standing Order 62(1)- Prohibited references: “When speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member.” The honourable Member is imputing improper motives in terms of what he was referring to another honourable Member, not only him, but other earlier speakers in terms of the process in hand. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, Sir. I hope you heard that, honourable Kirpal? HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what honourable Tuisawau is about accountability and transparency which I am asking. There is wrong in asking about transparency and accountability of the honourable Minister, and this has been allowed in Parliament by the honourable</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 67 Speaker, the question asked by honourable Rinesh Sharma. I would like to inform honourable Minister for Infrastructure that our fellow citizens living in Tacirua have not been receiving reticulated water since 2 nd March. I request the honourable Minister to look into this as His Excellency the President mentioned this in his Address and I quote: “The Government is committed to ensure that all citizens have access to clean drinking water.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Just fix your thing first and then bring up some Points of Order:</span></p><p>It is disheartening to note that a large section of our population is being deprived of basic necessity, and cartage of water to this area is not regular. Also, if the honourable Minister can look into the roads at Nabitu, Sigatoka, Marasa, Nadi and the bridge at Buabua, Lautoka which are in pathetic conditions. Madam Deputy Speaker, we must be united with the vision that portrays a strong, secure, peaceful and prosperous Fiji, where people are educated, healthy and manage their resources in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Our aim is to decrease poverty, promote equal opportunity and prosperity and enhance peace and stability to help Fiji achieve its long term development vision. It can only happen if the Government gives opportunities to our younger generation who are the future leaders of this nation and stop getting people who have left the nation and are returning for their own benefit and agenda. I hope the honourable Prime Minister will give some serious consideration to this. Before I end, I would like to remind honourable Gavoka that it is not a free education, because conditions are attached to it, bond (Coalition bond). He has a habit of going around the bush blaming Fiji Airways when in Opposition, but now he is praising it. Where has Qantas gone? Madam Deputy Speaker, fellow Fijians are questioning about the charter flight … (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- …to Israel and if the arrears have been fully settled or still pending? It is taxpayer’s money, honourable Gavoka. Now you are quiet! (Laughter) With those words, I urge the Government to get to your work as time is flying and people are watching. Serve the nation and do not be obsessed with FijiFirst, as you will not be able to match what the FijiFirst Government did for the poor Fijians. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.:</span> May God bless this nation, all of us and the Coalition partners.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members and all joining in the gallery and online; aap sabko saadar pranaam, salaam alay kum and ni sa bula vinaka saka to all. We began our Parliament this year in a very holy month. Our Christian brothers and sisters are praying and fasting in preparation for Easter later this month. I wish</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>68 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 Ramadhan Mubarak to our brother and sisters from Islamic faith, as they too embark on a month of fasting and prayers. Hindus too are marking fagunmas, as they prepare for Holi also later this month. This week, there is a World Spiritual Leaders Forum organised in Hydrabad, India, where leaders from different faith traditions are coming together to see how each faith can contribute to peace in a world full of strife. Terrorists come together and unite in their quest for destruction, so why cannot faith leaders join hands to build peace? For that, we have to make an effort to learn about each other’s traditions and customs without fear of losing our own identity. Madam Deputy Speaker, as His Excellency reminded us in his gracious Speech, we are blessed with diversity of cultures and faiths. Yet, while many of us enjoy the different festivals and have a basic understanding of each other’s beliefs, narratives promoting fear and insecurity have never allowed us to fully embrace each other. Much more needs to be done to allay those fears. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency lamented that some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust among our communities for their own political ends. So, when the honourable Prime Minister called himself a vulagi when he was a visitor at an event, this was drummed up because this was what he had called non-indigenous community. Even chiefs when they enter a territory beyond their own within Fiji are called vulagi. This simplistic interpretation is what might be called, in other countries, a ‘dog whistle’. Some politicians will capitalise on the use of the word to prey on the insecurities of non-indigenous people, to suggest that they are being left out or treated as different. Many of us with a heightened sense of insecurity are ready to believe the worst, so when we hear this narrative, our fears are made worse. Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to also raise the issue on what the previous Member, honourable Kirpal said. He shared one example of where Native land lease is being converted, and then he used that example to create insecurity among all State land, what if it is converted back and what impact it will have on everyone else? Things like that causes fear, that is gaslighting what is being shared. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. KIRAN.- So, when you see one example like that, instead of finding out why it has been converted, is it being used, is it more necessary for that particular mataqali, we have used that to create fear amongst all the people of Fiji. That is exactly what His Excellency the President is talking about. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. S. KIRAN.- Madam Deputy Speaker, even when we have lived together for generations, we do not understand enough the extent of our fears and insecurities relating to other communities. Those of us who are not indigenous surely understand that for the iTaukei, their identity is the vanua, land, its customs, traditions and its people, and all of these adhere to them. Migrant communities feel insecure that the land they live on to which they form a different but also real attachment, could be taken away from them. What is the work we need to do as leaders to ease the tension and fears that these issues raise? Is it to create more tensions, like we have witnessed?</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 69 There are surely ways that we can see these issues not as a contest or a competition, but as a way in which we share and co-operate, work together, contributing different things, and live in harmony with one another, acknowledging each other’s insecurities and working to make sure that we understand and not create that as a fear. We need to acknowledge our past, look at our narratives of the past and how pain, trauma and insecurities have been transferred from generation to generation. Indenture, coups and evictions from land have traumatised my community and our sense of belonging. It does not help when these things keep being drummed up. Melanesians, Rabi and Kioan, Chinese, Part-Europeans, all have had a history that is not talked about. We do not learn about it in schools. Instead, we rely on stereotypes passed down between generations. Political upheavals in the last three decades have impacted every ethnic group and there are scars we carry. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the key focus areas for our Government will be to work on healing through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and building social cohesion so Fiji and its people can reach their full potential beyond these insecurities and fears. The honourable Leader of the Opposition had shared today that we need to integrate multi-culturalism in all spheres of our life. That is our intention, Madam Deputy Speaker. School curriculum will be reviewed to integrate our history much of which was removed by the last Government. The Coalition Government has reintroduced Ratu Sukuna Day and added Girmit Day to celebrate our leaders and remember our history. Truth and Reconciliation Commission will provide a platform for collective healing. The honourable Prime Minister, under his leadership, the entire Coalition Government is committed to this process. This may be a difficult walk, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is hard to look within ourselves and do the hard work. It is easier for us to ignore these things and pretend that everything is fine, but we cannot go into the future as a nation, secure and united, until we have confronted the demons of the past. There are painful conversations to be had in our vanua settings with non-indigenous communities, political prisoners and their communities, as we prepare for the Commission. Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to pay tribute and acknowledge the efforts of Major-General Jone Kalouniwai, the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF), for his own initiative of healing and reconciliation within the RFMF that he began this month. We know that the RFMF has played a role in many disruptive political events in the past. And as the Commander stated recently for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to succeed in Fiji, it was important for RFMF to work on healing and reconciliation from within. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am grateful that we live in times with leaders such as the Commander and our honourable Prime Minister who are committed to steering the nation forward from its painful past. I want to invite all segments of our community to engage in the Truth and Reconciliation process, including the business community, civil society, the Public Service and the religious groups, to create an environment of learning about each other’s cultures and faith traditions. Enabling a Muslim worker to quietly conduct his or her midday prayers at work during Ramadan, or reflecting together in a neutral and non-religious way on the message Easter brings, would be ways in which we could bring people together, show respect and support inclusion. Only when we have learnt each other’s values in each of our cultural and faith traditions, do we embrace each other’s authenticity and only then do we enable each other to grow to their full potential. Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a challenge issue to one and all, to take the time to try and</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>70 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 learn from others around you, whose faith and ethnic and cultural identities are different from your own. As one who has spent more than 20 years on this journey, let me assure you that the greatest learning from these engagements is that about oneself. We can learn to see ourselves in a different light, to understand how, within our own faith and traditions, we can do better and serve others better. I look forward to the journey of healing for this nation, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank His Excellency for highlighting the wide-ranging work of the Government to strengthen our core social protection programmes. Fiji has developed a national Adaptive Social Protection Strategy and Implementation Plan in 2023 funded by the World Bank. This strategy aims to strengthen the role and performance of the social protection sector in helping households, communities, civil society, local government and Fiji overall in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from disasters and in mitigating the impacts of climate change. Fiji has recognised the value of adaptive social protection which is defined as building the resilience of households by investing in their capacity to prepare for, cope with, and adapt to shocks, protecting their wellbeing and ensuring that they do not fall into poverty or become trapped in poverty as a result of disaster impacts. The development of Fiji’s first Anticipation Action (AA) Framework in 2023 will enable financing to be triggered by the forecast of an approaching hazard, instead of only reacting to its impact following the event. The AA Framework was developed in partnership with National Disaster Management Office and it is funded with the support of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and World Food Programme. Our Ministry has the responsibility for cash transfer to selected beneficiaries of social protection programme and prepositioning of necessary supplies. This improves the ability to deliver prompt pay-outs so that those affected by climate shocks can action time-sensitive preparedness and response measures. Madam Deputy Speaker, to guide the staged implementation of the Strategy, the Government has developed its 5 Year Implementation Plan, which identifies two main approaches for enhancing the delivery of the Adaptive Social Protection Strategy, to: 1. expand social protection benefits and reach in disaster hit communities; and 2. implement community-based Adaptive Social Protection actions in 14 priority districts which are at heightened disaster risks and facing the impacts of climate change. An essential prerequisite for delivering Adaptive Social Protection is investing in a robust and high-coverage social protection system that can deliver benefits in a reliable and timely manner and can be scaled up in times of crisis. In addition of the Adaptive Social Protection Strategy, the Government is committed to strengthening the design and delivery of its portfolio of recurrent social protection programmes through an ambitious and wide-ranging package of reforms with the support of the Australian Government. These reforms are focused on strengthening programme inclusion, efficiency and effectiveness, in alignment with the objectives of the 2021 Social Assistance Policy, across the six major social assistance benefits administered by the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. Madam Deputy Speaker, our Ministry is considering several programmes and policy reforms to ensure that beneficiaries are receiving sufficient support and to enhance the coverage and accessibility of the core social protection programmes. We are currently undertaking a range of</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 71 operational reforms to ensure that the system is delivering support to people in a transparent and cost- effective way. This includes: 1. ensuring that the public have access to information and understand the social protection entitlements; 2. setting up mechanisms for effectively responding to complaints; and 3. strengthening tools to measure how well Fiji’s social protection system is working. The Ministry is digitising social protection and developing a new automated integrated beneficiary management system to make it easier and more cost effective for Government to deliver, and for beneficiaries to access social protection. Madam Deputy Speaker, as His Excellency has laid out this year, we have a lot to do. To my honourable colleagues in the Opposition, I want you to know that we value your work among your supporters and Party members. I value the work you do to scrutinise and criticise the Government’s work. I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his commitment to work with the Government on what matters to our people and the nation. I hope you will also see the value of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on which we are embarking and give to this process your full support. We cannot be effective in this work without your help. Nothing is more important than for all of us to be able to show our people that our differences in debates in this Parliament are not about enmity or hate. They are about working together to make our country better and stronger. I know that deep in our hearts this is what we all want, and I look forward to hearing from everyone on how we can make our process better, more inclusive and something which will lead to lasting change and that includes, being factual in the way we debate and trying out best not to do gaslighting. We look forward to a very productive year, Madam Deputy Speaker. I wish to say thank you to you and to Parliament, and may God bless Fiji. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen; ni sa bula vinaka and good afternoon to you all. Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to respond to His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere’s Address for Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament last Monday and to thank His Excellency for his most gracious Speech. At the outset, His Excellency the President made some profound announcement with regards to Government policies and plans for the development and advancement of our nation Fiji, which we all need to take heed of and work towards as honourable Members of this august Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, among the highest priorities of the Coalition Government is the formulation of a new National Development Plan for the nation, as announced by His Excellency the President. The new National Development Plan will capture our collective vision and aspirations for the future and set key initiatives and strategies that will allow the nation to grow sustainably in the many years ahead of us. As alluded to by His Excellency the President, the key fundamental of the Government’s</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>72 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 development agenda is inclusive development to improve the wellbeing of all our citizens. The National Development Plan is anticipated to be finalised by June this year before the Budget announcement. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President highlighted the commitment of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to address the significant challenges posed by the increasing burden of Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases in our population. Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) continue to be the main disease burden for our people, contributing to 80 percent of all deaths in the country and 40 percent of premature death. I am grateful to the honourable Prime Minister and Minister responsible for the Civil Service for launching earlier this year the Policy and Guideline on Healthy Catering at Government agencies and institutions which should guide how the Civil Service can promote and implement healthy eating and meal preparation. The healthy eating habits to reduce NCDs in Fiji do not start inside our hospitals and nursing stations. They start and are nurtured in our homes, schools, villages, workplaces, offices and also in the deliberations of this august Parliament. The NCD crisis we have will require all our collective efforts and determination to control and stop. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services is finalising its Wellness and NCS Strategy with the help of our partners, which will guide our effort in addressing NCDs in Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, at this juncture, the Ministry is highlighting an uphill battle with the increasing number of HIV and AIDS cases in Fiji. While this is still the tip of the iceberg, it is commendable for the Government of the day to recognise two significant issues that were pushed under the carpet. It:: 1. 2. recognises drugs as an issue; and recognised HIV. Our latest statistics on HIV cases are alarming and demands our attention and collective action. From January to December 2023, we have recorded 415 new HIV cases in Fiji, compared to 245 cases for the same period in 2022. Out of these cases, 404 are adults, while 11 cases are children. Three of the children got HIV through sexual transmission, while eight children got HIV/AIDS through Mother-To-Child Transmission (MTCT). Of the total number of patients diagnosed, 298 are reported to be male, 122 female and four transgenders. In addition, 31 of these cases were teenagers aged between 15 years to 19 years. The increase is attributed through increase in active case finding within the Ministry of Health and Medical Services using Point of Care Testing. Unfortunately, in 2023 alone, Fiji lost 82 lives to HIV which is one to many. According to the Global AIDS Monitoring Report, Fiji is now one of the top two countries in the Asia-Pacific region with rapidly rising new HIV infections. The Ministry is aware of the linkage between the use of illicit drugs in the country and the rise in HIV cases. Activities such as Blue Toothing for IV drugs users and Chem-Sex amongst the younger population are fueling the rise in new HIV cases. The Ministry is finalising the HIV Surge Strategy which will facilitate our collaboration with</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 73 health partners, across Government Ministries, and our communities to strengthen prevention, increase national HIV testing by 3 percent for key population groups, improve access to diagnosis and treatment, reduce stigma and discrimination relating HIV and AIDS, and strengthen the governance of our HIV response programme. I take this opportunity to remind everyone in Fiji that unsafe sexual practices and the use of injectable drugs are contributing to the rise of HIV in Fiji. Avoiding these risky behaviours can prevent you from getting the HIV infection. I also want to remind everyone in Fiji, that HIV is not a death sentence. With treatment, people living with HIV can lead a normal and productive life and have children who are free of HIV infections. Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to address the disease burden in Fiji. His Excellency the President had highlighted a number of important steps that the Ministry will undertake. The Ministry of Health and Medical services is focussed on reviewing and updating a number of critical health legislations such as the Public Health Act 1935, Nursing Act 2010, Radiation Health Act 2009 and the Mental Health Act 2010. Other health related legislations are also being considered for review as they impact the collaboration and coordination of effort between the Ministry, other Government agencies and the community, in the efficient delivery of health services and the protection of public health in Fiji. Talking on health workforce, Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji continues to lose healthcare workers from the Ministry into the private health sector in Fiji or abroad. Current global trends indicate that the movement of healthcare workers will continue for some time due to a global lack of healthcare workers. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the world will face a shortage of 10 million healthcare workers in 2030, reducing from 15 million in 2020. These gaps are still significant and contributing to the movement and maldistribution of the healthcare workers in Small Island Development States (SIDS), such as Fiji. Nonetheless, the Ministry has noted that in the case of our nursing workforce, the attrition rate has reduced in the months of November to December 2023, following the implementation of salary adjustments and incentives for nurses which Parliament approved in 2023-2024 National Budget. This is an encouraging sign, and the Ministry will continue to work with the stakeholders to address human resource need for the immediate and the long-term. On infrastructure improvement, Madam Deputy Speaker, since January 2023, the Ministry has continued with its health infrastructure improvement programme with the budgetary allocation from the Government, together with the general support of our partners, local businesses, civil society organisations, Hospital Board of Visitors and community members. Through this collaborative effort, the Ministry has implemented a number of significant infrastructural improvement projects that include, amongst others, the: 1. Refurbishment of Nagado Nursing Station, Vatulele Health Centre, Nukuilau Nursing Station and Nailaga Health Centre in the Western Division. 2. Refurbishment of Dreketi Health Centre, Naqumu Nursing Station and Savusavu Health Centre in the Northern Division. 3. Refurbishment of Galoa Nursing Station, Korovou Health Centre and the SOPD Clinic at Wainibokasi Hospital. 4. Refurbishment of wards and road works at St Giles Psychiatric Hospital. 5. Refurbishment of the Rose Hall at Tamavua Hospital.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>74 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 6. Construction on the Food and Water Laboratory at Fiji CDC Centre in Namaka. 7. Refurbishment of Cicia Health Centre in Cicia Island in the Lau Group. 8. Construction of a mortuary ramp and admin walkway at Labasa Hospital. 9. Internal renovations and exterior painting of the Mataika House in Tamavua. A number of infrastructural works are currently progressing, such as the refurbishment of the Nausori Health Centre, the interior painting for Labasa Hospital, and the construction of the Northern Medical Warehouse facility, to name a few. The Ministry will continue to address the infrastructure improvement needs for all its more than 200 health facilities across the country. The Ministry is aware of the infrastructural issues relating to the 100-year-old CWM Hospital, which have been highlighted a number of times in the media. The Ministry is engaging with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and our health partners, to address the immediate and long- term infrastructure needs of this Hospital. We hope to announce this week a health partner support that will go a long way in addressing the short and long-term actions to improve our hospital buildings. On Digital Health, Madam Deputy Speaker, COVID-19 pandemic showed us the value of digital health in augmenting and enhancing the delivery of health care services in Fiji and globally. In 2023, the Ministry launched its first ever Fiji’s Digital Health Strategy which is aimed at enhancing the Ministry’s communication and digital platforms and facilitating better disease surveillance, patient referral, supply chain and inventory management, resources planning and mobilization, and governance of its daily operations. Our divisional and subdivisional command centres operations will function much more effectively with access to a better digital and communication platform. Madam Deputy Speaker, the strategy will assist in the introduction of new digital health programme such as the immunization information system and telehealth capabilities that will further enhance health services as well as the storage and security of confidential health information for patients. This 5-Year Digital Health Strategy and Implementation Plan with the associated package of digital support will address governance, systems and human resources in line with the Government's overall digital plan. On health programmes, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has targeted the strengthening of a few health programmes that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which now need strengthening and enhancement. The Ministry is finalising its Primary Health Care Strategy with the support of our partners. The strategy will define the Primary Health Care package that will be delivered at all levels of health services from the nursing station right up to the main referral hospitals. A strengthened Primary Health Care programme will ensure that our population receive the health care they need in a timely manner, fulfilling our Universal Health Coverage targets for Fiji. While Fiji’s immunisation programme has been exemplary and applauded globally, the Ministry wishes to maintain the high immunisation coverage for the population of Fiji. The last coverage survey showed a 95 percent coverage overall for all vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccination coverage for the primary doses is also 95 percent for the adult population. With a strong child health programme under the Ministry, Fiji has maintained its neonatal mortality rate of less than 12 per 1,000 live births consecutively over the past five years, meeting the</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 75 SDG target of less than 12 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030. The Ministry will also begin to address and measure our progress towards the SDG targets of less than 25 per 1,000 live births for under five mortality rate. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry is strengthening the immunisation information management system with development partner support in the development of a digital immunisation registration system that will be completed over the next two years. This will allow defaulters to be traced efficiently, and readily available updated coverage data across the nation. With development partners support, the Ministry has updated its Immunisation Policy, and rolled out the digital Bluetooth monitoring of our Cold Chain process, which is the heartbeat of vaccination, providing the opportunity for research into the use of vaccines in Fiji. In 2023, the Early Childhood Development Policy and Implementation Plan was launched through the collaborative effort of our health partners and the government agencies including the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. The Policy will ensure that the National ECD Advisory Committee effectively guide the holistic development of more than 88,000 children between the age of 0 years to 8 years in Fiji through access to healthy nutrition, early education and support for the parents. Madam Deputy Speaker, inclusive development is an approach within the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is taking in terms of meetings our strategic objectives and most importantly improving the quality of health care for Fijians. For our many health programmes, the Ministry is engaging our community partners and civil society organisations to address the health concerns of our communities and address the health needs of our vulnerable communities so that the elderly, babies and children, pregnant mothers, the disabled and those with chronic diseases are adequately addressed. The increased allocation for medical outreach to rural communities, which is decentralized to our divisions for the first time ever will ensure that our rural, hard-to-reach communities, and maritime communities are visited by our health teams and their health needs addressed close to their own homes. In fact, as I speak, a team of Medical Specialist led by our Acting Sub-Divisional Medical Officer (SDMO) Eastern, Dr. Luke Ravula are touring the islands of the Lau Group providing medical care and health promotion activities. Madam Deputy Speaker, through the Ministry’s Donor Coordination Unit, we are gradually building up our capacity to be able to engage effectively with our various health partners and gain maximum benefit from their support and generosity. The Ministry is grateful to the support of local businesses, NGOs, Civil Society Organisations, Board of Visitors and community groups, as well as partners in DFAT, MFAT, KOICA, JICA, USAID, China Aid, World Bank, ADB and the UN organisations – WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP and the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, USA, China, as well as families and individuals who have supported the Ministry in its efforts to improve health services provision for the people of Fiji. Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to conclude with His Excellency the President’s Address when he said and I quote, “Let us not see challenges as mountains, but as common missions to ascend and resolve with open and constructive dialogue, with a view to build social cohesion.” With that in mind, I wish to mention and extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work of our health care workers throughout the country. One of them was highlighted in the media recently – the Medical Officer at Cicia Health Centre in the Lau Group, Dr. Rusila Tikoitoga who</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>76 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 11 th March, 2024 courageously and successfully delivered twins last month with limited medical resources at her disposal. Now, this is not our ideal delivery plan for a twin pregnancy knowing the many risks associated with multiple pregnancies. However, this was the reality at the frontline on that day, and not of her choosing. Dr. Tikoitoga displayed calmness, quick thinking remembering her training as a medical intern, and her dedication and faith to see the young mother and the newborn babies through. Madam Deputy Speaker, Dr. Tikoitoga exemplified many more dedicated and hardworking health care workers in Fiji whose stories we may never hear, who gave their best day in and day out, in spite of the many challenges they face each day. As their Minister, I salute all of them today and I also thank our friends and partners who help to make their work easier each day with their support. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services cannot do it alone, we need everyone’s contribution to create a healthy population in Fiji. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this brings to an end today’s proceedings and I want to thank you very much for your energy today. We will begin tomorrow morning with the next speaker. I must admit that afternoon tea had been ready for some time, but I thought you might appreciate us just forging ahead and then giving you the opportunity to enjoy afternoon tea after today’s proceedings.
