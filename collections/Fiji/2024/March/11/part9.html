<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s Sitting, all those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking an interest in your Parliament. Commonwealth Day 2024 Honourable Members, we, the member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations generally known as the “Commonwealth”, once again, come together to commemorate Commonwealth Day. Every year on the second Monday of March, 56 independent countries from around the world hold celebrations to commemorate this special day. Commonwealth Day is a celebration of unity, diversity and the links we share in the Commonwealth. This year’s theme, “ One Resilient Common Future: Transforming our Common Wealth ”, resonates deeply with the Parliament of Fiji, embodying the spirit of collaboration that defines the Commonwealth. It emphasises our shared responsibility to build a resilient and interconnected world. On that note, I extend a happy and blessed Commonwealth Day to all honourable Members and to all Fijians. Amended Sitting Times Honourable Members, for the purposes of ensuring that all 55 Members have the opportunity to respond to His Excellency’s Address, and also that Parliament can successfully deliberate on the items listed on the Order Papers for this week, the Business Committee had unanimously agreed to</p><p>11 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 the following: • That Parliament may sit beyond 4.30 p.m. from Monday to Thursday and beyond 12.30 p.m. on Friday; and • Lunch breaks to be limited to one hour only. International Women’s Day 2024 Finally, whilst the world celebrated International Women’s Day last Friday, I wish to take this opportunity today to wish all women honourable Members of Parliament a belated International Women’s Day. In commemoration of the International Women’s Day, we will have the Deputy Speaker, honourable Qereqeretabua, to preside over the Parliament’s proceedings at different times from Monday through to Wednesday.</p></body>
