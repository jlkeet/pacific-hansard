<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s Official Opening of the second session of this parliamentary term. I also welcome our guests seated in the gallery, thank you for joining us today. Today is another special occasion the in parliamentary calendar, as it marks the Official Opening of the Second Session of the third term of the Fijian Parliament. The State Opening will be officiated by His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere. Refurbishment - Parliament Chamber Honourable Members, as you may have seen today the Parliament Chambers has undergone some refurbishments and IT conferencing system upgrade to ensure that Parliament remains adaptable to the ever-changing world of technology. There has been a change in the carpet colour to the two-tone navy blue and grey. The colour is considered timeless in fashion and design, and it represents wisdom, stability, trust, convention and knowledge that stems from within us. It also resonates and represents the vast “blue” Pacific Ocean that surrounds Fiji. It is hoped that it would provide the platform that can be used for cooling and calming, both physically and mentally whilst there are heated contributions in debates by both sides of Parliament in respect of building Fiji’s democracy. While Fiji continues to honour the Westminster traditions in terms of practices and aesthetics, we should also appreciate the need for our Parliament to make certain adjustments to branch of on its own. Many Commonwealth Parliament Chambers have adopted colours different from the traditional Westminster green. In this case, while the carpet colour has changed, for the most part, Parliament still uses green in other aspects of this Chamber.</p><p>4 th March, 2024</p><h4>Communications from the Speaker</h4><p>3 Honourable Members, the other is the inclusion of the crafted tapa or motif design backdrop at the back of my Chair and this is to represent our unique Fijian culture, and also to encourage our talented women entrepreneurs to display their leadership and skill, and for the empowerment of women and partly to promote women handicraft as part of Parliament’s contribution to SDG5 on gender equality. This one is a traditional masi drapery from Cakaudrove and has been made by the women of the province. It is also envisaged that the Secretariat, in consultation with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, will also be in touch with the other Provinces, who will also be able to provide a similar motif design to be hung at the back of my chair at a later time so that we may showcase that our cultural identity is very much alive and well. It does not stop other Speakers of Parliament who will occupy this Chair in the future to change the background to one that they identify with, be it from any province or even from other non-iTaukei communities. We have just come back from a visit to the great Government of Australia by the Parliamentary seat in Canberra. There, they have on display in their big parliamentary Chambers 7,000 work of art from the interior to the coast and to the urban areas. It belongs to the traditional people, the first nation’s people, and the Australian people are quite proud for what is showcased in their Parliament. Most of the Parliament elsewhere, even the New South Wales State Parliament has a similar display of art works, and also the Chair. Most of our walls within this Chamber lay bare for all this time, but again, this is a proud place to display our handicrafts, especially coming from the women. Honourable Members, the other adjustment you may have noticed is the elevated gallery which will provide both our visiting guests a better view by the Speaker. Furthermore, as you can see, we have restored the Presiding Officer’s Chair, this is the one that I am sitting on, which is very historic given that it dates back to 1939 with all its original art with the Crown at the top which signifies that Fiji is still a member of the Commonwealth. I am told that the honourable Faiyaz Koya’s dad also used it during his tenure as Deputy Speaker. It also has our coat of arms with the inscription, Rerevaka Na Kalou Ka Doka Na Tui or translated (Fear God and honour the King), and we will keep all the original handcrafted carving designs on it including the red leather and the cushion. Finally, honourable Members, you would have noticed the additional five big screens on the walls which will allow Parliament to boost its e-Parliament initiative. We will continue to reduce the use of paper for the printing of Order Papers, Minutes of Proceedings and other documents. All these documents will be emailed to all honourable Members and copies will be projected from these screens. Honourable Members, and at this juncture, I wish to advise that as is customary, the honourable Members of the Judiciary will be joining us in Chamber to hear the Address by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji. [Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament escorts the honourable Members of the Judiciary into Parliament while honourable Members of Parliament are upstanding.
