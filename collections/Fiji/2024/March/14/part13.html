<body><h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE - FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK</h3><h4>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE - FIJI DEVELOPMENT BANK</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, for the purposes of Section 145(1) of the Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 131, I move: That Parliament approves – (a) (b) (c) that the Government guarantee for the Fiji Development Bank borrowings for the 12- month period from 1 st March, 2024 to 28 th February, 2025 through the issuance of short and long-term bonds, promissory notes and RBF financing facility and other short-term borrowings; that the Government guarantee for a sum of $130 million for the guarantee period; and that the Bank pay a guarantee fee of 0.075 percent on the cumulative utilised guarantee.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>291 Government Guarantee - FDB 14 th March, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, by way of background, as per the establishment of the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) Act in 1966, it is important for me to, once again, highlight the function of the Bank and, that is, to facilitate and stimulate the promotion and development of natural resources, transportation and other industries and enterprises in Fiji and in the discharge of these functions, the Bank shall give a special consideration and priority to the economic development of the rural and agricultural sectors of the economy of Fiji. Furthermore, Sir, the Bank is under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and this requires the Bank to provide a six-monthly report to the Minister of Finance. Also, as required under section 2(1) of the Financial Management Act which states that subject to any other Act that the Government may guarantee the financial liability of an entity in respect of a loan or otherwise but only if the giving of the guarantee is approved by Parliament. So by way of background, this is why this guarantee comes to Parliament. This Government guarantee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the request from the Bank is to: 1. 2. 3. 4. continue the facilitation of the Government’s policy by lending to essential sectors of the economy, particularly resource-based sectors including; agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, transport, communications, storage, small and micro enterprises, wholesale and retail, hotels, sustainable energy from fossils to renewable sources and professional and business services which will assist the disadvantaged community to earn a decent livelihood. lend to the resource-based sector that will assist in the development of the agriculture sector and assist the development of the Fijian economy in the long run. continue provision of finance that can support the growth of the nation’s economy and improve the standard of living for the people, as well as improving their social economic status by assisting them with their needs in making the correct investments. ensure that the Bank’s borrowings are guaranteed by the Government, therefore, reducing the perceived risks associated with such borrowings. This will make the Bank’s instruments more attractive to investors and should reduce the cost of borrowing to the Bank. I want to also state, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the original intention of the Bank was to ensure that the Bank actually took additional risks in providing financing to sectors which, perhaps traditionally, will not be the ones that commercial banks and other financial institutions would like to lend. In terms of the Bank’s lending portfolio, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank’s Audited Financial Statement as of 31 st December, 2023, recorded an accumulative total loan portfolio of $482.73 million. We are representing about 8,561 accounts of $371.04 million in the focus sector, which is what I had stated earlier; and 1,058 accounts, amounting to $111.69 million in the non-focus sector, compared to $692 million in the 2022 Financial Year. So, that is a significant change, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the Bank’s financial position for 2023, at the end of the financial year, the Bank doubled its consolidated profit to $3.8 million, an increase of about 114 percent when compared to the same period last year which was $1.8 million. This is attributed to the increase in fee income and allowances for interest and fees. The overall asset base stood at $594 million as at 2023 Financial</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>292 Government Guarantee - FDB 14 th March, 2024 Year 2023 and a 5 percent decrease when compared to the $626.2 million in the 2022 Financial Year. While total liabilities declined to $411.7 million, 8 percent decrease from $449.9 million in the year 2022 so with the decrease in total liabilities, the total shareholders’ equity increased by 3 percent to $182.2 million. As at the end of 2023 Financial Year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank had total cash and cash equivalent of $179.1 million - an increase of about 72 percent when compared to the same year in 2022. The increase was attributed to the higher collection levels during the year and that is understandable (coming out of COVID-19). On the Bank’s borrowing forecast, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for 2024 and that relates to the Government guarantee that we are seeking from Parliament, the Bank’s total forecasted outlay from 1 st March, 2024 to 28 th February, 2025, which is the proposed amount for the 2024 Guarantee, Sir, amounts to $191.26 million as opposed to $211.3 million during the 2023 Guarantee that we had approved here in Parliament. So, given that the Bank’s forecasted inflow is only $61.26 million during the proposed guarantee period, Sir, the Bank requires an additional $130 million to finance the total outlay of $191.26 million. Henceforth, the guarantee that we are bringing to Parliament is for an additional $130 million which is proposed to be raised from the issuance of bonds and other instruments - promissory notes, short term borrowings and RBF financing facility. The FDB Guarantee, Sir, is requested on an annual basis. That is why we have to bring it again this year. Given that Parliament only approves to guarantee FDB borrowings for the next 12 months period, which is a strategy, I think, also put in place to stringently monitor the risk associated with these borrowings to minimise the risk of exposure to Government. In light of the figures highlighted, the outstanding guaranteed borrowings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been declining over the years. Every time we have been coming to Parliament, the amount has been declining. For instance, the total approved Government Guarantee for FDB borrowings for the past five years has accumulated to a sum of $920 million, and as of 31 st December 2023, only 25 percent - $234.21 million of this accumulated approved guarantee is outstanding by which the Debt Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning is closely monitoring to ensure that associated fiscal risks are mitigated at all times. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank’s current average lending rate and cost of borrowing as of 31 st December, 2023 is 5.67 percent and 1.23 percent respectively. Additionally, the Bank accommodates and delivers a variety of Government’s socio-economic and directed lending policies, therefore, request that it continues to be assisted by the provision of guarantees. I think that is the rationale behind the guarantees as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank’s outstanding liabilities guaranteed by the Government, as mentioned earlier, as of 31 st January 2024 amounts to $227.6 million, of which bond stood at $45.5 million - 21 percent; term deposits at $65.1 million - 29 percent; and RBF import substitution and export finance provision at $117.02 million, which is 50 percent. Financial implications of this guarantee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of 30 th October, 2023, the total Government guaranteed debt stood at $1.02 billion or 7.7 percent of the GDP. Accessing the $130 million guarantee that we are asking Parliament to approve for the Bank, will increase the total Government guarantee exposure to $1.2 billion or 8.7 percent of GDP. I think the honourable Members of Parliament understand this. What that means is that, if there is a default, then the Government will have to come up with that $130 million. But the good news is that Bank has never</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>14 th March, 2024 Government Guarantee - FDB 293 called on the Government guarantee to honour its guarantee, and the Bank continues to pay the guarantee fees. With those details, I commend the motion and ask the honourable Members to, please, support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. And before I offer the floor, I wish to inform this august Parliament that I have in front of me a list of speakers who have been identified by both Whips. The Opposition will lead off the batting and that is to be done by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and to be followed by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation and Education, before we switch back to honourable Koya and then to be rounded off by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been listening very carefully to the motion and I can see that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance was smiling most of the time when he was presenting this because he knows how these Guarantees used to be debated in Parliament previously. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say from the very beginning of my contribution that we, on this side of Parliament, fully support the motion. I am a bit worried about what honourable Koya referred to as “year of nothingness”, probably to salvage the Government of the year of nothingness, we have decided to give it our full support. However, seriously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just for three key reasons, it is a development bank and the key things about development bank is providing that long-term financial support and the two key words are to support projects and most importantly, the sectors. We have been talking about diversifying the economy and this is one of my concluding remarks. I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we had some long discussions here. During the week, I responded to the request from the Prime Minister’s Office, from Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have consultations with the consultant who is here on our Foreign Policy - White Paper. Again, I discussed with Mr. Peter Varghese. We can come up with a very good Foreign Policy, at the same time, where do you converge with the work that has been undertaken by the Ministry of Defence on national security issues because at the end of all these, to support your Foreign Policy, to support your national security policies, we need a well-functioning economy to provide that support to the policies that we have. Why I am talking about projects and sectors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because if we refer back to the Household Income and Expended Survey Reports (HIES), we will come up with the incidents of poverty and particularly in the areas in Fiji. The honourable Minister for Rural Development has been talking about coming out of dependency syndrome. The honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs has been talking about empowering the iTaukei in their respective communities. We fully support that, but we need to be analytical as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Where are the incidents of poverty in Fiji high? I had noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the work of the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), when we established FDB in Taveuni, in Bua, additional to the one that we have in Seaqaqa and the one in Labasa, the 2018 HIES Report specifically stated that the incidents of poverty in Vanualevu reduced from 53 percent to 48 percent.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>294 Government Guarantee - FDB 14 th March, 2024 Apart from the other contributing factors, I will come to MSMEs because of the Northern Development Programme but FDB played a critical role in the achievement of that. That is why data is so important and that is why that analytical thinking needs to be there, and then we look at the potentials in the respective areas - not just the rhetoric, not just the statements but we need to do something about it and this is why the development bank providing these finances for projects and the sectors. We have talked about the resource-based sector. We have heard a lot from the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. We have heard a lot from the honourable Minister for Agriculture. Let us do something, let us come up with serious plans, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On Small and Medium Enterprises, one of the purposes of development banks is to provide banking services principally to cater for the medium to long term needs of agricultural and industrial enterprises with emphasis on small and medium scale industries. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications and I also had some discussions. Again, going back to the economy because when we are talking about the economy, we are doing our review on our defence and our foreign policies. During our discussions with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, we have been talking about Fiji as a hub, hub for what? Let us get into some serious work so that we can fully utilise that advantage that we have so that we can gain from it. On the role of SMEs, Japan thrives. They started off with small enterprises and they become big players, not only locally but globally as well out of SMEs. I know the effect of the Northern Development Programme. I have talked about the incidents of poverty because SMEs in the North have continued to be assisted from 2008 and I hope that, that still continues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we need that. We have been talking about high unemployment. This will be a solution when we have a lot of SMEs. We do not want people to be employees only, we want employers, and this is why it is so important. Of course, the agriculture sector. As the honourable mover of the motion has correctly stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initial purpose of FDB or the main objective is to facilitate and stimulate the promotion and development of natural resources, transportation and other industries and enterprises in Fiji, and to give special consideration and priority to the economic development of the rural and agricultural sectors of the economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go back to His Excellency’s the President’s Address last year, there was a commitment by Government to set up a special committee for the sugar industry. I will say that again, in His Excellency’s Address last year, there was in the statement by His Excellency to set up a special committee to look at sugar. I have discussed with you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Chairperson of Natural Resources Committee and being new to Committee work, I did not know where to put that in the Report on the Agriculture Sector, but I decided to put it in the Chairman’s foreword. If we can have a special committee, not only to look at sugar, but to look at the whole agricultural sector - sugar and non- sugar, because as stated very recently, again, by the honourable Minister for Lands and, of course, in</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>14 th March, 2024 Government Guarantee - FDB 295 concurrence with what His Excellency said, that agriculture is the backbone. Let us do something serious. We offer our assistance from this end. I know the 2020 Agriculture Policy Agenda and the key thematic areas that is in the policy agenda. From there, they have worked out the five key thematics that are there in the Strategic Plan. It is good to have a plan but let us come up with some concrete work on how to operationalise that plan so that we diversify the economy and we can broaden the economic base. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Natural Resource Sector has a lot of play and that is why we strongly support this motion. Of course, we continue to contribute when Government sees it fit, as consistent with what we have discussed and what has been stated as well by His Excellency in his Address and, of course, the commitments to last year. Once again, we fully support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition for your contribution. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the floor for the Government to guarantee the sum of $130 million to the Fiji Development Bank (FDB). The way I see it, Sir, quite simply, FDB’s role is to provide finance for the development of the country. Mr. Speaker, we all want the Bank to succeed. There are two parties to the bank; those that manage the bank and those that borrow. In my view, Sir, what we need is for both to be well educated - the one who manages the affairs of the bank and the one who borrows. One of the finest examples of development banks, Mr. Speaker, is the Development Bank of Singapore. It is dominant in the Asia Pacific region, and it is for that reason, that it is run by people who are well educated, well trained and the borrowers are also well-educated people who put the money they borrow to good use. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am picking the angle that the education policy of the Coalition Government is critical for the economy of this country and critical for the FDB. As I have articulated that our policy is in terms of what we provide in scholarships, there is no other country in the Pacific that provides scholarship for its citizenry, like Fiji, and it is a policy of the Coalition Government. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wrote off the debt of 53,725 people (young men and women) in this country, debts that were valued at about $650 million. I hear from honourable Koya that there is nothingness but I tell you, Sir, that that kind of write-off was heavy lifting of the highest order anywhere, not even FijiFirst would have thought of that. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. V. R. GAVOKA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this because we need education to develop our country. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its very positive report of the economy given out this week, had a paragraph there that Fiji should focus on education and skills training for its people. So, we are committed to education policies that provide education to our people in the best way possible. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about TELS…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Talk about FDB:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.:</span> … and education, I met this lady who came up to me and said, “My</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>296 Government Guarantee - FDB 14 th March, 2024 daughter is a doctor. Thank you, she does not have to pay her TELS debt.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Vinaka:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> And if you look at that, Mr. Speaker….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Point Of Order. Order 61 – when speaking, Members must confine their observation to the subject under consideration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we are talking about the Fiji Development Bank Guarantee. That is what we are talking about. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we are talking about the health of the Bank.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, can I just make a Ruling on that Point of Order? Can I humbly ask you just to confine your observations on what is before us? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are talking about the health of the Bank here and an educated citizenry is very important for the Bank to survive. We can talk about guarantees but if what you guarantee is wasted, then it will all come to nothing. That is why we need policies of Government to support the economy of this country, to support the Bank and to support the development of this country. That is why education is so important. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot being said about education. If you do not support it, if all these misleading statements, honourable Sachida Nand said that the FFP policy that they only pay 50 percent is better than ours where we write off 100 percent”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want the Bank to succeed, we want our people to know what to do with their money and we need training, we need education, and that is why, it is important to educate our people and that our people in education, we train them to execute. We can have all the best plans but if our people cannot execute, it will fall apart. If they are given loans and they do not know how to use it, if you cannot execute, the Bank will fail. That is the point that they do not understand, Sir. They do not get it. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- We look at Fiji in a holistic way, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What is important is for the other side to realise that our education policies is the best that has been in this country and it is always supported. Honourable Premila Kumar is bringing Australia saying that Australia do not even give free education. They used to give free education, but that is history. You do not know your history. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Point of Order, under Standing Order 61, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on relevance. He needs to be instructed to be confined to the subject at hand and he is going all over the place. He has forgotten that he is in Government now, not in Opposition. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you may continue. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, do they think about the last 16 years of wastage? (Laughter)</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>14 th March, 2024 Government Guarantee - FDB 297 It is 16 years of wastage because they did not educate our people properly. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mismanagement because they could not train people to execute. We want people to execute better in this country, Mr. Speaker, that is why education is so important. Without that, the Bank will fail. It is obvious they cannot make the connection, that is why we inherited a sorry state of affairs. (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order. Standing Order 61. Are you finished? Just because I got up, he finished. Thank you. (Laughter) HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I hear one more 16 years quip from the other side, Sir, I will continue reading the list. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as pointed out right at the outset, we fully support this motion. I think sometimes we forget about what actually drives our economy. Again, one of the most important things for us to always remember is that we have guaranteed within our Constitution the right to economic participation, and it is a very important provision within the Constitution. Section 32(1) reads, and I quote: “Every person has the right to full and free participation in the economic life of the State, which includes the right to choose their own work, trade, occupation, profession or other means of livelihood.” Why I say this as a reminder, Sir, for eight years because I served as Minister for Trade, I think also the honourable Minister now who looks after the Ministry of Trade and SMEs has really grasped the issue well. I think if I remember correctly, he spoke at the Fiji Enterprises Engine graduation ceremony where he mentioned about the entrepreneurial journey and I quote from him, Sir, as it requires a special kind of determination and resilience. I am so happy that he actually recognises that and I think what happens is, when we do these things and the FDB for many, many years has formed a huge part of the life of SMEs and continuous to do so, it is something extremely important. If I could just relay some facts and figures, if you look at countries like Indonesia, 60.51 percent of its GDP is actually from these MSMEs and that is quite a substantial amount. Indonesia quite surpasses some of the other countries, but it is huge with respect to their contribution to GDP. So, when we look at ours, we have to put these things in, we have to support these ideas specifically when it comes to banks, like FDB. We also know that the normal high street banks generally do not easily accommodate these MSMEs. These MSMEs and we recognise these very much a long, long time ago about how they drive the economy and they are the engine for growth when it comes to that. So, a word of reminder to the honourable Minister of Finance, please, remember them during budget time because they do form a huge part of our economy and currently, they all are suffering and we would gladly support this.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>298 Government Guarantee - FDB 14 th March, 2024 Now, if I may also, Sir, when we talk about MSMEs, we are not actually just talking about one Ministry. It is the Ministry of Tourism with all our ladies who sell their wares during the tourism season, et cetera; it is the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; obviously, it is the Ministry of Agriculture; it is the Office of the Prime Minister’s; the Ministry of Sugar; Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection; Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts; Ministry of Fisheries - these are all the Ministries that are involved in MSMEs and we need to recognise that because they really form a huge part of our country’s growth. The cooperatives are involved in it and I am really happy to see that the Ministry concerned, Ministry of Trade, is continuing to do that, but they actually need assistance and help, especially in light of the fact, as I have said, high street banks, even though they are flushed with cash, they make it a little a bit more impossible for our MSMEs to survive. Again, I think we also need to be a little bit mindful of honourable Gavoka, who is the new Minister for Education so he is just promoting his Ministry. I think we must also remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I think honourable Gavoka pointed out a very important point that if you have a bank, you need a great Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who is actually going to drive this and I understand that the current CEO is a huge admirer of the MSME sector and he actually does quite a lot for them. So, all in all, Sir, just being very short and sharp, I am not going to go on about it, maybe out of the year of nothing as we might get a year of something out of this support that we actually render to FDB. I wholeheartedly support the motion, Sir. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make some comments in support of the motion before Parliament by the honourable Minister of Finance, I thought I will just touch on honourable Koya’s comments in his speech today. I was trying to think of an appropriate word to use when he said that it has been 14 months of nothingness and I came up with one word, - ‘comical’. Honourable Koya cannot be serious and say that we have not done anything in 14 months, compared to 16 years. Let me remind them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when Mr. Naiqama came out with the report on poverty, he was reporting on the 2019 figures and not 2022 because they would have said that it is COVID-19 related. That was before COVID-19. He said that one-third of the population in Fiji is under extreme poverty; one-third, 16 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services was very polite when he spoke about health. I will tell him a story just for them to know. I spoke to the Chief Surgeon at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again on Standing Order 61 on relevance. We are debating the Government Guarantee motion that is before Parliament and he is going all over the place. You had instructed them to be on to the point, it is amazing, I admire you for your patience though, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, patience is for everyone, but I ask the honourable Deputy Prime Minister to, please, continue as most of the speakers are in support from both sides. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very quickly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was speaking to the Head Surgeon of the CWM Hospital and he said that out of the eight Operating Theatres, only three are operational. So, what these poor doctors have to do, they have to work during the day because of the backlog, and they go and sleep a little bit, then come out at midnight with the nurses and actually</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>14 th March, 2024 Government Guarantee - FDB 299 operate on people. It has been like that for so many years - 16 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying, we have shared the unsustainable debt problem in this country. They are saying it is COVID-19 related - it is not COVID-19 related, it is because of the wastage in this country that we have arrived at this unsustainable debt problem. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Point of Order! Standing Order 60 - Relevance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you had directed him to speak on the motion, he is still going on - very disrespectful to the decision that you had made. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Naupoto. Honourable Members, you are all adults here. When the Speaker has made a ruling, let us continue to respect and honour that, please, because it is so hard when you think you are in the right, then you want to inform other people, “Look you people were wrong.” This was the actual thing that happened. Again, can we just focus on orders before us, that is, this motion by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance on the FDB seeking a guarantee. That is all we want. At the beginning, it worked very well as I was listening, “oh, this will be short one.” As we come together to agree, then all of a sudden, we are finger pointing again. I insist on the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, please, but do continue. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the unsustainable debt, let me explain how relevant it is. That is why it is very important that we support the FDB guarantee so that we continue to broaden the economy and support the people of Fiji. May I now be allowed to make my contribution, Sir. I rise to briefly support the motion by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. The FDB has played a key role in the development of economic progress of Fiji. I recall with fondness that a former Prime Minister of our country was the CEO of FDB, the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase, and whenever FDB comes up, I recall him with fondness his massive contribution towards the FDB in supporting our country at that time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FDB has a big mandate to support MSMEs in the country in areas such as agriculture, sugarcane farmers in particular, and also wholesale, retail, hotels, restaurants, transportation and service sectors, to name a few. I just wish to elaborate a bit more on my support for the motion, Sir. In fact, the FDB has been working very closely with the Ministry of Trade as it had even during honourable Koya’s time, in terms of trying to support our SMEs in terms of, firstly, attaining finance at an affordable rate and also driving development or economic activities in the agriculture sector so that subsistence farming transforms into subsistence and commercial level. This guarantee will provide an opportunity, and for that reason, this guarantee is supported. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to list out a few key things that the FDB has done over the last year. Right now, 93 percent of FDB’s portfolio is catering for three sectors - MSME sector, SME sector and also agriculture. They have actually started to focus in recent times on agriculture value chain, such as ginger and rice, in particular, and they continue to focus on trying to de-risk their portfolio and that is why right now the request to Government for a guarantee continues to reduce. Sir, it was $280 million in 2022, $150 million in 2023 and now, $130 million in 2024.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>300 Government Guarantee - FDB 14 th March, 2024 There is a laser focus on women empowerment, and I know the honourable Minister for Women is actually very passionate about financial assistance to women. For the FDB’s Women Entrepreneurs Loan in the last 16 months, they have been able to disburse about $3 million to about 1,100 women with loans. Of course, they do have a digital literacy programme as well, Sir, in collaboration with Visa International and, apparently, just recently their financial literacy platform is online and 5,500 customers or individuals have clicked on to that literacy programme. They also even do outreach programmes every month, at least, 15 on average, reaching out into places, like Kadavu, Rabi and other areas and we continue to try and work with them in their outreaches. Of course, as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance, there has been a reduction in the non-provision in the Non-Performing Loans (NPL) portfolio in the last 24 months which is very positive. In closing, Sir, just an example of a recent support that we have gave out in Kadavu where I was a few weeks ago, we were there to handover bakery equipment to Mrs. Alumita Tuila under the IHRBP funding which is a one-third two-thirds programme. She was able to get a grant from the Ministry and financed her one-third contribution from FDB under the Women’s Entrepreneurs Programme. Mr. Speaker Sir, today she is supplying more than 120 loaves a day to the community, and that is the type of assistance that we will continue to encourage and foster as we move forward. On honourable Koya’s point, we are developing an MSMEs strategic plan which is receiving a lot of positive feedback and the FDB has actually been quite active in contributing to that plan because we can see that with the well-articulated plan and with some key strategies, we can hopefully grow the contribution of MSMEs to GDP, which is now 18 percent to, at least, double or more in the years to come. I also thought to share with particularly the people of Fiji who are listening in that the Government is not giving FDB actual physical funding - we are merely approving a guarantee which would allow them to access finance. Mr. Speaker, we speak in support of the contribution, and I fully support the motion. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their contributions and especially thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his support for the motion on Government guarantee. Just very quickly and briefly, Sir, the point raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition on SMEs, in fact, Government has worked very closely with FDB to strengthen its reach to agriculture - to SMEs and MSMEs. If I could just give you some figures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, the Bank disbursed about $40 million worth of loan to assist in the MSME and agriculture sectors alone. As pointed out by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, the FDB has also introduced some new innovative projects for the SME and MSME sectors, particularly for women, and he gave the statistics. Women’s loan portfolio represents about 28.6 percent of the Bank’s overall loan portfolio, which is quite impressive. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has said, it represents about $3 million and about 1,300 accounts. Also, just to give you some figures and put it for record that the Bank has recorded a substantial decrease in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) by 30.2 percent; four times more, compared to the previous financial year and the NPL was $152.3 million. The Non-Performing Loan value as at June 2022 has now reduced to $116.94 million in June 2023. I think that has been the case overall. A lot of the COVID related loans for businesses that were not able to pay loans during COVID, I am</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>14 th March, 2024 Government Guarantee - FDB 301 told by banks that many of them have cleared that as part of the economic recovery in 2022-2023. Just quickly clarifying the point raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in terms of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey Report, I think the media also confused us on what was in the Report. What the report said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was 75 percent of those who were in poverty and not 75 percent of the total iTaukei population. It is the total which was below poverty line. Of those who were in poverty, 75 percent of them were from the iTaukei community. I see a lot of people saying that 75 percent of the iTaukei population are living in poverty, that is incorrect, it is 75 percent of those who were already in poverty. I agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Deputy Prime Ministers that SMEs, even in developed countries, the largest number of employment is created in the SMEs micro enterprises, small businesses, and they contribute significantly to the GDP. The honourable Prime Minister was saying to me earlier that FDB’s role, and I agree with him, is to also take a little bit more risk and expand its portfolio in terms of supporting SMEs, MSMEs and those in the agriculture sector. I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My first job was with FDB many years ago and the late former Prime Minister, Mr. Laisenia Qarase, was the Managing Director. Part of our responsibility in the section I worked in was basically to go and identify these very small micro enterprises and we were looking at loans of $1,000; $2,000; and $3,000. What we found at that time was that those very small ones were actually very good. They were able to repay their loans on time and it created a lot more economic activity in those areas. So, I agree with all the honourable Members and with the honourable Prime Minister that we need to focus on SMEs and, particularly, in areas where the Bank could take a bigger risk in lending. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the FDB Board and Management. I think we have a very competent Board, and I am pretty sure that with the new strategic plan going forward, the Bank will serve its intention of promoting those focused sectors that we have identified earlier in our presentations. Once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the honourable Members for supporting the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today.
