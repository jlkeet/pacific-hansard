<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Point of Order! MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise a Point of Order. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. There is a Point of Order being raised. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 74(1)(a) and Standing Order 80, I wish to raise a Point of Order against honourable Ketan Lal. Despite my personal explanation here on a question that he raised, he continued to…. MR. SPEAKER.- Can I have a look first, honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.:</span> Thank you, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, you may continue, honourable Minister. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ketan Lal, despite my full explanation here in answering his question, continued to post on Facebook the issue that had already been addressed in Parliament and I would ask him to refrain or to pull it down. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, whatever you say in Parliament can be addressed under Standing Orders, but if you go to the social media, that is beyond my reach. But I certainly would like to ask honourable Ketan Lal, for the sake of ensuring that we maintain the dignity of the Parliament. Honourable Ketan Lal, I am talking, for the sake of preserving the dignity of Parliament, I ask that in your own good time, please, ensure that whatever is being stated in the social media should not paint that picture of you continuing your diatribe outside of Parliament when full explanations have been given. I am not here to defend the honourable Minister, but his dad, he has also served his time well for Fiji in undertaking duties bestowed to him by the honourable Prime Minister now, and we even served time together. So, that is just one of the things that affects us one way or another since we come from the islands. His sons have represented the country and I was his running mate in the 1999 General Elections. That, in a nutshell, is just a short explanation of this late great parliamentarian and gentleman. He is a huge man, honourable Member, you can see it by the built of his sons; not this one here. This one grew up in the Raiwai and Raiwaqa area, but his other sons are huge people and they played for the national team as well. I hope you will take that into account, honourable Ketal</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>226 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 14 th March, 2024 Lal, without depriving you of your right to the social media, et cetera.
