<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking interest in the proceedings of your Parliament. Parliament – ICT Upgrade of Conferencing System For the information of all honourable Members, there are only a few works left to complete the overall ICT upgrade of the conferencing system in our Chambers. I have been advised that these will be completed after this sitting and will be fully functioning at the next April sitting. These includes the interpretation (captioning) and broadcasting of the vernacular (translation). You may notice that you are not provided with any listening devices since of this fact that there is no final connection. It had just arrived after being bought from a New Zealand firm and that should be ready as I have stated in the next sitting. Translations – Hon. I. Vasu and Hon I. Tuiwailevu With that effect, I have also received notification from the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts and the honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs that they will deliver their responses in the vernacular. I can confirm that I have also received the English translations of their responses, and these will be included in the Daily Hansard for today. Whatever has been said in this Parliament, you will find after a few seconds being livestreamed in the television, whether it is said in the vernacular, both iTaukei and Hindi, or is said in English. That is what you will see on our television.</p><p>14 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 225 Appointment of Opposition Whip Honourable Members, I have received and acknowledged official communication from the Office of the Leader of the Opposition, informing that the new Opposition Whip is honourable Viliame Naupoto. I congratulate you, honourable Naupoto, and I also thank the outgoing Opposition Whip, honourable Alvick Maharaj. He has been holding that position for a long time. He came in fresh, very young and even unmarried, but his hairstyle has changed a lot and very quickly after being married.</p></body>
