<body><h3>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- 80.</h3><h4>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- 80.</h4><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Are you sure now? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am questioning that my Point of Order has been asked. He stands up and blabbed away without a Point of Order. I am trying to explain, what he is trying to get into. (Chorus of interjections) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Members, I am reading Standing Order 80 - Personal explanation and I quote: “A member may explain matters of a personal nature with the permission of the Speaker.” I do not think this was a personal nature, maybe your Point of Order should have been clarification but we take your point. Thank you honourable Koroilavesau,, please take your seat. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, irrelevant Point of Order, makes no sense. What he claims that there was massive unemployment in the country, that is what he said.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Of course:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> And let me tell him, this is the kind of motherhood generalisation without any facts that they are bringing into Parliament. Let me just tell you the situation in the formal sector, average….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, please take your seat. Your Pont of Order, honourable Member?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, now I refer to Standing Order 81.</p><h4>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Which is Response to Misrepresentation?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Continue please. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you. I understand there is a percentage on increase of employment in Fiji. That does not explain our people on the streets and in our areas who are not</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>178 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 being employed. So, it is the responsibility of Government to get them employed. If people have been moved out from here and have gone overseas, … DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroilavesau.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> … that is the responsibility ….</p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroilavesau, I beg your pardon, Sir. Standing Order 81(2) states and I quote; “An explanation must be succinct, strictly relevant to the reference, and not introduce any new matter.” So, please be succinct in your Point of Order on the point raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Do not bring in are new matter please, Sir. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- The reason that I have explained, the issue that he has raised and my point of view when I raise the issue in Parliament. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We take your point. Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau. Continue, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I know they have a plan to disrupt me. Let me … (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Absolute lie:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> The reference to massive unemployment in the country is a lie, is a motherhood generalisation without any figures, without any statistics. Let me just give you an example, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is FNPF data. In 2022 and 2023, in fact in 2023, the formal sector employment return stood more than pre-pandemic levels and Madam Deputy Speaker, average salaries in the formal sector as per FNPF data also increased by 12.46 percent. They are contradicting themselves, in fact, the demand for labor, all the indicators from the Bureau of Statistics, Reserve Bank of Fiji, International Monetary Fund, World Band, Asian Development Bank and the business community recognises that we have a tight labor market, there is shortage of labor, people are looking and sometimes they cannot even find a skilled labor. So, this claim that there is massive unemployment in the country is just bogus, designed to mislead.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Hogwash is coming from that side:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> Let me give another example, Madam Deputy Speaker, of the generalisation of bogus claims and I know why they do that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Because you used to do it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because they have got nothing else to talk about:</span></p><p>All of them said, “we just heard someone talk about fiscal policy, wrong fiscal policy.” In fact the honourable Leader of the Opposition to his credit recognised and made some very good insights into the economic problems that we have and in fact he made some good suggestions about</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 179 broadening the tax base. Let me just read and I urge all honourable Members on the Opposition side to read the concluding statements from the International Monetary Fund which conducts an independent analysis, looks at the data and consults the business community. It put out the Report yesterday and this is what they said about fiscal policy amongst many others, and I quote: “The fiscal stance reflected in the 2023-2024 Budget remains broadly appropriate as a moderate fiscal consolidation balances medium term goals, a narrowing output gap and accommodated monetary conditions. The Fijian authorities have made impressive progress in mobilising domestic revenue, although spending has also increased. The 2023-2024 Budget appropriately included revenue and unseen measures and VAT, corporate tax and departure tax as well as removing certain tax concessions and incentives. Total fiscal impact of the budget is estimated at 4.6 percent of GDP.” This is what the IFS is also saying. They would have ideally liked us to remove zero VAT on basic food items; we did not. We added, Madam Deputy Speaker, one more item.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It was already there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> And we added Prescribed Medicine to make it 22 items, they had forgotten.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Stop lying! It was already there.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> They have forgotten, Madam Deputy Speaker, that under their dictatorial rule and the FijiFirst rule, they had 15 percent VAT without any exemptions. Those are the people who are sitting there. We in the Opposition then advocated for zero VAT on basic food items and the list that we provided in 2018 of 21 food items were copied from our manifesto and implemented before the last elections. That is what they did. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is what the IMF Report is saying. Let me also give other examples of lies. The honourable Lal claimed that the Back-to-School Assistance was started by FijiFirst.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes:</span></p></body>
