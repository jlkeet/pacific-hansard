<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI HON. P. TIKODUADUA. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of the Parliament and my fellow Fijians, I rise to lend my voice to the motion</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 191 put forward by the honourable Prime Minister thanking His Excellency the President for his insightful and forward-looking Address at the State Opening of Parliament. His Excellency’s Speech, rich in vision and aspiration, not only paves the way for our collective endeavours, but also reminds us of the weight of our duties to our beloved nation, Fiji. Speaking to the importance of the role that His Excellency plays, I want to say that in the last 15 months or so, His Excellency has truly lived up to his constitutional mandate to be the symbol of national unity for our nation. Even when things were tough, His Excellency did not waver, he showed true leadership by accepting the elections results, showing us all how much he values democracy and the choice of the Fijian people. It is not easy to stand strong when there are so many voices and pressures coming from different directions, but our President did just that. By welcoming the election results, he did not just follow the rules and the Constitution, he showed us what it means to truly respect and trust the process and the decisions of our nation and her people. This leadership is inspiring, Mr. Speaker, it reminds us that no matter what, we need to stick to our principles like fairness, respect for each other and the peaceful transition of power. These are the things that keeps our country stable and united. Mr. Speaker, in that regard, I also would like to wish to extend my appreciation to the Commander and the Ranks of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, the Acting Commissioner and the Officers of Fiji Police Force, the Permanent Secretary, the Director and the Department of Immigration for their dedication and service to our country. Their commitment to maintaining peace, ensuring security and upholding the law is the bedrock upon which the confident, safety and well- being of our nation and its citizens rest. Mr. Speaker, as announced by His Excellency the President, the National Security and Defence Review is envisaged to be a holistic assessment. It encompasses not only our military capabilities, but also the broader dimensions of security that are pivotal for a peaceful and a prosperous Fiji. This includes economic security, cybersecurity, environmental security and human security with a particular emphasis on alleviating poverty as a means to enhance national stability. This comprehensive review will enable us to identify critical gaps, align our strategies with the best practices globally and tailor our approach to the unique needs and aspirations of our Fijian society. It will serve as a blueprint for transforming our security and defence sectors into agile, forward-looking entities capable of not only deterring threats but also contributing to the holistic well-being of our nation and its people. We understand that a nation’s strength is not solely measured but its military prowess but by the resilience and prosperity of its people. Therefore, the National Security and Defence Review will also explore mechanisms to strengthen social safety nets, promote sustainable development and ensure that every Fijian has the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our nation’s growth. The task ahead is complex and demands a collaborative approach. We will engage with a broad range of stakeholders, including community leaders, international partners and experts across various fields to ensure that the review is comprehensive, inclusive, with our national values and goals. Mr. Speaker, the National Security and Defence Review represents a pivotal step in our journey towards a secure, stable and prosperous Fiji. It is an opportunity to redefine security in a manner that resonates with the needs of our time and reflects our commitment to the well-being of all Fijians. The review team is expected to present its report to Government in August this year and subsequently to Parliament afterwards. As we embark, Mr. Speaker, on this critical review, I seek the support and wisdom of this</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>192 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 esteemed Parliament, especially the Opposition. Together we can chart a course towards a future where security is synonymous with opportunity, prosperity and peace for all of our citizens. Mr. Speaker, the challenges we face today, from transnational crime and drug trafficking to the threats posed by climate change and natural disasters, demand a police force that is not only robust but also adaptable and equipped with contemporary capabilities. The security landscape has evolved dramatically, and so must our responses to these challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hold myself accountable for the current law and order situation in Fiji today, much of which has been inherited from decisions made in the past. The honourable Maharaj yesterday talked about FijiFirst sowing seeds. Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed they sowed many seeds. If FijiFirst wants to take credit for the good and sweet fruits of seeds that they sowed, they must also accept responsibilities for the bad or rotten or sour and poisonous fruits as well that was born out of their administration. The negative fruits of these seeds are what we are contending with today. It is what I am contending with today - drugs, police brutality, unprofessionalism and inefficient administrative processes. All of these are now my responsibility and I have to deal with it, I accept it that it is in now on my lap. It will not change overnight, but I assure Parliament, Mr. Speaker, it will change, it is going to change. Now having said all that, Mr. Speaker, it is our duty as stewards of this nation to look beyond the vestiges of the past and forge a path towards a future where our security apparatus is capable, resilient and responsive to the needs of our time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight a crucial initiative within our Fiji Police Force known as the “Restore Blue Concept”. This innovative approach is aimed at embedding human rights at the heart of our policing efforts. It is about ensuring that every action taken by our police officers aligns with international human rights standards, ensuring that the rights and dignity of every individual and community are respected and also protected. The essence of human rights-based policing is to forge a positive, trust-based relationship between the police and the community that they serve. It is about moving away from any practices that may have previously undermined public confidence in the police such as excessive use of force or human rights violations. These actions not only damage the professional image of our Police Force but also hinder their ability to effectively serve and protect our communities. By adopting the Restore Blue Concept, we are committed to transforming our Police Force. This involves integrating human rights principles into all aspects of Police work, from daily operations to the very ethos that guide our officers. It means reviewing and upgrading even their equipment and facilities to ensure they must meet the high standards required for humane and effective law enforcement, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This initiative is not just about avoiding wrongdoing, it is about actively promoting and protecting the rights of all Fijians which is fundamental to maintaining peace, order and the rule of law in our nation. In echoing the wisdom imparted by His Excellency the President, and drawing upon the lessons of comprehensive security strategies such as those I witnessed in the People’s Republic of China, particularly the emphasis on public security through poverty alleviation. We recognise the intrinsic link between socio-economic stability and national security. The fight against drugs and transnational crime is not a battle that can be won in isolation. It requires a united front, a coalition of efforts across ministries, governmental departments, and, crucially, within our communities. To this end, my Ministry is committed to fostering stronger partnerships with local and international stakeholders, enhancing information sharing and intelligence cooperation, and</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 193 building the capacity of our law enforcement agencies. This collaborative stance extends beyond the confines of traditional security apparatus to encompass education, social services, and economic agencies, recognizing that preventive measures are as critical as enforcement in this enduring battle. Moreover, we must empower our communities to be the first line of defense against these threats. Community policing, public awareness campaigns and engaging with civil society organisations are pivotal in this regard. We aim to not only disrupt the supply chains of drugs and criminal networks but also to address the demand side by providing support, education and rehabilitation services to those affected. The battle against drugs and transnational crime also underscores the need for regional and international cooperation. In a world where threats are increasingly transnational in nature, our security strategies must also be borderless. We will continue to strengthen our ties with the neighbouring countries, international organisations and allies to combat these global challenges together. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to speak a little bit about drugs in particular. I wish to address a pressing concern that threatens the very fabrics of our society - the pervasive issues of drug in Fiji as we have been hearing throughout, particularly from the Opposition for the few days that we have been here. The illicit drug trade is not simply a criminal enterprise. It is a multifaceted scourge that undermines our social, economic and moral structures with a particularly devastating impact on our youth and our children. The infiltration of drugs into our communities has far-reaching consequences. It erodes the potential of our young people, drawing them away from education and productive activities into cycles of dependency and of despair. The allure of the drug trade, with its false promises of quick wealth, ensnares not just individuals but entire families and communities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and lawlessness. Our Government is acutely aware of the gravity of this issue and the need for a comprehensive and multi-pronged strategy to combat it. Our approach is anchored in education, prevention, treatment and enforcement with a particular emphasis on safeguarding our youth and our children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry and the Coalition Government is attacking the national drug problem through a four-pronged strategy: 1. 2. 3. Education and Prevention: We are committed to launching national awareness campaigns aimed at educating our citizens, especially our young people, about the dangers and consequences of drug use and involvement in the drug trade. By strengthening our educational programmes and community outreach, we aim to build resilience among our youth, empowering them with the knowledge and skills to make informed choices. We will seek to partner with other organisations that are already doing this work on the ground. Treatment and Rehabilitation: Recognising the importance of compassion and support in addressing drug dependency, our Government will enhance access to treatment and rehabilitation services. By providing comprehensive care and support, we aim to facilitate the recovery and reintegration of affected individuals into society, offering them a path back to a productive and fulfilling life. Enforcement and Legal Framework: To disrupt the drug trade and hold those responsible to account, we are bolstering our law enforcement capabilities and reviewing our legal framework. This includes enhancing inter-agency cooperation, both domestically and</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>194 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 internationally to effectively tackle drug trafficking networks. Strengthening our legal framework will ensure that penalties for drug-related offences are commensurate with the severity of the crime, serving as a deterrent to potential offenders. On community engagement, the battle against drugs cannot be won by Government action alone. It requires the active participation of our communities. We foster partnerships with community leaders, civil society organisations and international partners, to create a united front against the drug menace. Through these collaborations, we aim to reclaim our communities from the grip of drugs and restore safety and security for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to announce in Parliament that we are working with our development partners to build a specialised Drug and Narcotics Bureau, reporting directly to the Ministry. This new Bureau will, in my intention, be singularly tasked with effective intelligence gathering, prevention and, of course, the prosecution of those who are responsible for this threat in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drug issue in Fiji is a battle that we must fight on all fronts. It demands our collective resolve and a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes and provides suitable solutions. Our Government is fully committed to this fight, for the sake of our nation’s present and future, especially for the wellbeing and potential of our young people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on immigration and border security, as we navigate the complexities of our national security landscape, addressing the challenges of drugs and transnational crime, we must also turn our attention to the pivotal role of immigration in safeguarding our nation’s borders and ensuring the orderly management of people entering and leaving Fiji. In this era of globalisation, the movement of individuals has exponentially increased, bringing forth both, opportunities and vulnerabilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, modernising our immigration technology and processes is not merely an administrative task. It is a critical component of our national security strategy. The advancement of technology in recent years offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and integrity of our immigration systems. By embracing these innovations, we can significantly improve our ability to detect, deter and respond to the potential threats at our borders, while also facilitating legitimate travel and fostering economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to this end, my Ministry is actively pursuing the modernisation of our immigration infrastructure. This includes the adoption of advanced biometric systems, which will enable us to accurately verify the identities of individuals entering and exiting our country. By integrating these systems with international databases and watchlists, we can enhance our screening processes and prevent individuals with known criminal backgrounds from entering our shores. Furthermore, we are committed to upgrading our data management systems to ensure that they are secure, efficient and interoperable with other national and international security databases. This will improve our ability to share and analyse information, enhancing our collaborative efforts with international partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the modernisation of our immigration processes also extends…. MR. SPEAKER.- Please round off, honourable Minister. Are you rounding off now?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> Yes, I am, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 195 By digitising these processes, we can offer more accessible user-friendly services to visitors and potential residents, thereby, supporting our tourism industry and attracting foreign investment. At the same time, streamlined and transparent processes will reduce opportunities for corruption and malpractice, ensuring that our immigration system operates with the highest standards of integrity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the modernisation of our immigration technology and processes is an essential step in our broader security and development strategy. It reflects our commitment to upholding the rule of law, protecting our citizens, and ensuring that Fiji remains a welcoming and secure destination for legitimate travellers and residents. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in weaving together the various strands of our discussion, from fortifying national security and modernising defence capabilities to enhancing immigration processes and tackling the scourge of drugs and transnational crime, it is evident that our collective endeavour is both, complex and critical. Equally important is our unified stance against misinformation, particularly concerning the rise in crime rates, ensuring that our narrative remains anchored in truth and transparency under the Rabuka-led Coalition. Let us not forget that our ultimate goal transcends partisan lines - it is the security, prosperity and wellbeing of Fiji and its people. In this spirit, I extend a hand of collaboration to our colleagues across the aisle, inviting them to join us in this noble pursuit. Together, we can build a stronger, more resilient Fiji, where every citizen feels safe, valued and empowered. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, v inaka vakalevu and thank you for this opportunity to articulate our collective vision and reaffirm our dedication to the betterment of our beloved Fiji and its people. I support the motion by the honourable Prime Minister and thank His Excellency for his most gracious Speech. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Tikoduadua. I can understand where honourable Maharaj is coming from because afterall, you two were buddies at one time. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise to contribute to the debate on the motion in the name of the honourable Prime Minister that is before Parliament, which is to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I just quickly remind the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration that we have no tree that has fruits that are all sweet that we can handover. If you cry about the sour one, it will remain sour. If you add a bit of salt or sugar, you may be able to eat it. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> Sir, instead of complaining, please, do something.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, on the day His Excellency spoke to us, I was reminded of a memory photo on my Facebook page eight years ago in a New Zealand Military helicopter as we were travelling to the devastated areas ravaged by TC Winston to assess the best way we could provide emergency assistance and help those in need. Fiji led by the Government then stood together, united and tackled the huge task at hand, to provide some immediate relief and build back better, and some still ongoing today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, amazingly only a few months later in August of the same year, the nation came together again as one and cheered our Fiji Sevens Team on to its first ever Olympic Goal Medal.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>196 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 During COVID-19, the same happened. We united as a nation, and through some strong decisive leadership by Government then and operators at the operational and tactical level, we came through. The strategy to expose the virus, through testing, eliminate the virus through isolation and vaccinate, worked. We came through and our economy grew. We became the fifth fastest growing economy in the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recall these events to highlight an important, if not, the most important point, at least, in my view, of His Excellency’s Speech to us and, that is, I quote: “As leaders, we are required to leave aside our differences for the common good of our people.” His Excellency, went further to say, and I quote: “We must focus on our shared destiny and commonality rather than our small differences.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted through my recollection of those past events, we, as a nation, have shown that we can do what His Excellency was imploring us to do. We have done so in the past. His Excellency’s Speech to this august Chamber also comes at a time when our nation is facing some major issues. There is an exodus of Fijians from Fiji to other countries overseas seeking employment, education, and there are those who are migrating. There is a general shortage of skilled workers. There is brain drain as well as it was very well articulated by my colleague, the honourable Virendra Lal yesterday. The FijiFirst Government put in place policies to reverse that brain drain and turn it into a brain drain gain where former Fijians can come back and invest in our country. This Government, it looks like it will be brain drain gone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a sharp rise in crime. Drugs is at a crisis level. Yesterday, my colleague, honourable Tuinaceva, highlighted the very unfortunate case of the high number of deaths on our road. The economy is slowing down to 3 percent this year according to IMF. Life is generally hard on the ground. His Excellency’s Speech also comes after a little over one year of the Coalition Government in power. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Coalition Government, it is time for you to defend your record. The only problem is that there is very little record, if any at all, to defend. HON. K. K. LAL.- Shame! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- This must be the reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why they are just trying to lay blame on FijiFirst to cover their doing very little or nothing at all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after listening to the other side for the past two days, it seems that the other side of Parliament interprets working together or walking across the aisle as a ticket to not being criticised. Sadly, I have to remind them that it is not the case. In this, the people’s Parliament, they will be criticized. You will be asked tough questions by us on this side of Parliament and the sole Government backbencher. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- And I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they heard the very wise suggestions from their Government backbencher to them yesterday.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> You worry about your 16 years.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 197 HON. V. NAUPOTO.- It is just too bad, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they wanted to make themselves all Ministers and Assistant Ministers and they missed out on the value of good governance backbenchers. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Absolutely! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you well know, the legislature has an oversight role on the Executive. You are very well aware of this, Sir, and that is why we will never shy away from our job of oversight. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the situation on law and order in the country demands some urgent attention. There is a growing lack of confidence in our Police Force both, in their capacity to do their law enforcement work and on the integrity within the Force. The recent arrests that included serving Police Officers on the allegation of tampering with the recently seized hard drugs kept as exhibits is quite worrying. I fear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is a rot that is setting in the Police Force, and I sincerely hope that I am wrong. If there is a rot, it needs to be fixed quickly because, Sir, to successfully smuggle high value contraband like hard drugs into or through a country, a secret segment of the society is created - the drivers, the transporters, the lookouts, the sellers, the bankers, and when enforcement officers or officials become part of that secret segment of the society, the problem is almost impossible to crush, as he had wanted to do when the drugs were discovered. The honourable Minister’s recent comments in the media that drug networks operated with impurity under the previous Administration is quite irresponsible, given the hard work carried out by the Fiji Police Force over the years to fight drugs. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I call on the honourable Minister publicly and I call on him again here in this Chamber to provide evidence to justify his claim. Let me remind the honourable Minister in this Parliament of some facts in 2019. The Fiji Police Force established the first ever Narcotics Bureau to ramp up the fight against drugs and specialist training was provided to Police Officers to deal with drug-related cases. Capabilities have also been enhanced over the years to assist the Police to combat this drug problem. Anti-Drug operations across Fiji over the years have resulted in the seizure of green and hard drugs worth millions of dollars and the perpetrators have been convicted. According to media reports, in 2019, police uncovered a methamphetamine lab in a nightclub in Nadi. A small-scale methamphetamine lab was also discovered in 2013 and in 2015 in Suva. Way back in 2004, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Police found chemicals big enough to produce 2,200 pounds of crystal methamphetamine in a factory outside Suva. So, I am not so sure where this ‘doing nothing’ in the past is coming from. The fight against drug is and will continue to be an ongoing operation and it will be a big chunk of the Police Force enforcement work. Other countries have taken a step further to set up border force to tackle contraband smuggling.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>198 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 The last thing the Police Force need is political interference, which is very evident right now, and I had call out the honourable Minister for Home Affairs publicly on this issue a few times. The Fiji Police Force and other enforcement agencies need to be resourced, not interfered with. Unfortunately, nothing significant was provided for them in the last Budget. I hope that there will be an improvement in the next Budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the call by honourable Radrodro yesterday to the honourable Pime Minister for Fiji to withdraw its position and its support to Israel’s occupation of and actions in Gaza. This position harms Fiji’s international reputation as a peacekeeping nation that is committed to lasting peace in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our international reputation as peacekeepers is built on the Republic of Fiji Military Force’s professionalism and experience. Our international reputation as a peacekeeping nation is equally premised on our ability to stay neutral in regions where Fijian peacekeepers are deployed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, only by being neutral will we be seen as credible by the parties to the conflict. Some legal scholars describe our submission as overstepping international law. Perhaps, the honourable Attorney-General can enlighten us tomorrow as to who drafted Fiji’s submission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s explicit support to one party to the conflict has diminished and compromised our peacekeeping reputation and high standing not only in the Middle East but worldwide, and especially in the Global South. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted by honourable Radrodro yesterday, Fiji’s stand at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) puts our peacekeepers in harm’s way. Yes, there is always an inherent risk to the lives of peacekeepers when they are deployed to peacekeeping missions, as is well known to the former peacekeepers who are in this Chamber. But taking the side of one party makes you an enemy to the other, and I am talking about the lives of fathers, mothers, wives, husbands, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Some, in this Chamber, might even have close relatives serving in the Middle-East missions right now. My youngest son is currently serving in Iraq. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me turn to something that happened yesterday, and you may have been listening. I was disheartened when after honourable Ketan Lal asked his question to the three Ministers yesterday, the answer came in a form that, sort of, said, ‘how dare you ask that question’. It was followed by a lecture on how he should behave, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those questions where merely questions on transparency and they required simple answers, perhaps, just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’. I am pretty sure that if they had asked the honourable Prime Minister whether they should answer those questions, they would have got a very short and sharp simple military style answer of just saying answer the question and clear your name. By the way, we did not cook up those questions on this side. It came from the people, obviously, those who saw and witnessed and when the people ask, they deserve an answer because transparency is a principle of democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what was even more sickening to me personally yesterday was when honourable Tuinaceva used as an example the words that were spoken publicly in a Government organised public consultation on Local Government on 25 th September, 2023, to highlight the</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 199 problem of racial hatred rearing its ugly head again.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It has nothing to do with the Government:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Make it shown:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> The Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics accused him of inciting racial disharmony. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker wisely ruled against it yesterday:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Very bad! HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I and other honourable Members in this Parliament have seen the result of racial hatred when it manifests into physical violence. Racial hatred is the biggest barrier to harmonious and peaceful coexistence in our multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi- religious nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had warned about racism last year during my Maiden Speech in this Parliament and the incident that honourable Tuinaceva was referring to happened just a few months later. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics can choose to bury his head in the sand and pretend that nothing is happening when it comes to racial hatred and racism, and that does not bother me at all.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not just one way:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> The reason is that, he is only one, there are 26 of us on this side who will fight racism and racial discrimination. We will call it out. We will warn people about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst stands for equal citizenry, and we will continue to fight for equality for all in this Parliament and outside of this Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Order! No banging of the table, please, honourable Members. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the one question that all that voted for us, those who gave us the privilege to occupy the seats we currently occupy, the 42.55 percent of voters who gave us 26 seats, the 8.89 percent of voters who gave National Federation Party five seats…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> 58 percent said, ‘no’.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> …the 35.82 percent of voters who gave People’s Alliance Party 21 seats and the 5.14 percent of voters who gave SODELPA three seats and even those who did not vote, all asked the same simple question; What are you doing to make lives better? And the answer is, given this Government’s one-year record, it is very little to nothing. I am sure that the people are fed up with the rhetoric from the other side that FijiFirst did this, FijiFirst did not do that, and it just goes on and on because there is very little…</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>200 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is the fact:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.:</span> … that the Coalition Government is doing to better your lives.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are fixing your mess:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I will end by echoing to this Parliament, again, the voice of the people. They are asking, what are you doing to make lives better? Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and all those watching online and the television viewers here this afternoon; bula vinaka and good afternoon to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President along with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Education have informed this august Parliament about the commitment of the Coalition Government to education. Today, I stand to reiterate the same message, education is the cornerstone of development in any economy and Fiji is no exception. Please allow me to expand the issues that affect the Ministry of Education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Denarau Declaration emanating from the Education Summit would now form the basis of the future direction of the Fiji education sector. At the heart of that declaration, there are seven thematic areas based on the Terms of Reference of the Fiji Education Commission which has gone through public consultation on Wednesday last week. Based on this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a paper would be drafted to be discussed in Cabinet in the coming days for the roll out of the Education Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second important challenge that awaits our action is to have a home grown education programme that not only induces a strong sense of civic pride, patriotism and productive citizenry but one that also prepares a future workforce to meet the demands of the domestic and international markets here and abroad. We will continue to assist in the process of nation building through education and improving the lives of our fellow kith and kin. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third dimension is improving the actual classroom environment, its physical and social infrastructure pertaining to teaching and learning. This is in ensuring that we have adequate teachers, improve our pupil:teacher ratio, boost student morale, provide for the security of teachers and students and importantly, improve the welfare of those engaged in the process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot the fact that more than 90 percent of our schools are faith-based education institutions. We cannot and must not follow the footsteps of the previous Government in undermining and diluting the foundation values...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.:</span> …of these faith-based schools. The People’s Coalition Government is fully committed in upholding those values and we will support everyone to enhance the same way moving forward. The Coalition Government is on record of living by its noble commitments and in respect of the education sector, our budgetary allocations, pragmatic leadership and steps taken to ensure that we provide education for all, speaks volume about itself. I do not think one needs to belabour this point as teachers and students find themselves in a more free and just</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 201 environment for teaching and learning than the period of cynicism in the last 16 years of the last administration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the regularization as per MCS Circular 2/2024 and 5/2024, we at the Ministry are effectively correcting the irregularities, inhumane, inconsistent and haphazard appointment processes that was implemented by honourable Hem Chand during his term when he was head of Human Resources at the Ministry of Education.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H. CHAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Point of Order.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Point of Order, honourable Assistant Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. H.

H. CHAND.:</span> To you, Sir.</p><p>I think he is misleading Parliament; it is not me. He has mentioned my name. It is the Ministry of Education. He has mentioned my name, he should withdraw that. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Assistant Minister, that Point of Order has been raised on your mentioning his name.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He said he was there before:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, he was at the administrative during that time.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we are now correcting the wrong subject combinations for Head of Department (HOD) appointments. For example, a graduate in Commerce was appointed to HOD Social Science, how was this allowed when there were many others? Secondly, the prolonged acting appointments of officers; officers acting here, there and everywhere. It was like Hollywood and maybe Bollywood. The officers in the last government would be transferred from pillar to post at the whims of Directors like the FijiFirst was doing for the last 16 years. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the removal of three counsellor positions was ill conceived, poorly planned and negatively impacted our children. We are in the process of re- instating the Divisional Counsellors and will introduce counsellors in each of the nine districts and appoint counsellors to the large primary and secondary schools throughout Fiji.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>202 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 We are now also correcting the separation of teacher couples. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue to be inundated with requests to reunite couples and families. The last administration must have had a quota of families that needed to be broken up when they were making appointments within the Ministry of Education. There was also a complete disregard in ensuring ethnic balance in all our primary and secondary schools. Every appointment or suggestion to HR fell on deaf ears. The fact that remains that vernacular must be taught at the primary school level and evidence suggests that those whose mother tongue of the vernacular being taught should be the teachers. In the last administration, I believe the honourable Members on the other side disregarded that when they were in the Ministry controlling from the last 16 years in office. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Another massive exercise that we embarked on is the review of School Classification. I ask the honourable Members in the Opposition, how can an Assistant Principal in a small school with a population of 100 students be paid exactly the same salary as the AP in a large school with a student population of 1,100 students? How was this done? I urge the honourable Opposition Members not to mislead the people of Fiji in this regards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will also be establishing HOD positions in schools. In 2023, we established 60 HOD positions and remunerated them accordingly. This year we will establish approximately185 HOD positions. In the last government, the acting HODs in various schools is an unestablished position where they were doing the work without any remuneration. This is modern day slavery, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry embraces the work before us. We are implementing decisions and plans based on facts and we will continue to do so in line with the policies of our Coalition Government. Another fact that I wish to draw the attention of this august Parliament to, is the Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PILNA) 2021 Report. The PILNA data shows that the score for Year 4 students in 2021 was lower than in the previous PILNA cycle, PILNA 2018. The report also showed that approximately 66 percent of Year 4 students in Fiji, two out of three performed at or above the expected level which is three to eight in the PILNA Report 2021.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Schools were closed- COVID:</span> 19.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.:</span> Conversely, approximately 34 percent of the students, one out of three performed below the expected proficiency level, which is level zero to two. In other words, even though most Year 4 students were meeting the minimum expected level for numeracy but this is a significant proportion (34 percent) who are yet to meet this level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PILNA findings support intervention in Fiji education system with the goal of strengthening our numeracy, reading and writing instruction leading to improved student learning outcomes. Other data sets such as that from the World Bank and our very own Status of Education Report 2023 tell a bleak story. We are actively working on changing this narrative with a clear system, processes, transparency and accountability that is now only seen in our beloved Fiji after 16 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has also invested heavily in the much talked about literacy and numeracy rate in Fiji as revealed by the regional educational authority body in the PILNA results, as mentioned earlier. I would like to reassure this august Parliament that apart from strengthening our Drop Everything And Read (DEAR) programme in school and the reading unit set</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 203 up in the Curriculum Advisory Service, we as a Ministry have also extended investment in the library unit. The Ministry of Education advocates exposure to reading materials at an early age to complement the literacy and numeracy curriculum in collaboration with the Australian Government. We have now ventured into community library. This has begun in a few communities. An example of the success of the partnership with community library is the big improvement in the Year 8 examination results of one of the primary schools in the Eastern Division that was once classified as underperforming school. We will invest in a mobile library that used to be a practice in the past. For the rural communities, we are having community library set up. For our urban students, we will partner with other government ministries and ensure that we provide adequate reading and student support spaces in the local halls and the communities Fiji wide. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the digital world that we are in now, we will need to encourage our children to develop reading habits because most of us sitting in this room will agree with me, and we know too well the benefits of reading and the positive impact it will have on our children who are the future leaders of our nation. I also want to bring to the attention of this august Parliament, the effort that the Ministry of Education is implementing on accessibility to education. The Asset and Infrastructure Services Unit continues to ensure that all schools are either rebuilding or renovating its building adhere to the standard Category 5 disaster resilient structures. Due to climate change, the Ministry has included Disaster Risk and Resilience staff to ensure that the Ministry of Education provides, facilitates and promotes the teaching, learning, administration and management of education in Emergencies and School Based Disaster Risk Reduction Programme in the country in accordance with the Ministry’s policies and guidelines. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues to deliver boats and engines to support student’s transportation to school. Let me enlighten Parliament that the Permanent Secretary visited the school whereby its students were swimming across the flooded river last two weeks ago in the interior of Viti Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bridge…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Assistant Minister, there is a Point of Order. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Standing Order 60 - Relevance. I thought we were answering to His Excellency’s Speech. MR.

KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are here to acknowledge His Excellency’s Speech on last Monday and not a Ministerial Statement to figure out or to outlay a work of a Ministry, please. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Koroilavesau, see we must be happy because he has taken us to Hollywood, Bollywood and now we are coming back. Continue, honourable Assistant Minister.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>204 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continue to deliver boats and engines to support students’ transportation to school. Mr. Speaker Sir, the bridge has been unrepaired since TC Winston in 2016. The FijiFirst Government in 2018 campaigned fervently in this are, they have got the vote but failed again to deliver to the people in the Wainimala areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the visit by the Permanent Secretary of Education and Permanent Secretary of Rural Development and the Ministry of Education officers from the Assets and Infrastructure Unit, we will pursue the building of the bridge and the overall improvement of road infrastructure in this area. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Some populations in that area cross the river 27 times to reach education, market and health services. I wonder how Members from across the floor would fare if they or their children had to cross the cold Wainimala River at least twice a day as early as 5 a.m. to get to work or get to public transportation. I am certain that they would not fare well at all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has invested in the purchase of three tractors supplied to three Government schools to start with. The massive land mass need mechanisation for productivity and savings for those boarding schools. The schools will not only produce its vegetables and root crops to save money but also teach these young people at boarding schools the importance of eating fresh local produce and the importance of the agriculture in our economy as this can be a source of livelihood as well for them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial literacy in the Ministry of Education is one of the eight curriculum perspective in the National Curriculum Framework (NCF). Financial Education is incorporated in English, Math and Social Science at the Primary levels 1 to level 8, at Secondary levels from Year 9 and Year 10 in Commercial Studies and Year 11 and Year 12 in Math, Accounting, Economics and English. Smart with Money Zone Programme, an evolving Ministry of Education Initiative. This is work in progress. The Ministry’s Curriculum Advisory Services (CAS) is working on this project. The programme involves parents creating an account which we call a “Money Zone Account” for their children with a minimum deposit so that the children can start owning an account and managing their own money as they grow up in our beloved Fiji. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is everyone’s business in today’s modern world and we ask the Members of this august Parliament to bring something positive to contribute to accessibility of our education here in Fiji. May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call on the next speaker who is the Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister may I just acknowledge the presence of former Assistant Minister sitting in the gallery, not forgetting the old man from Kalabu behind honourable Aseri Radrodro and Mr. Felix Magnus as well who is the Special Administrator of Nasinu Town Council. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians present here today and those connecting on livestream. I also wish to warmly welcome the Women’s Dorcas Ministry from the Suvavou Village who are here with us this afternoon. Before I begin, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to raise a few issues with regards to what has been raised by the Opposition. I find the intervention by honourable Naupoto very contradictory.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 205 As he had known, that in 2019 the FijiFirst opposed the motion to investigate the causes of the drug problem in Fiji. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Listen, listen! HON. S. TUBUNA.- Following that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, their leader, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama assaulted honourable Pio Tikoduadua, of course most of the Members who are here voted him out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drug problem in Fiji is a direct neglect of the previous FijiFirst Government.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Listen! MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last two days we have heard from the Opposition their very generalist and exaggerated claims of Government to the increase in migration of people overseas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had no clue of what is going on. They have no idea of what is being done in this country. They should be aware that following COVID…. shamefully policies linking MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, let us listen to the honourable Assistant Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, they should be knowing that after COVID-19….</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I am still speaking, honourable Assistant Minister. I said that it is best that we listen first to the honourable Assistant Minister. If you want to make comments just hold it for a while until he finishes. You have had your chance, let us give him the opportunity to present what he has prepared. You may continue, Sir. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, following COVID-19, there was an open market out there in Australia and New Zealand and most of our people migrated because of increased salaries. The Opposition’s claim on the reasons that they have raised with regards to the increased migration is bogus and misleading. Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an issue that was raised yesterday by one of the Opposition Members on the statutes for the Council CEOs. It is essential to clarify that majority of the Council’s CEOs are reaching the end of their term in office and the honourable Minister for Local Government is committed to ensuring a transparent and accountable process for their replacement. To achieve that, the Ministry has meticulously developed the Terms of Reference (TOR) and Expressions of Interest (EOI) for the engagement of a reputable recruitment agency. The Councils will collaborate to oversee this process and upon engaging the recruitment agency, then we will work very closely with the Special Administrators to initiate the recruitment of new CEOs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in this august Parliament to respond to His Excellency the President’s Address. I would like to thank His Excellency the President for his inspiring and thought-provoking</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>206 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Address that was delivered on Monday, 4 th March, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are so blessed in Fiji to have such a high chief of high calibre, na Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata, Taukei Bolatagane”, who has earned the respect of everyone, including the different races that have called Fiji home. In addition, as Members of this august Parliament, we should all continue to strive and be conscious of the need to address the relevant needs of the different races that live in this country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share some of the work that I have been undertaking at the Office of the Prime Minister. When the Coalition Government came into power, one of the saddest things that we noted was the lack of data on where the poor people really live. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was attributed mainly to the previous Government’s inability to provide relevant and reliable statistics on the status of poverty in this country. Certainly, I fully concur with His Excellency the President when he requested us as democratically elected representatives to listen to the voices of the people, not only those who had elected us but all our citizens, young and old, men and women. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we assumed office, we were inundated with calls from some of the poorest communities in Suva, that they needed to be further supported with assistance from Government. Instead of taking a knee jerk reaction, we thought that it would be wise to undertake a detailed survey of these communities. In June 2023, the Office of the Prime Minister engaged the Fiji Council of Social Services (FCOSS) to conduct a survey on 23 informal settlements and poor communities along the Suva- Nausori corridor. The 23 communities are: 1. Narocake; 2. Nukutubu; 3. Kalekana; 4. Manikoso; 5. Bali; 6. Marata; 7. Vataleka; 8. Koio; 9. Korolailai; 10. Wai; 11. Wairua; 12. Naivikinikini; 13. Valenicina; 14. Rewa; 15. Matata; 16. Naikotokoto; 17. Bua 1; 18. Bua 2; 19. Matainiborosisi; 20. Veiraisi; 21. Nabuli Settlement; 22. Naisogowaluvu; and 23. Newtown. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this project, FCOSS went out into these communities to discuss</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 207 and identify their needs, and to conduct community assessments which identified local development challenges. These challenges were grouped into six categories which included the following: Environmental Degradation and Risks; Infrastructure and Safety; Education, Health Services and Leadership; 1. Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); 2. 3. 4. 5. Governance and Social Cohesion; and 6. Economic and Livelihood. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I was briefed on the findings of the Community Assessment Project in December last year, I was deeply troubled and burdened. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would be surprised to note that the data collected from the 23 communities along the Lami-Nausori corridor reflected that some Fijian households lack the most basic of household amenities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have Fijians living just an earshot away from our towns and cities in the Central Division that are still using pit toilets. There are even some households that do not have any toilets and share with their neighbours. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a meeting of the relevant key stakeholders was convened to strategize on how Government could work collaboratively with other NGOs and the private sector to tackle the issues highlighted in the survey. Other issues highlighted is the frequent water disruptions, unhygienic waste disposal, infrastructural issues such as access roads, bridges and health centres, limited access to electricity, social problems like drugs and substance abuse, sex trafficking and crime, security of land tenure and overcrowding, and lack of governance structures in informal settlements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as result of the survey, we have identified two communities - Bilo and Matainiborosisi in Lami, that have been without water for the last 20 years. Despite being 15 minutes from Suva City, they are not connected to any water supply. We then took this matter to the honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services to put these projects into the pipeline. These two communities will have access to regular water by the end of the year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my Maiden Speech last year, I highlighted the need to address the plight of descendants of the Melanesians who are currently living in Fiji, more particularly is to explore how the Government can formalise existing land tenancy to ensure that they have more permanent tenancy arrangements. To this effect, Government has established an Inter-Ministerial Taskforce under the administrative and policy oversight of the Office of the Pime Minister, to oversee and be responsible for the implementation of this initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have started our consultation with the three communities that are in Wailoku, Namara and Matata. We will be finalising the proposal for Wailoku in the next two months. Sir, as for Matata, the land that they are currently occupying is now included as part of Lami Village. MR. SPEAKER. – Please declare your interest, honourable Assistant Minister. HON. S. TUBUNA. - We are indeed thankful to the two Yavusa in Lami – Yavusa Nasevou and Yavusa Nakurukuru, for their generosity in accommodating the Melanesian settlements of Matata.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>208 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the time, we take the generosity of the landowners for granted but they are fulfilling the role that has to be played by Government which is providing land for those who are in need to be resettled. There are so many landowners, particularly in the urban areas of Fiji who, out of their good faith, provided their land to house other communities. These landowners are namely, those from Kalabu, Tamavua, Suvavou, Kuku, Nausori, Namoli, Naviyago, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sad reality is that most of these landowners suffer silently in poverty but they do not admit it. When you talk to them privately, they will say life is difficult, ‘sa rui dredre inaka ’. Sir, Government is hearing their voices, and we will strongly consider establishing a special fund to compensate the landowners for giving their land to be used by other communities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, late last year, the Office of the Prime Minister received complaints from Indo-Fijian families around Suva that youths from squatter settlements are terrorising them and stealing green coconuts from their backyard. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in January this year, the Office of the Prime Minister organised a ‘Green Coconut Replanting Workshop’ at Vakacoko in Naboro, to increase the supply of green coconuts in the Suva-Nausori corridor. This has not been done by anyone, including your Government. (Laughter) HON. S. TUBUNA.- Those youth who were previously terrorising Indo-Fijian families will now be able to access the green coconuts that will be planted there. It is expected that about 10,000 coconut seednuts will be planted at Naboro in the next two years and, of course, we are very grateful to the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways for supplying the coconut seednuts and organic fertilizer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, environmental degradation, particularly soil erosion in rivers and watershed areas, remain to be one of the biggest problems. If you travel around the interior of Fiji, along the Sigatoka River and along the Ba River, you will notice this environmental problem. This problem has been there for more than 20 years but there has been no concerted effort to undertake to rectify the issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has been made worse by the FijiFirst Government when they created the Ministry of Waterways from the Drainage and Irrigation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Previously, they used to have their engineers – Principal Engineers and Senior Engineers. However, when Dr. Mahendra Reddy was the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, he converted all the engineering posts to administrative posts and there is currently no engineering capacity within the Department to execute these responsibilities. This is the legacy of the FijiFirst Government. We have a degraded watershed system and increased soil erosion with increasing flooding in all our towns, and we have very limited capacity for people to design new rivers and watershed areas. Mr. Speaker Sir, some honourable Members in the Opposition have commented on the new National Development Plan that will facilitate practical solutions to the economic and social challenges faced by our people. We, the Coalition Government, will implement this plan to ensure that there is lasting progress. We are going down to communities and consulting with them to solicit their voices. This will be a successful plan, as compared to some of the plans that were formulated by the previous Government. Mr. Speaker Sir, in 2016, the FijiFirst Government formulated a 20-year National Development Plan. If you look at some of the targets that were set, for the annual average growth</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 209 rate from 2016 to 2021, the target that was set was 4 percent to 5 percent, but the actual that was achieved was -1.8 percent. If you look at the Government debt, the target was to reduce to 35 percent of GDP by 2036. The actual that was achieved from 2016 to 2021 was around 60 percent. These figures, again, reveal the poor economic management of the FijiFirst Government. Mr. Speaker Sir, when you pay a visit to Lautoka and Ba areas, one of the common problems highlighted by the community members is the extreme destruction of termites on the structures of their residences. The sad thing about this situation, Sir, is that no one knows anything or how to address it. Most of the information that we receive was from local experts who do not have full knowledge of the technology to address the problem. The Coalition Government, for the first time in the history, is recognising the plight of our communities in Lautoka and Ba, and we have allocated a provision of $3 million to assist in the eradication of termites. We will be providing free baits to those that have shown evidence of termite destruction, and at the same time, those families that earn less than $30,000 can apply for a relief fund of $5,000 to purchase housing materials. Those who have an income less than $50,000 will have access to $2,000, which they can use to purchase housing materials. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I wish to emphasise that this Coalition Government cares for its people, and we will do our utmost best to reach out and directly serve the needs of our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of drugs, the increase in the availability of synthetic drugs such as, Methamphetamine, is a great concern. The recent seizure of large quantities of Methamphetamine has brought home the message that drugs is here to stay. Marijuana is widely available in most of our communities and we should make every effort to address this issue. Unfortunately, for the last 16 years, there has been no new initiatives undertaken to address this problem. When we went around the marijuana planting areas in the highlands of Noikoro, one of the things that they raised is the lack of introduction of alternative crops that they can grow. They have raised this with the previous Government, but it has fallen on deaf ears. In the last few weeks, you might have noted that we have introduced a new crop in Noikoro, which is the planting of coffee. We would like to thank the Indonesian Government for the provision of US$25,000 to support the “Smallholder Coffee Project”. We are going to introduce this in the highlands of Navosa, Savatu, Bukuya, so that people have other alternative crops to plant and, of course, to cultivate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally endorse His Excellency the President’s call to protect and preserve our traditions, culture and language to promote social cohesion amongst the different communities. I totally agree with this, but I certainly believe that we need to enhance the capacity of our communities first. There is a need for strong focus on human and social capital whereby communities are empowered to improve the resilience and livelihoods of their communities. On environment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the wellbeing of the Pacific region continues to be affected and threatened by the impacts of climate change. The Pacific way of life and our cultures have been defined by the climate and our knowledge and experience of how to manage storms and cyclones which have impacted our people for generations. But our resilience is now being tested as the trends and patterns that have defined our experience and knowledge continue to change. We are in the middle of a rising and warming ocean and the implications are no longer subtle.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>210 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this head up on local climate change and national programmes and activities, I wish to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Address in formally opening Parliament. I fully support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- We shall now press on, honourable Members. We have three more speakers and after we finish, you can probably have a relaxed time and enjoy your tea break. Thank you. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery, viewers who are listening in on television, tuning in live on the Parliament livestream, and fellow Fijians; ni sa yadra inaka saka and a very good afternoon to you all. I also wish to greet the people of Ra in the usual greetings of the Ra-ssians, “ Sa yadra ”, either in the daylight or moonlight. Au vakayadra ‘iko yani ena vanua o Ra - ena vanua va’uraga o Saivou, Rakiraki, Nakoro’ubu kei Nalawa. Ni sa yadra, ni ma’a vinaka mai. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make my contribution to His Excellency the President’s most gracious Address, allow me to offer my condolences to the passing away of the late Ratu Osea Kasami, Na i 'aukei Nacokula, the Chairperson of the Bose Vanua o Ra, who was laid to rest at his village in Dranivau last Saturday. I also wish to offer my condolences to the Mata Ni Tikina o Rakiraki, Mr. Senitiki Vunisa, who was also laid to rest last week at his home island in Malake. Both gentlemen are very reliable, influential and true sons of Ra. Drau qai vano iko ena vakacegu na i ‘aukei Nacokula. Vinaka saka vakalevu na cola‘i ni ‘avi ni vanua saka va‘uraga o Ra. I rise today to thank and deliver my response to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, Na Gone Turaga Bale Na Tui Macuata, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere’s most encouraging and inspirational gracious Opening Address of the 2024 Session of Parliament. His Excellency made some very important points, the most important of which was unity and putting national interests above political gain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would say that the Speech by His Excellency was fitting to the vision of the high office and, that is, to be the pillar of national unity. It had encouraged and also advised us leaders of this Parliament on how to conduct ourselves in the coming year and also what our people are expecting from us as national leaders to be doing for the national good, public good, as well as those who look up to us as leaders. His most gracious Speech called for unity and also talked about wisdom as leaders, that we must possess in making deliberations and comments which we, as influential figures in the society, have power in our words and actions that people will learn from us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am at pains to see that sadly, tribalism and egoism have been at the forefront of national politics and governance by so called leaders over time who, instead of carrying out the crucial business of nation-building, they have contributed instead to tearing down peace, unity and stability because for them, their own status, their own pockets and their own families have been more important than that young person, young mother, farmer or villager who needs assistance and who went to the polls because they trusted that we would get to this august Parliament and be true to our words to look after their needs. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many of us get into Parliament and never go back to see the people who gave us their votes. Many of us engage in lies during election campaigns and we get votes using</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 211 misinformation and disinformation and these distortions confuse our vulnerable voters to vote for leaders who are only seen during election campaigns and disappear into the forest for the next four years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the business of entering Parliament must be a noble job. We should be role models to aspiring politicians who will come and stand in this very place where I am standing and advocate for the ordinary person on our streets and in our communities. Like the words of His Excellency, and I quote: “I look upon the honourable Members of this august Parliament, I am humbly reminded of the immense responsibility that comes with representing the diverse voices and aspirations of our people. As democratically elected representatives, I ask that you listen to the voices of our people, not only those who elected you, but to all our citizens young and old, men and women.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must do away and denounce those politicians that tear down peace, unity and stability in this august Parliament. We must denounce the personalisation of attacks against other politicians, especially uncalled attacks against our women who are already marginalised in a predominantly patriarchal society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to comment on a few areas of Government that we need to put right, improve on and to develop new ideas for the betterment, progressive and prosperous Fiji. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my province of Ra, there are issues that need to be addressed to assist our people economically, socially and politically. These needs range from infrastructural needs to education and social welfare, and these are very crucial issues which Government is obligated to address. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, the cost of living is a crisis around the world right now and Fiji is no exception. I ask the Government to do something to moderate the high cost of living as the grassroot people and low earning families are being impacted by policies formulated by this Coalition Government. Coming from the interior and isolated place in Fiji, life is very expensive, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I ask the Government to consider options such as companies need to share the burden of high prices on consumers by reducing their profit margins, which could mean putting more items under price control. I advise the Government to do less talk and more action, as currently we are seeing more talk and no action. (Chorus of interjections) Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for electricity needs, five villages along the Nasau Road Access in Nalawa, Ra, namely Sawanivo, Nasau, Ovalau, Nubumakita and Nukulau are requesting Government if it is possible to consider giving them EFL power by connecting electricity from the already existing EFL grid. We are also requesting EFL electricity supply to be supplied to the following settlements - Naqaqa, Onabua, Nukulevu and Nasele. The Nasau hospital is located at this place, together with the newly established Nasau Secondary School and the facilitation of electricity to the people and students of Nasau will transform their lives forever.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>212 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Honourable Tuisawau and honourable Vasu had recently visited the Nasau District in the interior of Ra, and I am sure, with the honourable Minister’s concurrence, such a gesture would go a long way in uplifting the lives of our people who will appreciate the Government that is responsible for their needs. On that same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also looking forward with anticipation to telecommunication and internet coverage in blackspot areas in Ra, particularly the Nasau and Nailuva Districts where students and teachers continue to climb mountains in order to send emails or to access internet for school projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also requesting the Government through the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection to consider constructing an Artefacts and Handicraft Centre in Rakiraki to assist and empower women in Ra financially as there are less employment opportunities in Rakiraki Town. These issues have been raised mainly at the Ra Provincial Council, and I do hope honourable Minister for Women, that one day the Government will consider this request. I also ask the Government to consider expanding the Ra Maternity Hospital in Navunibitu. Honourable Minister for Heath, this hospital was established in 1970 serving coastal and interior communities in Ra with the aim of reducing child mortality rates and improving health care of the expecting mothers. Around 150 to 200 deliveries are done at the facility per year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of bridges, we are requesting the Government to seriously consider the following existing bridges in Ra, as it has affected the transportation of school children and the people. The Raravou Bridge in Nailuva which was washed away during TC Winston in 2016 and the Waimari Bridge which was washed away during TC Yasa in 2019. I am also asking the Government to consider looking at the Vatukacevaceva, Natabu and Drana Bridges, including a new request or proposal for the construction of Nakorovou and Toki Village Bridges in Nakorotubu as school children have to cross these rivers in order to catch their transport to go to school. School children and people in these areas are stranded for long hours and at times with wet clothes, reaching home late in the night or in the wee hours of the morning, waiting for the water level to recede in order to get home due to poor bridge conditions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Sugar this morning (unfortunately he is not here), that they are still considering whether to build a full operational sugar mill or just a juice extraction mill in Ra. This is the same old idea he proposed last year, yet no action has been taken. I wish to advise the honourable Minister for Sugar that the people of Ra are expecting a fully operational sugar mill and not a juice extraction factory as that was the promise made by certain Coalition partners, honourable Prime Minister. The construction of this intended fully operational sugar mill as promised, will help local residence with employment opportunities and our farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on the call by His Excellency in the fight against crime and drug trafficking. The illegal narcotics and methamphetamine use amongst youths is a concern in Fiji. The distribution of hard drugs had spiralled out of control and is a far bigger disaster than climate change. Month after month, it is either marijuana seizures or arrests over possession of illicit drugs, none more dangerous than the highly addictive illegal crystal methamphetamine, a strong drug that affects the central nervous system, and the one that is widely distributed throughout the country and the Pacific region. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions estimated that funds from illicit drug activities were more than $10 million annually and that local traffickers could make between $5,000 a day from the sale of cocaine and methamphetamine in the domestic market.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 213 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji continues to fight the war on drugs since 1980s and recently hard drugs are now more easily available on the streets in major towns and cities. Increasing news coverage on the use and sale of hard drugs in Fiji, particularly methamphetamine, has brought to light the need to raise awareness on the dangers and prevalence of illegal narcotics and methamphetamine use among youths. Tragically, our worst fears in iTaukei villages is that methamphetamine or ice is easily accessible as lollipops, which means our children and youths are being viciously targeted by unscrupulous drug kingpins. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force could not tackle the illegal drug trade alone, and aside from law enforcement partners in Fiji and the region, community support is needed through the sharing of information to be able to disrupt these illegal networks and safeguard our communities from the devastating impact of illicit drugs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also ask the newly established Great Council of Chiefs (Bose Levu Vakaturaga) to urgently look into a solution to drug trafficking as majority of those involved are iTaukei youths who are unemployed in our cities and towns. Provisions should be made by the Bose Levu Vakaturaga and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs in trying to shift unemployed youths back to their villages to utilise their idle land to earn a living. I am also calling on the Judicial Officers to pass higher sentences for hard drug offences as a deterrence to the offender and other persons from committing similar offence and the protection of the community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue our journey towards 2024, we must always stop to give thanks for the many blessings that God has bestowed upon us. We must show gratitude for what we have. Despite our challenges, we are abundantly blessed. Never take anything for granted. Give thanks for each breath of life, each sunrise and each sunset. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that together we can take our nation to new heights. We will be united and we will be a nation that will stand forever more. May God bless this nation for us all. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka, honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu – the land of the Ra-ssians. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and members of the public in the public gallery, dou bula maleka na marama mai Nadonumai. Vinaka vakalevu nomudou yaco tiko mai. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address the motion before this esteemed Parliament and extend my gratitude to His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech on 4 th March, 2024 marking the formal Opening of the 2024-2025 Parliament Session. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President spoke eloquently on the infrastructure sector particularly on the plans moving forward. Infrastructure, as we are aware serves as the foundation of the nation's economic growth and development. It encompasses a wide range of physical structures, facility systems that support and enable economic activities. Before responding on areas highlighted by His Excellency the President, please allow me to briefly touch on significant changes the Ministry have made in the past year or so when the Coalition Government came into power. A significant critical issue is good governance and change management. These are two areas which we focused on and started off in the Ministry. By way of definition, governance encompasses the system by which an organisation is controlled and operates, and the mechanisms by which it, and its people, are held to account. This was very critical for the Ministry given its size, the services it</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>214 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 delivers and also the significant budget it is allocated with. Most importantly, services provided by the Ministry has direct impact on the livelihood of people and development. Mr. Speaker Sir, with the sorry state of our national infrastructure both in urban and rural areas, the need for change cannot be overstated. In terms of governance, the appointment of the new Boards for all Commercial Statutory Authorities under the Ministry is an effort to set a new strategic direction. In the process, the Board have also unearthed governance issues from the FijiFirst Government. The finding is a testament of poor governance by the previous government which shows lack of accountability, lack of transparency, conflict of interest and ineffective Board members. This also calls for a major overhaul of the governance system and setup by the FijiFirst Government. A specific example of the FijiFirst failure, corruption and mismanagement is the Fiji Roads Authority. The new Board of FRA was appointed in April 2023 and they immediately identified systems and governance breakdowns and a huge cash flow crisis that was crippling FRA. Fiji Roads Authority had fully utilised its 2022-2023 Budget allocation within five months by 31 st December, 2022 without any capital expenditure funds for the remaining seven months. The Board had literally no capital funds to operate since its appointment. This was worsened by huge FRA arrears owing to contractors. Apart from the extensive damages caused by delayed maintenance in the road infrastructure in the whole country, contractors, suppliers, key services providers had not been paid when we came in since January 2023. Some workers had to be laid off. This cash flow crisis had a significant impact on the delivery of services by FRA with mounting public complaints and outcry due to the continuing deterioration of road systems. The Board had no choice but to take immediate steps to address the crisis by its line Ministry under the Ministry of Finance in terms of securing overdraft facilities and paying off arrears to contractors amounting to $40 million. Contractors were able to be mobilised from May 2023 to-date throughout the year enabling us to catchup on delayed works. This also required the commissioning of a Special Audit for the three-year period from July 2020 until the same month in 2023 which revealed the total cost of variations and escalation totalling $405 million. These variations were largely facilitated and approved by the former FRA Board, with concurrence of the Minister of Everything. This is a very significant amount and exceeded the annual capital budget approved for each of these three years and is equivalent to about 10 percent of the national budget. Other findings include: 1. Preliminary and feasibility studies were not carried out; 2. Changes in project scope after tender was awarded and fresh tender was not called for significant changes; 3. Inconsistencies noted in cost escalation formulas; 4. Retention Funds owed to contractors were utilised by the Authority due to its cash flow crisis; and 5. There was no specific allocation or budgets for emergency works. Some specific examples, for the Nadi Four-Lane Upgrade, the original contract was $65 million, project completion of $116.8 million, cost overrun $50.9 million. It should be noted that the Office of the Auditor-General in its 2018-2019 Report stated that Fiji Roads Authority paid $623,250 for bouganville plants without a proper tender as stipulated in Fiji Roads Authority Procurement Procedures where purchases of over $100,000 should be tendered. In terms of the Queen Elizabeth Drive from $61.9 million, this escalated to $65.7 million, acost overrun of $3.7 million. This Queen Elizabeth Drive project general coincided with the sale of</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 215 State tiri land in Nasese initiated by the FijiFirst Government with zero consultation with current residents and the Tui Suva and his people. This is a total disregard of the key stakeholders. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The State tiri land were eventually leased by the FijiFirst Government to Punjas and Tian Lun Investments Pty Limited who indicated that they would invest $600 million for a major hotel and high-end residential complex. Previous Cabinet decisions had specifically decided that these tiri lands were for State use for a good reason, given its location but this was denied by the FijiFirst Government. Tian Lun was registered on 13th September, 2018 by a Chinese National as sole shareholder. At one point the shareholding value changed from $6 million to $250,000. He did not file any annual returns between 2016 and 2022 and did not file a scheme plan or start work within 12 months as required. The company profile is totally dubious and due diligence by FijiFirst Government just failed. The question is, why did not the FijiFirst Government cancel the development lease when conditions of the lease were not fulfilled in first 12 months? Was the Queen Elizabeth Drive project of $65.7 million for these two businesses, one of which ended in failure? What was this project for? (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- This 4.25 kilometer road cost $15.4 million a kilometer. Imagine how many rural roads, bridges where children and villagers are still struggling, we would have fixed with the $65.7 million. Such developments are criminal, as Queen Elizabeth Drive could have been upgraded with $10 million.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Go and see the photos:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The Coalition Government will not allow such blunders and dubious developments:</span> (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, His Excellency the President in his Speech encouraged the need to invest in robust and resilient infrastructure.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You should be Minister for Photos:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- While there are works funded through the Government budget, FRA acknowledges the assistance from development partners. The Ministry through FRA has utilised a total of $270.7 million across the three Divisions in 2023, including 526 roads as part of the Rip and Remake Programme and also spanning 300 kilometers in length. It has accelerated the Pothole Repair Programme, so if you move around, you will notice a 70 percent reduction compared to when we came in December where there were potholes everywhere. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>216 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- There is emphasis on Climate Resilience Road Project, for example, a prolonged much needed project is the Toga Bridge which was commissioned at the beginning of this year after long delays by the FijiFirst Government probably because they were not FijiFirst voters.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- They have been disconnected from the main road network during heavy downpour and high rainfalls. There are other low lying areas which have been neglected with sea level rise and poor drainage systems. I thank the honorable Minister for Agriculture for the revival of the Drainage Boards:</span> These are areas such as Cautata which have not been touched on in the last 30 years and it continues to flood, so we taking action on that. In terms of the Fiji Transport Infrastructure Restoration Project, we acknowledge the assistance of the Australian Government Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, a total package of $117 million supporting the Fiji Roads Authority in the renewal or resealing. We have also secured progress with our development partners such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and others for the design and due diligence for the additional 40 bridges and three jetties. The Coalition Government has also signed an Agreement with the People’s Republic of China for a $300 million road upgrade in Vanua Levu which will benefit thousands of Fijians in terms of improved access to schools, health facilities, businesses and markets. This will involve sealing 82 kilometers in Natewa West Coast, Nabalebale, Naviavia, Dawara and Nabouwalu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking of rural roads and connecting the unconnected, the re- establishment of the Public Works Department remains a priority and this is strategically driven by the incoming Permanent Secretary. The Ministry has taken some proactive measures in purchasing necessary machines as part of the $5 million allocated for the financial year and this has gone through the Tender Boards. The dismantling of the PWD by the FijiFirst Government is a national disaster of major proportions. (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Government facilities have deteriorated in the last 16 years under FijiFirst. Just go around the country and look at the PWD depots, government quarters, hospitals and others. Sir, PWD teams used to man the CWM Hospital, Government House and Parliament on a 24-hour basis, just imagine and you dismantled that, this was taken away by you. (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The Department of Government Buildings and Architects have completed a draft National Building Code which will undergo further consultation with some key agencies. The Department continues to service the Ministry and Government in terms of scoping, drawing and costing of new government buildings and maintenance. We have also initiated meetings with the Ministry of Health regarding CWMH and plans are in place to immediately start upgrading within the next two to three weeks. There was a question on why was the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) created and shifted from PWD? If you analyse the Office of the Auditor-General’s Report, there was basically no basis for it, no technical basis or professional basis for moving away the technical people from</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 217 there into that office. The conclusion is, when you look at the contractors they hired or engaged, most of them are in the list of the FijiFirst finances. (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of circulation of public funds - robbing Peter to pay Paul to finance the FijiFirst. (Chorus of interjections) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- When FijiFirst dismantled the PWD, 108 assets worth $8.6 million were transferred out. This included backhoes, graders, cranes, tip trucks, land cruisers, et cetera. So, I am asking where are they because I do not see any sign of them. In terms of rural roads and bridges, these are in a deplorable state as mentioned by the honourable Member from Ra and we continue, as you can see in terms of maintaining that upgrading with the budget we have. We are doing our best in terms of current resources, but it is not enough. In this regard, let me reassure, honourable Ratu Niudamu that we have visited that areas he has mentioned including crossing flooded streams. I am not sure whether some of them have cross flooded streams. (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Those will be addressed soon including Energy Fiji Limited contractors who are now working in Navosa, after that they will come to Nasau. The Coalition Government is doing its best. We are undergoing as a matter of priority a scoping, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the rural bridges and roads in terms of looking at a mix of financing from the regular budget and also there have been discussions with development partners in terms of progressing that as a project itself. Given the ongoing challenges faced by our villagers and the need to ensure our rural life remains attractive, rural infrastructure upgrades remain a high priority for the Coalition Government. In terms of the employment they have spoken about, most of the movements overseas, they started it with the Labour Schemes and now they are complaining about it. When it was initiated, it was meant for those who were farmers in the villages but unfortunately there were some skilled Fijians who went in that Scheme. So, that is the area which is currently being addressed. Finally, I was shocked when a claim by MWH now Stantec, a road engineering services engaged after PWD was dismantled landed on my table amounting to $23.8 million for services from 2014 to 2016. HON. P. K. BALA.- Are you making a Ministerial Speech? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Why should the people of Fiji pay for a FijiFirst Government blunder? Why should we pay? If I had my way, the FijiFirst Party and its officials should be surcharged. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>218 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, $23.8 million divided by how many of you? We deduct it from your pay. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This is a direct consequence:</span></p><p>His Excellency the President also addressed water and sanitation and, of course, this is ongoing. We have continued to progress that and push for that in terms of urban water projects. The connecting households.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- No water:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Rural Water Projects:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No water in Tacirua:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.-These projects have benefitted thousands of households and some of the notable Rural Water Projects were just commissioned in Nasaibitu, Tailevu, Fulton Primary School, Ra and Maumi. However, one thing I have noticed is that when developments happen, the villages who are near those developments have not been connected. So, I am asking what were they doing in the last 16 years? We have worked hard in terms of that. The honourable Assistant Minister has mentioned the Bilo Water Project, we have moved that forward. In terms of Momi Village where the Marriot Hotel is located, that was just left aside. So, a lot of that has now being brought forward. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I visited Vusama Village in Natadola. There are few villages and settlements there, they are still unconnected but we are now working on that. You regularly repeat that we are not doing anything. As I mentioned here, these are just a few. There are hundreds of other projects, Sir. They are working day and night to complete it. Water is a basic need and we need to push on with it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is another one which was neglected, the Denarau Island Wastewater. In the last 16 years, despite the increasing number of hotels there, they have not done anything to expand the capacity until the systems started breaking down. Thank you to honourable Minister of Finance for agreeing to the financing of that, even though it will be more than $10 million, so we will stagger that out. That was a major disaster. You nearly destroyed the tourism industry, but luckily we came in. (Laughter) If there was no change of government, the whole economy would have collapsed. Water catchment roads from Vaturu to Nasealevu were in a deplorable state. We could not even go up, so I do not know what was happening.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Too much talk:</span></p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 219 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- When we went to do our sevusevu in Nagado Village, they were really happy and they said, “You are the first Government Minister for us to see in 20 years.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- They lied to you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I do not know whether they lied to me or not, but I know they were telling the truth. (Laughter) On water catchment leases, again, these are areas which need to be rationalised. Some are there and some have not been transferred to Water Authority of Fiji. Thank you to my predecessor and the FijiFirst Government who have been working on that. Of course, I have to mention the Viria Water Project. As a Government, we do not run down the other Opposition. (Chorus of interjections) As honourable Members and an honourable Government, we acknowledge that project which is a major project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity in support of the honourable Prime Minister’s motion that this Parliament thanks His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before Parliament. Over to last few months, I was grateful to have had the chance to meet so many of our fellow Fijians to hear their stories and to understand their concerns. Their input has been invaluable in shaping our platform, and we will continue to listen to their needs and concerns as we take on the responsibilities of public office. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a democratic society, the Opposition plays a crucial role in holding the Government accountable and ensuring that the interest of all citizens are represented in the decisions made by those in power. I am honoured to be part of this vital function and we are committed to using our voice to fight for a better future for all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President, in his Speech, reiterated that to revitalise the sugar industry, a number of initiatives have been developed to increase cane production to 1.8 million tonnes in the 2024 season, compared to 1.6 million tons in 2022. To support the diversification within the industry, alternative livelihood programmes will be developed to augment farmers’ income against world market price fluctuations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s sugar industry supports the livelihood of thousands of Fijians - the benefit of cane growing standards beyond the fields and crushing mills. The industry drives rural development such as upgraded rural roads, giving farmers access to agriculture inputs and machinery for their farms, and access to markets, urban centres, schools and health services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to increase cane production, the honourable Minister for Sugar needs to work in collaboration with the existing sugarcane farmers, and at the moment, such is not happening. The honourable Minister should respect the sugarcane farmers of Fiji.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>220 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Hear, hear! HON. V. PILLAY.- In nearly all the consultations done so far by the honourable Minister last year and this year, farmers are very disappointed. According to the farmers, the honourable Minister quickly reverts on defending mode, starts finger-pointing and creating argument with the respected farmers. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! HON. V. PILLAY.- I wish to remind the honourable Minister that he must remain courteous and maintain professionalism at all times, as he is the executive arm of Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the farmers are over 50 years old and even with sickness, they do their farm work seven days in a week to keep the industry going. But here is a Minister, in Fiji’s history, that does not have any respect and regard for these hardworking farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wisht to remind Parliament and take on a flashback to the Maiden Speech by the honourable Minister where he said, and I quote: “Our approach is bottoms up and people centered and not bottom down of model imposition. We are here to serve and not to be served. We are here to be directed by the people and not to dictate them. We are here to listen and no to lecture.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is just doing totally the opposite of this. Therefore, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to sack the honourable Minister for Sugar if he wants a better vibrant future for our beloved sugar industry. (Laughter) Under the leadership of the honourable Minister for Sugar, cane production will never increase as he is daydreaming that only he can improve the sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the additional guaranteed price of $6.38, the Coalition Government has failed to mitigate inflation, high cost of living, hidden costs in hiring of labourers, food costs in the camps, transportation costs of bringing the labourers and sending them back after harvesting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a $1 per tonne was given to the farmers who are part of the manual gang, last week. This was assured by the honourable Minister but was delayed. However, farmers are yet to receive a $5 per tonne on extra tonnage, compared to 2022 season. This is yet to be paid as this was another promise to the farmers by the honourable Minister. I urge him to fast-track the process and pay the farmers as promised as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, the farmers had to pay an average extra of $10 per tonne more to the labourers for harvesting that brought the overall amount to close to $30 per tonne. In the 2023 season, all these costs I have stated earlier on has surpassed $50 per tonne for manual gang, leaving aside the production cost. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the 2024 season, farmers are anticipating that these figures will increase. With the increase in VAT, rising food costs and other associated hidden costs, farmers will basically be left with nothing. The truck drivers, owners, cane cutters are all affected because of the rising costs.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 221 Mr. Speaker, Sir, when world price was all time low, the FijiFirst Government gave a guaranteed price of $85 per tonne. Now, since there has been an increase in the world sugar price and with farmers struggling with high costs of production and high cost of living, I challenge the Coalition Government to give the farmers a guaranteed price of $110 per tonne. That will sustain the farmers for the next three years. Also, this was promised to the farmers by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance during the Election campaign and I hope he will stick to his promise. This will greatly assist in mitigating high costs associated with cane farming, as I have stated earlier on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now is the time for the Ministry of Sugar to revamp the mills, repair the rail trucks, railway network, install new cage bins, service the constant out of order tractors so that during the harvesting season and after, farmers are not affected. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the brink of harvesting, then the cane access roads are upgraded which frustrates the farmers. Therefore, I am pleading with the honourable Minister for Sugar that his Ministry must plan well ahead in advance in terms of maintenance of cane access roads and shallow crossings. I urge him to work closely with the Cane Access Road Committee in ensuring that these roads are ready well before the harvesting commences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have dwelled at length only about the sugar industry for the simple reason and, that is, during my visits to the farmers, these are the issues that have been brought up to my attention by the farmers. And as a sugarcane farmer myself I am well aware of the hardship we all face. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Coalition Government, in particular, the honourable Minister for Sugar to work hand in hand in keeping the sugar industry afloat and must work in collaboration with the stakeholders and give much needed respect, care and assistance to our beloved sugarcane farmers of this nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the adherence of the Constitution and the doctrine of the separation of powers, the honourable Attorney-General has a lot of influence in the chaotic appointments in the legal fraternity, which were made contrary to conditions stipulated in the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Leader, Mr. Bainimarama, and former General Secretary, Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum, have suffered greatly in the political persecution initiated by the honourable Attorney-General and the Coalition Government. I suggest that they stop preaching to us in Parliament and quoting from the Bible, but start practising what Christianity actually teaches and what Jesus Christ had practised in life. This is the more reason that the honourable Prime Minister should remove honourable Turaga and put someone with integrity, work ethic and who can abide by the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, what is the use of these Boards he says were created to listen to the public, when none of the honourable Ministers have been answering their phones? If they had listened to the public, they would have taken away the 6 percent VAT and replaced the tax deduction to the rich Fiji Water company.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N.

With more than a year, there is no improvement on the roads, to be honest, in regards to all rural roads, the roads in the urban and peri-urban areas. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> Yes, because he is not doing his job.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.:</span> Because of the road conditions, the people are also suffering, apart from the cost of living, the rise in inflation, et cetera. So, I will request the honourable Minister to stay back in Fiji for a while, please, do not go out. Stay back in Fiji, move around and fix all the roads. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.:</span> No water at Nasinu, honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, he should be the next one to be sacked.</p><p>(Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, the road from Naqalotu to Tawava and to Lomati Road to join the road from Daviqele is yet to be completed. This is in Kadavu. Mr. Savenaca has been texting and asking me to ask the honourable Minister to, please, stay back in Fiji and complete this road. The first cut of this road was done by FijiFirst and now this road is overgrown. Can the honourable Minister, please, complete this road? Once this road is completed, the roads South of Kadavu from Vunisea, will be done. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration on his talk on drugs. This would be a very good time to test all the honourable Members of Parliament do that we can give our people the confidence that we do not indulge in the taking of drugs, as he has said. (Laughter) We should fight this danger on all forms. Sir, I would also like to ask him, how many seeds did he plant when he was in government?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He ran away because the seeds were budding:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, His Excellency also spoke about leadership and our observation is that, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation and Acting Minister for Education has betrayed his own colleague by taking up the education ministerial portfolio… (Laughter) …and we are happy to hear the contribution made by honourable Radrodro compared to the honourable Minister’s. We can see a new SODELPA for the 2026 Elections under honourable Radrodro as Party leader. The old politicians that damaged SODELPA over the years are slowly resigning one by one. Honourable Gavoka’s Party leader term will expire this month.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 223</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Point of Order, honourable Member. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Standing Order 60 – Relevance. Whilst the honourable Pillay’s utterances are somewhat entertaining, he is meandering right away from His Excellency’s Speech. He started talking about the inner works of SODELPA. Mind your own business, honourable Pillay. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Hogwash! MR. SPEAKER.- Relevancy. Before I give the okay, he has finished talking. (Laughter) Allow the Speaker to look into the Standing Order that has been highlighted or quoted so then I would be able to make a Ruling, whether you continue or you will be asked to just resume your seat. But this one here, as we have done quite cleverly, I will ask honourable Viam Pillay to continue and be mindful. You have sacked so many people now. (Laughter) HON. V. PILLAY.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation and Education’s party leader term will expire this month, and it is time to elect a young model leader, like honourable Radrodro. (Laughter) HON. V. PILLAY.- In FijiFirst, our leaders have our support, and they will never betray us, while the SODELPA leader has thrown one of his own members under the bus. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, FijiFirst did not run on dictatorial rules in the past, as stated by honourable Members. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. PILLAY.- FijiFirst has strong decisive leadership, that leadership would get rid most of your problems which this Government is facing in five minutes. No dilly-dally, in five minutes, honourable Members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity and I hope this Government will consider the Opposition’s criticisms as constructive which can be a catalyst for all positive change. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Pillay. You have been a long serving Member, your words are not really full of wisdom, but I thank you for your contribution. Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today and I thank you all for your contributions. I now adjourn Parliament until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 4.34 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76</p></body>
