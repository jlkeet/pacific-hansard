Back-to-School Assistance was a new initiative of the Coalition Government:</span> In the last two years we have allocated almost $100 million.

I would ask him to provide the evidence:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That was a COVID-19 assistance; he is lying. This is back to school. Before the children went to school, a month before, this is a new initiative announced by the honourable Prime Minister. Let me also talk about the cost of living. You are a joke, honourable Usamate.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Brutal cost of living:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koya. APoint of Order, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise under Standing Order 74(1)(a). This is specifically with respect to practices in Parliament. The honourable Minister has been in Parliament for many years, I think he should withdraw. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Are you hard of hearing Sir? I just said Standing Order 74(1)(a) - Practices of Parliament. Please Sir, can you refrain from referring to another honourable Member like you just did. I would like that withdrawn, Madam Deputy Speaker. He is a senior Member and a former Minister, it would be nice. We can go on back and forth, honourable Minister but not in the way you just did. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Withdraw!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, they learn to take it as well, let me.</p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, if I may just say something right now. I really do not want to waste Parliament’s time. I have heard some words from this side of Parliament addressed specifically to a Member on this side of Parliament and I would like that to stop, honourable Usamate. Please let us just respect each other and let us carry out the debate as asked of us by His Excellency the President. Vinaka vakalevu.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C.

Let us just continue with the debate, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p><p>As I have said at the beginning, I expected this. Let me just continue to talk about the cost of living. The IMF Report on the level of inflation is very clear and let me just point this out to them. The continued reference and continued misinformation about the cost of living, when honourable Premila Kumar was speaking the other day and honourable Nand was talking about the farmers and housewives, one of the farmers from Ba messaged me and this is what he said, “Tell them, prices of flour gone down from $22 for 10 kilogrammes to $15; rice price for 10 kilogrammes has gone down from $25 to $19. Seems they not doing shopping that is why they….”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They must be going to expensive shops:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- There is a sale in that supermarket:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not with flour and rice:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- As we have said, as the Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve Bank of Fiji have said inflation was 5 percent in 2023. In January it has gone down to 3.6 percent. The trend is very good. The impact of a VAT increase from 9 percent to 15 percent on some of the household items apart from the basic 21 food items was temporary. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Opposition completely ignores the measures that we put in the budget to help those …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It only offsets:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> …who needed them. As I said almost $100 million in the last two years has gone to more than 60,000 families…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Vinaka:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … and their children to prepare them for back to school support.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>182 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 The Social Welfare, Madam Deputy Speaker, was increased by $15 and $25. We increased budget for health services, kidney dialysis, agricultural subsidies; all these came through the revenue that we collected. The other important point that I want to make, this is one of the most famous and most well- articulated lie in this Parliament over the last two days. This is about the Tertiary Education Loans Scheme (TELS) write-off. The $650 million write-off has taken away the burden from 53,000 families and their children. These students who came out with a debt burden of $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 and $50,000 depending on the duration of the course, were burdened with making the repayment while they were working. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- That is right! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That income has gone back to the families and is now with them.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Girmit:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- One innovation we brought and this was an idea from our Coalition partner SODELPA and very important is that the decision by the Coalition Government has removed that burden and also provided an opportunity:</span> In fact, with the same amount of money, with less than what they were spending on TELS loans, we are giving more scholarships to students than ever before under TELS. Madam Deputy Speaker, I was very, very surprised that they cannot differentiate between a loan, bond and a scholarship.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Microwave:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> They claimed that because it is a bond, it is not free. In fact when we studied, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the 1970s, 1980s, every student who got a scholarship funded by the government was bonded to serve the country.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Full time job:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> If you did not serve the country, if you chose to leave the country, you got to pay. With the TELS loan they had the same arrangement. We heard these stories, these lies about students wanting to go overseas. They had the same process. You had to either pay; whether you had to pay 50 percent or 20 percent, you still had to pay if you wanted to go. So, if you sign a bond, you get a scholarship. You graduate, your work in Fiji, you do not pay a single cent. You serve your bond, you go. That is what we have done. Again, let me also say a little bit about the economy, Madam Deputy Speaker, because this is another lie that they are advocating and perpetrating in this Parliament. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The recent Budget (this is to also put the record straight), we had reduced the fiscal deficit from an average of 9.0 percent to 4.8 percent of GDP. We plan to bring this down further to 3.5 percent on the upcoming Budget. The reduction in the deficit was critical to put out debt trajectory on a path of sustainability.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 183 Madam Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to update Parliament that for the first time of the fiscal year, Government has recorded a net deficit of $114.9 million, equivalent to -0.9 percent of GDP - a surplus. This is much lower than the targeted net deficit that the Government has already collected of $1.8 billion in revenues which is almost half of what has been forecasted for the year. In the first six months, we have managed to achieve almost 99 percent of the budgeted tax revenue. Compared to the same period last year, the total revenue collection has increased by $458 million or 34 percent, and tax revenue are higher by 367 percent or 31 percent. Similarly, non-tax revenue has also increased. The reason why I am giving you this figure is because honourable Premila Kumar and some others out there… (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) …claimed that we will not be able to collect the revenue. In terms of the expenditures, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the first six months, Government expenditure totalled $1.9 billion, which represents about 44.1 percent and we agreed that it is lower than what we expected. But as we approach the second half which is normally the case, we expect expenditure to increase and some of the projects that are there would not be delayed. There was this talk about the National Development Plan (NDP), Madam Deputy Speaker, and we heard from the Opposition that there was a plan already. In fact, that plan was conceived, concocted and what we found out that there were actually incorrect figures. The data that was used in the plan was incorrect. The data on the sugar industry was all wrong. They claimed that the Tonnes of Cane per Tonne of Sugar (TCTS) would be around 5.7 TCTS. These were the kind of statistics concocted in that plan. There was no priority, so what we have done as a Government, we have recognised that we need an immediate plan, wo we have a 3-Year Plan, a 5-Year Plan and a 20-Year Plan because we know as a Government, that we will not be able to achieve everything in three years or five years and that we need a 20-Year Plan. Madam Deputy Speaker, what we will do is we will make sure that we prioritise and make it realistic. We know that there are certain things that we would not be able to do in three years or five years. They talk about listening to the people. If you look at the process that we have adopted in the formulation of the NDP, this is the most comprehensive process - starting from His Excellency’s Office, to all Government Ministers, NGOs, the public, we have got a consultant who is well experienced in development planning, so that is the process through which we will have a plan and that plan will be realistic. It will be targeted and prioritised. One last point, Madam Deputy Speaker, with respect to the claims made by the honourable Members on the other side and this is laughable. They talk about democracy, they talk about good governance, they talk about transparency, they talk about cronyism, they talk about nepotism, they are behaving like bad losers, Madam Deputy Speaker. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- When you listen to them, I thought that after a year, and as I have said, I want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition because it is important to</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>184 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 recognise that it is we, on this side of Parliament, that has brought real democracy in this country. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- We now have real democracy. The people in this country are listening to them. Listening to the garbage that is coming from the Opposition, from the generalilsation that is coming from them. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-What they did, Madam Deputy Speaker, they have talked about the promises we made in the last Election. In the last Election, they went around quietly, openly, telling the people social welfare will be gone, free school will be gone, scholarships will be gone, your leg will be gone. This is what they are still telling the people… HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Who said that?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.:</span> … and I know what they are telling.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> But when we came into Government, when they found out, “Aah, all these things that FijiFirst was telling us were lies. We still got our scholarships better. We are going to increase in social welfare allowances. We are going to increase in the health Budget. We are fixing health centres.” Honourable Maharaj was talking about waiting for a lot of things. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, may I please ask you to wind up.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am winding up with one last point:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroilavesau has a Point of Order. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister knows very well his time is up and you had begged us this morning that we should stick to our time. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I have just done that with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Please wind up, Sir. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I think honourable Koroilavesau did very well today. He worked very hard, and I know you might have been selected to disrupt me. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- You are not the Deputy Speaker!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Sit down:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I will sit down at the instruction of Madam Deputy Speaker:</span></p><p>She has asked me to conclude. You are not going to bully me here.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 185 DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, please, wind up. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, one last point and I will sit down. This is in response to honourable Maharaj. What I was saying is if they had fixed all health centres, if they had fixed the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, if they had accepted our motion in 2019 to deal with the drugs, we would not be waiting. We waited and we are here now. They can wait. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- As I have not received any notification from the Secretary-General to Parliament, we will continue to listen to the response from our final speaker before we break for lunch. HON. V. NATH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians who are joining us here today at the gallery and all of you who are connecting online - bula vinaka, namaste, jai siya ram, as salamu alaykum and a very good afternoon to you all. As we enter the month of March, I extend my warm wishes for the joyful and peaceful time filled with spirit of renewal. May the upcoming celebrations of Holi, Ramadan and Easter bring happiness and blessing to you and your loved ones. Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise in this august Parliament to deliver my contributions on the Address by His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Fiji. But, before I do so, I wish to remind the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to, please, go through the Daily Hansard of past Parliament Sittings, when they were on this side of Parliament. Now, they are on the other side. I suggest to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to feel the pulse of the people on the ground and just do not follow the report by IMF. The report looks merry and rosy, but on the ground, the story is different. Life is very hard now. I want to tell you that the people are watching you, not listening, but are watching you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Watching you as well:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. V. NATH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, at the outset, I wish to thank His Excellency for rightfully highlighting in his Opening Speech that water is a basic need and crucial for our socio- economic development. No one can deny the fact that water disruptions have become an everyday issue in all households. It is now an everyday and everywhere issue. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Viria Water Project is a significant infrastructure project that was initiated by the FijiFirst Government, which aimed to resolve the water supply issues and improve the lives of 360,000 Fijians in Fiji’s Suva-Nausori corridor, with an addition of 40 million litres of water per day. With an investment of over $270 million by the Asian Development Bank, the Green Climate Fund and the Fijian Government, this project, based on initial estimates, should have been operational by now. It was anticipated to be finished in May 2023, followed by a two-month commissioning phase.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>186 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the continuous delay from the Coalition Government is sending a negative signal to our development partners. We have to be mindful that the well-planned projects with implementation timeline on track, secures more investment from our development partners.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Development partners do not invest:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, given this delay, the relevant authority is to undertake further investigation to confirm the official launch date. Information on the project's environmental impact or any incorporated sustainability features is currently lacking. Additionally, monitoring the project's long-term effectiveness in addressing water supply issues and its impact on the Suva-Nausori areas' development would be insightful. By exploring the suggested resources and delving deeper into these areas, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the Rewa River Water Supply Scheme for its potential long-term impact. If the honourable Minister is saying that the project is completed, then why are the people still complaining about the lack of water? Madam Deputy Speaker, there has been a very strong emphasis on these mentioned areas in His Excellency’s Speech on the plans by the Coalition Government. However, I would like to remind us today on the saying that goes, and I quote: “Action speaks louder than words”. This also applies to those promises made during campaign time leading up to the Elections. Yes, these promises are to be actioned and not only used as political mileage or vote buying and left as failed promises. I firmly believe that whatever statement is delivered within this august Chambers should be converted into action. If not, then they are just mere words. Madam Deputy Speaker, many on the Coalition Government side like to use the blame game and it seems they are still campaigning. This diversionary tactics by the Coalition Government is an attempt to gaslight the nation to keep their campaign narratives alive. The good thing is, the people of Fiji have opened their eyes and have seen the truth.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> The truth is 16 years.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> Yes, you worry about the magic show.</p><p>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have seen the cost of living climb to new heights, compounded by the increase in VAT to 15 percent which has seen spending drop simply because the ordinary Fijians cannot afford as much as they once did. The decrease in indirect tax revenue clearly shows that consumer spending habits has decreased. This is a clear indication that our economy is contracting, and this is a very worrying trend. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency also mentioned in his Speech that the national debt was $9.9 billion. The question is, what was this money used for? Over $800 million has been borrowed so far by the Coalition Government and we have yet to see any new development rather than a re-packaged FijiFirst development. Madam Deputy Speaker, we have heard about the National Development Plan that is due out this year by the Coalition Government, but I ask, why does the Coalition Government need to remake something that has already been in place since 2017? We hear from the Minister in charge of this stating they will put in new policy initiatives, including those contained in the People’s Alliance</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 187 Party, National Federation Party and the Social Democratic Liberal Party Manifestos will be reviewed and factored in the new plan. Would it not been cheaper and more prudent to have an updated National Development Plan rather than making something new at great cost to the nation? It has been 15 months now since the Coalition Government took over government and the whole nation is wondering what they have been doing all this time. What have many of them been doing for the past eight years when the FijiFirst was in power? Did they not have plans and ideas? Clearly, they were not ready and from what I have heard, many of them are still not ready. Madam Deputy Speaker, all in all, this is an indication of the Coalition Government’s disconnection and lack of understanding of how the current mechanism works, and the inability to continue to build a nation is worrisome. By way of reverting to the blame game when they know they have nothing to show, no new or viable and good ideas is evident everywhere you look. You can ask almost anyone and they will tell you the same thing, life is very hard now and this is true. Madam Deputy Speaker, “any man can sail a ship when the ocean is calm”, Publilius Syrus wrote those words more than 2200 years ago. We have seen much in the way of finger pointing and verbal attack on us that says, “they did not do the job”. Madam Deputy Speaker, this Government has forgotten that under the FijiFirst Government, Fiji had to endure six cyclones with TC Winston hurting Fiji to the tune of around $1.8 billion and costing 44 lives. We were also hit by COVID-19 - a global pandemic which brought our economy to its knees and costing us over 1,300 lives. To prevent stalling the economy, we had to make the tough choices and borrow to keep our economy going. Madam Deputy Speaker, in ensuring that civil servants were paid in full, even if they were stuck at home. Any economist would know that it takes years to restart a stalled economy and the repercussions to the people of Fiji would have been extremely serious. All these, set us back by years of development and what do the people who benefited from tough decisions have to say for themselves now? They showed gratitude for all the aid and sadly, many were bought into the narrative of high debt that only came into existence by helping rebuild after the natural disasters and the pandemic. Everything is relevant, Madam Deputy Speaker, everything Government builds or creates, there is a ripple effect that affects the whole nation. This Government is very smart to talk about the shortfalls of FijiFirst but they also failed to explain to the people why we did that. They have hoodwinked the people into thinking that we did not look after them and sadly, Madam Deputy Speaker, many of the people of Fiji are gullible enough to have fallen into their negative narrative hook, line and sinker. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Rural and Maritime Development Programme by the FijiFirst Government in the past years have transformed Fiji’s rural economy and have raised the people’s living standards but now, they are suffering. Crime rate has increased. Stealing of rootcrops as alluded by honourable Shalen Kumar and other honourable Members on this side. At this juncture, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration for attending a meeting on my request and he has heard from the public that the crime rate has really increased. Honourable Minister of Finance, if you are not sure, find it from your team and from your boy in Wailoku.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>188 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have already visited them:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.:</span> You go and visit them and you will find that the crimes committed are not only in Baulevu, but Viria in Naitasiri, Muaniweni and Tailevu and everywhere, the crime rate has increased. Stealing of rootcrops and vegetables are included in that. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. V. NATH.- As pointed by His Excellency that Government will prioritize a wide range of programmes to revitalise the rural economy and encourage self-reliance, including funding of Self Help Programmes, Community Access Roads, Footpaths and Bridges, High Risk Water and Sanitation projects, Rural Housing Assistance Programme and the Rural and Outer Island Development Programme. Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to reiterate and remind this august Parliament that all these ongoing Programmes are from the FijiFirst Government. There is nothing new by the Coalition Government but the fact is, we have seen a major rebranding of everything from a microwave budget to a National Development Plan that I am sure will be very similar to the National Development Plan of 2017. In His Excellency’s Address in 2023, he said, and I quote: “Democracy will be broadened and localised further with the empowerment of local community to choose their Advisory Councillor through elections.” I will admit, I was cautionary optimistic that this Coalition Government was going to burden the Advisory Councillors. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am fully aware of how people appreciate the provision of Government assistance and services to our rural community and I am also aware of how difficult the work as an Advisory Councillor is. As people waited to elect their Advisory Councillors last year, we only saw failed National Federation Party Candidates and their supporters getting appointed to those positions and not elected. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. V. PILLAY.- Shame! HON. V. NATH.- I hope the honourable line Minister is aware of that. District Advisory Councillors do play a critical role in connecting the people to the Government and vice versa, to ensure that people get the real assistance needed by them. In this regard, it is very important that the right people are appointed for this position - someone that can be a game changer and has the ability to serve the community as a whole. I will ask the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management if the process was followed. I was told by a reliable source that the list advanced from the Commissioner Office was changed. I will ask the honourable Minister if Police Clearance was done for the District Advisory Councillors. HON. P. K. BALA.- Who changed the list?</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 189</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- I eagerly await his reply:</span></p><p>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is critical for an economy to have a robust transport system to enhance movement of goods and persons. Our maritime community faces this challenge particularly those who reside in non-economical routes. In addressing this, the FijiFirst Government introduced the Government Shipping Franchise Scheme. His Excellency had emphasised the need to better coordinate for disaster preparedness, response, recovery operations and mitigation. Could the honourable Minister for Rural Development on behalf of the villagers of Rokovuaka and Narikoso in the Ra Province and the villagers of Matacula and Maumi in Tailevu update us on the construction of evacuation centers? We have not heard anything so far? The signing was carried out by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) more than three years ago, but nothing has been seen happening. Madam Deputy Speaker, having $6 million approved under the former Minister, preparedness work already done, the project was supposed to start last year. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- What happened?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- They were overseas:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. V. NATH.- It talked about KOICA supporting the development under the Saemaul Undong Programme, but this was also Korean funded, nothing happening so far. I hope the honourable Minister has not shelved this project because they are FijiFirst projects. I remind them that our Fijian brothers and sisters will suffer if a disaster hits these areas. I had visited this area personally, they really need evacuation centers. The honourable Minister stated twice that we need to come away from the dependency syndrome. What is the honourable Minister doing differently to ensure that we move away from the dependency syndrome as we are hearing nothing new and only hearing a similar style – microwave statement similar to the honourable Minister for Finance and rebranding FijiFirst programmes. Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Lynda Tabuya yesterday attempted to insult us by saying that we are jack of all trades. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for that complement. As the saying is, “jack of all trades is a master of none” but often better than “a master of one”. Sadly, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coalition Government is neither a jack of all trades and definitely most of them are not a master of one except the honourable Minister herself who is an expert in are few fields which everyone knows of. To conclude, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to remind the Coalition Government to relook at the changes that they are willing to implement, not to be vote buying but to ensure that it will bring about economic stability and sustainability. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, it is now 12.43 p.m., we are going to adjourn for lunch and the bell will ring just before 2.00 p.m. Thank you, enjoy your lunch. The Parliament adjourned at 12.44 p.m.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>190 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.13 p.m.</p></body>
