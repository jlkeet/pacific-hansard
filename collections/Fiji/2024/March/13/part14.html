<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome – Women’s Dorcas Ministry Honourable Members, before we move on, I would like to highlight two issues that has come before me whilst listening intently to the speeches, but before I do so, I would like to acknowledge a tour group from the members of the Women’s Dorcas Ministry of Suvavou Seventh-day Adventist Church and their team leader is Ms. Leba Volau. Ni bula vinaka mai, vinaka vakalevu. Contempt of Parliament – Hon. K. V. Ravu The other issue I would like to bring to your attention, honourable Members, is that I would like to address an issue that I have picked out after having reviewed the Uncorrected Hansard Report for yesterday, Tuesday, 12 th March, 2024 and this is with respect to the reference made by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to section 72 of Schedule 1 of the 2018 Code of Conduct. For the information of honourable Members, the Code of Conduct Bill was moved on the First Reading under Standing Order 84(1) on 30 th November, 2018. The Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights tabled its Report on 4 th April, 2019 and pursuant to Standing Order 86, their Chairperson then moved that it be sat down for consideration by the Committee of the Whole of Parliament on a future sitting date. Due to the Prorogation in 2019, the Bill had lapsed and was restored to the Order Paper on 8 th December, 2020 and that status remained until the Dissolution of Parliament in 2022. In essence the Code of Conduct Bill 2018 had lapsed entirely. In that respect, since it was never enacted, it is not a current law and therefore it is out of order to quote nor apply any of the clauses that were contained in the lapsed Bill. Honourable Members, it is pertinent to reiterate that deliberately misleading Parliament is a very serious matter and may be viewed as Contempt of Parliament. It is equally important to ensure that whilst speaking in Parliament, one needs to be factually correct and this has been highlighted by the honourable Deputy Speaker when she was presiding; here, you need to present the facts and you have to be very factual since we do not want to mislead the members of the public. In that respect, honourable Members, I will call on honourable Minister Ravu if you could kindly withdraw your statement on the reference to the Code of Conduct Bill 2018 accordingly, and since you still have seven days to correct what is in the Hansard Report and the statement will be expunged from the Hansard Report for Tuesday, 12 th March, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I withdraw that statement.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much:</span></p><h4>We will ensure that the statement is expunged, as I have stated earlier from the Minutes of</h4><p>the meeting held yesterday.</p></body>
