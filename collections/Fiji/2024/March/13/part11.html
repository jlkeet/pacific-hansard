<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI HON. I. NAIVALURUA- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, and honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians who are watching and listening this morning. Bula vinaka and good morning to you all. I thank His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, President of the Republic of Fiji</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 151 I thank His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, President of the Republic of Fiji for his Address to Parliament on the Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament where His Excellency reminded the Members of Parliament of their, I quote: “…immense responsibility that comes with representing the diverse voices and aspirations of our people…”. His Excellency has urged Parliament to fulfil its obligations and I fully support that call. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President has also encouraged all Members of Parliament to, I quote: “…listen to the voices of our people, not only those who elected you, but to all citizens, young and old, men and women.” Madam Deputy Speaker, in essence, His Excellency had demanded of us several things that can be summarised simply as this: 1. That we feel the heartbeat of our people on the ground, and when we do that, we try and connect our heartbeat to the heartbeat of our people. 2. Work together and listen to each other. 3. 4. Get the job done. Improve the way we do business, deliver quality and timely service. Madam Deputy Speaker, I call on the honourable Prime Minister to listen to the heartbeat of the people, because I am not convinced that his Government, his Coalition of political partners is doing that. While I commend the Government for completing the projects initiated under the previous administration, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to move his Ministers to action, instead what we see in the delaying and deferring of what the real issues are on the ground. Madam Deputy Speaker, the world is experiencing turbulent times, we only must look at the increase in global conflicts, supply chain disruption, global inflation and environmental and social pressures from climate change. Fiji is not immune to this. The impact is well evident here at home. The call is urgent. Does Fiji have the leadership ready to lead through trouble times? Does Fiji have the leadership mindset that will successfully lead us through? Can this Government craft a way forward that is hopeful, genuine and inspirational for all? Madam Deputy Speaker, governing with Coalition partners is a significant challenge, especially when the Coalition needs to improve its performance and start to deliver on its promises. Madam Deputy Speaker, I call on the honourable Prime Minister to review how he is leading his Coalition and form a government that will serve the better interest of our people and take us forward. If the task is becoming too difficult, throw out a lifeline to those who can help build a better Fiji for our people. Madam Deputy Speaker, there appears to be a deep confusion in the Government about developing a clear forward strategy and implementing priorities. As I have moved around Fiji, spoken with vendors, employees, families, farmers and business owners, I have heard a consistent message of disappointment in this Coalition Government. There are deep and real concerns about our cost of living. Many families are finding they are in survival mode, working out what bills get paid and how to continue living with less in their pockets. I ask the question of this Coalition Government, is your leadership bringing a change for the better? Are your policies bringing a change for the better? HON. OPPOSITION MEMBRS.- No! HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, another concern is the compromise in keeping Fiji safe and its borders secure. We have become a target for organised crimes. They have exploited gaps in the integrity of our people and our systems. The mounting evidence is that Fiji is</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>152 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 a transit point and destination for hard drugs. There has been a loss in the confidence of our Police Force as the guardians of our streets and communities.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Previous years you did nothing:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. NAIVALURUA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the question of the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration, with drugs so easily accessible and drug-associated crime impacting so many in our community, is your leadership effective in making Fiji a safer place? Are your policies effective in making Fiji a safer place? Madam Deputy Speaker, I express my concern on the mass exodus of our people to Australia and New Zealand. As the honourable Attorney-General rightly pointed out in the news on 7 th March this year that this brain drain weakens our nation's potential. I applaud the honourable Attorney- General for his honesty and ask the Coalition Government – what are your plans to address this brain drain? Madam Deputy Speaker, when people have confidence in a nation and leadership, they invest in that nation and make it their home and place of belonging. This Government is failing to build credible opportunities for its people and secure their confidence so they can say with pride – Fiji, Forever Fiji! Madam Deputy Speaker, I turn to one of this Government's initiatives: the re-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC). This newly reassembled body needs to be accessible, reachable, available and willing to serve in the true heart and spirit of vakaturaga. The fact that the Colonial Administration gave the name to the assembly of chiefs reveals its history and legacy. The name is outdated in my view and the GCC needs to be rebranded. It is out of touch and connected to a troubled past, not our future. We live in the 21 st century where the name of this assembly of chiefs should resonate with the principles and purpose it will serve in moving forward. Madam Deputy Speaker, the re-establishment of the GCC was a significant political platform in our last election. However, the GCC's continued relevance is not connected to politics but is dependent on its ability to serve the best interest of its people. The GCC’s true value will come about as it stays within its purpose of preparing and encouraging the hearts of the iTaukei to invest in the right areas of life and education, to challenge and lead the way in developing self-reliance and drive a shift of attitudes for advancement rather than entitlement, from characteristics of selfishness, dishonesty and indiscipline to true principles of cakacaka vata, veiwekani vinaka, veilomani, vei dokai and duavata. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Vinaka! HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- This is the key to realising and utilising the God-given gifts that lie within each of us. Madam Deputy Speaker, like all initiatives led by this Government, the whole community has many expectations of the GCC. I therefore, ask the honourable Prime Minister what return on investment we will see. Will this initiative lead to better lives and a better Fiji? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Yes! HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in reflecting on His Excellency’s Address to Parliament, I note the absence of any reference to the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Given the uniqueness of Fiji’s sporting heritage and our deep natural talent across this nation, by now sports being one of our premium assets. The success of the Rio Olympics and the repeat success at</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 153 the Tokyo Olympics were highlights we celebrated. Yet, despite that world-class success, we have not capitalised or effectively utilised it in terms of what Fiji could have reaped. Simply, we are not achieving all that we can from sports. Those celebrations are now a distant memory than a foundation on which we built to harness greater sporting excellence. Rugby is just not an afternoon game but a pathway to become a powerhouse, a brand, a pathway for our players and coaches. Through the boots of our rugby players, the world has come to know of Fiji better. Our sporting engagement is not limited to rugby. We compete in netball, volleyball, swimming, basketball, hockey, soccer, weightlifting, yachting and athletics to name a few. Madam Deputy Speaker, our sports are also a platform for nation building, economic inflows through remittances, developing the Fiji brand and building a friendly space for diplomatic relations. Madam Deputy Speaker, sports has a great role to play in nation building. I propose that the Government consider the establishment of a Fiji Institute of Sports or Centre of Sports Excellence to train and develop our athletes to compete at an elite level. Our performance at regional competitions are declining illustrating that we need to take the necessary development steps and invest more in what we have. By investing in the sports industry, we create better opportunities for our hardworking sportsmen and sportswomen. Madam Deputy Speaker, furthermore sports can be better integrated into a foreign policy so that the achievements of our sports people can strengthen our international relations. This is about maximising what we have, expecting the best economic benefits and building our nation and moving it forward. As a small island nation, we have to be creative and innovative to be able to play above our weights. Madam Deputy Speaker, our nation’s future lies in the hands of our youth. They are critical in shaping our country’s growth and development, and their empowerment is vital to boost productivity. We need to work together to ensure our young people are open to change and they share our unified vision of moving the country forward. It is important that as a nation we must understand that empowering youths goes merely beyond giving them a voice, it is about equipping them to use that voice effectively and contribute positively to the society. With this, Madam Deputy Speaker, I strongly propose a review of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. This is to pave the way for a more focused and a proactive approach to develop our youth and sports separately. Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank His Excellency for his emphasis on the key pillars of our foreign policy. I believe our foreign policy should ultimately be above connecting the world to Fiji to achieve our well-being and prosperity as a nation. To accomplish this, we must have our house in order. The world will connect to Fiji when we are seen as a safe and stable destination. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. NAIVALURAU.- The world will connect their investment to Fiji when they are confident that we are good managers of our economy. The world will support and cooperate with Fiji when they know that we are consistent in our decisions and uphold international norms. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, our peacekeepers are a stable part of our foreign policy engagement, yet this Government has chosen to take sides in the very area that our peacekeepers are serving. These decisions, in my view, needs to be revised or will disrupt how we</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>154 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 add value and gain value as a longstanding partner of the United Nations Peacekeeping Missions. Madam Deputy Speaker, while we discuss and debate policies, the real issues that confront us now are the bread and butter issues that our people face. The figures released by the Reserve Bank of Fiji paint a grim reality. The cost of food in our nation increased by 3.4 percent in January 2024, exacerbating the burden of our already struggling population.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- The harsh reality is that major businesses are thriving while families are left digging deeper into their pockets to afford a decent meal:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the writing is on the wall. The people of Fiji are not facing a mere inconvenience but an uphill challenge against the rising cost of living that threatens the very fabric of our society. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Brutality:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Update that information:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it would be wonderful if we are able to still remember the words by His Excellency the President that we need to listen to each other. I hope the other side would do that this morning. (Honourable Members interject) HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as Members of this esteemed Parliament, we are reminded by His Excellency that it is not only our duty but our moral obligation to question the rationale behind policies that exacerbate the suffering of our people. The Coalition Government must answer to the people. What justification can there possibly be for imposing such hardships in the name of change? Is this the change they promised - a heavier load for the already weary shoulders of our citizens? Madam Deputy Speaker, we cannot afford to idly watch our people suffer. Action is needed, and it is needed now. The Government has taken steps such as subsidising fuel, reducing Value Added Tax on essential goods and controlling food prices. While these measures have provided short- term relief, they must be better targeted at those in need and on tight budgets. The Coalition Government would do well to understand and accept that they need to roll up their sleeves and do the real work now. Madam Deputy Speaker, before the last elections, some of the Coalition partners made all sorts of statements about selling Fiji Airways. I commend the Coalition Government for keeping Fiji Airways, a national asset and realising how it serves our tourism objectives and national economy. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Nobody said that! (Honourable Members interject)</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 155 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Who said it? (Chorus of interjections) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please order! Please allow the honourable Member to continue with his speech. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to exercise decisive leadership that develops stability in this Coalition Government and this nation. We live in turbulent times, and turbulent times demand leadership that can take us forward to a stronger future. Fiji needs stronger and able leaders who can carry the burden of taking Fiji forward - men and women whose loyalty to the country is unquestionable and who will give us hope for a better future. Right now, an increasing number of people are losing faith and confidence in this Coalition Government. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. L. D. TABUYA. – Where is the fact? HON. I. NAIVALURUA. – The writing is on the wall! HON. K. K. LAL. – Hear, hear! HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I urge the Members of this august Parliament to think anew and act anew; our people are listening, watching and asking questions that need to be heard and answered. In response, let us try to feel the correct pulse of our nation and not assume or pretend that last year’s pulse is accurate today. Let us stand up, step out and move the nation forward with wisdom and courage. Finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, let us work together to unite our people and give them the courage, confidence and hope to build a better future. Madam Deputy Speaker, I applaud your leadership of this august Parliament and the guidance you have provided to oversee the roles and functions of this Parliament. I convey my best wishes to the honourable Speaker and to you, Madam Deputy Speaker as you lead our Parliament through its second session. God bless Fiji, vinaka saka vakalevu. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; I rise to respond to the most gracious Address by His Excellency the President on 4 th March, 2024. Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank His Excellency for his wise counsel and strong leadership for all Fijians. His humble plea to the leaders in this Parliament to continue the promotion of harmony and embrace diversity in our nation demonstrates the essence of his Address. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency was forthright in calling all of us to work towards lasting peace and harmony for our beloved nation. He made this plea after pointing out that some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust amongst communities for their own political ends.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>156 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, since the beginning of the sitting of this Parliament from Monday, we have noticed two sides of the coin of the Parliamentary Opposition, as far as the tone of the debate is concerned. One would have expected that all the honourable Members of Parliament across the floor would heed the example set by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, but this did not happen. A few became vitriolic and demonised the Coalition Government with their wild and unsubstantiated claims. HON. K. K. LAL.- Hogwash! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Go wash with the hogs! One honourable Member of Parliament, honourable Ketan Lal, obviously despises the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and the National Federation Party. He is a perfect example of what His Excellency pointed out. The honourable Member’s communal agenda is clear from his utterances. All I will say to him and a few others is that, you can continue with your diatribe, but this Government will continue to build a foundation for lasting peace, harmony and unity in diversity. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the context of the labour market, His Excellency pointed out that social justice is the key term for achieving peace and harmony through decent work and a sustainable employment for all. And that is exactly what the Coalition Government has done and will continue to do in the future. Madam Deputy Speaker, the FijiFirst Government dismantled all the structures of consultations and amended laws to create an environment of insecurity and fear. It was a one-way traffic, and now they have the audacity to point fingers at us when we are trying to fix all the wrongs they did. They made all sorts of wild allegations. What a farce! Madam Deputy Speaker, since coming into power, this Coalition Government has: • • • • • • allowed workers dismissed unfairly or terminated under the pretext of the COVID-19 pandemic, being an act of God, to return to work, particularly the Air Terminal Services and Fiji Airways workers. revoked the COVID-19 Mandatory Vaccination at Workplace Regulations 2021, and allowed workers terminated under these regulations to re-apply and return to work without restrictions. extended the retirement age of the civil servants from 55 years to 60 years, including the municipal workers. removed fixed-term contracts for civil servants and employees of municipal councils, providing them with job security that they had been yearning for, for ages, and this is also extended to all the State-Owned Enterprises including Government Statutory Authorities. promoted good governance through consultative approach rather than the dictatorial approach. consultative approach to also lawfully dismantle the existing worker laws and policies, to allow for social advancement - all the draconian laws that they had put in place unilaterally.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 157 Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency is quite firm about advancing social justice both, at home and abroad. which he first advocated during the International Labour Organization (ILO) Conference in Geneva in 2023. To support this commitment, Government has confirmed its participation to join the Global Coalition for Social Justice focusing on the theme Bridging Gaps and Building Alliances. The theme this year provides an opportunity to foster dialogue on actions needed to achieve social justice, especially in an environment of uncertainty, conflict and weak institutions. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coalition Government has brought back to life tripartism. The people of Fiji need leaders who listen to them, care for them and do justice to them. Institutions such as the Employment Relation Advisory Board, the National Occupational Health and Safety Board and the National Employment Centre Board and the like, are crucial for creating peaceful and harmonious industrial relations.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Listen to the voices of the people:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, due to non-compliance to ILO Convention 144 on Tripartite Consultation, Fiji was seriously cited at the ILO under the previous Administration, (this is history it will remain there and will repeat it), for failing to comply with the very Conventions that they had ratified. Madam Deputy Speaker, through tripartism the Ministry is able to conduct a comprehensive review of the Employment Relations Act, as well as discuss policy matters relating to employment, productivity and workplace relations. Madam Deputy Speaker, the review of labour laws is aimed at reversing the unilateral amendments done by the former Government to curtail fundamental rights of workers and workers organisations, including trade union leaders. Madam Deputy Speaker, I vividly remember the incident when my former colleague, the National Secretary of the Fiji Trades Union Congress (FTUC) - Mr. Felix Anthony, was arrested from his home in front of his family at 10.00 p.m. at night… (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.-...locked up in the cell in Lautoka, driven to Suva in the wee hours of the morning and questioned there at 8.30 a.m. and kept in custody. That is what brutality is, honourable Usamate. That is brutality. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- This harassment continues:</span></p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! HON. A. D. SINGH.- It will not be forgotten, Madam Deputy Speaker, and the reason was because he raised the voice of the weak and poor workers, and they are talking about brutality.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. BIA.:</span> It is 15 months now, honourable Singh, we want to hear what you are doing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.:</span> The review is progressing very well, Madam Deputy Speaker, with</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>158 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 inputs from the tripartite parties through consultative engagement via the Employment Relations Advisory Board, the sub-committees are working. Madam Deputy Speaker, when all that was happening, those who were there at that time were on this side and they were all gleefully and shamelessly supporting. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. D. SINGH.- I also wish to thank the ILO Regional office here for its tremendous support and guidance. (Hon. P. K. Bala interjects) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Areh, he was arrested from your office yaar, and what are you talking about, honourable Bala? (Laughter) Madam Deputy Speaker, the ILO has provided us with assistance through a Legal Drafter and has also now extended another Legal Drafter’s assistance so that we can comprehensively revise this legislation and to be presented to the floor of this Parliament in the first half of this year. It is a massive exercise, Madam Deputy Speaker because they have undone everything and has to be redone and those…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- You were sitting in one of the boards:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> Dictators! They were dictators, there was not consultation.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> You had no say, anyway.</p><p>(Laughter) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, address the Chair. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in this Parliament, in its November sitting last year enacted the Employment Relations (Amendment) Bill 2023, marking a significant step to improve the rights of workers. Sectors that were decreed “essential” in violation of ILO Conventions were removed from what was first shoved down the throats of workers as the Essential National Industries (Employment) Decree 2011. They suffered for 13 years. It was dismantled on the very floor of this Parliament here. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is alarming to note that due to the draconian anti-worker laws that were either promulgated or enacted by the previous Government, union density went down from 30 percent to 12 percent. Now, that says everything, what else do you want? Now, they are saying they are championing the rights of the people. They decimated the unions. But now, both the unions and workers are busy re-organising to regain their membership and strength. Madam Deputy Speaker, as part of the holistic review, the Ministry is now reviewing the minimum wage in the 10 Sectorial Wages Councils which were also dismissed by them. The process will involve Sectorial Wages Councils already appointed by the Ministry.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 159</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, your Point of Order? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am rising on Point of Order 60 which is Relevance. We are talking about His Excellency the President’s Speech and not the Ministry of Employment. (Laughter) DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau, please, continue Minister. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am very much responding to His Excellency’s Address. Madam Deputy Speaker, the minimum wage exercise is going to be completed and an announcement is going to be made in the 2024-2025 National Budget. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Mediation Service of the Ministry of Employment is a peace- making institution that provides social justice to both parties, the worker and the employer. In line with its objective, we have managed to amicably resolve two potential industrial actions namely, the health and the energy sector, as well as several others. Madam Deputy Speaker, issues of labour mobility, addressing skills shortage, the initiative on the formulation of a new sector strategic plan over the next 10 years which is aligned to the needs of the labour market is noteworthy. This will also address the issue of labor mobility through the appointment of an Education Commission to undertake a holistic review of our education system so that it adequately aligns to our needs. Thank you, Ministry of Education. Madam Deputy Speaker, in addressing the current needs of the labour market, the Coalition Government has supported the revitalization of the technical vocational training institutions around Fiji, to provide short-term and medium-term technical training to meet the industry needs. These are provided by the various established institutions and, of course, the three Universities. One of the institutions, Madam Deputy Speaker, is the Poly Tech Pacific which was mentioned during the debate by honourable Hem Chand. I am surprised that honourable Chand, having worked in the Ministry of Education for so long does not know that there is a thing called “non-profit company”. All schools are privately owned and Government funds 98 percent of the costs. Even the University of Fiji is registered as a private company and that University also receive grants. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- They are just making money. I know you better from labour days (Laughter) HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, just because they hate the individuals who are running this education provider, they have that contempt for them. That is the whole problem. This institution is providing much better service than the failed Technical Colleges from which the taxpayers lost $30 million. They have forgotten that. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh!</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>160 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- This institution deserves more funding:</span></p><p>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me just elaborate a little bit more on what they are doing. They are providing award courses, as well as short courses for basic skills training and development for unskilled youth which TSLS calls micro-qualifications. The award programme allows students to attain a certificate at level 2 or level 3. Level 4 and diploma level is currently being reviewed by the Fiji Higher Education Commission. Now, if you have a gripe, go and question the Fiji Higher Education Commission because this institution is accredited by Fiji Higher Education Commission. Madam Deputy Speaker, by July 2024, a total of 1,254 students will complete their award programme category, of which 488 will complete at the end of March, and 776 will finish their programme at the end of July. The students are spread between Nausori (536), Tavua (310) and Labasa (408). The programmes are national qualifications developed by the Fiji Higher Education Commission. Madam Deputy Speaker, for short-term Rapid Skills Development Course, a total of 797 have completed this course and an additional 323 are in class, while about 120 are awaiting commencement. This institution has 2,200 students. They also take in dropouts and provide them with the skills training that allow them to become meaningful citizens of this country. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Nabua Youth have actually benefited from this and the honourable Attorney-General was there to launch the programme that they have gotten into. So, that it is what it is doing. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has been working with stakeholders like TSLS, TSLS Board to address the needs of training and filling in the gaps that we see. One initiative is the Apprenticeship Scheme that has been initiated. There are 400 positions for this year that are provided for in the budget. The Government is topping up wages by $2, which will amount to a total of $4.90 an hour. So, 230 places have already been taken up by institutions like Energy Fiji Limited, Asco Motors, et cetera, and the balance are going to be recruited in the near future. Madam Deputy Speaker, we also have the National Employment Centre where we have increased the allowances for attaché’s that can be attached to workplaces for three to six months. From $120 a week, it has been increased to $180 for graduates and for those with certificates and diploma, we have increased the weekly allowance from $100 to $150. This came into effect on 4 th January, 2024, and it is shared 50/50 by the employer and the Government. So, these are initiatives we have undertaken. Under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have been liaising, talking and collaborating with Australian Government agencies, approved employers, key stakeholders and Fijian workers, to ensure that the PALM Scheme and Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) programmes will be strengthened and sustainable. Equally important is the Coalition Government’s duty of care to the Fijian workers’ welfare which we term as “non- negotiable”. The economic benefit from PALM remittances up to December 2023 is F$274 million. Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Kumar had actually questioned the value of our visit to Australia. They were very happy when my predecessors visited but when I visit, it hurts them. (Hon. P. K. Bala interjects)</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 161 HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, little knowledge is dangerous but zero knowledge is very dangerous. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Times up! HON. A. D. SINGH.- After we have discovered all the challenges, we have been able to appoint three Country Liaison Officers (CLOs), improved the terms and conditions of their work, had the minimum standards observed, we have solved the problems and now, the CLOs are handling them directly. Madam Deputy Speaker, this Government is about approaching through a consultative approach. This Government is about listening to the people. This Government is putting into practice what they were always dictating and that is the difference between them and us, and we will continue to do that, and we will not be thwarted by anyone. Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I thank you too, honourable Minister. HON. J. N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians, I rise to respond to His Excellency the President’s Address at the opening of the 2024 Second Session of Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, to put it simply, the Coalition Government is struggling to be in Government. They are just over more than one year in power and indecisive decisions are destroying Fiji faster than any cancerous disease. This Government hasty and impartial decision in making our people to be caught struggling for their daily needs… HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Facts, facts! HON. J. N. NAND.-… so they can govern without being questioned, leaving them helpless without much support. Madam Deputy Speaker, what else? Potholes, dusty, pathetic road conditions and defective works are now a staple feature on our roads in Fiji. This brings to my attention the state of Kawakawa, Caralevu, Nabekavu, Coquru and Delaikoro Roads which of Waiqele Road just 2 kilometres away from Labasa Airport situated in Waiqele. With a population of more than 2,000, this is the only long stretch of road approximately 18 kilometres… HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Why didn’t you do it? HON. J. N. NAND.- …that has not been tarsealed and often neglected, and regular maintenance is neglected. The FijiFirst Government had plans to upgrade this section of the road but COVID-19 hindered its progress. I urge the Coalition Government to tarseal this road as during rainy season, this road becomes bogged and children, especially, have to walk as far as Waiqele Sector Office to catch the transport to go to Waiqele Primary and Secondary Schools, as well as other schools in Labasa Town.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>162 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, sugarcane farmers find it difficult to cart their cane to Labasa Mill and many have left cane farming and have settled elsewhere. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Very poor! HON. J. N. NAND.- Coupled with this are yaqona farmers from Delaikoro and Coquru who are unable to sell their famous Coquru Kava in the Labasa Market on a regular basis. So, as a result, they are exploited by wholesalers who give them less than the market price. Madam Deputy Speaker, as His Excellency the President has stated, Government is committed to fostering a competitive and sustainable agriculture sector. However, this cannot be achieved as people and farmers of Sigatoka are sick and tired of stray animals that roam and ramp their crops, vegetables and sugarcane farms. Madam Deputy Speaker, Sir, my neighbor, Mr. Uday’s wife, broke her arm while chasing stray horses from her sugarcane farm as she fell on the rough sugarcane terrain. (Hon. Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.- It is not a joke. She required surgery and was in constant pain:</span></p><p>Madam Deputy Speaker, because stray animals frequently rampage their cane plantation and destroying everything in their path, many people have lost interest in sugarcane farming and production. Also, multiple reports have gone unanswered and little, or nothing has been done to seize the wandering horses and livestock, people have lost faith in the police and agriculture department in Sigatoka. In the farming community around Nadroga/Navosa, this has grown to be a nuisance and an eyesore. Madam Deputy Speaker, stray animals is one of the major contributing factors of road accidents in the Sigatoka area from Sovi Bay to Lomawai. In the last three months, eight accidents have occurred and three lives have been lost. The Ministry of Agriculture is hopeless and helpless, and I urge both the Ministers to please take this very seriously and give more funding to the staff to monitor and impound these stray animals. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am saying all these because I go out to the community for community service where I meet members of the public. Just lately, I came to know from farmers in Valley Road that there is no subsidy on weedicide and insecticide which means extra financial burden to farmers. To add to the woe, the Agriculture Research Station does not have any seeds at the moment to supply to the farmers when they should be the one selling seeds and have it ready all the time. Not only this, Madam Deputy Speaker, the veterinary office never has enough medicine for cattle, pigs, goats and chickens and this hinders big time in bringing top quality meat production. Due to the lack of medicine, the livestock die rapidly and that is beyond the farmer’s control. There are many cases which can be proven by the farmers. In addition, the machine that is supposed to be hired by farmers for land tillage is always under constant repair. Madam Deputy Speaker, last year water disruptions along the Suva-Nausori corridor has continued its usual trend and very less has been done to mitigate this. Complaints from the ordinary citizens for timely water cartage in times of water disruptions has fallen on deaf ears. Often water is delivered two days late or in some cases no cartage at all.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 163</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Minister overseas:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. N. NAND.:</span> On the same note, Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge the Water Authority of Fiji to look into the plight of Nakama, Savusavuitaqa, Dogoru, and Delaikoro village settlements that do not have access to metered water contrary to the fact that huge reservoirs have been built in these areas that provides water to whole of Labasa Town. In fact the water source that supplies water to the whole of Labasa is in Vuinakawakawa which is few kilometers from Nakama, Dogoru and Delaikoro. The honourable Minister for Sugar got more votes from these villages and areas and he has neglected them and the situation has remained the same. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President also spoke about the new National Development Plan that will invest in robust and resilient infrastructure thus enhancing social safety nets for the disadvantaged and low-income household. Madam Deputy Speaker, there is one such community is in Soasoa, Ronikanace Road in Tabia, Labasa where there are seven families without electricity. Scoping was done by the FijiFirst Government and I urge the Coalition Government to take this forward, as it has been a year and no action has been taken despite the villagers frequenting the EFL Office in Labasa. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! HON. J. N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President reiterated that we must increase our collective effort in implementing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the risks associated with climate change and sea level rise, not only here at home, but also in the region. Madam Deputy Speaker, I also wish to reiterate that under the leadership of our former Prime Minister and former Attorney-General, Fiji has become a global and regional leader in raising awareness on climate change, its effects and what the nation states should do together to reduce emissions, to keep us within 1.5 degree Celsius of global warming and to avoid catastrophic climate change. In order to combat climate change, reduce emissions, make advanced adaptations to the effects that are already occurring, and build strength, financial resources and wise investments are needed. The long-term advantages of these actions far outweigh any initial expenses. Madam Deputy Speaker, investment by the FijiFirst Government towards climate change is unmatched because never ever before have we had investment of such magnitude. The list is impressive and incessant. The FijiFirst Government had delivered on climate change where we had developed a: • • • • robust National Climate Change Policy; National Adaptation Plan for Fiji to guide climate resilience; low emissions development strategy that will guide Fiji towards a law carbon future by 2050; and National Ocean Policy that is designed to accelerate Fiji’s Blue Economy aspirations. Madam Deputy Speaker, what have the Coalition Government delivered apart from false promises and attempt to resolve their own internal issues? It seems they are running out of innovative ideas and stamina to take this country forward. Madam Deputy Speaker, recently it was in the news that 30,000 tonnes of cane have not been harvested. Part of the blame must go to the Fairtrade where many farmers opted to join Lautoka</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>164 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Cane Producers Association, Rarawai Cane Producers, Penang Cane Producers Association and Labasa Cane Producers Association under the umbrella of Fairtrade. The Fairtrade has been riddled with mismanagement, poor work ethics and accountability. Farmer’s complaints are swept under the carpet as Fairtrade is not answerable to any Ministry and even until to-date we have not seen their annual report. Nepotism and favouritism is at its peak and many farmers are marginalised resulting in their crop not being harvested by the Fairtrade gangs. Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry to fix these issues that farmers are facing with Fairtrade which he has failed to do so for the whole of last year as farmers had brought these issues during Ministers consultations with the farmers on numerous occasions. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the people of Fiji have lost faith, credibility and respect in the Coalition Government due to its inability to deliver what they promised during their campaigns. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the answer to all these problems they have created including disunity, poor economic growth, high incidence of poverty, deteriorating law and order, abuse of human rights, lack of transparency and accountability. Madam Deputy Speaker, as alluded to earlier by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, this Government is on record of appointing former politicians to key Government positions instead of experts and technocrats that has resulted in poor service delivery, miscommunication and very poor decision making. Madam Deputy Speaker, currently the Government looks pretty anguished about the state of the public service, they just could not convert their words into action. So far we have not found a shred of vision in the Coalition Government’s agenda which is heavily leaned on plans to reverse, replace and repeal and disestablish the good work done by the FijiFirst Government. I think they have a plan to go backwards and not to take Fiji forward. Of course, many voted for change but this was not the change people had voted for. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government’s priorities seem to be visionless, random and harmful grab-bag of policies and decisions that do not focus on the real issues on the ground. As such, I urge and plead that the honourable Prime Minister takes responsibility for the issues facing the country and accept that he has failed as a leader. There needs to be a clear change in governance that would help re-organise the Government. Madam Deputy Speaker, finally I wish to quote from Y B Yeats poem - “ The Second Coming ” echoed by Chinua Achebe in his classic novel, Things Fall Apart: “Turning and turning in the widening gyre; The falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world; The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere; The ceremony of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst; Are full of passionate intensity.”</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 165. Madam Deputy Speaker, God forbid we do not go down that path. Having said that, I have hope that both sides of Parliament commit to bring critical change for all Fijians. I have hope that both side of Parliament have consultation and conversation to provide a roadmap for a change for our nation’s women and children’s needs. Madam Deputy Speaker, I have hope that both sides of Parliament have a conversation and this is grounded in the need for transformation in the way we create possibilities for all Fijians. In the words of Samuel Coleridge ’s poem “Work without hope draws nectar in a sieve, and hope without an object cannot live.” Madam Deputy Speaker, the objective of my hope is that no Fijians should be left behind. Thank you, for giving me this opportunity. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, it is now 10.37 a.m., I intend to adjourn just for half an hour and we will see you back in half an hour. Enjoy your tea. Vinaka. The Parliament adjourned at 10.39 a.m.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>166 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.08 a.m. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, namaste and sat shiri akaal. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to respond to His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere’s Opening Address in Parliament last week. Firstly, I thank and commend His Excellency for his most gracious Speech. His advice, wisdom and wealth of experience not only underscored the need for good policies and plans for the nation’s growth and development, but also reminded us all honourable Members of this august Parliament of their responsibility to include the voices and aspirations of all people in our policies. His Excellency spoke on the significance to embrace, build tolerance and trust amongst the various ethnic communities and remain united with one of the common goals to ensure that we live in a progressive, prosperous and peaceful country that is socially cohesive. Madam Deputy Speaker, as the Minister responsible for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, I applaud His Excellency for clearly emphasising this and thank the Coalition Government for re-establishing the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs which was disbanded more than a decade ago. I agree with His Excellency and I also believe in promoting Fiji where culturally diverse societies are socially- cohesive and all citizens share and agree on a common direction of a nation. We all will do better economically and socially and will be more successful at attending to challenges as it arises. Having understood this and to support the objectives of the re-established Ministry, two consultants were engaged to draft a policy framework for the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs, which outlined the strategic framework to guide its structure, strategic objectives and programmes for all the ethnic communities in Fiji. The Government of New Zealand provided the grant assistance to support this process. Madam Deputy Speaker, a wide range of consultations has been conducted with the Government Ministries, Non-Government Organisations, Faith-Based Organisations, leaders, academics, community leaders, lawyers, regional advocates and a range of people from the various ethnic communities and others with an interest in multi-ethnic affairs to formulate a policy report. I am proud and confident to inform Parliament that the policy report has been finalised and will be tabled in Cabinet in the next sitting to seek the consensus on the findings and recommendations. In this regard, I extend my heartful appreciation to the Government of New Zealand, the two consultants, namely, Dr. Rajend Prasad, Mr. Radhe Nand, the Cabinet and all the stakeholders and individuals who have provided valuable contribution and inputs towards the drafting of this policy report. Madam Deputy Speaker, on this note, I would like to respond to a young honourable Member on the other side of Parliament who appears totally confused about the role of the Ministry of Multi- Ethnic Affairs. Perhaps, he was not listening attentively when I had outlined the plans of the Ministry in the April session of Parliament last year. I want to inform him and to do so from now, so that he can perhaps save the valuable time of this august Parliament if he listens properly. We are progressing well as per the plan of the Ministry. We believe in consultations, inclusiveness, dialogue, listening and then making sound policies. This is the foundation of the Coalition Government. We do not pick things from the air and do not rush with ill-conceived ideas, policies and Bills like the previous government. Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of tangible projects on the ground, noting that the Ministry is currently at its initial stage of assessing the community integration projects, we have identified the need to focus on projects which maintains and modernises the traditional structure of the heritage</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 167 sites to allow continuity of the service. One of the lead projects is the construction of a gas crematorium in Tuatua, Labasa, and handing over of the gas crematorium to the trustees will come within the year. This project will complement the natural practice as the gas cremator is environment friendly. We have also planned three similar projects in the West in the coming year. Madam Deputy Speaker, to commemorate and celebrate 145 years of the arrival of our Girmit ancestors in Fiji, my Ministry this year, will take lead in organising an event at the Lautoka Girmit Centre to celebrate the arrival of the Girmitiyas in Fiji, and to acknowledge and appreciate their valuable contribution to the progress and prosperity of Fiji. Honourable Sashi Kiran is assisting me as the chairman of this organising committee, and we have plans to make this important day in our calendar a memorable one. Again, it is the Government that has given significance to the Girmitiyas and its children by making it a public holiday for a second time in our history. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency in his concluding remarks stated that the Coalition Government is committed to protecting and preserving our traditions, culture, language and to support this objective, the Ministry has partially supported a 10-member youth group who are participating in the International Ramayan Festival in India. Their participation at this event is a testimony that the Coalition Government is committed to support and show case various cultures and its practices in the international level. More importantly, to maintain and preserve our culture and allow continuity of this practices for generations to come. Madam Deputy Speaker, my Ministry has a significant task ahead and as His Excellency elaborated in his speech to rebuild Fiji, we have to get everyone together, have a sense of belonging, trust and cooperation among people from diverse backgrounds. It is all about building strong united communities where we feel supported, valued and responded to. Madam Deputy Speaker, moving onto my other portfolio of Ministry of Sugar Industry, I wish to shed some light on the sector. I was very inspired by His Excellency’s Speech when he reflected on his passion about the sugar industry as I do and both of us are also farmers. His Excellency has spent much of his time growing up with the Indo-Fijian families, especially during the harvesting season. He also had a crucial role as a Director on the Board of the Fiji Sugar Corporation in providing strategic directions to the company. Madam Deputy Speaker, the members of this august Parliament are aware of the critical financial situation of the Fiji Sugar Corporation and the overall sugar industry must go through. Currently, we are barely achieving 1.5 million tonnes of cane compared to 3.5 million tonnes of cane we harvested in the good times. Whilst the rest of the sugar producing companies have moved into diversification, FSC has not conducted any research and development activities to explore diversification opportunities to generate additional income in its better days when it benefitted from the European Union under the preferential sugar price. It has only produced raw sugar and this will not take us too far, therefore, diversification is a must for the future sustainability of the industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, the problems are many and as a new Minister for Sugar Industry and a farmer too, I have a challenging role in turning this industry around. It is not impossible, sugar as a resource-based sector is important for the livelihood of around 20 percent of Fiji’s population and to bring revenue for the country that supports in the reduction of national debt as it still brings more than $200 million in terms of foreign revenue, let alone the employment it provides to the people in the Western Division and in my howe town. Madam Deputy Speaker, to ensure that the industry is sustained, my target is to achieve 1.8 million tonnes of cane in 2024 and over 2.5 million tonnes of cane within the next five years. These targets will become part of the National Development Plan that will craft the future vision of Fiji.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>168 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 My plans are to immediately address issues on the farm, harvesting, transportation and efficiency of the three mills. The Coalition Government, Madam Deputy Speaker, has fully supported the industry in the 2023-2024 Budget and it will also support towards the next budget as well. Yesterday, Madam Deputy Speaker, a Member on the other side of Parliament mentioned about Rakiraki. Had this Government not butchered the Penang Mill and sold it as scrap, we would have certainly achieved more than 1.8 million tonnes of cane years back, let alone insurance payout of $8.5 million for the damage to Penang Mill from TC Winston which was used elsewhere by the former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Abdul Khan. Because of these decisions of the FijiFirst Government saw many farmers exit from the industry. We have plans to bring them back and the good days are coming, and we will do it with full commitments. Madam Deputy Speaker, all citizens in the sugar industry will be given equal opportunities. We will be supporting all existing farmers and potential farmers who are willing to join the industry and farm. We are already offering grants of one-third or a maximum of $7,500 for new farmers who want to purchase farms for cane farming as well as paying for lease renewal costs. This grant is accessible for both men and women, young and older generation and for all Fijians. Madam Deputy Speaker, a member on the other side of Parliament earlier stated that the Coalition Government did nothing for land leases and farmers. I found that strange. Does he not know that a taskforce was formed by the Coalition Government under the leadership of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister to resolve matters concerning land leases, renewals and premium issues? Apart from these, we have grants for the upgrade of cane access roads, infield drainage, cane planting, manual harvesting, cane cartage, cage bins, farm mechanization, guaranteed cane price and incentives to reward our hardworking farmers. Our strategy is to fully mechanize the sugar industry as a response to address shortage of labour for cane planting, cultivation as well as harvesting. So, we will bring cane planters and fertilizer applicators for farmers. We have kept searching for harvesters for hilly land but so far we have not found a suitable one. However, in the meantime, Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) is getting steel tracks to convert the current mechanical harvesters into semi-track machines that can ease some burden on the undulated land. We will continue to look for hilly-land-harvesters and I am hoping to find something soon. Madam Deputy Speaker, on the milling side, we have plans to venture into diversification to produce value added products such as refined sugar and sugar products, increase co-generation capacity of the mills and of course ultimately to look at ethanol plant in Fiji. Such relations will help benefit our industry through exchange of technical expertise and technologies and these cannot be done overnight. Madam Deputy Speaker, the current mills are operating below capacity and needs attention to improve their efficiency. Soon, I will be getting experts from India to assess the three mills. These experts will provide a report at no cost as professional fees, and they are coming from Delhi. Madam Deputy Speaker, upon the completion of the assessment, we will get an idea on our short-term solutions of the three existing mills. The experts will also provide a report on Penang Mill on whether a new mill with full capacity to refine sugar or will only extract juice and transport to Ba Mill. (Inaudible interjection) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Do not laugh! Listen!</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 169 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen, listen! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Other plans, Madam Deputy Speaker, are to explore setup of refinery to refine raw sugar and sell at premium price. This will not only increase FSC’s income but the farmers as well. In addition, FSC will need to expand co-generation capacity of the mills to supply green energy to the Electricity Fiji Limited grid. Other countries are moving into supply of renewal energy and nothing should stop us from establishing ethanol plants in Fiji to produce ethanol for local consumption and of course to export. Fiji is importing fuel worth millions of dollars where the aviation industry is the biggest consumer of fuels. So, we have potential for ethanol green energy to reduce import bills and support the reduction of carbon emissions and mitigation of climate change impacts. Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of capacity building, we are advocating quality research, development of technology and transfer to our field officers and farmers. Last year, many trainings including separate trainings for women were organised by the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) and Fiji Sugar Corporation in all Mills. The training involved various aspects, including farmers’ field days, demonstrations of new technology and awareness of cross-cutting issues such as climate change, et cetera. The SRIF will continue to conduct high quality research and transfer knowledge of technology to stakeholders. Climate change has become one of the major challenges of the industry. In our efforts to reduce risks of climate change, the industry is developing climate resilient varieties. Farmers are also encouraged to practice integrated nutrient management to ensure improvement and maintenance of soil health. It is a compulsory requirement for all farmers to get the soil tested to ensure proper nutrients are applied to farms for their newly planted cane. Madam Deputy Speaker, we are building financial security for all farmers. For this, the Sugarcane Growers Council has continued to mitigate some level of risks for all growers under the bundled insurance scheme where farmers are encouraged to take voluntary parametric insurance. We are also progressing well, Madam Deputy Speaker, in reviewing the Sugar Industry Act to incorporate our plans for conducting the Sugarcane Growers Council election, which will give the voice back to the sugarcane farmers. In addition, Madam Deputy Speaker, we want our farmers to learn international best management practices in farming. To advocate this, we have sent 18 persons, including 14 farmers, to acquire experience and knowledge from cane farmers in India with the support of the Indian Government. These farmers will come back to share knowledge with fellow farmers in their localities. The Sugar Cane Growers Fund is ever ready to avail finance to the growers and recently launched a new product whereby it is offering new loan for purchase of new farms with an interest rate of 1.99 percent for the first year. Madam Deputy Speaker, we all know about the finances of FSC that is struggling to come out of the legacy of financial mess of over $400 million in debt accumulated over the last 16 years. But we need to find a workable solution to generate income for the company. To address FSC’s financial constraints, we are looking at joint venture schemes. We will soon get into discussions with the FNPF and Fijian Holdings for possible business models whereby the investors and FSC will partner to develop properties for various purposes such as for hospitality, medical, retirement and light commercial sector.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>170 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the sugar industry is here to stay and we will make it bigger, better, modern and mechanised. We have demonstrated this by paying the farmers the highest ever payment in cane proceeds of $91.38 per tonne for the last season. No other government has done that and we have not short-changed either. I will ensure that all stakeholders both, from the Multi-Ethnic and Sugar Industry are working together to achieve the set targets in the short and long-term. Madam Deputy Speaker, before I sit down, I would like to show an example of how mismanagement was happening in the yesteryears of the industry. There is a report here which was compiled in 2016, and you know what happened. When this report was being compiled about Mr. Abdul Khan, there was so many transactions where money was paid. (Hon. A. Bia interjects) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Yes, we are going to fix it. All I am saying is that these types of commissions were made. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Standing Order 60 on relevance. He is not replying to His Excellency’s Speech and he has also run out of time. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau. Honourable Minister, are you winding up? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker, because they do not want to listen to the truth, so I will end here. HON. S. NAND.– Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of this august Parliament, friends, families, and fellow citizens who are present in the gallery and those who are watching us live on the Walesi platform; a very good morning to you all. I rise to respond to his Excellency’s of gracious Speech during the opening of the 2024 Fijian Parliament Session. Madam Deputy Speaker, quite a lot was covered by His Excellency in his Address. A paragraph each was devoted to each Ministry, however, I would have loved to see some in-depth policy issues that will gear Fiji in the right direction. I totally agree with the Honourable Prime Minister when he reiterated His Excellency’s words, and I quote, “It is, however, unfortunate that some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust among our communities for their own political ends”. My advice to the honourable Prime Minister is to look within your group. (Laughter) HON. S. NAND.– The answer to your issues lies within. A classic example is the Viria Water Project. Every box was ticked before the funding was given by ADB. The project was completed and was due to be commissioned in August 2023. What happened to the commissioning? Why has it not started supplying water to the greater Suva-Nasinu corridor. (Hon. Ro F. Q. Tuisawau interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- I am taking about its commissioning:</span></p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 171 Madam Deputy Speaker, is it the case of some political interference, and thus demand more compensation before the project is commissioned?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

They are</h4><p>saying that the water is not flowing, but it is flowing. That needs to be corrected. HON. S. NAND.–Madam Deputy Speaker, my question was, has it been commissioned officially? No, it has not, stick to the point, do not mislead the house. Why has it not been commissioned? Is it the case of some political influence, and thus demand more compensation before the project is commissioned? Do something about it, honourable Prime Minister. Otherwise, it will be a step forward and two steps backwards. Madam Deputy Speaker, results are best achieved when everyone works as a team. It is rather unfortunate that in this Coalition Government, everyone is pulling to their own way. This Coalition Government does not think twice before throwing its own people under the bus to suit its own agenda. When will they get the confidence of the people? Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency has talked about empowering our people, and I respect that thought. However, is this Government’s action leaning towards that? The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation and Acting Minister for Education very proudly stated that they have forgiven 53,725 student loans. Is it totally forgiven? The Coalition Government celebrated the Girmit Day last year, but little did they advise the people of Fiji that they are introducing Girmit 2.0 for our youth. Madam Deputy Speaker, the 53,725 graduates who’s TSLS loan has been forgiven, do not walk free. They have been bonded by the Coalition Government for three years to seven-and-a-half years, depending on what they have studied. Their travels, vacation with families and attending urgent overseas engagements have all been affected. They have to find guarantors and get clearance for FRCS before they can engage in any overseas travel. I, as a Commissioner for Oath, have seen the struggle these students go through in getting those forms filled by the guarantors and the form being endorsed. This policy is all geared towards stifling the growth of the individual. If they want to migrate or work outside of Fiji to develop their career, they have to pay the remaining bond term before they are allowed to travel. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- What’s wrong with that? HON. S. NAND.- These students were better off with FijiFirst conditions where…</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>172 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. NAND.- Listen, listen! HON. S. NAND.- … if they wanted to work outside, they only had to pay half of the total debt and the other half was totally forgiven and this is the real forgiveness, not converting into Girmit. So, to the 53725 graduates, I would like to say, “Welcome to Girmit 2.0! Courtesy of this Government”. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is heartening to note that His Excellency has acknowledged that agriculture will continue to be the backbone of our economy for food security and export. The Agriculture Sector is a sector that keeps the nation ticking through thick and thin. It is pleasing to note that the Ministry of Agriculture has come up with a 5-year strategic plan. I hope this is not only on paper but will result in actions on the ground.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- We will do more than you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Listen! Madam Deputy Speaker, the cash crop farmers are struggling with the high cost of production. The seed cost has gone up, the cost of fertilizer and other inputs has gone up, transportation cost has skyrocketed. To add to the misery, by the time these products go past the craters on the road, a considerable percentage of these products are beyond sellable state. Even in the international Trade Administration – Fiji Country Commercial Guide that was published on 23rd January, 2024, it mentions, and I quote: “The sector also faces several challenges including natural disasters, inadequate infrastructure, and high transportation and input costs.” Everyone is acknowledging this fact but the Coalition Government is in a denial mode, I wonder way? How will the farmers survive? The Agriculture Sector aid should be well targeted and well monitored. I have just been informed that the tractor that was given to the Deepwater community is kept by an elite few and the other farmers of Deepwater are unable to access that tractor for their farming needs. This is not an effective aid. So, someone in the Ministry is sleeping. Madam Deputy Speaker, the livestock sector is also in a miserable state. The strategic direction is missing to steer Fiji towards robust livestock sector. In the 2023-2024 Budget, the honourable Minister of Finance blindly allocated funds to import dairy animals into the country without consulting the relevant stakeholder. This fell facedown and now we are told that they no longer will be getting the live animals to support the dairy industry. Money allocated for farmers to improve production in not reaching the farmers and part of it is kept by intermediatory organisations as administration expenses or mark-up. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Livestock Sector, the cost of inputs has gone up too. In such cases, farmers are bound to take shortcuts to make ends meet. When shortcuts are taken, there is a blatant disregard to husbandry practices and the livestock becomes susceptible to disease and bad management practices.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 173 An example of Dairy Sector is the Calf Milk Replacer which is essential ingredient in the dairy industry. From $161 in late 2022, the price has gone up to $251. That is absurd! How will the farmers be able to support this and be able to get to this ingredient and use it in the dairy industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am in no way blaming the honourable Minister for Agriculture or his team of officers. They are trying to do their best with limited resources they have been allocated with. They have been asked to run with their legs tied down. The root cause of this is poor fiscal policies. If fiscal policies are set, taking into consideration these commodities, these segments will prosper. The Government needs to ensure that funds allocated to the Ministry is released on time for it to be effective. Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency alluded to raising the standard of living for our communities. But is this Coalition Government working towards that? No, I do not think so. I do not know in which world this Coalition Government is living in. They continually avoid recognizing that poverty in this country has significantly gone up. People are struggling to make ends meet, the cost of housing has gone up, parents are finding it difficult to put food on the table, the cost of food has gone up by an alarming rate, parents are now tasked to fork out extra for school levies, things have gone beyond the reach of ordinary people and only the elite few can afford it. Despite all these, the Coalition Government, especially the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is in a denial mode. On 27 th December, 2023, a newspaper article read, and I quote: “Cost of living lower, said Prasad”. Is this for real? Has he talked to the market vendors? Has he talked to the BBQ sellers? Has he talked to the construction workers? Has he talked to the housewives and domestic workers? Has he talked to the farmers? Has he visited the rural and peri-urban areas and talked to them? Madam Deputy Speaker, my suggestion for the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is to visit these people and talk to them. Then only he will know what they are going through. I met some taxi drivers recently and they were really worried about the high cost of inputs. Some of them have resorted to driving for 10 hours to 14 hours a day to take home a decent income to look after their families. That is dangerous - a person driving for 10 hours to 14 hours a day. But they cannot do much, they have to work that hard to make ends meet. They are burdened with high cost of vehicle parts and consumables. These are the people who should be heard in making policies and decisions. It feels as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is clearly avoiding contact them. But these are the people whom he promised during his Election campaign that with good policies, he will bring the cost of living down, and that was the promise. But then, did he do it? No, on the contrary, he is quoted as saying, and I quote: “Cost of Living not determined by the Government, says Minister for Finance.” This showed that he lied through his teeth to fool the voters just to get into Parliament. I will let the voters decide if he is to be believed the next time he comes around. Again, this high cost of living and increased poverty is because of poor fiscal policies. Madam Deputy Speaker, every now and then, when one raises the issue of high cost of living and the rising cost of goods, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance and</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>174 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 13 th March, 2024 Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is quick to respond that it is a global phenomenon. Of course, it is, and a good Government will make fiscal policies as such that it will stimulate growth and reduce the cost of living. If there is a global phenomenon, a good Government will not go ahead and raise taxes and other duties. However, in Fiji this was not done, and our people were pushed with both hands towards poverty. Again, poor fiscal policies is to be blamed here. (Hon. M. S. N. Kamikamica interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> It is 14 months now, you cannot go back and say, “FijiFirst Government”.</p><p>Now, it is for you to go and do it. Madam Deputy Speaker, investment in this country is all time low. People have shelved their investment projects until such time there is confidence in the economy. Once the investors see confidence in the economy, they will invest. You will not have to beg them to invest, like someone did recently in Nadi. If the fiscal policies are right, confidence will surely show in the economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, crime over the last 14 months is alarming. Please, people do not feel safe walking on the streets after 7.00 p.m. One never knows when he or she will be burgled or robbed. The incidence of serious crimes such as manslaughter or murder is alarming. Theft has taken a new turn now. Apart from business and residential properties, thieves are now targeting farms, farm produce and farm animals. Farmers in Koronivia, Viria, Laken in Tailevu have all complained about loss of farm equipment, farm produce and farm animals. As alluded earlier, farm inputs are not cheap, and losing them after devoting one’s time, money and effort is heartbreaking. I come with facts. A classic example is farms in Waidalice, Tailevu. Farmers had their rootcrops ready for harvesting in December. A couple of evenings before the planned harvest, the entire field was harvested by the thieves and taken. Nothing was left for the farmer or the market, not a single mosel was left. This is what people voted for. Is this the change that people voted for? (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. NAND. – Absolutely everything! Then to add salt to injury, when the farmers went and complained to the police that their produce was stolen, you know what the police said – “get a security guard to guard your farm.” (Chorus of interjections) HON. L. D. TABUYA.– Which police station?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND:</span> – Waidalice Police Post.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA:</span> – Where is the report? HON. S. NAND.– You go and talk to them, that is your job, not mine. I have given you the information, go and verify it. Is this the change people have voted for? Is this the security people have been provided with?</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 175 Madam Deputy Speaker, unprecedented levels of hard drugs are landing on our shores. This was not happening under the FijiFirst Government. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. NAND.– Unprecedented levels of drugs! This is due to poor policing in guarding and monitoring our waters. What is the Government doing about it?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA:</span> – Sixteen years, you did nothing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Why can the Government not allocate more resources in guarding our waters? Why can they not? The answer is paisa nahi hai, no money! The Civil Service has ballooned. Overseas travel has ballooned. Probably this is where all the money is going. And do not talk about loans, you have not paid a single cent. On the contrary, you have increased it. Does the Government think that the people who were caught and produced in the court are the ones involved in the hard drugs? These drugs do not come cheap and there is more to what the eye can see. Go ahead and investigate, please. Do not sacrifice the pawns to save the king. Madam Deputy Speaker, most of the hardship for our citizens in the last 14 months is because of poor planning, poor management and poor fiscal policies. I am sure everyone in this Parliament knows who’s turn is to go under the bus now. His Excellency advised everyone to enhance transparency. How transparent is this Government? Madam Deputy Speaker, the question I propose to the Government is, “What was the reason for the six people trip to Macau?” Was it sightseeing? Did it have any national reasons? Who paid for that trip? Was it the Government or was it the Chinese delegation who is selling the idea of establishing a casino in Fiji? Looks like there is more to come before us. Madam Deputy Speaker, in our Foreign Policy, our stance against the ceasefire in the Israel- Palestinian war is incorrect. Not only me, but majority of our people feel that the Government is wrong. Remember Palestinians are not Muslims alone, they are Muslims and Christians. Our narrow focus has restricted us from seeing the whole picture. Madam Deputy Speaker, I was really taken aback by a criticism from Government by a prominent woman activist who was defending the removal of honourable Lynda Tabuya as the Deputy Leader. Those allegations are quite serious. I hope the honourable Prime Minister takes heed of those allegations and investigate. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.

HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I join the rest of the honourable Members of this august Parliament in thanking His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere for his most gracious Speech when he opened the new sitting year of Parliament on 4 th March, 2024. His Excellency reminded all of us not to lose sight of the fact that national interest is paramount at all times. He urged us to ensure that we must promote unity and diversity. His Excellency also expressed concern that a few unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust amongst our communities, and he emphasised the importance of respectful debate because of its impact on inter-ethnic relations. Madam Deputy Speaker, I have always believed Parliament to be a temple of democracy. We all had bitter and sometimes acrimonious debates in the past, and will no doubt continue doing so in the future. We can be as hard hitting as we like, however, debates of such nature should not be based on race, religion or ethnicity. It should not be used as a fear mongering tool, it should not be without lies and it should not be about making wild and unsubstantiated claims. Therefore, my rebuttal of what came out from the Opposition will actually form the basis of my reply, as well as that of the Ministry that I am entrusted with, will do this year. I want to begin by thanking the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition for their very dignified, respectful and meaningful contributions. For once, I was hopeful that the honourable Members on the Opposition side would take their cue from their Parliamentary Leader while delivering their responses. But my hope turned into disappointment very quickly. A few moments after, honourable Members started speaking from the other side, and all I have heard in the last two and a half days, Madam Deputy Speaker, lies, misinformation …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> No facts, zero facts.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ... motherhood generalisations:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in the process of my delivery, I will give you several examples of what those lies were. It was told this morning, for example, honourable Naivalurua said that in the last elections campaign the parties promised to sell Fiji Airways. No manifestos for a political party in the Coalition ever said that we are going to sell the airline.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Absolute hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hogwash:</span></p><p>Then we had honourable Koroilavesau coming out and telling a massive lie when he said, “there is massive unemployment in the country.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No facts:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- No figures. The claim of massive unemployment was a massive lie. DEPUTY SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Koroleva, your Point of Order, please.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>13 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 177 HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Standing Order 90. Madam Deputy Speaker, what I have indicated in Parliament is basically massive unemployment. If he is indicating that there is an increase of employment in Fiji, that does not explain why people are unemployed around Fiji. If they are unemployed, that means they are not being trained to take over the vacancies that exist now. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I am sorry, honourable Koroilavesau, please repeat your Point of Oder.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Point of Order 90.</p><p>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Are you sure?</p></body>
