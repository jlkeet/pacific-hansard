<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I would like to thank each and everyone of you for the contributions you have made yesterday. I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting once more and for all those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet, thank you for taking an interest in the proceedings of your Parliament. This week we will continue to hear the responses to His Excellency the President’s Address to Parliament, which was delivered on Monday, 4 th March, 2024. Honourable Members, before we proceed further, just a reminder to each and everyone of you that as I had stated a while ago, you are offering your responses to His Excellency’s Address. Expunged Words from Daily Hansard I heard from two speeches delivered yesterday, one from the Government side and the other from Opposition, saying that it was their right of reply. Honourable Members, just to be reminded once again that the right of reply will only be given or provided for the mover of a motion. In this particular instance, the mover of the motion is the honourable Prime Minister. He will be offered the right of reply at the end of your responses. I hope that is very clear and I will make an instruction here that those who stated that it was their right of reply, those words will be expunged from the Daily Hansard. I hope we will agree so we keep with consistency at the same pace. If people are still worried about who made those words, one was made by honourable Esrom Immanuel in his response and also honourable Sanjay Kirpal.</p><p>78 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 12 th March, 2024</p></body>
