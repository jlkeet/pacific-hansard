<body><h3>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3><h4>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 2 nd December, 2024, I move that: The Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 20/2024), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we had some discussions on Monday on this Bill which is very clear. The short title, the amendment to the Act decided the Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Act 2024 and if approved, this Act comes into force on a date appointed by the Minister by notice in the gazette. The only amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is section 8(1) of the Presidential Pensions Act 1994, which is amended to delete “five years”, substituting it with “three years”, because of the situation we are in where the presidential term in the 2013 Constitution is for three years or prior. Previously it had been five years. The pensions were calculated or determined by the term of the time, rather than a term in office, as had been changed in the Constitution. We find ourselves now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have the first President who only served a term of three years, although they may be appointed for a further term. The immediate past President served only three years and should not be denied the benefits he would have derived if he had served the full five years. I thank the honourable Members who had supported the motion to bring it this far, and I also thank the Turaga na Tui Macuata for his term, and we do not want to deny him any of the benefits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen that our Heads of State had really carried the flag of the nation well wherever they had gone. The immediate past President had carried that flag to the Olympic Games, World Cup Rugby, United Nations General Assembly and has really been a worthy holder of the Office of Head of State - President of Fiji. Without any further ado, I commend this Bill before the House. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list of three speakers, and may I remind that each speaker will only have 10 minutes each for their intervention. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the floor on the motion that is before this august House on the amendment to the Presidential Pensions Act 1994. It is a legislation that has covered the pensions for Presidents and also for Governor-Generals in the past, those who</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 2533 had been our Heads of State and also when we did have then the Vice Presidents of Fiji. It is something that is important and relates to the highest office of the land in terms of the Commander- in-Chief of our Fiji Military Forces and all that it entails, hence the Head of State. First, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister and members of the Executive, who have brought this up because as we can see, there is an anomaly, to some degree, between the duration of the term that they serve and the way that it was set in the original legislation. I think this sort of motion or Bill being brought up under Standing Order 51 makes sense because it is apparent that there is a need for it. No one needs to get a big textbook to be able to see that need. There is nothing new that has come up. It is not a substantive change, it is something just to correct, something that needed to be corrected. I think this is something that the Government needs to realise - you use Standing Order 51 for something like this, that is sensible. The good thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this is an Opposition that is sensible. We do have our senses about this. In the past, we have had an Opposition who would sit on this side and oppose anything and everything. This particular Opposition, we do have our senses with us, and we see that this is something that is just logic or something that needs to be done. It needed to be done so that is why, as the Opposition, this is something that was ideal for Standing Order 51, not aquaculture. The Aquaculture Bill is a totally new Bill. It should have gone through the whole process but because it is sensible and look at us, we are all sensible, including those on this side who really support the other side, we are all sensible on this side of the House. That is the reason why. For me and all of us on this side, we unequivocally support this Bill. It makes sense, it is a sensible move and we are, I would say, the sensible Opposition, not like that lot when they were sitting on this side. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support this whole episode of nominating Presidents. We have the process where the honourable Prime Minister has a nominee, and the honourable Leader of the Opposition has a nominee. However, that particular process has now ended. The former President has now departed and is back in Macuata. We now have a new President. In the appointment of the current President, one of the things that concerns us, which is the second reason, is the flip-flopping nature in which the Government approached this issue. Honourable Prime Minister, with all due respect, Sir, we once again saw that flip-flopping nature which was apparent right from the very outset ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Standing Order 60 on relevance. Also, it is unnecessary that the honourable Member is casting aspersions on the appointment process. He is talking about flip flops. His Excellency the President has been appointed by a process of Parliament. This Parliament appointed him. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unparliamentary, irrelevant, and an attempt to bring disrepute to the Office of the President by raising the matter of the appointment of the President. MR. SPEAKER.- I do agree and I will rule honourable Usamate out of order in that particular respect. You may continue nevertheless on other aspects of it, if you wish. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not question the manner in which His Excellency the President was appointed, I do not cast aspersions on that. I think we now have the honourable President who is in place, Na Gone Turaga Na Tui Cakau, and there is nothing that I will say that says that there is anything wrong with that. It has been done. I was just talking about the fact that the</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>2534 Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 nominations changed over time and that is alright also because it is the prerogative of the honourable Prime Minister to change his nominations. (Honourable Members interject) HON. J. USAMATE.- Hold your horse! I think one of the things that did happen here, to a large extent, was the build up of expectations. I am sorry, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Usamate. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024. This Bill, at the outset, it is a clear, simple ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> A Point of Order, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, honourable Usamate. HON. J. USAMATE.- Just a clarification, I was under the impression that you had asked me to stop. Is that correct? MR. SPEAKER.- Well, I have asked you to stop, yes, now. HON. J. USAMATE.- I was under the impression that you had asked me then, that is why I sat down. MR. SPEAKER.- I said, “do continue if you wish” but you then sat down, so that ceases your</p><h4>opportunity to present. I did ask you to continue, that is correct.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Can I just clarify, Sir? MR. SPEAKER.- What do you want to clarify from me? HON. J. USAMATE.- I was under the impression that you had asked me to stop, that is why I stopped talking. I did not realise that you had given me leeway to continue. MR. SPEAKER.- It is on the record. I did ask you to continue if you wish, but then you sat down and said you are done. Continue, honourable Naivalurua. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this is a very simple clear amendment Bill that can be easily discussed in a very short time. It is a Bill that is urgent. Secondly, it is a Bill of necessity. It is quite clear from the discussions on the Bill that it has been long overdue and there is a misalignment of the Constitution to the actual Act, in my understanding, of this. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the amendment will surely bring a degree of fairness to His Excellency the President who has recently retired. If we fast-track this quickly, he will be able to receive a fair remuneration of what he is supposed to receive. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of the House, we are clear on our position. We support this amendment Bill for the simple reason that it is urgent and a matter of urgency. But the point that I</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 2535 would like to emphasise is that it was long overdue. It should have been realigned long ago, but it was not, so let us do it now. I, and our G9 Bloc, support the amendment of this Amendment Bill. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, fellow Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise to support the Bill that was moved in this august House by the honourable Prime Minister on Monday, 2 nd December, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I do that, I suppose I should join the chorus of congratulations and well-wishes that have been expressed in this House by honourable Members, as well as outside of the House, to your good self for your appointment as the Speaker of this august Parliament. I am sure that you would have already observed by now that it is, indeed, a little harder to maintain the House that you had, compared to the house that you had previously had domain over in the courts. Perhaps on a lighter side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we are well into the evening, in the courts, only one lawyer has a right of audience when he or she is on her feet. In this House, Sir, you will find that 55 Members would think that they all have a right of audience all at the same time, even when you have only given permission to one. But I wish you all the very best, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A bit of background and context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, indeed, a very short Bill. It seeks to correct a legacy error of the previous Administration. Let me correct myself, Sir. The misconception of a legacy and the era that they did not correct. What was the legacy? Around 6th September, 2013, a new Fiji Constitution was signed into law by decree. We all know how that Constitution was constructed - by a few, quite possibly by one, and forced on the people of Fiji. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- This was after the widely consulted Yash Ghai Draft which was released in March 2013. Later, as we all know, was hideously burnt at the back of the Printing House. On whose orders? That attack on a democratic consultative process was done. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some honourable Members on the other side of the House know.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Point of Order, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, honourable Usamate, your Point of Order? HON. J. USAMATE.- My Point of Order is Standing Order 60 – Speech must be relevant. We are talking about an amendment to this Bill and the honourable Member is talking about Yash Ghai and the making of Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not talking about our Constitution. The speech making is totally irrelevant. We are just talking about the amendment. MR. SPEAKER.- Order! I will just allow him for a little bit more. Carry on, honourable Minister. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, could I just rehash that? On whose orders that attack on the democratic consultative process was done? Perhaps, some honourable Members on the other side of the House know. Now, with the passing of the Truth and Reconciliation Act yesterday, they are now free to tell us who gave those orders. So, the much publicised fanfare of constitutional making in 2013 that provides for the President’s Office’s functions, powers, terms in office and other provisions concerning that office of the President, Section 85(1) of the Level 7 Constitution of 2013 states, and I quote:</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>2536 Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 “The President holds office for 3 years, and is eligible for re-appointment for one further term of 3 years, but is not eligible for re-appointment after that.” Since 2013, Mr. Speaker, there have been four Presidents to-date. The first two Presidents served more than five years. The recently retired President of the Republic of Fiji served one term and, that is, three years. Whilst the two Presidents qualified for Presidential Pension, the retired recent occupant of the State House did not. Therein, Sir, is the error of the so-called legacy of the FijiFirst Government. They forgot to correct the President’s Pension Act of 1994, in particular, section 8, to align the constitutional term of office and the entitlement that must ensue after they leave. This amendment, Mr. Speaker, that is being brought in by the Coalition Government does more than just correct the legacy error of the previous Administration but also reflects a government that is ensuring that Heads of State are treated alike after they have completed their term in office. Whether they have completed one term or after completing a re-appointment term, this Coalition Government is taking the step to ensure equity to all past Heads of State who have served our nation well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment shows a government that is committed to fairness and parity and in that regard, I urge the honourable Members of this august House and the members of the G16 Bloc to also support the Bill moved by the honourable Prime Minister. MR. SPEAKER.- I would just like to comment further, after listening to the honourable Minister, that I find his intervention relevant as a background to why the present amendment to section 8 is made. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very short reply, but I would like to just reflect on the great motion we agreed to yesterday on the Truth and Reconciliation Bill which became the Act. I would like to thank all the Members who participated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you were ambassador, one of the few ambassadors we have had during our term out of the Commonwealth in the Court of St. James, I came to present my matanigasau to Her Majesty. You became Her Majesty’s matanivanua. I still do not know what Her Majesty had told you to say to me, but I was very happy with the way she received me and I am sure that if we go through the process that we have agreed to go through in the passing of the Bill yesterday, we will have the same sort of friendship and comfortable relationship that I had with Her Majesty until her demise. However, coming back to this Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank those who participated, and I apologise for the flip flop, that was a sincere disclosure. We were sincere about moving for the reappointment of the former President, but the circumstance is beyond our control which forced us to look for someone else. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill before the House and I hope that we can now vote on it and agree. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 2537 [Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 20/2024), passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji (Act No. 16 of 2024)] MR.
