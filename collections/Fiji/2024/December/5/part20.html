BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and all those tuning in live on Parliament Facebook page. It is with great urgency and optimism that I present the Aquaculture Bill of 2024 before this Parliament today. This Bill represents not just a piece of legislation, but a pivotal moment for Fiji's economic, environmental and social future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a strategic move that will formalise and regulate our aquaculture sector unlocking its tremendous potential to drive food security, create jobs and contribute to economic growth. As we know, Fiji's fisheries resources are vital to our people contributing to food security and livelihoods, particularly for our coastal and rural communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sector has been operating without a comprehensive legislative framework to govern the rapidly changing aquaculture industry. The Aquaculture Bill of 2016, which was tabled in Parliament in 2016 and was initiated by the former Permanent Secretaries and former Minister for Fisheries, laid the groundwork for this transformative legislation. Unfortunately, that Bill lapsed when Parliament prorogued in 2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we certainly cannot afford to let this Bill suffer the same fate. Globally the aquaculture industry is experiencing unprecedented growth. According to the State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture Report of 2024, for the first time in history, aquaculture production has surpassed that of wild caught fisheries. This is a turning point for global food production, and Fiji must act now to ensure we are part of this global movement. We are already seeing increasing demand for seafood, with aquaculture offering a sustainable solution to feed a growing population and to mitigate the strain on wild fisheries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides a solid framework to regulate and support Fiji's aquaculture industry in a way that promotes sustainability, biosecurity and responsible resource management. The Aquaculture Bill of 2024 outlines the creation of designated aquaculture zones where both marine and freshwater aquaculture activities can be conducted sustainably without causing environmental degradation. This approach will protect Fiji's unique marine and freshwater ecosystems, while fostering economic growth in communities across the country. The Bill categorises licences into commercial, semi-commercial and subsistence food security types, ensuring that aquaculture enterprises are registered, monitored and met by security standards. Through this licensing system, aquaculture enterprises will gain legal recognition, empowering them to access financial support, be it loans or grants, which will fill further growth and innovation in the sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the licensing will ensure that only those meeting proper standards will operate, safeguarding our resources and preventing harm to the environment. It also means that it will track and monitor aquaculture activity, ensuring compliance with environmental laws and international best practices. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the Licensing Committee, the Scientific Committee and Advisory Council, as part of the Bill, is integral to ensuring effective governance of the sector. These bodies will work to oversee licensing, guide the sustainable management of the industry, provide scientific advice and recommend policies. Their roles will ensure that decisions are based on scientific data and best practices, while also promoting transparency and public trust in the aquaculture sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill empowers land owning units and communities to better utilise their</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>2570 Aquaculture Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill empowers land owning units and communities to better utilise their land for aquaculture, particularly in areas affected by saltwater intrusion, where agricultural activities are no longer viable. This under-utilised land cannot be converted into productive aquaculture zones, for oyster farming, seaweed cultivation and freshwater fisheries, without the risk of environmental degradation. This will create income and food security for rural and coastal communities and contribute to the overall economic resilience of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, every year the Government allocates substantial funding to support aquaculture initiatives such as pearl farming, seaweed projects and the development and maintenance of aquaculture hatcheries. This sustained investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to this sector. However, to truly maximise the potential of these investments, we need a strong and enforceable legal framework that ensures sustainability, biosecurity and long term success. The Aquaculture Bill of 2024 will provide just that, creating a foundation for growth, innovation and resilience in the sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Bill of 2024, is not just an opportunity. It is a necessity. It is a comprehensive solution to the challenges facing the aquaculture industry from environmental protection to food security and it will lay the foundation for a prosperous and sustainable future for Fiji. I urge this Parliament to support the passage of the Bill today and to ensure that we do not miss this critical moment to transform Fiji's aquaculture sector for the benefit of our people and future generations. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to speak. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Minister Bainivalu. Honourable Members, before I open the floor for debate, just go back to my initial comment about there being no time limitation on the debate. I have to retract that and in fact, because before me a list of five speakers that are allocated to speak on the debate, there are two from the G16-bloc, two from Government and one from G9- bloc. Each speaker therefore will have only 10 minutes to speak on the motion. So I will ask first, the honourable Semi Koroilavesu to deliver his statement. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir, for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Aquaculture Bill 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the discussions in the last two days has been long within our group. In my effort to convince our group for us to accept and endorse this Bill, and basically, the response that I had was that, they were not happy with the way the Bill was brought in, and I think the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka is not here, but the word they said is that “tyranny of the majority.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the background to the Aquaculture Bill has been long overdue and I wanted to highlight a few issues because the honourable Minister has indicated what the Bill implies and what it will do to the aquaculture industry within the fisheries sector. The pearl and aquarium clam breeding has been very difficult, and this Bill will maximise potential economic benefits of supporting pearl and aquarium clams. This has been practised in Laucala and Northern Taveuni by a company called Civa Fiji. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of about 5,000 aquarium clams had to be destroyed because the legislation did not give any clear indication, who the authority was, to give the okay for the export of aquarium clams. So, basically it was a decision between the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Fisheries. I am glad that this Bill will clarify that issue. The sustainable aquaculture practices that the clam and pearl breeding operations will ensure that they are environmentally friendly and would not harm our marine ecosystems. We need to support our investors that come from overseas. Civa Fiji had spent a huge amount of money with the hotel owners in Laucala and Northern</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2571 Taveuni, but to see their aquarium clams to be completely destroyed. The addressing of invasive species, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we think that tilapia is quite a good species, it is an invasive species. Whenever tilapia is introduced, it eats everything else that were naturally Fiji species. There is another species that is called barramundi. Investors wanted to bring it into Fiji. It lives in streams and rivers and it also lives on the reef. We tried very hard to fight against it because it would destroy every other fish in Fiji, but this Bill will be able to regularise and give the system that will stop this from happening in the future. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species or CITES. This is an issue that I think for the benefit of our honourable Members such is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Mr, Speaker, Sir, would know this very well. What this Bill will do, will basically make sure that there is no trade or exchanges that will destroy our ecosystem within our reefs and waters. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conversion of sugar cane land affected by sea-level rise as we convert all this land that have not been cultivated along the coast that has been affected by climate change. Coastal areas from Nadroga right to Ra, coastal areas in the west coast of Vanua Levu, warm water, beautiful and pure, but we need to develop something so that we can energise this industry, and this Bill will give us that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the event that the Bill will be passed, my friends from my group have agreed to support the Bill. So, the benefit is quite far and wide and it will benefit Fiji in the long run. The regulatory framework, the proportion proposed National Aquaculture Bill establishes a clear regulatory framework that governs the industry, ensuring that operations are conducted in a sustainable and responsible manner. It promotes sustainable practices by setting environmental standards and guidelines for aquaculture operations, helping to protect aquatic ecosystem and biodiversity. By supporting the aquaculture industry, the National Aquaculture Bill can stimulate economic growth trajectory of increased production and export opportunities creating national food security. Aquaculture can significantly enhance food security by providing a reliable source of protein and other nutrients, especially in regions where wild fish stocks are declining. A clear and legal framework can attract both domestic and foreign investment in the aquaculture sector leading to technological advances and improved production methods. Consumer protection includes provision for food safety and quality standards ensuring that aquaculture products are safe for consumption and meet market demands. Community engagement - the proposed National Aquaculture Bill can promote community involvement, support local aquaculture initiatives, foster social acceptance and participation in the industry. Disaster preparedness, it includes guidelines for disaster risk management, helping the aquaculture sector to better prepare for and respond to natural disasters or disease outbreaks. Coordination and collaboration, the Bill will facilitate collaboration among various stakeholders, including Government agencies, industry players, research institutions and local communities, leading to more effective management and development of the aquaculture sector. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, international compliance, the National Aquaculture Bill can help align our country’s aquaculture practice with international standards and agreements, enhancing its reputation in global markets. I support the Bill before the Parliament. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; today, I rise to support the</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><p>2572 Aquaculture Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024, a piece of legislation that I believe will be transformative and impact Fiji’s economy, food security and environmental sustainability. The Bill addresses the critical area, which has always been focussed here on discussion in this august Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will focus my contribution to specific areas where the Bill will greatly address the needs in those sectors. One is strengthening food security. As our population grows, the global climate challenges escalates, ensuring food security becomes paramount. This Bill emphasises sustainable practices that protects and enhances our marine ecosystem, while increasing fishing and seafood production for local consumption. By investing in aquaculture, we reduce our reliance on imports, making Fiji more self-reliant and resilient to external shocks. Second is the economic potential on aquaculture. Aquaculture represents a growing global industry, and Fiji is uniquely positioned to benefit from this growth. With our pristine waters, diverse biodiversity and strategic location, we have the resources to establish ourselves as a leader in sustainable aquaculture. This Bill creates a robust regulatory framework, providing clarity and stability for investors both, domestically and internationally. By fostering innovation and providing support to small scale farmers, it ensures that the benefits of this sector will be widely distributed across our population. Third, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is environment stewardship. We are the custodians of our environment, and this Bill will underscore our commitment to sustainable development. It sets stringent standards for waste management, habitat protection and the use of resources, ensuring that aquacultural activities do not harm our marine ecosystem. It promotes the use of modern, environmentally friendly technologies, balancing economic growth with ecological preservation. The Bill ensures that methods adopted are based on best science evidence. It also ensures that precautionary approaches are followed where scientific evidence is not available. Fourth is supporting local communities. Aquaculture offers immense opportunity for our rural communities, providing capacity building, creating jobs and uplifting livelihood. Training programmes and access to resources outlined in this Bill will empower our people to participate in the growing sector. Strengthening local communities provides an opportunity to reverse urban drift and promote self-sufficiency and sustainable resource management. Women and youth, in particular, stand to benefit as aquaculture creates inclusive employment opportunities. Fifth is global and regional leadership. By passing this Bill, Fiji sends a clear message that we are ready to lead sustainable aquaculture development in the Pacific. This legislation aligns with our commitments under international agreements such as SDGs and the Climate Action Framework. It positions Fiji as a model for other Pacific nations’ seeking to balance development and environment stewardship. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Aquaculture Bill is not just about fish, farms or economic metrics, it is about securing a brighter, more sustainable future for Fiji. It is about creating opportunities, protecting our environment and enhancing the wellbeing of our people. I urge my fellow Members of Parliament to support this Bill. Together, let us unlock the vast potential of aquaculture and set a new course for the sustainable development of our beloved Fiji. Finally, I wish to thank the Committee and the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry for their hard work. I also wish to thank honourable Koroilavesau and his team for the initiative and effort throughout the process of this particular Bill. I support the motion before the House. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to lend my support, and I have been instructed to inform Parliament of the support of the G9 Bloc also to the Bill that is before the House.</p><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2573 Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just look at the bigger picture of what this Bill will do, in 1940, tilapia was introduced into Fiji and in 1967 grass carp was brought into Fiji to help keep our rivers clear from the bekabeka i raga and all those weeds that clog our rivers. Now, grass carp thrives as a source of protein. Tilapia from being brought way back in 1940 is now cultured. The species that is now cultured is very much the species that is widely exported from Thailand, the biggest exporter of Tilapia. Way back in 1940 and today, we can culture sand fish ( dairo ), I have seen it. We culture milk fish, there is a farm in Vitawa. All this time, Mr. Speaker, aquaculture piggybacks on other legislations - piggybacks on environment legislation and piggybacks a little bit on fisheries legislation. In Fiji's fisheries, the coastal fishery is well-regulated, offshore fishery is well-regulated, aquaculture until today, when we pass this Bill will now be regulated. Aquaculture transcends from the marine aquaculture to brackishwater in the middle, to freshwater aquaculture, hence the danger that has been mentioned tonight in those ecosystems, if it is not managed properly. So, the bigger picture of this Bill, I heard mentioned tonight is the fact that we are creating history and for the first time now, aquaculture as an industry, is a fishery that will now have an Act on its own. It is now a regulated industry and when it is a regulated industry, it is a catalyst for growth. Investors will come if they want to come in and invest in this part of our fisheries in Fiji. I thank the Ministry for picking it up and bringing it now to the House. I thank those who have started the move to get aquaculture fisheries regulated and I fully support the Bill that is before the House. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I wish to thank the Natural Resources Committee on the development of this Bill, particularly the Ministry. Most of what I wanted to say has been shared as well by the speakers before me. I had very limited time in the Ministry from 2012 to 2014, and I saw the huge potentials in aquaculture. That made us join INFOFISH in Malaysia so that we can piggyback and gain from the experiences of, particularly, countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines and Cambodia, who are well ahead of us in the aquaculture industry, not only in terms of the technology development, but it is about the whole value chain. Also, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to visit India and through the then Dean of the College of Agriculture and Forestry in Koronivia, we made arrangements if I can visit a farm in India. I have forgotten the name of the place, but it is easy to get there because it is next to the National Dairy Research Institute which is about a one or two hour’s drive from New Delhi. I was privileged to be introduced to the largest fish farmer in India, a Nobel Peace Prize earner, because of his contribution to food security. But unfortunately, the arrangement did not continue because he trains officials from almost every developing country and we were in the process of sending our people and I moved again to another portfolio, Sir. I am always ready to assist where needed. We had discussions. We decided to support it, he initially opposed in which it came in, particularly under Standing Order 51. I was particularly interested in Standing Order 51 because in the definitions of the terms or the interpretations, it talks about the aquaculture industry. Although most of the Bill focuses on production right through to marketing, I have talked about the whole value chain. Processors and manufacturers of equipment and feed and individuals - I think these are some areas where probably, later on, we can revisit. I know that we attempted to bring in a nutritionist into the Ministry of Fisheries back then to help us develop nutrition for feed for aquaculture, because in Fiji, unfortunately, the feed that we have are produced by livestock feed producers and there is no</p><div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div><p>2574 Aquaculture Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 one doing specialised aquaculture feed. When aquaculture feed is thrown on the water, it must float because the fish, prawns will come up and then have a bite. Otherwise, it all sinks to the bottom of the sea. That is one of the reasons why I was interested in this and, of course, as alluded to also by honourable Viliame Naupoto, I saw the definition of “freshwater”. It means natural water. Most countries that I visited including China, probably Fiji needs to go into that area as well where they have freshwater laws on how we use freshwater? There is a law. In Fiji, we have an abundance of water, we have a shortage of water, and we do not utilise this water well. Of course, it is linked to the environment. That is another story, but we will look into it, as we come to the operationalisation of this document. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was also interested, as alluded to by honourable Koroilavesau in Clause 40 of this Bill which covers the trade of aquaculture product, and also the issue about Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). I have always argued that there is a difference between wild harvest and farmed or cultured production, because CITES is about endangered species and protection, particularly in the export of these commodities in terms of wild harvests. The clam farm in Taveuni, unfortunately, were not allowed to export clams which would have brought us millions of dollars. The good thing about that clam farm, he worked closely with the qoliqoli owners. He supplied the clams (young ones) to the qoliqoli owners and when it is ready for harvesting, he buys it again from the landowners and then he is the one that does it. I hope that this, honourable Minister, will be taken care of in this Bill because, unfortunately, back then when it was under the Ministry of Environment, it really made things difficult for the Minister for Fisheries. We had long discussions, even in Cabinet, but when it comes to the technical people on the ground, sometimes it is hard. That is the reality. This is something that will bring us a lot of potentials economically. Clause 42 is on the restrictions on the import or introducing to Fiji a live aquatic organism for aquaculture without the written authorisation of the Permanent Secretary. When I was Commissioner Northern, one of the big challenges in the North was the iguana in Qamea and Taveuni. I was told that it was just brought in as a pet, and then it was out of control, and it became a nightmare to the local population. I know at one stage, they requested the RFMF to come and shoot the iguana but then, all those animals have rights as well, now under international law. So, that became a big issue. Lastly, we will pass this law today. One thing that I learnt, Sir, from IPU meetings is the role of Parliament. It is not only about making new legislations, but Parliament has that responsibility to ensure that these laws be operationalised, they are given the resources and Parliament will also continue to provide that oversight and scrutiny so that it is implemented. I hope that this Parliament in the new direction that we are taking, will also take this responsibility in ensuring that honourable Minister for Finance provides the funding, so that the honourable Minister for Fisheries can have extra staff according to the organisation that she is going to come up with, and then we ensure that there is proper capacity development, so that it will bring the benefits that we have. Honourable Tunabuna has particularly talked about food security. Our triple burden of malnutrition in Fiji, when we were developing the body, I was arguing with Fisheries, “please, let us just concentrate on upper Namosi, upper Naitasiri, because we need to replace rourou and ota with fish.” Let us not only look at income but let us look at food security as well. I support the Bill, Sir. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the</p><div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2575 Aquaculture Bill 2024. Before I do that, I just thought I would reflect on a couple of things. Yesterday, we made history in this House and today again we are making history because we are passing some Bills that have taken a long time to get to fruition. I was actually going to pick one the other side of the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the delay of the Bills coming into the House. I think, on reflection, there is a message to all of us in what we did today, in that, if we work together, we can actually make a big difference in these years, probably that is left in our service for our country. The second thing I thought I just reflect on, in the discussions that we held with the Speaker of the Senate of Australia, she mentioned that they passed 35 Bills using the equivalent of our Standing Order 51. They did so by negotiating between the parties before they got into Parliament. It is something that perhaps going forward we can think about because: (1) We will increase the number of Bills we bring into the House which is our job. (2) We will not be using Standing Order 51 like a weapon in terms of passing of the legislation. I just thought I would share that, Mr. Speaker, just to start off with my contribution today. As a Minister responsible for Trade and MSMEs, this Bill is quite important and is a significant step towards establishing a comprehensive framework for an industry that, we all agree, has significant potential for our country. The Bill ensures, Mr. Speaker, that we sustainably develop the aquaculture industry while at same time protecting marine ecosystems, promoting biodiversity conversion and addressing the challenges of food security and environmental stewardship. The framework provided in this Bill will stimulate economic growth by encouraging investment in sustainable aquaculture practices and supporting small scale producers which in turn would boost domestic production and exports. Fiji’s aquaculture apparently began in 1937 with a common carp which was introduced in Fiji from New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 87 years later we are here in Parliament to discuss an Aquaculture Bill, a framework that will regulate this important industry and safeguard its future. Aquaculture is contributing to nation building by creating employment opportunities, encouraging investment in sustainable aquaculture practices and stimulating economic development in coastal and rural areas. It supports small scale farmers, which is quite exciting, and plays a critical role in addressing the challenges of overfishing and food security, as mentioned and is a healthy source of protein for our people. The current aquaculture production is currently valued at $11 million, with the right policy investment mechanism and resources, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is potential and a suggestion that we can even grow this industry to over a hundred million at least by 2030. The Aquaculture Bill introduces a comprehensive framework to regulate and support the sustainable development of Fiji’s aquaculture industry. It establishes mechanisms such as the Aquaculture Advisory Council and scientific committee ensuring expert oversight and evidence- based decision making. The Bill defines aquaculture areas, mandates environment impact assessments and introduces a streamlined licensing process to support compliance while fostering investment and innovation. Importantly, it safeguards Fiji’s marine ecosystems by prohibiting harmful practices such as the introduction of genetically modified species and enforcing robust biosecurity protocols. These provisions collectively empower small-scale farmers, encourage private sector investment, and ensure that the industry aligns with international standards. By supporting sustainable practices, the</p><div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div><p>2576 Aquaculture Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Bill enhances food security, reduces reliance on seafood imports and creates opportunities for rural communities. It is no secret Mr. Speaker, that the Ministry I have been honoured to lead, is guided by five general objectives; two of which are economic diversification and MSMEs and co-operatives, just pathways out of poverty. The Ministry is currently in discussion with several local farmers and financial institutions to develop and expand the aquaculture industry and support local players. I have had the privilege to meet two young, exceptional young men, Mr. Apenisa Maracava and Mr. Laisiasa Cavakiqali who are rising stars in the aquaculture industry. Mr. Maracava was one of the three recipients of the first ever Pacific Agri-Innovate Competition Fiji at the SIDS Forum in Nadi last month. This farmer is excelling in his business venture of shrimp farming by combining innovation, science and sheer hard work. The Ministry has not only provided financial support but is also building capacity to support MSMEs and their business operations. I thank the Ministry for Fisheries and Forestry in recognising the critical role that cooperatives play as a vehicle to change communities. Through the formation of cooperatives, members can enhance their skills and develop their resources together, and flourish. We have cooperatives that are engaged in seaweed and nama farming, creating employment for our women and youth. I recall when our country came to a standstill during the COVID-19 pandemic, all Fijians recognised the need to diversify the economy so that we discontinue the practice of overreliance on one sector. We, the Coalition Government, made a promise that we would look at developing our primary industries and, Mr. Speaker, the passing of Bill No. 21 of 2024 is one of the many ways we intend to keep that promise. Mr. Speaker, before I take my seat, I urge all the honourable Members of this august Chamber to reflect on the conversations the years to diversify our economy, create alternative sources of income and empower our local businesses. Passing the Aquaculture Bill of 2024 is an opportunity to turn those conversations into action. Let us come together to ensure this Bill is passed, so we can lay the groundwork for a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous aquaculture industry that benefits all Fijians. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all the honourable Members with their constructive and supportive contribution on the debate and the motion before the House. The Aquaculture Bill is one of the two Bills of the Ministry of Fisheries under the 2024 legislative agenda. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the former Ministers for Fisheries, Permanent Secretaries for Fisheries, the former Director of Fisheries, former Fisheries Officers. I also would like to thank the current staff of the Ministry of Fisheries for their hard work and continuing to push for the tabling of this Bill. We did it. Vinaka, Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Aquaculture Bill 2024 (Bill No. 21 of 2024), passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.
