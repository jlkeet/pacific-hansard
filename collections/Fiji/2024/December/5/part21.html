<body><h3>BANK OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC BILL 2024</h3><h4>BANK OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Wednesday 4 th December 2024, I move: That the Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 (Bill No. 22/2024) be debated, voted upon, and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as I said yesterday, this is a pretty straightforward Bill and I hope that we will be able to get through this very quickly. Just by way of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank of the South Pacific (BSP) Financial Group Limited formerly known Bank of South Pacific Limited, is incorporated and headquartered in Papua New Guinea with branches operating in the Pacific region including Fiji, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands and Vanuatu. The BSP Fiji Branch is registered under the Companies Act 2015 as a foreign company. In line with the global corporate financial structure and, indeed, some of the trends to gain operational efficiencies, the BSP Group Board resolved and approved the restructure of its operations in Fiji from a branch to a subsidiary structure. On this note, to the new entity for which the name has been reserved with the Registrar of Companies as BSP Financial Group Limited (BSP Fiji) will be incorporated as a company under Fiji's Companies Act 2015 with 100 percent shareholding of its parent company BSP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the restructure of this nature of a commercial operation has implications for customers, employees and other persons in legal relationships with the banking entity. And without an enabling legislation of this kind, numerous and complex legal steps would be involved to substitute, in this case, BSP Fiji for BSP legal security documents such as mortgages, debentures, general and specific security agreements, and the like. This could potentially involve a lot of transaction costs and, indeed, an inconvenience to customers, the acquiring bank and other persons dealing with the transacting banks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said when I moved the motion yesterday, this legislation has precedence. The Australia-New Zealand Banking Decree 1991 successfully proceeded day two of the takeover by ANZ of the operations of Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Many of us would remember the BNZ. The National Bank of Fiji Limited Act 2011 also facilitated the acquisition by BSP of the operations of National Bank of Fiji in 2011. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024, therefore, seeks to facilitate the restructure by the vesting of BSP’s banking businesses in Fiji to be BSP Fiji by law, and this Bill is actually modelled on the 1991 and 2011 legislation. Those who are familiar with banking, such as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications would attest to this, that there are some of the justifications on BSP Fiji to be restructured into a subsidiary company. I want to highlight the following financial market regulators preferred financial institutions within their markets being incorporated into that particular jurisdiction. Secondly, it complements the existing subsidiary approach in Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, and signals to the Fiji market that it is a local bank. But it also is about confidence in the country and confidence in the market in which the branch is located.</p><div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div><p>2578 Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Additionally, having a locally incorporated subsidiary allows for greater local board participation with consideration of a local operating environment. It allows for the segregation of Fiji market activities to a Fiji entity which, in turn, should allow for greater economic efficiency - things such as head office costs and other rationalisation that normally takes place. A subsidiary operation provides limited liability protection, shielding the parent company from the legal and financial risks associated with the subsidiary’s activities. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, subsidiaries often have a degree of autonomy in decision-making, allowing them to adapt more effectively to local market conditions and regulations. Operating through subsidiaries can help mitigate risks by segregating operations and assets, thereby, protecting the parent company’s overall financial health. There are also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, expansion opportunities that subsidiaries can facilitate, such as expansion into new markets and new industries, providing a platform for growth separate from the parent company’s care corporations. So, there is an element of independence with a local board participation, and a local operating environment Local presence also enhance the parent company's local presence, subsidiaries will add to that, fostering better relationships with customers, suppliers and stakeholders in different regions. Subsidiary also may comply with local regulation, which can streamline regulatory compliance and reduce the parent company's administrative burden. Through this Bill, Mr. Speaker, BSP Fiji will install its own board of directors here in Fiji and further enhance its current structure by having other subcommittees, requisite policies and procedures where required pursuant to RBF’s (Reserve Bank of Fiji) supervision guidelines and any legislative provisions. So, as I have said yesterday, as the consultations were held. The Cabinet had provided approval for stakeholder consultations. As I said yesterday, they were face-to-face consultations held at the BSP Fiji branch conference room. Generally, the Ministry of Finance received overwhelming support on the proposed restructure, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said, this is important for BSP and Fiji. BSP is a number one bank, and I will probably, in my right of reply, provide more details as to where BSP is in terms of the whole banking industry. As I said the other day, the urgency of this Bill contrary to my friends on the other side, the financial year ends on 31 st of December, and once this Bill is passed, BSP will be able to move on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I open the floor for debate, there are three speakers on my list and</p><h4>each speaker will have 10 minutes to speak.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, it is actually quite late in the day, and I think I did mention yesterday that this particular Bill is (I see the honourable Deputy Prime Minister smiling), is not thorny, but there is one question, which I ran by him earlier just to give him a heads up. It is just some clarity with respect to one or two issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two transactions that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister referred to were, when ANZ outright took over BNZ, and I think also when BSP took over Colonial’s operation. If I remember correctly, subject to be corrected by the honourable Minister, I think those were purchases, but this is an assignment, that is being done in-house. So, in terms of purchases and assignments, what is interesting, is within this particular Bill, and I think if I can refer to Section 18. That particular Clause reads: “No liability is created or is deemed to be created under any tax law for BSP or BSP Fiji by the divesting by BSP of the BSP business and BSP property and the vesting of the BSP business and the BSP property into BSP Fiji.”</p><div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 2579 So, you are looking at, this is going into a new entity for one, and then the vesting of BSP capital in the assumption of BSP Fiji or of the BSP liabilities. We all understand what is actually transpiring here, but what we would like to know from the honourable Minister is that, in other previous transactions, would they also be given a waiver of any tax liabilities? Because bear in mind, these are foreign-owned companies that make a large profit out of Fiji. So, is this transaction being treated as one where it is so important that they are being told that they do not have to pay any liabilities tax on this particular change of ownership, so to speak? Because it is a divestment and divesting all of its business into another one? If it was done with a private company, where you are divesting your shares, et cetera, there are taxes and things that you may be liable for. So, there may be a quicker explanation when he is going to respond, to say why is that being done, or is that a normal practice, and was that done when BSP purchased Colonial Bank and when ANZ purchased BNZ? Again, the difference here is also that that was a purchase, but this is just a clear divestment. We understand the reasons why this is being done; basically, to create operational efficiencies, et cetera. We understand that it may be a huge quagmire of difficulties involved, because you are talking about pieces of property and liabilities that are involved. We understand the operation of the particular clause in it where there is a waiver and I am talking about Clause 4(4) where it says: “no further consent, permit, notice, certification, ratification, charges, registration fees of any kind, filing fees, lodgement fees, or fees of any kind whatsoever is required to be given in respect of any instrument sought to be registered for the purpose of evidencing, recording or effecting the matters referred to in this Act. So, anything that is being done in order to facilitate this, no fees will be applicable. Basically, it's being done for zero. The state does not collect a penny. My question here and behalf of all of us is please just give us reason why? Why is the state not collecting a penny, especially in light of the fact this is not one of our Fijian institutions like HFC or FNPF or one of our other institutes like Vodafone, etc? If it’s to facilitate because they are one of the largest operators, we would like to know. Is it to facilitate because they have so many customers in Fiji, we would like to know. We do not have an objection to this happening, Mr. Speaker, we just want an explanation from the honourable Minister as to why that is happening or what is actually happening with respect to this exemption from any tax payable. If there isn't any tax liable, that's understandable, but I'm not privy all of that. The honourable Minister might be able to explain to us, whether there is a liability and that's actually being waived by virtue of that particular clause being put into the law. That was the only query that we had Mr. Speaker, I notice late in the day and I actually that's the that's something for the Minister to answer. I think that's a genuine query from all of us so that we do know if we do get asked, we can always respond to that. I thank you Mr. Speaker. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise to support Bill No. 22 of 2024. These are BSP Fiji Bill 2024, it’s a very important one to the organisation and to Fiji as well. It is simply to provide for the transfer to BSP Financial Group Fiji Ltd of the undertakings of the BSP Financial Group Ltd in Fiji for related purposes as already been mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, as also mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister, this is an important business decision moved by BSP as it seeks to be aligned with global financial structure and try to gain operational efficiencies. What we are looking at, at the end of the day, it will mean innovative and cost-effective financial services to customers. However, it is also important to bear in mind from the explanatory notes on page 13, item 1.3, that there will be implications of this kind action as being questioned by honourable Koya. There could be tax implications that can be clarified by the Deputy Prime Minister.</p><div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div><p>2580 Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 It is also mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister, the BSP Fiji Bill 2024 has precedent. We all know that the Australia-New Zealand banking Decree 1991 successfully facilitated the takeover by ANZ and so the operations of the Bank of New Zealand. And also mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister the same case also happened in the Bank of the South Pacific Limited’s acquisition of the operations of the National Bank, back in 2011. Mr. Speaker, the business restructure of BSP will need the enabling legislation. This Bill is a necessity. BSP’s financial year begins in January, and they will definitely need the law to get the transformation work done. So, I want to thank you Mr. Speaker for the opportunity, and I support the Bill that is before the House. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Bill relating to BSP. I was just reflecting over the last few days when Colonial Bank started saying that it was going to leave Fiji. I remember quite vividly reflecting on what would happen to the assets of such a wonderful bank that had done a lot for the country, and what that investor would do for the future of the financing system in Fiji? It was the first time I heard about Bank of the South Pacific, then we all discovered they were from our brothers and sisters from Papua New Guinea and they wanted to come to invest in Fiji. Fast-forward now to 2024, they are one of the largest single investors in Fiji and will be up there in terms of lending funds. They are number three certainly in terms of institutional investment through BSP Life. They cover life insurance for quite a number of our people. And I have to say Mr. Speaker, Sir that they have done well. They have of cause have their own property in the country and they are wonderful corporate citizens. I turned a celebration for them recently, the honourable Prime Minister as well. In terms of regionalism, in terms of regional corporation, BSP has been one of the agents of regionalism in the South Pacific. They continue to move around the Pacific and have become a central part of the financing system in the Pacific. So, I guess I am saying Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you reflect on that and the importance to Fiji. Of course, when they decided to become a subsidiary and no longer a branch, and some of us especially for me, who have worked in the banking system, there is a major shift when you are a branch and becoming a company. Because the proper system of governance perhaps is a bit lighter in terms of footprint over a branch, the full extent of corporate governance gets imposed in a subsidiary. So, full corporate governance structures are imposed on the entity. I have always reflected on when foreign banks setup as branches and when they decide to become subsidiaries as in the case with BSP, it is actually a signal that they are in the country to stay. That they want to part of the fabric of the country, they have confidence in the country, and they wish to participate not only as a branch but a fully-fledge corporate citizen. Just on those reflections alone Mr. Speaker, Sir, alone when this came to Cabinet, I certainly welcomed it because it is the right thing to do for the company. I am sure the honourable Finance Minister will address the questions by honourable Koya. But just look at it this way, they are signalling to Fiji that they are here to stay, it really just the left hand passing over a bottle to the right hand, and in that simple process if they are any liabilities of course. As a country we should welcome the decision to change over to a corporate entity, because it does enhance its overall standing and also creates greater signal certainly from my perspective in terms of their participation in the banking and financial sector of our country. Mr. Speaker, on those few notes I fully support the Bill before Parliament and hope we all do</p><div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 2581 as well. Vinaka saka. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give a little bit more on BSP’s footprint enrolled in the banking industry in the country. Let me just respond to honourable Koya I think that is a very good question. Let me say first there is no new third-party involvement, so that is the first thing which essentially means that the ownership does not change. If you look at the Value Added Tax 1991 legislation, which provides exemption for financial services and zero-rating of taxable set supplies of sales for business as a going concern, that is another point. Section 18 of the Bill which you referred to honourable Koya, that is related to tax consequences of the BSP transfer. We have checked with Fiji Revenue and Customs Service) as well, it is satisfactory. Really in terms of tax, nothing changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, BSP is one of the largest corporate taxpayers and your point about profit of BSP, in fact, BSP has 6,000 shareholders and FNPF is the largest shareholder. So, what that means is that the more profit BSP makes, the better for FNPF members, but let me just give some information for our people and for Parliament. Sir, BSP offers a full range of business and personal lending products, international trade and payment services, transactions, savings accounts, plus electronic banking services across the ATMs, EFTPOS, internet, phone, and SMS banking services. It offers a full range of business and personal lending products, international trade and payment services, transaction and savings account plus electronic banking services, ATMs, you have internet, phone and SMS and banking services. In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, BSP is the number one bank by market share, having the largest loan deposit portfolio, the loan portfolio is about 26.9 percent almost 27 percent and the deposit is about 25.5 percent. They have about 398,412 customers, a network of 17 branches, 548 fulltime employees and 40 part-timers, and attachment staff. They have about 122 ATM and 319 EFTPOS. They actually offer a very significant volume of rural banking services through their partnership with postal agencies, and they have the farthest outreach right up to Rotuma. There are also about 58,736 social welfare customers who bank with BSP and are not charged any monthly service fees, and they get 4 free transactions per month. This is the nature of BSP’s banking business. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all the honourable Members for their contribution and support for the Bill. I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Haroon Ali, the Country Head for BSP; the man with 40 years of banking experience. And our staff within the Ministry of Finance including the Permanent Secretary for having the consultations and getting this process sorted out. We had two options; we could have done this through transfer by agreement and the other option is legislation. We preferred the legislation which is easier than the transfer by agreement option. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to the honourable Members. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- We will now proceed through vote on the motion. Question put. Motion agreed to. [ Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 (Bill No. 22/2024) passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. 21/2024)] MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that bring us to the end of today’s sitting. I thank you all for your contributions and if I may say so I think that we have done remarkably well today, considering the seven Bills and their importance to the country that have gone through and passed.</p><div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div><p>2582 Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Wish you well tonight and Parliament stands adjourn until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. Thank you, honourable Members.
