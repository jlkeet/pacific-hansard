<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Status of Disaster Preparedness (Question No. 293/2024) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the Ministry’s status of disaster preparedness, considering we are into the hurricane season? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; ni sa bula vinaka. I rise in Parliament today to share several ongoing initiatives; the essential disaster preparedness activities undertaken by the Ministry through the National Disaster Risk Management Office (NDMO). I wish to begin by highlighting the real impacts of climate change on Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The recent COP29 that concluded last month, stressed that SIDS were at most risk from the adverse impacts of climate change. For our small island nation of Fiji, climate change is causing natural hazards to become more severe, happening more often in affected areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of background, Fiji is located between two major tectonic plates, the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate. Due to subduction zone movements of tectonic plates around Fiji, earthquake activities are occurring regularly. Earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean Rim including, for instance, South America and Japan, can also generate tsunami wave threats for Fiji. And an island nation with numerous maritime islands, coastal communities, coastal roads and structures, Fiji is extremely vulnerable to tsunamis as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the nation of Fiji, climate security remains as one of our biggest threats. It has put pressure on our systems, to respond with limited resources and capabilities. The International Organization for Migration’s explanation is climate security refers to the direct and</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2503 indirect impacts of climate crisis. On peace and security, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating underlining vulnerabilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, climate security or climate change remains the greatest single threat to livelihoods, security and wellbeing. Threats to climate security which manifest through variations in weather patterns are placing added stress on our government’s targets, not only on the Sustainable Development Goals, but also our National Development Plan. The Fiji Government has long recognised the serious threat climate change poses to our country. Rising seas continue to erode shorelines and encroach on coastal communities. Between 1980 and 2016, annual economic damage caused by disasters in Fiji has been estimated at $35 million. We recall in 2016, following TC Winston, the overall economic value of destroyed assets reached $1.3 billion, nearly half of which came in the form of damages in the aftermath of the disaster, as the national economy struggled to recover. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our efforts to implement measures on the ground to adapt to climate change, we also recognise that some community infrastructures will have to be permanently relocated as the only way to avoid tragedy, save lives, protect livelihoods and prevent social disruption. However, we will only consider relocating people as a last resort after all other feasible adaptation options have been explored. While Fiji has moved forward in undertaking proactive measures to reduce disaster risks, the impact of national hazards on our communities remain. Geographically situated within the Pacific Rim of Fire and on the path of tropical cyclones in the South Pacific Ocean, the onslaught of national hazards on our fragile environments and economies are given every year. For our small island nation, the domestic realities of responding to disasters include, but are not limited to pressures on national budgets to cater for the continuous response activities that include activating sustaining emergency operating centres. Whilst financial provisions are made for bigger declared events, it is often the smaller, undeclared events that often result in the reallocation of ministry and national budgets that undermine our national development plans. Mr. Speaker, Sir, like our Pacific Island neighbours, we are archipelago of islands spread out and separated by the ocean. Domestic response efforts are often challenged by the tyranny of distance and intermittent connectivity. Ensuring that adequate response and relief efforts reach the last mile, is often a challenge, but met with the assistance of our regional and international partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an initiative that will greatly boost disaster preparedness is the recent passing of the National Disaster Risk Management Act 2024. The Act takes into consideration critical developments in the disaster risk management and humanitarian space and ensures that Fiji’s disaster legislation is up to date with a future that is increasingly under the threat of climate change. The Act captures future developments, obligations and thematic areas that will become the new normal in the disaster space. These include considerations aligned with the reviewed National Humanitarian Policy, the National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy, National Tsunami Response Plan, National Emergency Response Team Mechanism and Government’s future priorities identified in the National Development Plan. Furthermore, the Act ensures that Fiji is aligned to evolving global and regional perspectives specifically addressing the requirements of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, Sustainable Development Agenda 2015-2030, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015- 2030 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change 2050.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2504</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the provisions address the following: (1) human-induced and technological disasters; (2) whole of society and participatory approaches, inclusion and vulnerable group approaches; (3) cluster arrangements for effective response coordination; (4) the implications of climate change; (5) management of disaster-generated waste; (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) mortuary facilities for disaster victims and mass casualities; (11) gender equality and disability; (12) authority levels during disasters; (13) shifting the focus from managing disasters to managing risks; and (14) whole-of-government approach. engagement of the private sector in disaster management efforts; incorporation of regional and international agreements and other pertinent matters; civil military engagement; expedited clearance of aid consignments; Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with the National Disaster Risk Management Act 2024, the NDRMO continues to both, lead and work together with its regional and international partners through technical and funding assistance to develop and revise policies and procedures to accommodate the new normals in the disaster space. Some of these policy initiatives and reviews include the: • • • • • development of the Community Based Disaster Risk Management Policy; development of the Disaster Risk Financing Policy; review of the National Humanitarian Plan; development of the National Emergency Response Team Guidelines; ongoing review of the National Emergency Operation Centre Standard Operating Procedure; and review and digitising of the Initial Damages Assessment Form. Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster preparedness plays a critical role in the work of the NDRMO due to the country’s vulnerability to various natural hazards, such as cyclones, floods and earthquakes. We recognise that being well prepared for disaster is essential to saving lives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the New Zealand Government for its investment of $3.2 million towards providing support to improve disaster preparedness and response. The funding and support comprise a suite of interventions designed to increase the capacity of the NDRMO to manage disaster awareness and response in Fiji. It involves technical assistance at the NDRMO, upgrade of early warning and flood protection systems, construction of warehouses, upgrade of Divisional Emergency Operation Centres and development of information management system and preparedness, and capacity building through a peer to peer exchange programme with the National Emergency Management Authority of New Zealand of which I was fortunate to be part of. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through its strong partnership with the Government of Japan, the Government is committed to the extension of the Tsunami Sirens and we have recently concluded site survey of all 42 Emergency Operation Centres across Fiji which includes district, divisional and national emergency operation centres.</p><h4>I stand ready to answer any other further questions, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> Honourable Minister, one of the most critical components in terms of disaster readiness for us has always been government shipping services. I know that previously, they are one of the arms of us being able to reach and get, whether it was fresh water or medical supplies</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2505 or whatever, through government shipping services. Have you continued that or are they in a state of readiness with respect to assistance that may need to be rendered, if we do get another nasty cyclone coming through, especially one that affects the outer islands? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- I thank the honourable Member for that question. We have our own arrangements with the line ministry as far as the use of government shipping services is concerned. As soon as there is an emergency, there are certain vessels that they have made available for their use for disaster response. HON. V. NATH.- I thank the honourable Minister for his comprehensive answer. We know Mr. Speaker, Sir, that any hurricane will bring lots of rain too. When it rains, the water table on the soil also increases, and we have seen a number of landslides. During our days in Government, we prepared two document proposal papers for landslides. Can the honourable Minister highlight on where are the proposal papers? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you want the question repeated? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Yes, I want the question be repeated, please. Which papers are your referring to? HON. V. NATH.- I am referring to number of landslides, honourable Minister. In this disaster preparedness, landslides is not embedded. How will we respond to it and which Ministry will take over? I remember we had started some work, so in this preparedness, how will the complainants or victims be approached? HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is your question? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you get the gist of the question? HON. S. R. DITOKA.- It is a bit difficult trying to get the gist of the question. Where landslide is concerned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few Ministries that work together, including the Ministry of Lands, where geotech surveys are conducted. We work together with the Ministry of Infrastructure and we are only there as a response as far as mitigation is concerned, but other Ministries are involved in that work. MR. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the next question. I now see that the Prime Minister is not here with us for the second Oral Question, so we will come back to that. I do not see any issue with Standing Order 45 that could prevent the Speaker from saying that we will come back to the second Oral Question later on the day. On the third Oral Question for today, I now call on honourable Vanawalu to ask his question. ‘Starting a Business’ Model - NOW FIJI Project (Question No. 296/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the implementation of the ‘Starting a Business’ under the businessNOW FIJI project? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for his</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2506</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 question. The Starting A Business Subsystem (SABS), is perhaps, the start of Ease of Doing Business Project in Fiji with the desire to fully automate Government services in Fiji and this was the first system that was automated. It was actually launched on 26 th September this year. Basically, it worked on the philosophy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that you only enter your information once and the agencies then take care of the approvals. What that simply means is that now, you can actually apply to start a business or formalise the starting of your business from your home. The days of queuing will be over for this country in the next three to five years and that, Sir, will give back a lot of time to allow people to create more productivity in the country. We are excited, Sir, because of that potential that exits within this exercise. It was started, of course, by the FijiFirst Government, and we will ensure that we complete that whole exercise because of the transformative nature of this SABS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that helps MSMEs, particularly in terms of smaller businesses that are wandering around, trying to queue up for TIN and FNPF numbers, which is just another layer of inconvenience, so this system allows us to actually automate all that. The system, once it has been launched, started off with about 10 applications per week. I am now told that it received up to 300 applications up to last week on 27 th November, demonstrating the growing adoption of the system, 350 accounts have been created. We look forward to a continued traction in the rollout. Of course, just like any system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been some teething issues. To support that, we do have technical online assistance and also a call centre that assists, and there is also a team that is positioned to actually assist if the users of the system have issues. In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a tool kit that has been developed and issued to the agencies that are actually implementing the system, and the agencies include Occupational Health and Safety Service, Ministry of Health and Medical Services, National Fire Authority, FRCS and FNPF, just to sort of give guidance in terms of how the rollout is being conducted. What we are saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that as a first system of deployment, we are seeing some good signals but, of course, we are continuing to monitor issues, and we will continue to address them. We have now transitioned into the system that the honourable Minister for Housing was talking about which is BPAS and, that is, building permits. To repeat what the honourable Minister said, building permit approvals is one of the toughest things to do in this country. It is a pain, to be quite honest. For developers, you have to get application papers that normally reach this high, probably higher. You have to make three copies, distribute them to the agencies and then hope that they all get approved at their own pace. What this system will do, all developers will only enter once and all the agencies have access to the application, and they start processing approvals on the spot with the hope to reduce what is typically a two-year process down to one year or even shorter. If that happens, it will transform how investment is conducted in Fiji. So, these are the initiatives that are being undertaken by the Government. Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is National Strategy for Digitisation that I hope to bring to Parliament early next year. That will prioritise the automation of the whole of Government and also give guidance to, particularly, the honourable Minister for Finance in terms of how we fund that exercise. But it positions Fiji well in the years ahead in terms of automation and ensures that as our economy continues to grow, we are positioned to become easier to do business and ensure that in the years to come, Fiji is viewed as a country where business is easy to do. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister had given his response, and</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2507 we are very much aware of that particular project because it started in 2019. My only question to the honourable Minister would be, the rationale for changing the name from bizFIJI to businessNOW, what was the cost involved because that means changing the logo and other documentations, including the ICT wherever the logo appears? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- The changing of branding was managed within the Ministry, so the cost was internally - just advising on the change. HON. J. USAMATE.- Why change the name? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we got advice on changing the name. The name probably is not the key issue, the issue is that we are automating the processes. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Just like you change some names yourself, but that is really not the issue, there is really no cost to the change of name because even the paraphernalia was sponsored by the vendor, so there was not any cost to the change of name. But everyone felt that a different name was required, and that was recommended through the Ministry. I think leaving aside the name, we can all agree that what is being done is transformative for Fiji. Measures for Combatting Yaqona Theft in Taveuni (Question No. 295/2024) HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji Police Force inform Parliament on the effective measures that the Fiji Police Force is implementing to combat the increasing yaqona thefts in Taveuni? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, may I thank you for allowing me to be away for a while. I thought I would be back in time for the first question and thank you for deferring the question to this time. I rise to respond to the question by honourable Naivalurua on the theft of yaqona in Taveuni. There had been some theft, and probably very difficult to explain, but we know from that song ‘ Taveuni na vanua bulabula. ’ No one should be stealing anything that you can plant. I would like to highlight some statistics. Yaqona theft from 2019 to October 2024are as follows: (1) 2019 - 71 cases; (2) 2020 - 115 cases; (3) 2021 - 111 cases; (4) 2022 - 98 cases; (5) 2023 - 57 cases; and (6) January to October this year – 82 cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Police had been trying very hard to control the theft, including the vanua approach. Recently, I believe, there have been cooperation between the Police and the Methodist Church and, perhaps, other Churches too. They found out that praying about that was not working</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2508</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 so in the kacikacivaki by the Tuirara on Sunday, na cakacaka ni lotu ena macawa mai oqo, caka lotu masumasu ena siga ka o ka, mataka ni Siga Tabu o ka, vunau o ka, kerei talega na mataqali ka me qai yadrava tiko na yaqona. (Laughter) Those are, perhaps, some of the things that we have to do where there is no excuse to be stealing someone else’s yaqona. There was a decreasing trend noted from 2020-2023 but in 2024 alone, an increased number of cases had been recorded from the beginning up to October of this year. But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force has been implementing a number of measures to combat the types of yaqona in the island which include the following: (1) Dynamic community engagement and public outreach that includes empowerment programmes and awareness activities targeting youth and that includes the programmes of the Methodist Church. (2) Enhanced community policing initiatives such as visits to known offenders in the island and profiling them accordingly. (3) The Fiji Police has also established a joint awareness and empowerment programme with crime prevention committees in all settlements in Taveuni. (4) The Police is also working with the Turaga ni Koro in identifying whistleblowers on the ground. Increased police visibility through mobile patrols throughout the island. (5) (6) Re-enforcement of offenders and visibility in red spot areas. The Agriculture Station where Police worked closely with the Agricultural Officers in identifying those farmers who are prone to theft and other illegal activities. Engagement of the District Officer in the registration of all yaqona farmers in Taveuni and to assist in the monitoring of sales and purchase of yaqona in the area. In the event of theft, the District Officer will assist the Police in verifying farmers’ ID and ascertaining whether they are registered or not. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the measures that I have highlighted above are for dry yaqona only. Moreover, there has been an increased cases of green yaqona theft as well but currently, there is no regulation for the sale and purchase of green yaqona in place. I get very worried when I see big yaqona plants presented to me in the sevusevu - na veiqaravi vakavanua, wondering whether it was uprooted the day before or the night before. The Fiji Police Force is proposing that all yaqona business licence holders must include those that are buying and selling green yaqona, as well as its criteria. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Police restructure that was approved in Cabinet in 2018, the Force will establish a new community police post in Taveuni to assist in resolving that issue. The Police will work closely in collaboration with key stakeholders such as young farmers, state and non- state actors to ensure that yaqona theft in Taveuni is resolved once and for all. Let me assure this august Parliament that Government will continue to support these farmers to ensure they fully reap economic gains from the sale of yaqona to support the needs of their families. Those who are involved in the illegal trade are getting very sophisticated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because now they are using inter-island shipping, particularly outboard powered boats. So, if you are watching the Taveuni market, you may not catch them because they are going straight from the farm, they are robbing the farmers, straight into the illegal traders who bring them out, qai la’ki</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2509 vakamamaca tu i Vanualevu se i Labasa. So, there is very very sophisticated illegal trading going on, so we will just have to ask the Police to be more vigilant, and also the vanua administrators. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may, the issue of yaqona is very serious in Taveuni. I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his response and the effort by Government. I agree with the honourable Prime Minister that we should nip it in the bud, therefore, as a supplementary question, may I ask Government to deploy a special investigation or inquiry team, whether internally or externally, to really get down to the roots because this is connected to many other parts, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister always say, the economy, productivity in the village, leadership in the village, government agencies whether they are working together, et cetera. So, it is connected to many others and at the bottom part of it is the economy of the medium-sized island of Taveuni. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure honourable Naivalurua knows that there has been some time that the people of Taveuni have come to jokingly know the group that is involved from the Police to investigate this Kila Vata squad (KVS). The sooner we get the changes in the manning of those posts, the better it will be for the farmers. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the honourable Prime Minister can be reminded that the motion in response to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs has already declared that Naitasiri is now more fertile than Taveuni. My question to the honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you mentioned about the new police post in Taveuni, simply where will that be located?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.- On the farm:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> You mean, Navakawau side? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Sir, the strategic plan is with the Police Headquarters and they will position that in the most appropriate way. Free Water Assistance – Fiji Water (Question No. 297/2024) HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on which communities are being assisted by Fiji Water in their free water assistance programme? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Nand for his question. Just before I dwell into the substance of the honourable Member’s question, I would like to address some remarks made by honourable Premila Kumar regarding the free tax to Fiji Water. That is absolute nonsense, Mr. Speaker, Sir! That is incorrect. I have repeatedly, on this side of Parliament, cautioned the honourable Members not to keep on using this allegation that for some reason we are favouring Fiji Water. HON. J. USAMATE.- You are! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe, I will get a calculator and come and explain it better. As I have explained, with Fiji Water, the fundamental issue is this, in order to</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2510</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 regularise the tax structures within the industry, all manufacturers of water got tax free status. However, in the calibration of the water tax, the Fiji water tax was increased. In other words, in total, there is no loss of revenue to the Fiji Government. That was not confirmed by me, it was confirmed by the Ministry of Finance and Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS). Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we come and make comments in this Parliament, I urge that we be factual and if you have facts to the contrary, bring them and we can debate them. But I just caution some level of responsibility when we are talking about companies in this Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the question from honourable Nand, the Fiji Water Foundation which actually does the charitable work and is a charitable arm of Fiji Water, is separate from Fiji Water. When I first saw the question from honourable Nand, I was wondering whether he had the Water Authority of Fiji in mind as opposed to Fiji Water because of the separate nature of the two entities. Basically, the Fiji Water Foundation is funded by the Fiji Water Company which has been established in 2007 and has been focussed in improving the lives of all Fijians through various initiatives that they have been doing since 2007. So far, in estimation, it has invested up to $3.2 million in water-related projects, which is benefiting over 60,000 Fijians in over 30 rural communities throughout Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Foundation, of course, is dedicated through various initiatives that they have with community development. They look at reliable infrastructure, access to clean water, healthcare and education to the rural communities, particularly in the Yaqara area, who are the traditional landowners and where a lot of employees reside. They also assist with healthcare services for underprivileged communities and providing relief during natural calamities. Education such as classroom grants, is another area that they assist in. On environmental conservation, they fund a lot of clean water initiatives that are aimed to provide sustainable and hygienic water sources to the rural population. Finally, of course, some of their funds are directed at grant programmes, trying to assist with economic empowerment, with particular focus on women empowerment and leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In terms of some of the specifics, as I have said, Fiji Water has been helping communities in the Yaqara area, such as Drauniivi, Naseyani, Togavere and Rabulu, particularly with borehole pumps and reticulation systems. They are apparently paying for electricity for those pumps since installation and they have a full-time plumber who is actually supporting the village communities. They also have Village Water Community Committees who actually look after or watch those systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you also know that Fiji Water has now started to focus on commercial agriculture. Right now, the focus is on citrus, papaya and honey. They are moving around the country, looking at available land, even in Vanua Levu, Sir, so we look forward to Fiji Water assisting in commercialising agriculture. Apart from that, they are now looking at constructing a solar plant to support their factory out in Yaqara. They are in deep conversation with Energy Fiji Limited in terms of that solar plant, and most likely they will construct a solar farm that not only supplies their factory but also supplies back to the grid, which will be quite helpful as we try to transition to renewable energy. I know the honourable Leader of the Opposition is quite passionate about the transition to renewable energy and let that be music to his ears. Mr. Speaker, in a nutshell, I hope that does answer the question by honourable Nand that,</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2511 indeed, Fiji Water has been a very responsible corporate partner for the country. In fact, what we are saying is, they can do more for Fiji. The advent into commercial agriculture is certainly one opportunity. The second, of course, is the solar project, and the next one that is coming up because they have now quite a large maritime business, they are going to be making some significant investments into FNU to assist with the maritime school there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are some of the things that I thought I would just add on as part of honourable Nand’s question, and I thank him for the very useful question. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, during drought, the schools between Rakiraki and Tavua are seriously low in clean drinking water. I am not only saying between Rakiraki and Tavua, but most of the schools, they run low. Is it possible for the Government to negotiate with Fiji Water so that during these critical times, these schools can be provided with clean, safe drinking water for our children to prosper? MR. SPEAKER.- Before the Minister answers the question, I ask the relevance of this question because Fiji Water is a private entity and if Government has any influence over the distribution of water, then I think that it is relevant to ask whether the Government is distributing water in a fair way. You are now asking a follow up question that says, should the Government or will the Government help in the distribution of water from the private entity to the sectors in Tavua and Rakiraki, is that correct? HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, can the Government assist the schools by requesting Fiji Water to deliver clean, safe drinking water? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I am sure the Water Foundation receives requests from a lot of communities and I am certain that they can look at that as well. Perhaps, I can coordinate with honourable Nand in terms of getting the letters to Water Foundation. I am sure, given that it is an area that they are focussed on assisting, education as a key area they are focused on, I am sure they will be very interested. Implementation of Audit Qualification Issues (Question No. 298/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the short-term and long-term measures that the Ministry and Municipal Councils have taken to implement the audit qualification issues identified by the Office of the Auditor- General? HON. M. K NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question before this august Parliament this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the common audit queries that were raised by the Office of the Auditor-General when they conducted audits for Municipal Councils around Fiji are legacy issues and these issues should have been addressed 10 years ago. These are issues that mostly have to do with the internal control systems, as well as some of the Government issues that should have been addressed here and then. Simple internal control issues, like bank reconciliation, updating of the fixed register, variances between the general ledger and subsidiary ledgers, as well as VAT, rates, salaries and other things like errors in the financial statements, misapplication or non-compliance</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2512</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Those are very pertinent in the administration of any Council for that matter. After looking at all the issues and challenges faced by most of these Municipal Councils, the Ministry has come up with some solutions. One solution, which is based on one of the recommendations that was proposed to us by the Office of the Auditor-General, is to have a monitoring system within the Ministry to audit some of those Municipality reports. For this financial year, we have recruited and hired officers who have accounting and auditing backgrounds, to assist the Ministry in monitoring the financial affairs of those respective Councils. It is very interesting to note that most of the Municipal Councils have backlogs in the auditing of their financial reports. A good example is the one presented by honourable Naupoto this morning on the Savusavu Town Council. Other Councils have backlogs in auditing their reports, some have been there from 2017, 2018 and 2019. But there is only one Council that is really up to date with the auditing of its financial statements and that is Rakiraki Town Council. I commend the Special Administrators as well as the CEOs for getting their financial statements in order. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audit team that I highlighted earlier includes officers who are tasked to conduct a detailed review of all these financials, rectify errors in financial reporting and overseeing and rectify all audit qualification issues. After recognising the lack of expertise in all these Municipalities, we have also come to understand that the reason why we have these errors is that most of these Councils, even though they have some finance people but they do not have the right expertise to actually manage their financials. Also, we have been organising training programmes for the Councils in collaboration with the Office of the Auditor-General to carry out some of the very important programmes that will transform some of these Councils, ensuring that there are better processes, systems and policies in place in their respective Councils. We also encourage Councils to engage and participate in trainings organised by some of the financial institutions and non-government organisations based on their needs. One of the main objectives of having this internal audit within the Ministry is to ensure that Councils comply with financial and operational guidelines. The Ministry has also reached out to Municipalities to carry out their audit plan, on how the Ministry is going to coordinate the auditing of all Municipal Councils’ financial reports. With respect to the continuation of capital projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has developed a Project Management Policy and monitoring templates with specific milestones and timelines that the Councils commit to. The Ministry also has a project team that heavily undertakes site-visits. However, there is a need to build on this project team, where the skills are required to monitor the implementation of capital projects and proper utilisation of public funds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government has also advertised an Expression of Interest to engage an experienced trainer to deliver a comprehensive one-day governance training programme for Special Administrators and CEOs of all the Municipal Councils throughout the country. The purpose of this is to ensure that the training enhances governance capabilities, leadership skills and operational effectiveness of Municipal Councils across Fiji. This is scheduled for next year. The Ministry has reviewed some of the policies and SOPs that are in place, and we will</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2513 continue to review that to ensure that we have all the right features in the policy, to address some of the issues that have already been highlighted by the Office of the Auditor-General. This includes their Financial Manual, Mr. Speaker, Sir. One thing that we also aspire to do is to have a standardised accounting system within all Municipalities, something we are lacking in right now because when we request for reports, it is really difficult to obtain them from these Municipalities. So, when we have this system in place, we will be able have a proper reporting system to check all the various financials activities that are being carried out by all the Municipalities. This has been taken on board with the assistance of the Lautoka City Council. They have engaged a local consultant to assist the Council and the Ministry in this particular area. They will come up with an accounting system that will be used by all the Councils throughout Fiji. Another area is ensuring that all Municipal Councils conduct a Board of Survey. This is a mandatory requirement that some of them have been lacking in all these years. This Board of Survey has to be done annually. So, by virtue of section 130 of the Local Government Act 1972, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have done the appointment of inspectors to investigate and report upon the manner in which the Councils are excising all or any of their functions under the Act. Those inspectors are going to assist me, as well as the Ministry, in carrying out this work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier, it is something that we are trying to fix with all the Municipal Councils throughout the country. It is significant to note the progress made by the Councils thus far in keeping records of all these irregularities and queries, and we hope to rectify these this year, as well as in the coming financial years. Through the Council’s endeavour to resolve the audit qualification issue raised by the Office of the Auditor-General, our approach combines immediate corrective actions with long term reforms to ensure that the Councils are equipped to meet high standards of governance. I thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. H. CHAND.- Honourable Minister, one of the reasons for the audit issues is high staff turnover and shortage of qualified staff in the finance departments of the Councils and one way to retain staff would be job evaluation exercises. Are there any plans for the job evaluation exercise? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. When I took over the office, there were some outstanding industrial matters in some of the Municipalities regarding staff welfare and salary increases, and I am glad to inform the Parliament that there are some Municipalities that have taken steps to address some of those issues. Another issue that we have right now is the issue of not having the right personnel within the Ministry, especially the finance people. That is the reason why we are having a lot of audit queries and that is something that we all should address within the Council. A good example is Suva City Council. They have a very good Finance Manager who has been hired by one of the accounting firms. One of the things that I have also shared with them is to look at ways of retaining officers, especially the good officers in the Council. The other issue is, perhaps, when doing the job evaluation exercise within all the Councils, to ensure that we have the right remuneration, as well as the right benefits in place, in order to maintain or contain the staff in all these Municipalities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, one of the issues that came through during our time and I think it is still continuing is the</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2514</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 mandate of the Special Administrators. We have the CEOs who are supposed to do the micromanagement of the Councils, but there are Special Administrators who go beyond their mandate and start to micro-manage the Councils, and that is where the issue starts. The CEO is supposed to be reporting to the Board itself. What is the Ministry doing in terms of stopping these Special Administrators who are going beyond their mandate and doing the micro-management of these Councils? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can assure Parliament that within the parameters of the Special Administrators, they are given specific KPIs, as well as special instructions are given on how to conduct themselves in managing the affairs of the Council. Something that I have also been sharing with them is the importance of having a Special Administrator who is supposed to be a strategic thinker and must make sure that they give directions and provide strategies to the Council. I think it is working in most of the Councils. I have been stressing with the Special Administrators, when we have our forum with them, the importance of ensuring that they provide directions, while the CEO does the operational arm of carrying out the operations of the Municipalities. Eligibility of Foreign Nationals Entering without Permit (Question No. 299/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji Police Force inform Parliament on measures in place at the Fiji Immigration Department to verify the eligibility of Girmitiya descendants and those registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula holding foreign citizenship to enter Fiji without a permit? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question. On Friday, 13 th October, 2023, the Fiji Immigration Department and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs formalised their collaboration by signing a Memorandum of Understanding to carry out the mandatory responsibilities outlined in the Immigration Act 2023. The amended Immigration Act 2003 allows iTaukei individuals who are registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) to enter, reside and work in Fiji under exemption status, as specified in section 8(1)(g) of the Act. Similarly, descendants of Girmityas are eligible under the exemption by descent, as outlined in section 8(3). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department has implemented a multilayered approach to verify the eligibility of the Girmitya descendants’ exemption by descent and VKB registered individuals who hold foreign citizenship for permit entry into Fiji. These measures ensure the integrity of Fiji’s border management, while honouring historical and cultural obligations. Girmitya descendants, those who were exempted by descent, are granted to a direct descendent of a person (that is the principal citizen) who was considered a citizen of Fiji on 10 th October, 1970, and holder of a valid foreign passport to enter, reside, study and work in the country. Direct descendent include the principal citizen’s children, grandchildren and great grandchildren …. [Parliament Sitting was disrupted due to technical fault] The Parliament adjourned at 12.25 p.m.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2515 The Parliament resumed at 2.35 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we begin, honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the students and teachers of Nailagotabua Primary School from Verata, Tailevu. You are most welcome to your Parliament, and I hope that you will learn more about how your Parliament works. (Acclamation) Honourable Members, first, I apologise to the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Members, on behalf of our technical staff and the Secretariat, for the disruption to our morning session caused by some technical glitch to our sound system. As you are aware, it also happened yesterday, and maybe on second thought, I should not have mentioned our woes from Waidina making their presence felt. At any rate, the problems are fixed and we, hopefully, can proceed without any further interruptions this afternoon. Honourable Members, we shall continue with where we left off this morning on the honourable Prime Minister’s response to the question that was posed by honourable Premila Kumar. If the honourable Prime Minister so wishes, he may begin now. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my response to the question asked by honourable Premila Kumar on the eligibility of Girmitya descendants and those registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) holding foreign citizenship to enter Fiji without a permit, the Fiji Immigration Department and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs formalised their collaboration by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to carry out the mandatory responsibility outlined in the Immigration Act 2023, which allows iTaukei individuals who are registered in the VKB to enter, reside and work in Fiji under exemption status, as specified under section 8(1)(g) of the Act. Similarly, Girmitya descendants are eligible under exemption by descent, as outlined under section 8(3). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department has different merits, a multi-layered approach, to verify the eligibility of Girmitya descendants who are exempted by descent and VKB registered individuals who hold foreign citizenship for permit for free entry into Fiji. These measures ensure the integrity of Fiji’s border management, while honouring historical and cultural obligations. Girmitya descendants’ exemption by descent is granted to a direct descendant of a person, that is, the principal citizen who was considered a citizen of Fiji on 10 th October, 1970, and a holder of a valid foreign passport to enter, reside, study and work in the country. Direct descendants include the principal citizen’s children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. You probably know that in Africa during the wave of independence movement when the African States became independent, they granted citizenship to descendants - people whose great grandfather was the citizen of that country or a citizen of that colony. Jomo Kenyatta was one of the examples of those first independent movement leaders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under section 83 of the Immigration Act 2003, Girmitiya descendants who hold foreign citizenship can enter Fiji without a permit if they meet specific eligibility criteria and provide the necessary documentation. This criteria ensures that descendants can maintain their ancestral ties, while preserving the integrity of Fiji’s immigration system. The eligibility criteria and documentation requirements for Girmitiya descendants are as follows: (1) Individuals must provide evidence that link them directly to Girmitiya ancestors who arrive under the indentured labourer system.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2516</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 (2) Request letter from the applicant to be submitted by the applicant’s parents if the applicant is below the age of 18 years. (3) Support letter from the applicant’s Guardian and copy of Guardian’s valid national photo ID, if the applicant is below 18 years of age and will not be residing with either parent in Fiji. (4) Certified copy of the applicant’s valid passport biodata page. (5) Recent passport size photographs. (6) Certified copy of Birth Certificate. (7) Copy of parent’s Passport biodata pages, if the applicant is below 18 years of age. (8) Certified copy of Marriage Certificate, if applicable. (9) Copy of Foreign Citizenship Certificate, if applicable. (10) Police clearance from the country of citizenship or country of current or normal residence, if the applicant is above 18 years of age. (11) Medical Report must be conducted within three months prior to the date of lodgment. (12) Proof of funds, for example, copy of bank statement issued in the last three months. (13) Support letter from a Fiji citizen considered to be a family member, confirming the relationship of the applicant to the principal citizen, and a copy of his or her valid national photo ID and Birth Certificate. (14) Official document to prove the past or present existence of the principal citizen on whom your ancestry claim is based. For example, the copy of Fiji Passport, Fiji Citizenship Certificate, Birth Certificate, Death Certificate, Marriage Certificate, et cetera. (15) Official documents to prove the applicant's relationship to the principal citizen. For example, copies of Birth Certificates. (16) Copy of current permit or exemption, if already residing in the country. (17) Local Police report or clearance lodgement receipt, if the applicant above 18 years of age, only applicable for extension application. (18) Copy of employment contract or company registration form and letter is only applicable also for extension application and if the applicant is working or investing in the country. (19) Copy of previous exemption, only applicable for extension. (20) Search fee of $12.30 for record search conducted to confirm the principal citizen’s Fiji citizenship. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will table the response after, and we will also be circulating this to the Foreign Embassies for the information of the Fiji Diaspora. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Immigration Act 2003, specifically under Section 81(g) granted exemption say that to iTaukei individuals registered in the VKB, allowing them to enter, reside and work in Fiji without requiring a permit. A registered individual in the VKB is granted to a person registered in the VKB maintained by the iTaukei Land Commission and hold a valid foreign passport to enter, resides, study and work in the country. The eligibility criteria and documentation requirements for registered individuals in the VKB are as follows: (1) Completed exemption application form. (2) Request letter from applicant to be submitted by the applicant’s parents, if the applicant is below 18 years of age. (3) Support Letter from the applicant’s guardian. (4) Copy of guardian’s valid national photo ID, if the applicant is below 18 years of age and will not be residing with either parent in Fiji. (5) Certified copy of the applicant’s valid passport biodata page. (6) Two recent passport photographs.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2517 So, mostly, they are the same, they run parallel - the Girmitiya descendant and the VKB descendant, parallel all the way in the application. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department conducts cross verifications with national databases through collaboration with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs on the VKB registrations. For Girmitiya descendants, historical and archival records are accessed in collaboration with cultural and heritage institutions. Additionally, citizenship verifications are carried out through the Citizenship Unit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department also conducts identity security checks such as signatures, facial comparisons and passport data match against existing immigration records to ensure authenticity and prevent identity fraud. It is a very complicated and detailed response to a very valid question with the fluidity of the population we now have in and out, and I believe it should be presented at the end of my time for honourable Members to look up if they have any related cases or relatives to communicate them to. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Prime Minister. We note the offer by the honourable Prime Minister to table the qualifications required of the would-be applicants to those holding foreign citizenship to enter Fiji without permit. Memorandum of Cooperation - Japan Tourism Agency (Question No. 300/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the Memorandum of Cooperation with the Japan Tourism Agency of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vocea for his question. I appreciate the opportunity to update this esteemed House on the recent Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed between the Government of Fiji and Japan Tourism Agency, which is part of Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, dialogue on the MoC had started in 2018 and was formalised during my recent visit to Sendai, Japan, representing a significant milestone in Fiji’s bilateral relations with Japan. It underscores a mutual commitment to strengthening our tourism sector through sustainable practices, disaster resilience and knowledge exchange. The agreement aligns closely with Fiji’s National Development Plan which prioritises economic diversification, environmental sustainability and building climate-resilient infrastructure. Under the MoC, Fiji and Japan will collaborate on key areas such as crisis management, sustainable tourism development and infrastructure resilience. This partnership provides an opportunity for Fiji to learn from Japan’s expertise in disaster preparedness and response - a vital area, given Fiji’s vulnerability to cyclones and other natural disasters. By leveraging Japan’s advanced technical knowledge and best practices, we aim to fortify our tourism industry against future shocks, while fostering sustainable growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, additionally, the MoC sets the stage for capacity building initiatives, technical exchanges and joint programmes to promote eco-friendly tourism. These efforts will not only protect our environment but also enhance Fiji’s appeal as a leading destination for responsible tourism, catering to increase global demand for suitable travel experiences.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2518</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 The signing of this MoC also coincided with Fiji’s participation in the Japan Tourism Resilience Summit, where I had the privilege of addressing Asia Pacific Tourism Leaders on the importance of resilience and innovation in the face of global challenges. This Summit further reinforces the objectives of the MoC by highlighting shared strategies for recovery, sustainability and regional cooperation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this agreement, Fiji is building a future-ready tourism sector that balances economic prosperity with environmental stewardship. By deepening our ties with a global leader like Japan, we are securing not just the immediate benefits of partnership, but also the long- term resilience of the industry that is vital for Fiji’s socio-economic development. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that the agreement has been signed with the Japan Tourism Agency, is there a likelihood that we will be making an increased presence in Japan with respect to Tourism Fiji and Fiji Airways, bearing in mind that Denarau was built on the back of Japanese tourism? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, Japan is a huge market for Fiji and it used to be amongst the top three or four for Fiji back in the 1980s before the collapse of the Japanese economy at that time with the way the real estate market collapsed in Japan. But since then, Japan has been rather flat in terms of numbers, even globally, and more so now with the Yen being so weak. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they admit this, they will not see any growth on outbound travel for Japan because of the Yen. For us, Fiji, we are flying into Narita right now. We used to fly to Osaka at one time and Nagoya is a possibility, so going forward, the possibilities are there. We believe we have the capacity in terms of equipment, but at this point, given the economy in Japan and the way the numbers are still flat, we will not be considering any additional city in the immediate future. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Infrastructure resilience is one of the key areas covered under the agreement. Could you just elaborate further on that, honourable Deputy Prime Minister? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conference was in Sendai. Sendai, during Easter of 2011, had an earthquake and a tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people. I think you will remember that 30 metre high waves came in and flattened that part of Japan, the big Sendai earthquake. It was the worst in Japanese history. What they have done now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is build infrastructure around that coastal area to stop or to weaken the power of the tsunami that would come into the coastal areas of Japan. So, those are the types of infrastructure that we can benefit from, as we also prepare against risks like that. It is quite phenomenal; they even now have a way of determining that. Once an earthquake happens, immediately they know if the tsunami is coming - their warning system is highly developed also, and that is where we are coming from. It is amazing that the area that was flattened, about 800 homes were swept away in a matter of minutes during that period. I think if you saw the documentary on BBC and CNN, the school where people ran to from the tsunami is still there. We went to the school and we saw marks of how high the waves went up, this is the fourth-floor building. However, the important thing is the way they have recovered and what they are putting in place, so that is an example. There are other areas, on the kind of infrastructure that is built to guard us against flooding also. So, all these technical support will be there with Japan. They know how vulnerable we are, and they are willing to share what they have with Fiji and other countries in the Asia Pacific.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2519 Enhancing Capabilities of Firefighters – NFA (Question No. 301/2024) HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the measures being undertaken to enhance the capability of the fire fighters of the National Fire Authority? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. Before I proceed, I would like to inform this august Parliament that today, at the Marist ground in Flagstaff, Suva, the National Fire Authority (NFA) conducted their National Drill Competition and this competition gives opportunities for all the firefighters in the three Divisions - Central, Northern and Western Divisions, to not only display their skills, but also showcase the fitness level that they have in their respective Divisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the 5-Year Strategic Plan for the NFA, the Authority places much emphasis on the ongoing announcement capability of the firefighters to improve their quality of response, improve readiness to emergencies and increase technical skills, and to achieve the outcomes mentioned, focus on physical development and training on technical skills of all our firefighters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after recruitment, the firefighters can attend to fire incidents, material accidents, urban search and rescue, high-rise technical rescue, road accident rescue, swift water rescue and natural disaster rescue. These core responsibilities require a high level of fitness and technical skills to ensure tasks are executed efficiently and effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all firefighters undergo Required Fitness Level (RFL) training on a quarterly basis, as the very nature of work demands it. Every year, they undergo four RFL tests to ensure that they have the physical capability to conduct their work. Passing RFL tests means that they are physically capable to douse off or extinguish fires, respond to vehicle accidents, respond to people during floods or during any natural disaster, high rise rescue and any emergency that will need their response. Before they undergo RFL tests, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a health screening medical check is conducted to make sure that they are in the right state of health and mind to take the test. To ensure that they maintain physical condition, the Authority is working on equipping all Fire Stations with appropriate gym facilities and equipment. To date, 11 of the 21 Fire Stations have proper gym facilities and equipment, and there are plans already in the pipeline for another 10 Stations to also have proper gym facilities and equipment. In the 2025-2026 financial year, the Authority is looking at constructing gym facilities for Labasa, Levuka, Nausori, Suva, Valelevu and Sigatoka Fire Stations, and the following financial year, gym facilities have been earmarked for Pacific Harbour, Ba and Tavua Fire Stations. In the current financial year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NFA will be constructing a proper gym facility for Lautoka Fire Station. The Authority also takes the Health Wellness Wednesday Programme seriously. Every Wednesday, all staff are required to participate in physical activities as organised by the Training Department. As part of their annual cost operational plan, Corporate staff are required to walk a minimum of 10 kilometres every month. With the rise in NCDs, all Authority staff should maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2520</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Authority also invests heavily in building the technical capacity of its firefighters. As part of their progress up the ranks, they undergo promotional courses which they need to pass in order to advance. These courses include a Leading Firefighter Course, a Qualified Firefighter Course and a Firefighter Course. The Leading Firefighter Course prepares the officers to take on senior leadership, managing a team of people, supervisory skills and test their ability to make decisions at an emergency site or ground. The Qualified Firefighter Course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, prepares officers to take the leadership role in their respective stations, strengthen their skills in public speaking and presentation ability, compiling proper records and test their ability to conduct drills. Those promotional courses, Sir, are conducted by the Authority’s senior staff, internal training staff or certified trainers. The Firefighter Course training tests the skills and knowledge in fire terminology of our probation officers after they have completed a 12 months’ probationary period. Upon completion of the training, Mr. Speaker, Sir, officers are then confirmed to their positions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firefighters also attend international trainings in collaboration with international organisations and overseas counterparts. In May this year, 18 officers participated in International Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting training coordinated by Airports Fiji Limited with trainers from the USA and Australia. Recently, two officers returned from Japan after attending a three-month technical training. This opportunity was coordinated through the JICA sponsorship, in conjunction with the Ministry of Civil Service Training Division. Officers were trained in rescue techniques, fire management and disaster risk reduction. In 2023, an officer was sent to attend a three-month rescue technique coordinated by JICA. Also, in the same year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, three officers from the Structural Fire Safety Department attended a course on fire safety regulations in Sabaudia, Rome, for three weeks. Also, in 2023, 21 officers took part in a training coordinated by the Australian Disaster Assessment Team on Urban Search and Rescue held in Suva. These trainings, coordinated and conducted by international organisations, ensure that our fire service personnel are well versed with the current firefighting training trends. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all officers who attend training locally and overseas compile reports and learnings from training are often shared or taught to their colleagues. The NFA is also building networks with international counterparts for long-term training plans. Discussions are currently underway with a Singapore Fire Service, to explore the possibility of an MOU between the two organisations. On the emergence of new technologies on electric vehicles and lithium batteries, the Authority is hoping to send officers to Singapore for training in firefighting strategies, attending to electric vehicles and lithium battery fires. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also looking closer to home in building capacity for our firefighters. In April this year, the Authority signed an MOU with the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services of Queensland, Australia. This is through our Vuvale Partnership. This MOU will bring enhancement capabilities to our fire services. With the implementation of this MOU, Sir, three senior officers have returned from Queensland Fire Services on a one-week study tour. There are now discussions to explore overseas training for more officers to attend the same type of training. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of measures are being taken to enhance the capability of our firefighters. With Government support, the Authority is continuously building capacity of its firefighters to meet the needs and risks of today and tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2521 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, in the area of disaster related assistance and responsibility, the National Fire Authority is tasked with two main rescue elements - water rescue and hopefully, this is from lessons learnt during TC Winston, infrastructure structural damages assessment. I want to know what progress has been made in these two areas based on the previous arrangements that were also made with our overseas partners. In terms of water rescue, their capabilities and skills, and of course, infrastructure structural damages assessment. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for asking a very important question. Yes, the Authority has been collaborating with the Queensland Fire Services in the areas such as water rescue, as well as one that he has just mentioned, which is on infrastructure structural damages assessment. That is something that we are also considering to review so that in the future, training that we are going to have, the Authority is going to have this kind of training with counterparts from Queensland, as well as Singapore. We also have this training to be part of their training overseas. If you can recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in some of the flooding situations that we have just had late last year as well as early this year, especially in Rakiraki, the NFA Team was there to rescue some of the people that were caught during the flooding. That is also part of the training that the team is doing right now. They have also created paramedic training, and that is going to manage the provision of ambulance services. We are also thinking of getting ambulance from overseas that will have these facilities to also take care of some serious cases that are near death. These are some of the new initiatives that the Authority is undertaking in addressing some of the latest incidents in major health and also risky situations that they have encountered. Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir. Economic Empowerment of iTaukei (Question No. 302/2024) HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts inform Parliament on the opportunities and programmes that are currently available for the economic empowerment of the iTaukei? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Finance for the question. The economic empowerment of the iTaukei is not a challenge only for the Ministry of iTaukei but it is a whole of Government approach, to ensure that the benefits of economic growth is shared widely. However, it is merely a redistribution policy but is based upon building a sustainable framework that will allow more and more iTaukei to establish and run businesses successfully and, hence, generate new economic growth potential. This is also aligned to the Government’s Economic Diversification Policy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this regard, the itaukei institutions have been working more collectively under the Solesolevaki Framework, to formulate new initiatives for the economic empowerment of the iTaukei. Under the Framework, illegible landowners go through an investment ready programme with the iTaukei Trust Fund Board and the iTaukei Land Trust Board before they are channelled to Fijian Holdings Limited for their investment assessment, or the Merchant Finance for lending requirements. Some of the key initiatives include the establishment of wealth fund by the iTaukei Trust Board.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2522</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time in 84 years’ history of iTLTB, 10 percent of the annual lease money are being set aside for future investments. This is a historical initiative that will create a fund that allows the landowners to effectively develop resources, participating in: (1) business entrepreneurship; (2) (3) (4) invest or buy up expiring commercial leases; assist in providing education assistance for specialised fields; and in the same initiative, we are already on track to open up a landowners’ bank. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the iTaukei Development Fund by the iTaukei Land Trust Board. The iTLTB has already allocated $5 million in concessional financing to iTaukei businesses. So far, the sum of $2.7 million has been approved for 33 landowners’ projects ranging from agriculture, gravel extraction, tourism transportation services, logging fleet and SMEs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also provide some assistance to eco-tourism. As part of its broader strategy to empower iTaukei landowners, iTLTB has committed $1 million in financial assistance, specifically targeted at supporting eco-tourism projects within the landowning units. This initiative recognises the critical role eco-tourism plays in sustainable economic development and the conservation of Fiji’s natural resources, particularly in areas like Yasawa, where landowners operate eco-tourism ventures. Eco-tourism projects were badly affected by COVID-19 and iTLTB has taken the initiative to assist in revamping these operators in better quality standard to operate in the market. A study has been concluded and the iTLTB management is currently reviewing the recommendations provided by the consultant. These initiatives align with iTLTB’s reasons of driving sustainable economic development by empowering the iTaukei landowners to take a leadership role in tourism and conservation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Vanua and Marama Finance by Merchant Finance, the Merchant Finance has launched two financial products - the Vanua Finance and Marama Finance, to allow more access of capital to iTaukei businesses. The Vanua Finance is specifically for iTaukei resource owners who want to unlock the commercial value of their resources. This programme is targeting businesses, such as land subdivision, property development, gravel extraction and cartage operators. Over $6 million has been distributed for land subdivision projects, with five landowning groups. This is a huge opportunity, and the pipeline is very robust. The Marama Finance is targetting SME businesses in agriculture and other sectors. This facility allows women to access between $100,000 to $500,000 in loan from Merchant Finance. It should be noted that Government will be subsidising the interest for the first three years of this loan and no interest will be paid by the borrowers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on investment towards landowners joint venture with Fijian Holdings, the Fijian Holdings Limited through its impact investment programme has allocated 10 percent of its capital of around $50 million to directly invest into landowners’ group. This is through the joint venture model where Fijian Holdings Limited will contribute 60 percent equity and 40 percent will come from the value of the land, and the joint venture is the development of property for commercial development. Close to $50 million has been committed by Fijian Holdings Limited for five projects around Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Resource Owners Forum, for two consecutive years, we have been running the Resource Owners Forum where relevant Government agencies, the actual processors and exporters of these resources and the relevant financial lending institutions come together to discuss</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2523 the economic empowerment of iTaukei resource owners. It is from this Forum where most of the initiatives that I am sharing today were identified and initiated. On training and development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need for more training and development of landowners in financial literacy and businesses is critical. The Government is also committed to this and is working in association with the Government Ministries, non-government organisations and the private sector to ensure that this challenge is addressed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, the need to economically empower more iTaukei by getting them into business is a priority for this Government. However, we should be under no illusion that this will be achieved overnight. Our Government is coming up with programmes and is trying to set strong foundations to ensure that this is sustainable over a long term. Replacement Crossings – Nasovotava Village (Question No. 303/2024) HON. J. N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on the construction of replacement crossings for Nasovotava Village in Valley Road, Sigatoka, which were washed away in the 2012 flood? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we have included Nasovotava Village crossings in the Fiji Road Authoritys road works for the next financial year, specifically 2025-2026. This means that necessary resources and plans have been drawn up for the current financial year. The survey and design works for the replacement crossing is close to completion. These preliminary steps are crucial to ensure that designs meet the safety and capacity needs of the area, while considering the flood risks which led to the damage in 2012. The design will consider the lessons learnt from those floods, especially climate resilience, so that it can withstand the future challenges. It includes appropriate materials, structural enforcement and modifications. Consultations are ongoing with the affected communities, including the residents of Nasovotava. So, as mentioned, the replacement will not only improve the safety and accessibility but also enhance the resilience of the Valley Road network. Government is fully committed to addressing the needs of all Fijians, especially in our rural and flood affected areas, and we recognise the importance of connecting our rural communities. To conclude, I fail to understand why I am being asked about Nasovotava crossing because you could have asked the former Minister for Infrastructure and his Assistant as they had 10 years from 2012 to 2022, 10 years! But that was not addressed, so as our Government is for the people, for the Fijians in the rural areas which had not been addressed, we will definitely look into those. Thank you. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I would just like to bring to the honourable Minister's attention and if he is aware of it, that recently the Buabua Bridge has been washed away in Lautoka and the Arolevu Bridge in Nadi has been badly damaged. It serves the people of Barosa, Tunalia and part of oNawaicoba. Thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Thank you, I will get more details on that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Hogwash!</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2524</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I do not have the specific details, but in the last few days I have been very concerned about the perception put up by the other side of the Parliament, that we are not doing anything and we have been labelled ‘hogwash’. This term has been introduced by your side, so it has now become very popular. The other one was being called as incompetent and inaptitude. So, when we, the Coalition Government came in, we have worked hard, we did not rubbish the past projects but to continue and build on that. But one thing that continues to flabbergast me is the Queen Elizabeth Drive which contracted the sum of $61.9 million was awarded with a variation of $4.5 million and a final sum of $65.9 billion. This is what I am saying, that you cannot call us inaptitude or incompetent, when I can also say that of you. But the good thing is that this is a Coalition Government which is not abusive, we listen to you, and we work with you. When we are labelled as incompetent and inaptitude, this Queen Elizabeth Drive comes to mind. With the final sum of $6.8 million, a length of 4.5 kilometres or 14.6 million a kilometre, that could have been reasonably upgraded because the objective was to make Queen Elizabeth Drive more pleasant and for leisure walks and drives so that could have been done for $20 million. So, minus that from the final cost is $45 million. You could have built 30 crossings like the one which was being asked at $1.5 million per crossing, including the Nasovotava Crossing. Sir, that is just to put things into perspective when they labelled this side of Parliament as incompetent and inaptitude. MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I am saying that not to condemn you, but just to balance. I am sure we are not perfect, but we are making things right and building on what you have started. Someone said, “failed to do”, maybe I should have said that, but thank you very much. HON. J. USAMATE.- When we are talking about crossings and you go and talk about our road in Suva, that is inaptitude. But in terms of getting things right, what is the honourable Minister doing? Just a few months ago they did road markings. When there was heavy rain now, you cannot see the road markings. That is inaptitude! So, what is the Ministry doing? Are you buying cheap paint or is it that the contractors are not doing the right thing because those road markings that we did earlier this year have completely disappeared? What is the honourable Minister going to do about that to make sure that people drive safely on the road from Suva to Nausori? HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- This could be labelled a new question, but this goes back to the situation during their governance where they removed the Public Works epartment. So, within the Public Works Department, they used to have a Quality Assurance and Testing Unit but that was removed. They used to test the quality of the roads, what types of materials were used and the material used for road painting which is resin, he knows the answer but he is asking me. Yes, I am the Minister, so we are in the process of bringing that back to address that. The other thing is that the quality assurance work was being done by the private sector company who was engaged in that contract. That is like asking Dracula to look after a blood bank, so the two needs to be separated because one is monitoring the other, so that is the process. Role of FCCC – Fostering Market Competition (Question No. 304/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2525 Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co- operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the role of the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission in fostering competition within the market while maintaining oversight of price- controlled goods and services? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tunabuna for the question. Of course, the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) is a very important independent regulatory agency of Government that obviously monitors competition in the marketplace, provides oversight of goods that are price-controlled and also ensures that market behaviour remains fair and equitable. On a bit of history, FCCC was established in 2010 and actively regulates markets where competition is limited or absent. It controls prices of essential goods and services and also looks at anti-competitive behaviour and attempts to address such behaviour where there is suggestion of prohibited practices such exclusive dealings, price discrimination, et cetera. The FCCC reports to the Ministry of Trade, and we do work closely together in terms of just watching the market. I do receive regular advice from them in terms of particular market behaviours and also attempts to address them. Maybe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of the close working relationship, I will just share some of the things that we have been working on together or trying to facilitate. Of late, there has been the Geogas Pacific Acquisition, Petro Oceania Energy Pte Ltd - acquisition of Mobil operations. There was the Telstra Corporation acquisition which happened not in our time, but that was a big exercise as well. So, they do look very closely at acquisitions, particularly significant acquisitions, that may impact on market position, creating unfair competition or may disadvantage consumers. Lately too, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do things such as when we introduced the increased VAT, FCCC was very active in monitoring all the retail shops around Fiji, to actually ensure that the right pricing was being transferred to the people of Fiji and where they felt there was some strange behaviour let us say, that was actually addressed there and then around the country. Lately, as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked in this Parliament about the National Food Safety Taskforce. That Taskforce is still ongoing and, hopefully, we can come back and report to Parliament on some of the work that is happening there. But, certainly, some of the things that we were seeing was the prevalence of inferior goods on our supermarket shelves, and FCCC as well as Consumer Council have been quite active in actually moving around towns and cities, also working with the Health Inspectors in the Town Councils and trying to work together to go and monitor these places and ensure that some of these issues are being addressed. At the moment with FCCC and Consumer Council, there has been a bit of work going on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in trying to address the issues of food safety and food standards as well in the country. We hope to bring a separate set of legislative changes, and I know the Ministry of Health is actually looking at food safety at the moment and the FAO is working with them. We hope to piggyback on them and strengthen the standards, if you like, Sir, so that we can ensure that we do not have substandard food circulating on our shelves around the country.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2526</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, certainly from my perspective, FCCC has been quite active in trying to do its role. We interact regularly on all sorts of issues, and they do help provide guidance as well, where there is requirement for adjustments in bus fares or adjustments in other tariffs. So, it is a useful agency in terms of continuing to ensure that in the Fijian marketplace, that equity and fairness prevails and that our consumers are not gouged, Sir. Thank you. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his answer. He spoke about standards of foods. FCCC also regulates the pharmaceutical industry, and they also regulate medicine. I am not too sure, honourable Minister, whether you are aware of this or not, but the standard of medicines that are actually regulated are not accepted by the Ministry of Health. So, are there any, I would say, views of the Minister of excluding the substandard medication that are not accepted by the Ministry of Health and bringing the standard medication and have it priced controlled that are actually accepted by the Ministry of Health? For example, at the moment, if a particular brand of paracetamol is accepted by the Ministry of Health, that should be the standard followed by FCCC but currently, it is not. Anyone can bring paracetamol of any standard and get it under price control. Sir, is there any model to standardise that? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you very much, honourable Maharaj, for that question because it is part of your profession. I thank you for the information. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I can only promise to find out more about what you have raised, and I am quite happy to engage further in terms of trying to work out what you have just mentioned. Clearly, the Ministry of Health says that it is acceptable that, that should be the standard and that we should not be deviating. So, we will certainly find out a bit more on that. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is to the honourable Minister and it is in regards to short term price control. We have seen during Diwali time that the price of ghee, from $18, it shot up to $32. During cyclone time, the price of candles and batteries goes up. So, there are businesses that are trying to make money. These are mainly unscrupulous businesses at the misery of the people. So, my question to the honourable Minister is, are you going to short term price control certain items based on the situation? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I forgot to mention ghee and that actually came up as an issue lately. We have actually put that under price control because there were some very irregular pricings that was seen at the time, so that is under price control currently. In terms of the candles and batteries, we will have a look at that and see what can be done in that space as well. Specific Measures – Upcoming Cyclone Season (Question No. 290/2024) HON. F. S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation inform Parliament what specific measures is the Ministry implementing to prepare the tourism industry for the upcoming cyclone season and the impacts of climate change? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful that this question was able to be deferred from yesterday because I had to leave early to go to Nadi to officiate in the consultation and the announcement of a new tourism project at Wailoaloa Beach that occurred in Sheraton, Denarau. So, things are looking good for tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am grateful that I was given the time to go, and that question was deferred until today.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2527 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for the question. The impacts of climate change, as you all know, is a reality we share. We have lived and recovered from it - each time taking a lesson. In my years with the tourism industry, I have seen all these disasters as a hotelier, as an inbound operator and someone in charge of destination marketing for the country. In terms of cyclone preparedness, we can never be too prepared. But I also want to commend the role that the private sector industry has played which is quite instrumental in preparing for disasters. As we know, preparing for a cyclone or any other natural disaster for that matter is not a one agency job. When it comes to managing the impacts of a crisis or a natural disaster, it is absolutely critical to have a multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism. On communication, one of the very first ways of preparing is to ensure a transparent and ongoing communication. In Fiji, we have what we call the Tourism Response Team (TRT). The TRT’s key objective is to act as a consultative forum of public and private sector to coordinate, share information and provide assistance during natural disasters. It has membership of the Ministry of Tourism, National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), hotel association, tour and transport association, national airline, airports and utility bodies, like energy and water. While functioning informally, we are now in the process of formalising the TRT that it is not only activated during a crisis, but prior for better planning. This will also involve clearly communicating each agency’s role and responsibilities. This includes sharing information real time on guests who may be stranded, flight cancellation and expected water or power disruptions. Part of this includes disseminating information on evacuation centres, situation reports and emergency contacts. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership played by NDMO. Through Tourism Fiji, we also ensure timely consumable information to our global partners to provide reassurance of the safety of visitors to Fiji which is paramount. We also roll out re-start campaigns to let our visitors know we are open. On Business Continuity Plans, a few of the additional actions the Ministry will take, as identified by the National Sustainable Tourism Framework, is to identify resources and partners to support tourism businesses, MSMEs in particular, to develop business continuity plans and build contingency funds. This is a big part of building resilience. We also work with financial institutions and private sector associations to expand insurance options. With respect to how we are supporting the industry and prepare for the impacts of climate change, I think the approach, to a large extent, focusses on adaptation. This means, having in place climate resilient infrastructure, incentivising energy efficiency and ensuring access to climate finance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the initiatives the Ministry will spearhead is the introduction of National Sustainable Tourism Standards. The proposed National Sustainable Tourism Standards will act as a guide to enhancing the holistic visitor experience and the long-term sustainability of Fiji as a destination. It will also comprise specific indicators to ensure compliance, while fostering alignments with international and regional frameworks. This, amongst other areas, will look at energy conservation and waste and water stewardship. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next few years, we will also conduct an audit of available toolkits/ resources for mainstreaming sustainability best practices, and adopt Fiji-specific toolkits for operators to support the adoption and to the meet requirements of the Fiji Climate Change Act 2021: • Develop a voluntary green building code for hotels; • Focus on ecotourism products; and</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>2528</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 • Invest in sustainable aviation fuel. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very quick question to the honourable Minister, Paramedic Insurance is currently a programme for social welfare recipients in preparation of and respond to national disasters. Can the honourable Minister consider a similar type of insurance for villages hosting tourists and small tourism enterprises when disaster hits and it affects their business so that covers their losses? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a good question. We want everyone to be insured. There are a number of options out there but certainly it is something that we are working on, honourable Member. Tourism now has a huge element of community involvement these days. As I said earlier, it is no longer just the sun, sand and sea. People want to visit our communities, in fact, some prefer to stay in community establishments. We insist on insurance, and we will look at options to cater small scale types of businesses. Just a bit of background, because there is a bit of history to this, at one time, we had four cyclones in Fiji, to the extent that underwriters refused to underwrite anymore insurance for Fiji. Such was the impact on the bottom line. We had to go to Reserve Bank of Fiji so that people set up their own insurance. They carried their insurance at the time, I am going back some years now. But that is the kind of stuff that happened when Fiji had that kind of calamity. I think honourable Members will remember those days back in the 1980s when there were four cyclones for over two weeks or something. Those are the kind of risks that we face. I think today, it is much better because the risk for insurance has now spread globally. I do not think we will ever have that situation again where we would be virtually isolated from the insurance community because of the types of disasters that occur in our country. But going back to your question, yes, it is something that we will look into and be part of a tourism setup. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to, perhaps, ask the last supplementary question. Lessons learnt, particularly from TC Winston and TC Evans in 2012 for the outer islands, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the main issues were communications backup and transportation. This is dealing with bringing the tourists back. The ones along the coast, on mainland, are water issues. What is the Tourism Response Team, together with NDMO, doing to continue with the preparatory work to cater for such incidences? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the outer islands, thankfully the warning system in Fiji is quite effective, and just going back to my earlier statement regarding Japan, most of the weather systems in Fiji is through the support of the Japanese Government and we all know that. What we normally do in the outer island resorts is try and empty our resorts prior to the cyclone arriving because we want them near the airport. The anxiety, these things are covered globally on television, et cetera. The relatives back home are worried, so it is good that we always try and move them quickly into Nadi, near the airport areas or into the mainland. You do not want to keep your guests on island resorts. The warning system enables you to do that in good time so that they are safe in a mainland resort. The communication system is adequate. My last resort was back in 2010, I was in an island resort, communication was alright and was also centred through Tourism Fiji. Now, with Starlink, things will be a lot easier. On the mainland, water is an issue but what we notice is that most resorts now carry storage</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2529 capacities that enable them to operate for three days, and some can do more than that. So, part of the resilience and infrastructure is to ensure that you have backup in your water supply system. Just about everyone now has a generator so when power goes off, the generator kicks in within 30 seconds. All in all, the tourism industry is very well positioned and equipped to handle crisis, like cyclones. I think of all the industries in Fiji today, the tourism industry is very well positioned and structured to handle any kind of disaster. We have seen it. How many cyclones have happened here for the last 30 years or 40 years, but we always survive. When you are managing a hotel and you have about 400 guests and some of them are, for the first time, feeling this kind of stuff, that is the main part of the equation - to make sure they are safe, and you also make sure that your property is also safe. But as I have said, the industry is pretty well positioned and well structured to meet these types of threats. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I ask the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move his suspension motion, I wish to inform honourable Members that the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources has submitted his written response to Written Question No. 274/2024 which was asked on Monday, 2 nd December, 2024 by the honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs. That is now tabled and will be distributed accordingly. For the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
