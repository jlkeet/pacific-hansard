<body><h3>FIJI WORLD HERITAGE BILL 2023</h3><h4>FIJI WORLD HERITAGE BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Friday, 15 th September, 2023, I move: That the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 (Bill No. 25/2023), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 was introduced as a key legislative measure to safeguard Fiji’s natural and cultural heritage, ensuring its alignment with the international obligations under the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. Fiji became a State party to the World Heritage Convention on 21 st November, 1990, joining a global commitment to preserve sites of outstanding universal value. Adopted in the 1972 World Heritage Conference, the Convention provides a framework for protecting cultural and natural heritage worldwide. As a signatory, Fiji pledged to implement legislative administrative measures to uphold its responsibilities under the Convention. In September 2023, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was tasked which scrutinising the Heritage Bill with a mandate to review its provisions and report findings to Parliament. This process ensures that the legislation was comprehensive and reflective of Fiji's unique heritage needs. The Heritage Bill 2023 seeks to domesticate the principles of World Heritage Convention, providing a framework for recognising, protecting and managing sites with potential and outstanding universal values. The Bill establishes mechanisms such as the Fiji Heritage Council, the Fiji Register, the Trust Funds, along with provisions for buffer zones to safeguard surrounding areas. These measures aim to preserve Fiji’s heritage for future generations, while fostering a sense of national pride and cultural identity. On the issues noted by Committee, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights identified several key issues with the Heritage Bill 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just outline here, on two occasions, the draft Bill has lapsed before Parliament and it was initiated again by the Coalition Government. One of the first issues that was highlighted is the ‘outstanding universal value’ and its meaning. The phrase may undermine the values and rights of indigenous and local communities by imposing an external perspective on heritage significance. This is one of the issues that the Committee had to deal with it here and tried to explain to those who appear before them. The definition of the word ‘management’. The narrow definition of ‘management’ in the Bill fails to adequately incorporate indigenous Fijian cultural aspects that limit the scope of heritage preservation.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2538 Another one is the definition of the word ‘nominated property’. The term does not sufficiently link cultural heritage to indigenous culture, potentially overlooking indigenous contributions to heritage. The term ‘buffer zones’. There is a need to specify the size and extent of the protective buffer zones around heritage sites to prevent damage from nearby developments. Another issue is the Council composition. The Heritage Council should include community representatives from areas with listed heritage sites, to ensure local and indigenous issues are adequately addressed in Heritage Management decisions. What is the extent of the changes made to the draft? The Standing Committee proposed several key amendments to the Heritage Bill 2023, to ensure clarity, precision, and in alignment with Fiji's obligations under the 1972 World Heritage Convention. The key proposed changes include the: • • • • • • Bill Title The title is proposed to be amended to ‘Fiji World Heritage Bill’, to clearly reflect its focus on World Heritage Sites and avoid confusion with broader heritage terms. Short Title Amendment The Bill’s purpose is proposed to be redefined to highlight Fiji's commitment to UNESCO World Heritage Convention, emphasising its obligation and guidelines. Inclusion of Tentative World Heritage Sites The Fiji Register is proposed to include both sites on the UNESCO Tentative List and the World Heritage Property List, ensuring a comprehensive documentation. Composition of the Council The Fiji World Heritage Council membership is proposed to be reduced from 12 to 8 members for efficiency, with key stakeholders retained for relevant experience. Nomination process Sites would be required to be first nominated to the Fiji Register, before considered for Tentative List or World Heritage List. Stricter Penalties The Committee proposed an increase in fines and imprisonment term for violations, impacting heritage sites, with higher penalties for individuals and corporations. I noted that there has been some slight increase in fines. Normally, this is seen as a deterrence, but as you understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are actually the maximum fines. There was an issue for the local communities whether these fines reflect their needs, but we will rely, when these matters come before the court because these are the maximum. Normally, fines will be imposed, or the penalties will be commensurate with the extent of the offence. • Buffer Zones The establishment of buffer zones is proposed to apply to the Tentative List and World Heritage Sites, providing additional protection from nearby developments. What is the Minister's role? The Minister would be required to formally declare potential World Heritage Sites before nomination, aligning with international process. One of the key issues</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2539 too that the Committee dealt with is the deliberation on the funding and management. The heading for Part 7 was amended to recognition and management heritage places and is proposed to be revised to establish a clear funding and management structure of heritage sites. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendments made to the Bill were extensive, reflecting a thorough review of its provisions. Clarification of terminology, streamlining of council membership and enhanced penalty structures are particularly significant in improving the Bill’s practical application. The emphasis of Fiji’s obligation under 1972 World Heritage Convention, along with the establishment of the clearer process for site nomination management, ensures that Fiji's heritage sites are better protected and managed in line with international standards. These changes stem from the Bill’s alignment with UNESCO guidelines and reinforces its ability to safeguard Fiji's unique cultural natural heritage for future generations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few days ago, there was a reference made by honourable Premila Kumar as to the extent of the changes made. The changes are significant because once the policy changes, then it will be reflected in the subsequent in terms of the use of terminology. That probably reflects that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse and commend this Bill to this august House. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I have five</p><h4>Speakers. Each speaker will have only eight minutes to speak.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Justice for his presentation of the Bill, but most of all, I want to thank the Chairperson of the Committee and the Committee Members, who have done a lot of hard work to get this Bill into the House as quick as they did. I sat on the Committee for quite a while, and I understood the nuances behind what had actually transpired. Also, I want to take the opportunity to thank the honourable Prime Minister, who referred this back to the Committee because this was originally brought under Standing Order 51. He saw the light, Sir, and sent it back so that it could be thorough. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just some background on this particular Bill, the honourable Minister for Justice said that this had gone through previous Parliaments, et cetera, and had a bit of a long life. One of the reasons why this Bill had come through initially, so that we would be compliant in terms of Levuka. So, it was pretty much, when it was originally done, it was like a Levuka-centric Bill. But opposed to Levuka getting its World Heritage status, it needed to be modified, it needed to be strengthened, it needed to look at how we would deal with other sites once they come up, all the places that required application to go get listed. The list, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on how you get into the World Heritage Listing is actually not easy. You have to tick many boxes to actually get there. I think as has been spelt out by the honourable Minister for Justice, the criteria for the assessment of it is that you must be of outstanding universal value. Some of the things in there, Sir, the nominated property, and I think there are about 10 or 12 of them, are just some examples, and you must represent the masterpiece of human creative genius. You must exhibit the important interchange of human values over a span of time, and the list goes on, and whether it is on the sea, whether it is on the land, there are many things in Fiji, and this relates to our tourism industry also. Once you get onto the World Heritage Listing, it becomes a tourism attraction, so this value-adds to our tourism industry.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>2540 Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, to get on to it, it is actually not easy. But along with the list that it has with respect to getting on to the World Heritage Listing, there is a lot of difficulties that we would have faced if it came in its original form. That is why I take my hat off to the Committee, Sir, for having done such a phenomenal amount of work, purely because there are sensitive issues in this. One of the things that was most important and something that everyone needs to know, is that the minute you go and try and get listed on the World Heritage site, you have to have a buffer zone that actually covers that area that you are actually trying to list. When you have these buffer zones, you are talking about people's land, people's livelihood, et cetera, it may be encroaching upon. There are issues that need to be dealt with very sensitively when we actually do make the application to do this. I remember, Sir, visiting Sigatoka Sand Dunes and the village nearby and the questions that were raised at the time were very valid. They said, so if you put the buffer zone around this particular place, we have already used up that particular area. What is going to happen to the people who actually live there? So, there are genuine questions that came about with all of this. Some of you may know that have a particular bat cave in Vanualevu, the name slips my mind at the moment of the area, but that particular bat cave exists and it could be one of the World Heritage Site Listing, it could go on, but there were issues because the actual cave and the bats are looked after by the villages of the surrounding area, but they do not own the land. It is actually a piece of freehold land that was given to them, I am not sure, maybe the Chairman might be able to correct me, I am not sure if it was given back to the State, but it is actually owned by a particular person. So, these things need to be dealt with, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Maybe, the State needs to step in to ensure that it goes back to the native landowners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of you have seen a $100 note on which a cockroach like photo exists, that is something that is edible. It actually exists in Navua, Sir. It only comes up once every eight years, and it is a delicacy. So, these are the things that we have within our country that we can actually put in, in terms of listing. We take these things for granted, but it must be done very carefully. There are very sensitive issues that come about with respect to land and whatever is in it and on it, and I think, Mr. Speaker, the issues that I have actually raised were of genuine concern. I remember the first time we actually visited Levuka to try and get some discussions done, they did not turn up because they were angry, because they were not sure, because they were not able to do many things. Once this Bill comes into place, there is a long road ahead to get things right and this particular Bill, I think in the next Budget, honourable Minister for Finance, we might have to sit down and have a look at it and probably get some funding in it on a yearly basis so we can actually take care of these things, so we can actually get some research done, so we can have a good team to work on it so that we protect what we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is now something that will have to be included in our Budget on a yearly basis so that we get the system right, so that we can put these things on the World Heritage Listing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I commend the entire Committee that has done a lot of work on it and I commend the initial people that were actually on it who drafted the Bill. As a matter of fact, we faced a lot of difficulty because those who initially drafted were no longer at the Solicitor- General's Office. So, it was a very hard job trying to even get the Attorney-General's Office to actually provide all the necessary information. I also commend to the former Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, who was very, very approachable when we were trying to get this done.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2541 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with what is in it, I commend what is before us and we agree with the Bill being put forward before the House. I thank you. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the motion that is before the House, just a continuation with respect to the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023, in its current form that has been amended from the Solicitor-General’s Office, is perfect. I wish to inform this august House that this is the Bill that everyone has been waiting for. There are three issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise with regards to the Bill that we are speaking about. Firstly, this has been a long overdue Bill and the weight of this long overdue Bill has been carried much about Levuka, given that the introduction of this Bill, as rightly said by honourable Koya when it was tabled in its first instance, was Levuka-centric, the wording in its name itself had highlighted Heritage Bill. Upon further consultation and upon advice from the Department of Heritage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we came to find out that it was to be focussed on sites that had World Heritage status. Hence, if you see the amendment, honourable Members, there is an amendment in the name of the Bill which says that it is only centred on World Heritage status sites in Fiji and it has been long overdue for this and that has touched on the lives of the people of Levuka, given that it has been coming through the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, then it went to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, it has lapsed and has come again in this Parliament term. We are very fortunate that we are finally here to have this Bill passed. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, with regards to the substance of what the Bill has entailed in terms of our world heritage status in Fiji, firstly, we are meeting our requirements as per the UNESCO Convention. Secondly, if you go to Levuka, you will find out that they have raised a lot of issues with regards to this Heritage Bill. Finally, after the previous Friday, we finally got the green light from the landowners, and it had been one of the challenging times for us to get them. They are owners of the buffer zones, as was articulated by the honourable Minister for Justice and honourable Koya. We did not have time to consult them and that was our last consultation, and for them to give their blessings towards the amended Fiji World Heritage Bill in its passing, it is truly a remarkable achievement with regards to the Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute to this particular Bill that is before us. As very rightfully said by honourable Members who have spoken before me, it has taken quite a time to amend this Bill and bring it in the form that it can be presented into this august House. I would like to thank the Chairman and the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for inviting me to the Committee after I objected to the initial motion that it should not be rushed through and should be passed on to the Committee for deliberation. We had a thorough discussion, and I can see that the name of the Bill has changed to ‘Fiji World Heritage Site’, focussing mostly on Levuka rather than all the other national heritage sites.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>2542 Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, I was going through the Bill and I would like to quickly go over some of the Clauses that still seem to be a bit confusing and there were certain recommendations that were accepted. The first one is about the Fiji World Heritage Council. It is good to see that the number has drastically decreased. It was a very big council at first but now it is eight. My only concern is, if we are focussing specifically on Levuka, I was told that we can co-opt someone to be part of the council but that person might not have the voting rights as a co-opted person. This is the only site, Mr. Speaker, whereby we are dealing with people - Fijians. In all the other national heritage sites, we are basically dealing with animals or forests. So, at least, they could be included. In the near future, if we are going to review the Bill, we might have to consider, not just the ratepayers of Levuka, but also the landowning unit. Someone should represent them in this council because their views and ideas should be very much incorporated and heard in the council as well. The other thing the honourable Minister might want to clarify is on the function of the council. Now that we are focusing specifically on Levuka as a World Heritage Site, Clause 8(1)(a)(i); “the recognition and management of places in Fiji having potential and actual world heritage values.” Is it still with the World Heritage Council or is it something that is under National Trust of Fiji now because there is a National Trust Act as well which manages all the heritage sites. So are we duplicating or is it something we need to look into? The other thing is establishing, maintaining and updating a database of Fiji’s heritage sites. Again, this is something that was dealt with by the National Trust of Fiji. So, if we are just focusing only for Levuka, these people will have one register and National Trust of Fiji will have another register, so how will they communicate with each other, or is it preferable to have one register rather than having two? Moving on further in the Bill, Mr. Speaker, there is similar concern in Part 4 – Fiji Register, whether Clause 16(a) and (b) should be part of it or as we are saying, this particular Bill is only for the World Heritage Site and whether (a) and (b) is null and void now, a potential world heritage place and on a tentative list. So, who keeps this list, is it the National Trust or is it the World Heritage Site, because this is only dealing with one particular site now? So, there are some changes here and there, and it might be confusing. As I was saying, the initial Bill was overlapping, the Fiji Museum, the National Trust, Heritage Department that was formerly previously with the Ministry of Education and then the Council. So, there were a lot of overlapping and these are some of the things that we might want to fine tune if we actually opt to review this particular Bill in the near future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other one I would like to support, is on the increase of penalties. Again, it is very important to protect the sites and there needs to be hefty penalties in place if we want to actually protect our national heritage sites. But very well explained by the Minister that these are the maximum depending on the kind of damage or destruction that is actually done. The Magistrate or the Court might decide what would be the fine that is going to be placed on. But one of the very important things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this and we also found during our time was, we need a high level of advocacy in Levuka, especially in Levuka because the initial understanding of the people was that they cannot do anything with regards to their building, and that it had deteriorated to such as state, that now some of those buildings cannot be maintained. But it was not the case at that point in time, I believe the advocacy was not there. The face needs to be the same and the interior, that can be changed, but at least the face would actually look the way it is supposed to be, as it was. We cannot actually change it, we can maintain it, but it should remain in</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2543 the form that it was when it was actually built. Sir, a lot of advocacy is needed, and for that to actually eventuate and to implement this particular Bill, especially in Levuka, we need to ensure that we have an office based there for town and country planning because the application is coming all the way to Suva, and by the time it goes back, it becomes a very tedious and long process. I urge the Government to set-up a department so that people can be addressed and their processes when they do an application, can be expedited and handled by someone sitting in Levuka, rather than people of Levuka travelling all the way to Suva and trying to get things done over here to renovate the buildings. We have seen that some of the buildings has gone down and they are more no more. So, in order to actually prevent that from happening in the future we need to set-up our department of Town and Country Planning and a staff to be based in Levuka. The other thing that is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we might want to consider in the future is whether we still want to have the whole of Levuka Town as a World Heritage site or we want to specifically select a couple of buildings, so that other buildings can be brought down and new buildings can be constructed to increase the economic value of Levuka. Majority of the building owners they are very much interested to be part of this particular programme, but some of them they actually want to. So, while we are protecting some of the properties as a heritage site, we can allow some of the building owners to come up with a new building. So that economic activity also increases because at the moment we do not have enough rooms if we want to take tourists to Levuka to see these heritage sites, and then they have to go a bit further away from the buffer zone to have resorts and and hotels built. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, I thank the Committee for bringing this particular Bill and I request if they can consider the recommendation in the further review. Thank you and I support the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill that is before Parliament and that is the Fiji World Heritage Bill, 2023. Before I go further, I just like to respond to few issues that were raised by the honourable Maharaj and that is on Clause 6 on the World Heritage Council. The World Heritage Council establishes those that are there in Clause 6(2), it comprises all the Permanent Secretaries and those responsible for the Trust, Fiji Museum plus other representatives from the Town and Country Planning. This Council is for those that will be key decision makers on part of Government that will be overlooking these World Heritage Sites. For those that are in the management in the World Heritage Site they will form a management committee. This committee will include the residence that are there at that World Heritage Site, like Levuka and it will also include those landowners that are in the buffer zone. They will be in the committees. They will not be part of this Council. What this Council will do, will then work with that Committee, and that Committee is provided with funding. If you look at the funding that is there in Clause 30 of the Bill, the Council will then approve the funding where this Committee will then manage those World Heritage Sites and also include the buffer zones where the landowners too surrounding the UNESCO Levuka World Heritage Site will also benefit and managing that, so they can minimise the impact on the core World Heritage Site.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>2544 Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 5 th December, 2024 On the register that you have raised, in terms of the register for the National Trust and also the register that is established here. If you go into the definition of register it talks about the Fiji’s register of places established under Section 16. If you go to Clause 16, it establishes the Fiji Register for the registration of any place dominated to be: In order to become a World Heritage Site, and a potential World Heritage place. (1) (2) Tentative list to meet the requirements. After meeting those requirements with UNESCO then you can be declared or listed and seen to be a World Heritage Site. So, that is why this particular register that honourable Maharaj said, whether there will be two registers, it will be all in one register where you will have in that register those that are potential world heritage places. They will go for nomination, and if they pass, they will be listed as a tentative list under UNESCO. If they go pass that, then they will be declared or listed as a World Heritage Site. So, it will be all in one register so that there is no double system. It will complement each other. The other important thing given one of the key issue in this particular Bill is the World Heritage Site needs to have this outstanding universal way, and that is what we are protecting in this particular Bill. And now in Fiji there is only one World Heritage area that is under world list and that is Levuka Town. We had issues when we went there earlier with the residences of Levuka, given the processes they have to follow in renovating their homes and also in trying to develop other businesses. But the passing of this Bill will then allow a pathway in Clause 29 that will allow the process of how the applications, whoever wants to do any development will go to the Council, be approved through the management plan and also the commencement of the Council will be requested after it goes to the Town Council Planning or the Director of the Town and Country Planning. There were issues raised in Levuka. Opposite of the Mavida Hotel, there is a service station that was built two years or three years ago. The issues were brought up on how that particular service station or how that businessperson was allowed by the Town and Country Planning to build that particular service station. Because there was no law available at that time that prevented a new development to take place in that World Heritage Site. This particular Bill, when it comes into force, Clause 29 now provides a procedure on how the Director Town and Country Planning will need to adhere to this particular Council on what type of development to be done there so it does not have more destruction on what we call this outstanding universal value in Levuka. I think it was done during that time, it was surprising given probably two years or three years ago, I do not know who was the Minister responsible, I will not name. That is a concern that was raised in Levuka, given that Levuka was listed as a World Heritage Site back in 2013. In 2013, the Government then, had the view of protecting Levuka as a World Heritage Site but we do not know what happened later when that development was allowed, given the intention there was to protect Levuka. Those are a few things that I would like raise. The other thing that we clarified with the Council and the Department of Heritage was a buffer zone. It will not affect the rights of the land-owning units. If they want to go and use their plantation or build their houses, that does not affect anything. If only they want to go and lease out their land, then they will have to go through iTLTB that will have to get their consent from the Council on what type of development will happen on the lease, so it does not have an impact on the whole heritage area. So those are a few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir that I would like to comment on, and I fully support</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2545 the Bill. Just to end on a few things that also came up, and it was good that the honourable Koya has raised this, because of one of these issues is on the historical injustice in Levuka and probably a land claims tribunal to be set up, given these are some of the interests from the people of Lovoni, where the honourable Minister will know, they have some historical claims on the land and also the Turaga na Tui Levuka if a land claims tribunal can be set up and their interest can be brought forward on those claims with their evidence to prove that there were traditional owners. Already it will be a Heritage Bill, if the settlement happens, the honourable Minister for Lands, and probably this land can go back to native. It did not happen before, it was not allowed in the previous Government, but we hope that under this new Coalition Government that can happen. It will give much freedom and justice to those who need them, especially the landowners in Levuka. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023. Some may argue that World Heritage is a foreign concept. The principle that guides its successful implementation at the national level, is best left to the State party like Fiji. We need to embrace this and dictates its implementation, ensuring the careful blend of traditional and indigenous values. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill shows our deep commitment that heritage matters. We are sowing a culture of respect and revenge for the legacy that our forefathers have left us. We need to embrace this, so that our children of tomorrow can celebrate their values. The Bill is a necessity. Fiji rectified the 1972 World Heritage Convention in 1970. It is a requirement for State parties to take appropriate legal measures necessary for the identifications, protection, conservations, presentations, rehabilitations of its heritages. We are a nation that champion discipline and honour at international stage. In the same way, we are committed to honouring our obligation under the 1972 World Heritage Convention. This Bill is comprehensive. Comprehensive because, it has gone through a series of consultation. Concerns, aspirations of resource owners, our people and our communities collated during these consultations, have been factored into the Bill. The latest of these consultations was with the landowning units, that traditionally own land located within the buffer zone that protects the Levuka nominated property. They were never consulted, and I have been reliably informed that the land-owning units welcome the initiative and the purpose of the Bill which was then explained to them for ease of understanding. The bill paves the way for the legal protections of Fiji Natural Cultural Heritage, expressing our shared commitment to preserving a legacy for the future generations. This is our moment and the only time we can work collectively to safeguard what’s ours, is for now and in the future. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Bill is not impediment to development. Over the years, especially in Levuka, and on the island of Ovalau, our citizen has been misinformed and ill advised that Heritage halts development. These benefits spans from social infrastructure to economic returns which are crucial for the management of the site or place. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill enhances our ability to protect Fiji rich culture, legacy and makes it easier for resource owners to engage with the heritage regulations, the streamlining of regulatory process, offering a more efficient and user-friendly approach to managing heritage properties is expected to benefit Heritage site owners, developers and the nation by providing clear guideline and reducing administrative hurdles.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>2546 Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 5 th December, 2024 The Bill promotes sustainable system. One of the biggest challenges faced by the heritage sector has been the provision of management plan to support site or place managing community given approach to management and the availability of sustainable funding. The Bill now provides for this missing core arrangement to support the successful management of potential world heritage place in Fiji. Fiji tentative and world heritage listed sites, this is also extended to support the demarcations and management of buffer area that supports the core Heritage Protection area. This is the first for Heritage related legislation in the country. Our new Fiji Sustainable Tourism Framework promotes culture and heritage as a key pillar. Tourist based are geared towards this interactive experience. However, Fiji lacks cultural program, content in our heritage space, such as Levuka Town, Navala Village, Sigatoka Sand Dunes, lack the financial support and incentive to be remain viable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am indeed grateful to be Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law, Human Rights and its esteemed Members from both sides of the House for their invaluable support and careful scrutiny of the elements of the Bill. This has contributed immensely to the finalised amendment Bill we have which I firmly believe is ready to be passed by Parliament. I could never be firm in saying that the Bill is ready for passing to be an Act, fostering recognition and management of heritage place and space, including properties that have the potential to become world heritage sites. Mr. Speaker, I fully support the Bill. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the Committee and its Chairman for their hard work, visiting Levuka, of course, Ovalau. As we all know, the old capital of Fiji, there is a lot of history. Thank you, honourable Bulitavu, for picking out a story about the people from Lovoni. I have just been handed a note from the honourable Prime Minister that some i taukei ni qoliqoli from Makogai are under the VKB with the people of Navatu. I think the other day, an honourable Member from the other side was talking about Navosa, yes, indeed. As we deal with some of these key issues, it resonates with the search for the truth and, of course, the Coalition Government is committed to doing that. Imagine, eight years have lapsed, and this Bill has been going round and round. Honourable Koya mentioned about the role of the honourable Prime Minister. Yes, we have a Prime Minister who cares and listens, not the Prime Minister who existed in the past Administration. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Yes, we concede, we go, we change, we listen and we have the political will, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We will do it, just like we did it last year. Honourable Prasad said that. If anything, it is the demonstration of who your leader is. Unfortunately, you cannot say it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Too much hot air:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, why disinformation exists is because people from here do not go to Levuka. When you carry out planning, you meet with the very people. If you had done this from the beginning, we would not be here, but we are here, we listen and that is the hallmark of democracy. The people of Levuka are so grateful. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is going to help improve the area’s image and pride. It promotes the community beautification for Levuka. When you talk about Levuka, you talk about Lomaiviti - the heart of Fiji. It also builds opportunities and a healthy productive community partnership.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2547 Honourable Bulitavu and honourable Vasu mentioned about the Council. In 2022 and last year, there were a lot of engagements with the people of Levuka. I have begun to explain to them why. Why they understood because we just sat and talanoa with them. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the gateway but it is not one size fits all. Yes, we recognise the other things that needs to be done. It will be done, but first get the Bill endorsed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is under the Ministry for iTaukei Affairs, but at one time, it was with the Ministry of Education. One of the reasons why it has laboured on is because it has just been moving around. We are committed that under the steady leadership of the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and, of course, with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we need the financial support. One of the key issues with the people of Levuka is, what is the point of preserving when they cannot be assisted financially? As we speak, the restoration of the Cession has not been fully completed. We have discussed at length, we are so grateful that we have come to an agreement, and this is the way forward for Fiji - by endorsing this Bill before the House. I thank everyone for their contribution, I fully endorse this Bill before the House. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 (Bill No. 25/2023) passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. 17 of 2024)]</p></body>
