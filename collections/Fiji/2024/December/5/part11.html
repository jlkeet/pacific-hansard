Municipal Councils in Fiji are legislated under the Local Government Act 1972. Municipal councils, like Savusavu Town Council, provides overall policy direction to maintain and improve the quality of services and facilities for their ratepayers. Savusavu Town Council serves an estimated population of 6,000 in the greater Savusavu area and is responsible for the provision and maintenance of a wide range of services to its ratepayers and residents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report captures the various activities reported in the three Annual Reports from 2011 to 2013. Given the number of years that have lapsed, about 10 years to 11 years, the Committee made no assessment on the efficiency or otherwise of Savusavu Town Council. The Committee is, however, grateful to the Council for the information and data that are presented in these Annual Reports. The Committee is of the view that a consistent reporting structure would assist in the fair analysis of the Reports. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government to work in collaboration with town councils to identify a standard reporting template for use in all its future annual reports. I wish to thank the Savusavu Town Council for compiling and submitting its annual reports from 2011 to 2013. I also thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, and of course the hardworking secretariat of the Committee for the compilation of this bipartisan report. With this Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has dealt with all the reports that were referred to it in the last two Parliament sittings. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
