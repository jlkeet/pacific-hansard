<body><h3>SUGAR INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3><h4>SUGAR INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Sugar Industry (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 23/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the next sitting of Parliament and upon (e) presentation of the report on the Bill by the Standing Committee; the Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament and that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, on various occasions, I have emphasised my plans in addressing the challenges of the sugarcane farmers. One of the matters that I have agreed to resolve as the Minister responsible for the sugar industry was to give farmers back their voice by allowing them to choose their own members to serve the Growers Council Board. We want to stop making decisions on matters affecting them as farmers, and this can only happen if the growers election is reinstated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the honourable Members of this august House that we are making appropriate use of Standing Order 51. The Sugar Industry (Amendment) Bill to facilitate the reinstatement of the process of the election of members of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC). Mr. Speaker, Sir, For the past two years, I have had many pocket meetings with the sugarcane farmers both, in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. The farmers, in nearly all meetings, had inquired with me on why there are delays in conducting the elections for the members of the SCGC. Their eagerness and interest indicate that they can no longer wait to get their voice back. It was taken from them in 2009. Since then, the farmers voices have been diluted with the experience from the previous government. This not only affected them psychologically but impacted their contribution to the industry, resulting in an overall decline in production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 15 years now and we cannot afford to delay the elections and reinstate everything back to the way it was before in 2009. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual work to reinstate the process of the SCGC began as soon as I got into Parliament in December 2024. Following necessary consultations with the SCGC and the institution representing all Growers Councils - the Sugar Industry Tribunal, the Registrar of Sugarcane Farms, approval was given from Cabinet in August 2023.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Sugar Industry (Amendment) Bill 2024 2531 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has continuously been consulting the SCGC to ensure that necessary work is undertaken to allow sugarcane farmers’ election to be conducted before the beginning of the next cane crushing season, which is June 2025. After the election is conducted, the new Council Board or Directors will get into office to take charge of the farmers’ affairs. There will no longer be any appointments made by the Minister, which has been happening since 2015. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill was drafted by legal experts from the Office of the Solicitor- General with input from the Ministry of Sugar, the SCGC, the Sugar Industry Tribunal and Fijian Elections Office. The Bill aims to simply reinstate the election process for the members of the SCGC. Certain clauses of the Sugar Industry Act 1984 was removed to repeal the SCGC election and the composition of the Council. Therefore, through this Bill and the Principal Act, it will amend to reinstate Clauses 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 43, 46 and 47 that were either amended or completely deleted. The reinstatement of these Clauses will also allow the election to take place and new members of the Council Board to be appointed through the farmers election. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have done necessary consultations, and this Bill is a straightforward one, so we are referring this Bill to the Standing Committee for further deliberation. The Standing Committee will have several weeks to conduct their own consultations and analyse the Bill. My Ministry, including the SCGC and the Sugar Industry Tribunal are available to provide any further support to the Standing Committee where and when required. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I open the floor for debate, I wish to remind Members that you may speak for up to 20 minutes only and I should emphasise that the debate should be confined to the procedural aspects of Standing Order 51 and why the Bill needs to go through this process. Honourable Members, the floor is open for debate. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the honourable Minister for coming up with this particular Bill that I am sure is very vital for the sugar sector, in particular, for the sugarcane growers. I think, as a matter of principle, it has always been our hope that things would not have to go through Standing Order 51, but we are grateful that in this particular case, while it has gone through Standing Order 51, it is something that is needed and there is time. There is a bit of time. We know we have Christmas around the corner and to get this Bill back by March will mean that the Committee will have to start working in December, and probably by February, and we hope that, that will be facilitated so that we can meet the deadline that the honourable Minister requires. As I have said, we always talk about not using Standing Order 51 but in this case, there is some time, which gives us an opportunity as representatives of the people to take this back to the stakeholders and to come back with a full assessment of this particular Bill for the benefit of Parliament and Fiji. So, we agree with the recommendation that is before this august House. MR. SPEAKER.- Since there are no other interventions, I now call on the honourable Minister to speak in reply. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Usamate and the Opposition for taking this Bill very seriously. I hope we can settle this Bill by March and hold the election before June. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>2532 Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Question put. Motion agreed to.
