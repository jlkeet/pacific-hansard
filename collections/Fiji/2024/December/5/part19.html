<body><h3>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024</h3><h4>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024, I move: That the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 (Bill No. 5/2024), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, honourable Members, The Child Care and Protection Bill embodies our commitment to the well-being of children in Fiji. The Bill commits us to protecting and supporting all Fijian children, but especially those deprived of parental care, and those who cannot remain with their families because of abuse or neglect. This Bill displays our commitment also to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we ratified 30 years ago. Our Ministry in partnership with UNICEF produced the latest 2024 report titled Economic Costs of Violence Against Children in Fiji, and this survey conducted revealed shocking statistics, 81 percent of our children, aged 1 to 14 years, experience some form of violent discipline, 65 percent of our children experience psychological aggression, 68 percent of our children experience some form of physical punishment during this period in their lifetime. This survey also revealed a significant problem, which is called poly victimisation. The exposure of a single child to multiple types of abuse.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>2560 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 The study revealed that the total economic cost of violence against children in Fiji, is estimated about $460 million which is equivalent to about 4 percent of our GDP annually. This Bill represents the Coalition Government's response to the shocking statistics and the urgent need to protect and care for our children. The National Development Plan aims to eliminate violence against children through responsible policies and coordinated referral networks. The Bill replaces the outdated Child Protection Philosophy of Rescue and Removal which is over 50 years old. This outdated philosophy ignores the importance of children's holistic development within their own family and community. Indeed, it ignores the harm of depriving a child of their broader families nurture and the importance of their community. Mr. Speaker, under the United Nations Committee which monitors the Child Rights Convention as pointed out, that the number of residential homes and children coming into residential care in Fiji keeps increasing over the years. Most children find themselves in residential care because they have been neglected or abused by family. They spend very long periods of time in residential care with no love of family or their community. We cannot let this continue. That is why the Child Care and Protection Bill prioritises family preservation and family-based forms of care. It explicitly acknowledges and reinforces the key role of parents, families and communities in raising children and protecting them from harm. It also makes the distinction between a child in need of care and protection and a child in conflict with the law. Importantly, under the current child protection laws, the Government can only intervene once a child has been abused, and this is too late. Success only comes when we prevent or intervene early, and this Bill encompasses that prevention including early intervention and response services. Options for voluntary care plans can be negotiated with the child's parents or caregivers where court orders are used as a last resort when agreements cannot be reached. The child, parents, extended family and community leaders can be actively involved with care planning. Priorities given to kinship and family-based care. Prevention and early intervention has to be the new talk that we walk. That is why this Bill is revolutionary and it is transformative change because we do need to prevent and intervene early before it is too late. This will be the key to breaking the cycles of abuse that are being inflicted upon about 80 percent of our children. On that note, Mr. Speaker, I commend the Bill before the House, and I seek the support of Members. MR. SPEAKER.- I have a list of speakers with me, honourable Members. The floor is now</p><h4>open. There are six speakers with six minutes each.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk on this particular Bill. I think over here in this House, for a long time now, we have been talking about the social ills that impact our country. When we talk about it, at the end of the day, the solution that we always come back to is the family. At the heart of that family is children. That is why this is important. I think if we are able to do what this Bill wants us to do, is we are to have an impact on all the other problems that we are talking about. If we are talking about drugs and all of those things, it comes back to this, to being able to look after children, to be able to care and protect for them. If you look at the title of the Bill, it talks about providing for welfare and providing protection for children. I think this is fundamental. The crux of this Bill is to be able to do these two things.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 2561 One, to provide for that protection, to provide for that welfare. Secondly, to promote it, to make sure that it becomes instilled in the minds of everyone about the importance of this. To promote the welfare and to promote the protection of children as something that is important for us. The way that I see it, children are actually our future. If our children do well in strong families and if they do not have care and protection that allows them to become the kind of people that they are supposed to be, this Bill helps us to get there. It establishes a department for children that tries to make sure that children get the future that they deserve, and when children get the future that they deserve, that means the future of our country is in better hands. I look at that Bill, this is precisely what it is talking about because the breakdown of the family is the root of most our problems. When there are problems in families, as we will see, later on we will talk about the responsibility of parents, which is part of Clause 7 of this Bill is very important. It will be able to address that particular issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just looking at some of the Clauses that we have in this Bill, I will just look at some of the big motherhood things that we have in this Bill. It talks about the objectives of the Bill to promote the wellbeing of children, promote them and protect them. That is basically what we are talking about here. This Bill acknowledges that this is something that cannot just be done by schools or just the department or just a family or just a church. There is a role for everyone. I think at the end of the day, one of the messages that has come through this is Part 4 and Part A - the role of parents, families, communities, children, government agencies, non-government agencies, the importance of collaboration with that ultimate aim of making sure we can care and look after the children. Providing for the care and protection of children in circumstances where their parents, families and communities are unable to do so. In the past, in our communities when children did not have that care and protection, we had extended families that could help. But where we are going through these flux in Fiji where that level of social support has begun to deteriorate, eroded over time. I think this mechanism is kicking-in at a time as we are going through these flux between extended families to nuclear families, we have this message that comes in, these mechanisms that we have here that allow us to make sure that we can care and protect the children. Who is this Bill for? It is for all the children that are not getting the care and protection that they need. Under Clause 5, it lists them all; children who are orphaned, abandoned and also where the parents of the children are unable to care for that child and unwilling, the child lives or works on the street in circumstances that expose them to exploitation. This is a major problem. When you talk to the people at the Department of Children, they talk about parents who are unwilling. I think there is a crisis there in terms of values or the responsibility that we have in this in this country for the children that we have. Children have been displaced or separated from their family, the physical development of the health of the child. Wherever we went around Fiji, you know what people said we need to do? Kana kuita! This is the solution that people think about. I believe that the problem that that mentality comes from is the failure for us to deliver what we have in Clause 7. Clause 7 talks about responsibility of parents and this is where the emphasis has to be. A parent has the primary role of the safeguarding (keeping them safe), and promoting the well-being of the child, registering the birth of the child. So many people are not even registered. When you are not registered, you are not a legal entity. You do not have access to all the things that you need to get. All of these responsibilities - child's basic needs are met, receives adequate nutrition, children must have enough food. Why do they steal? Maybe because they are not getting food, maybe they are not getting that emotional support. We have to be able to make sure that the parents can do this.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>2562 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Child receives appropriate medical care, child’s access to basic education and further study, child to participate in social and cultural activities. It is important that parents inculcate social cohesion and the culture of the parents into the children. A lot of us today, some of our children cannot speak their own languages. They have forgotten about tilou and all of these things, have gone out of the door. Instil self-discipline, tolerance and respect. These are the kinds of things, we have talked social cohesion the other day, this is where it starts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have only got only 16 seconds. I believe that this Bill is very important for us. We need and it requires a paradigm shift on how we look at children. I call upon the honourable Minister for Finance, there will be a need to do a lot of training; people will need to be trained, the staff in the Ministry, the Police, et cetera. There will need be resources thrown at this. This thing will not work unless it is operationalised by training, translating the legislation and making sure there is enough resources to make it work. If we do not get the resources behind this Bill, it is not going to happen and I call upon the Government to make sure the resources are put in place over a phase sort of approach to make this happen for the future of our children, for the future of our country. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make my contribution to the Bill that is before the House. I would just like to continue from where honourable Usamate has left off, and that is rightfully so the responsibility of parents, which is highlighted in Clause 7. I, for one, when we were go on consultations. I usually said during our consultations, this is one of the Bills that Government should not have created in the first place. This is the negligence of parents that Government has seen that it intends to come and create this Bill. When we were at consultations, those were my words. This is the negligence of parents that government has seen, they are not doing their responsibility, that they are keen to develop this Bill. I am thankful to the previous government for coming up with a Bill and to the current Minister for putting the Bill to Parliament. There are few sections that are in the Bill that I would like to touch on that are very important, especially one responsibility of the parents and this is one, that is the most important in my opinion of the Bill. The Bill entails basically what the heading is - Care and Protection. It also introduces new offences, the offences that will intend to amend Crimes Act 2009. There are some new offences that have been created because of changing times and what have children been doing, things like luring sexual communication of children, all these are new offences which intend to amend the Crimes Act. A lot of the things that are in this Bill are basically straightforward and the reporting of children, mandatory report as highlighted in this Bill are some of the suggestions that came during our consultation to also have church leaders inside, to also have the turaga ni koro. Those were some suggestions during our public consultation. But there was also the risk that, if those were the people that would be the mandatory reporters, even they would be the ones who are committing the offences against children. There was a big risk there. So, with consultation with the Ministry, we remained with what they have had in what is in the Bill. The Bill also protects all these mediatory reporters, there is the notion, especially in our iTaukei culture. If there seems to be something that is going on in our village setting, we tend to bury it, we tend to keep it. If we take it up to the turaga ni koro, he will just say, “let us just solve it there.” What we intend to do with this Bill is that introduce mandatory reporter, in cases of children that all these must need to be reported, given the seriousness of the offences that are coming in with regards to children, if you can see the proposed penalties, these are some of the suggestions that the Committee proposed – more serious penalties because of the risk of the children.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 2563 Lastly, Mr. Speaker, my last contributor, I tend to remind everyone again, and to those who are watching, and I urge, the introduction of this Bill is solely based on the negligence of parents. It should not have been coming in as a Bill, but this has something that Government is fully concerned, given the number of children who are wandering our streets who have lost love, who have lost that protection, so the Government has stepped in. This is my opinion, Mr. Speaker. This is a very important and urgent Bill and I thank the honourable Minister for bringing this Bill and I support it. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, the esteemed Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition and respected Members of this revered Parliament. I rise this evening to lend my voice and strong support to the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024. As we consider this Bill, let us be reminded of two roles that we share in agreement as lawmakers and guardians of our future which is our children. The heart of any nation lies in the well-being of its children. In their eyes we see hope, ambition and the future of our great country. It is our duty as lawmakers to invest in the safeguard of their future. Clause 4 of the Bill stipulates the objective of this Bill, and its core objective acknowledges the absolute right of our children, rights to protection, rights to normal childhood, the sense of being loved, cared for and fundamentally the right to life. It accentuates the responsibility of families, communities, government agencies, non-government entities to not just protect the right of our children, but to promote their overall well-being, providing them with a nurturing environment for their growth and development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our ethical response ability to ensure that every child is carefree of violence, free of abuse, neglect and exploitation. To this point, the Bill outlines clear circumstances in Clause 5, under which a child is considered to be in need of care and protection. To encompass a breath of situation, be it a child who has been an orphan or displaced, who lives or work under harmful conditions, or who is being neglected or abused or exploited, this Bill ensures that no child is left vulnerable. I request all honourable Members of Parliament to come together and support the Bill with an unfeared voice. These children depend on us and we must not let them down. We are making a solemn pledge to protect our children, confirming our commitment to shape a brighter, safer and more promising future for our country. This Bill is not just of great importance to our children, but it is also central to the makeup of our society. It will defend us as a country that nurtures its future generation with kindness, respect and dignity. Let us remember that every child in need is a call for us to respond, a test of our humanity and a reflection of our values. We owe them our best effort, our kindness and our care. As we discuss and debate the details of this Bill, let us remember to put our children first, for they are not just a beneficiary of this Bill, but also the promise of a better tomorrow. Biblically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are reminded of our critical responsibility, drawing from the Bible thoughts, each child is a divine gift to a family, an arrow in the hands of society. From Genesis to Revelation in the Bible underscore the irreplaceable worth of children and nurturing their protection and careful development. The Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 19:14, said and I quote: “Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them for the Kingdom of Heaven belong to such as this.” Christ thoroughly cautioned against action that harm little children and lead them astray.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>2564 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 Matthew 18:6 states, and I quote: “Anyone causes this little one to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.” In supporting this Bill, we reflect Christ’s advocacy for every child. Honourable Members of Parliament, let us not forget we serve a nation. A range of individuals and families are depending on us, expecting us to safeguard their precious ones. Therefore, it is directly upon our shoulders to ensure this Child Care and Protection Bill is more than just words on paper. The spirit of this critical Bill must become our living reality in every home, every school, every online platform, every province, every tikina, every village, every settlement and everywhere our children thrive. The Bill represents a beacon, guiding us to uphold the sanctity of childhood and care and to create a society where no child stands at risk. The Bill calls to furnish a safe haven where our children's dream bloom, their abilities are nurtured, their potential are fully realised and their innocence fiercely protected. Tonight, we have a golden opportunity to affirm our nation’s ethics and societal values. By supporting this Bill, we affirm our commitment to comply with the divine mandate of embracing the invaluable worth of our children. This Bill resonates the Bible mandate of protecting the innocent and the vulnerable. It is a testament to our belief, our faith, our culture and our future. As I conclude, I want to reiterate, it is our sacred duty to support this Bill tonight. I urge each respected Member of this House, irrespective of your political affiliation, stand by our children and by the future of our nation, let us unite and ensure Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 is passed and adequately implemented. Our future depends on our action today. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to contribute to the debate. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024. This is an important Bill because it is about children who are the future of our country. Children are our most valuable resource. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have two Bills this week which are child related. I see these Bills as very important and urgent in nature, since it is dealing with our children. Bills of this nature should be prioritised by Government because children are our topmost priority. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few other Bills which were not that urgent but was passed under Standing Order 51 recently, whereas this very important Bill which relates to children took months to be passed in this House. I am glad that this Bill was scrutinised by the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill for the following reasons. Firstly, I have carefully looked at the content of the Bill and I can say that the Bill has been well scrutinised by the Standing Committee, and I thank them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, our children need protection from abuse, violence and neglect. Parents, families and communities play a very important role in protecting children and this Bill caters for that. Parents have the primary role of safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of his or her child, to ensure that the child's basic needs are met, including any special needs relating to a disability. The other very important responsibility of parents is to protect the child from engaging in</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 2565 activities that are harmful to his or her health, education and moral development. The Bill also introduces provisions to improve reporting mechanisms for children in need of care and protection, and the Bill provides civil and criminal protection for people who report abuse. Mr. Speaker, Sir, children need protection because it can have profound impact on their lives both, in the present and in the future. We have seen so many cases of child abuse. Child abuse can lead to physical injuries, lifelong disabilities, and can impair cognitive and social development. Child protection systems ensure that every child has the right to grow, learn and play safely, and all this is very well covered in the Bill. This week, I have mentioned in the House that the school dropout has increased in 2023 compared to previous years. The Child Care and Protection Bill will assist in reducing the numbers. This is a very important Bill. I thank the Committee who have worked on this Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity. I support the Bill. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise in support of the Bill. The Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 is about promoting wellbeing and prevention of abuse. With the rising cases of child abuse and child neglect, the Bill empowers a newly established Department of Children to take necessary action for children in immediate danger, whether in the streets or in their family environment. We find children on the streets suffering neglect, children involved in drug trade, children as victims and children as perpetrators of crime. The Bill provisions for care of children who are orphaned, abandoned, as well as those living on the streets. Our Ministry did not have specific mandate, but this Bill now empowers the Department of Children to look at the issue of children on the streets. The Bill will enable our Department of Children to look out for those in harm's way of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. It also allows a child to be placed in safety if a person convicted of offence against a child is in the same household. Mr. Speaker, in the year 2023, a total of 1,477 child abuse cases were reported. That is an average of four cases a day. Of these, 54 percent of the child victims were girls and 46 percent boys. Sir, 68 percent of these cases involve child neglect, physical abuse or sexual abuse and 58 percent of the victims were below the age of 12 - a stark indicator of the vulnerability of younger children to harm. Disturbingly, 4.4 percent of the victims were below the age of one, which points to the devastating reality of infants being subjected to abuse. The perpetrators of these crimes were in 72.7 percent of cases known to the victim. Among them, 50 percent were immediate family members which is a heartbreaking reality that underscores the need for vigilant child protection efforts. Police has released figures for the month of October this year, and crimes against children increased by 39 percent in October, in which 64 percent were sexual, 28 percent were assault-related, while 8 percent included other offences. All the perpetrators of the 13 percent cases of domestic- related in crimes against children were male family members and the victims comprised of 90 girls and 78 boys in one month, Mr. Speaker. It is horrendous to note that five children were being abused today somewhere in Fiji. That is reported. There may be many more unreported cases.</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>2566 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 To improve on reporting on child abuse, the Bill features mandatory reporting, which will now add a few more professionals to have the duty to report a case of child abuse in the hope to see all children everywhere have someone looking out for them. Mandatory reporter will include childcare services and day-care providers, hostels, in addition to health professionals, teachers, police, counsellors, et cetera. Mandatory reporter who is aware of a child abuse and fails to report now can be convicted and fined. We hope this provision encourages eyes and ears to look out for safety of our children in all spheres. The Bill also helps the Ministry and our Child Care Department to tighten processes to protect children in the context of their families and communities, as well as those who will need to be under the State care. The Bill will mandate the registration of those agencies who work and intend to work with children in Fiji. The Bill acknowledges the role of families and communities in promoting the wellbeing and protection of our children and allows the Ministry to work with all stakeholders to ensure that our children are protected. The Bill also allows a lot more provision for collaboration for the protection of children between Government agencies, faith-based community and traditional leaders, as we have heard. With the concerning number of abuse, it allows all stakeholders to work together to arrest the problem. More in-depth work will be required in the Bill for referrals, case conferencing and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, family and community, before reaching a decision for the child's welfare plan. At present, our services to children is almost one way where officers decide on most of the intervention made on behalf the child in State care. Officers do not get significant input from family members on decisions regarding their child. With this Bill, there is expectation to ensure that our practice is more thorough, and family members and community elders have an input on the welfare of our child. With the passage of this Bill, we as Parliament and as a nation, are declaring that every child in Fiji deserves a safe nurturing environment regardless of gender, ethnicity and geography, and that means that we, as leaders in our Government, together with leaders in our community, must do everything in our power to ensure that wellbeing, development and protection. We must each commit to responsibility of bringing this legislation to life, across ministries education, health, social welfare and beyond. Together, we can break cycles of abuse and neglect we see everyday, but this effort cannot rest solely on the shoulders of the Government. We need our communities to rise alongside us, community leaders, faith leaders, parents, teachers, elders and youth, everyone has a role to play. Mr. Speaker look forward to this Bill and I support the motion. Thank, Mr. Speaker. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to voice my strong support for the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024, a vital piece of legislation that reflects our shared commitment to the wellbeing of Fiji’s children. At its core, the Bill reaffirms the truth that we cannot ignore. The primary responsibility for raising and protecting a child lies with their parents and the communities around them. Parents are the first teachers, the first protectors, and the first role models in their child's life. When parents are present and engaged, children thrive, not just in school but in life.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 2567 However, this is not a responsibility parents can carry alone. Communities have an equally important role to play. Strong, safe and supporting communities give children a sense of belonging and security. They provide an environment where children can flourish, shielded from harm and surrounded by positive influences. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, makes clear what parental and community responsibility looks like. It lays out the duty of parents to provide for their children's basic needs, ensure their education, protect them from harm and guide them to become good citizens. It also recognises that when these responsibilities are neglected or unmet, the State has a duty to intervene, not just a replacement for families, but as a safety net for children. However, Mr. Speaker, it is important to stress that State intervention should always be the last resort. By the time the law steps in, the damage has often already been done. This is why our focus must also be on prevention - ensuring parents and families have the supporting tools they need to succeed long before a situation deteriorates to the point of crisis. This Bill challenge us as leaders to send the clear message. Parenting is not just a personal choice, it is a social responsibility. It is time for all of us, parents, community leaders, teachers, faith- based organisations and neighbours to step up. If we wait for the Police or the Courts to act, we have already failed our children. Mr. Speaker, the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 is more than a legislation, it is a promise to the children of Fiji that we will do everything in our power to give them a safe, nurturing environment to grow up in. It is a call to parents and communities to take responsibility for their roles in shaping the future of the children of this nation. I urge all honourable Members to support this Bill and to reaffirm our commitment in protecting and empowering Fiji's children. Together, we can build a stronger, safer and more compassionate Fiji for the generations to come.

SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Tikodudua for his contribution. We have exhausted the list of our speakers for the debate on this important Bill. I now call upon the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection to speak in reply. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, in my hand, I hold up a hand-held fan that depicts the senibua or frangipani. Each of the five petals represent the values to guide us in the wellbeing of our children in this country. It reads, “love, respect, care, protection, trust”. The speakers before me, Mr. Speaker, have very adequately, aptly and aspiringly shared with us what our vision is for the people’s house when it comes to our children, and we are first and foremost. As we sit here, we are fathers and mothers, and caregivers. So, this is something that we speak from our heart. And we speak with our heart to the people of Fiji, “Please, let us work together for the wellbeing of our children. The Government cannot do it alone. Parliament cannot do it alone.” Mr. Speaker, in the last week alone, there have been reported cases of three missing girls under the age of 18 years. One is young as 13 years. We have seen an increasing number of cases by the Fiji Police Force of missing girls. What is happening to our society? When these girls are returned home, we do not here from them. This Bill makes us responsible to find out where these girls are and why they are going missing? If you are listening and watching, if an adult is using our children, especially our girls for illegal means, this is a warning to you. You are committing an offence, and we are coming for you. And for the community, if the neighbour or anyone who knows what is happening to these girls or to our children, please report it, first and foremost for the love of that child. Mr. Speaker, I thank the speakers who have spoken. I thank you, honourable Members. I thank the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for their hard work, just like the previous Bill, to bring these Bills to Parliament today. I thank you for your support in passing the Bill today. Vinaka vakalevu, Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 (Bill No. 5/2024) passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. 19 of 2024)]</p></body>
