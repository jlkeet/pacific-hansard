<body><h3>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024</h3><h4>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024, I move: That the Child Justice Bill 2024 (Bill No. 04/2024), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, and to all who are viewing from home on our Facebook page or on television; today marks a transformative moment in our history. This new law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, catapults us from old ways of thinking that keep crime rates the same and leave children without rights, to a new safer Fiji, one where children in conflict with the law do not go on to re-offend but instead, go on to become contributing members of society. This law also catapults Fiji into the role of leading the Pacific in evidence-based crime prevention and the recovery of children's lives. We now stand shoulder to shoulder with global leaders in this. As I have said before, this is because the Act finally responds to why children come into contact with the law, based on research and science about what stops children from offending. One of the most significant aspects of this Act is the focus on diversion and the raising of the age</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>2548 Child Justice Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 of criminal responsibility. We recognise that children are not merely miniature adults, they are developing individuals who require understanding, support and guidance. By prioritising diversion, we shift our approach from punishment to rehabilitation. We shift from entrenching existing problems to creating a pathway out of them. We create a chance for children to grow up as positive contributors to Fijian society. As we embrace this important step, it is essential to recognise how the Child Justice Bill works hand in hand with Fiji’s Child Care and Protection Bill. Together, these two pieces of legislation create a comprehensive framework designed to protect and nurture our children, ensuring they receive the support and protection they deserve, and that they go on to thrive as adults who will make a difference in our country. The Child Care and Protection Bill, of course, sets a foundation for the rights and welfare of children across our nation and we will be discussing that next, but by raising the age of criminal responsibility and focusing on diversion, the Child Justice Bill complements the protection of children by ensuring that children who find themselves in conflict with the law are heard, and the circumstances that led to their offending in the first place are addressed. These laws collectively signify our understanding that children are not simply individuals who have made big mistakes, but they are most often children who have survived or suffered neglect or abuse. The Child Justice Bill recognises that many children enter the justice system due to circumstances beyond their control, and it is our duty to intervene positively. To my fellow Parliamentarians, this is a call to action. We must champion the integration of these two Bills in our policies and practices. It is not enough to pass legislation. We must ensure that our systems work together seamlessly. This means collaborating across Ministries, engaging our communities and investing in resources necessary to implement these changes effectively. To my own ministerial colleagues, the success of this legislation hinges on our collective commitment to its implementation. We realise that the passage of this Bill to Act is only the beginning of our work, but each Ministry will have to do their work in bringing the Act to life. Of course, our Ministry will play a key role in supporting our colleagues. We will play a role in diversion and working with children and their families to understand why those children have come into contact with the law in the first place. As I have said when I introduced the Bill, many children who find themselves in conflict with the law come from backgrounds where they are homeless, broken homes or being neglected or abused. These are the very children we need to protect and support to build attachment with their own communities. To my Ministerial colleagues, the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Minister for Justice, I pledge to support your Ministries in the policy and cultural changes demanded by this new law. For the Police, this means officers need to be confident and adept at safely engaging with children, to properly understand their circumstances and to engage with my own staff in offering diversion. It means you will need policies, procedures and training to underpin this. To the honourable Minister for Justice, your role is in training legal professionals and law enforcement in the principles that this new Bill is vital. You must ensure that everyone involved understands the importance of rehabilitation over punishment and is equipped to implement these changes effectively, but this is not just an Act that has implications for the Police or Ministry of Justice.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2549 Schools are the optimal place to foster environments where children feel safe, supported and empowered to succeed. Safety will sometimes be the only protective factor for a child where they do not feel this belonging or safety at home. School can be the ultimate circuit breaker to a child coming into conflict with the law, through the very provision of safety and support. I look forward to working with the honourable Minister for Education and his Ministry to bring this to life. Similarly, I address the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. Your support in addressing the mental and emotional needs of children involved in the justice system is crucial. We need to ensure that appropriate counselling and therapeutic services are accessible, guiding our children towards healing and personal growth. The success of this legislation will not rest solely on the shoulders of Government. It is imperative that all Parliamentarians, regardless of party affiliation, recognise their obligation to support and promote the implementation of this Bill. To my colleagues across the aisle, I invite you to join us in championing this cause. Let us work together, united by the common goal of creating a just and compassionate system for our children. Your voices are essential in raising awareness and fostering a culture that prioritises rehabilitation over retribution. We need to engage our communities, to inform them about the benefits of the diversion programme and the significance of raising the age of criminal responsibility. We need to encourage discussions that dispel myths and understanding of our new approach to child justice. Your role as Opposition is crucial in ensuring that this Bill receives the support and scrutiny it deserves. I know you will hold us accountable for implementing this new law and monitoring its progress, in ensuring that our commitment to child welfare is reflected in tangible outcomes. Together, we can ensure that this legislation is not merely a set of words on paper, but a living commitment to our future. On that note, Mr. Speaker, I commend the Bill to the House and seek the support of all honourable Members. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list of five speakers with me. Again, each speaker will be given eight minutes to speak on the Bill. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise with a deep sense of purpose and hope as I speak in support of the Child Justice Bill 2024. This Bill is not merely a piece of legislation, it is a beacon of compassion, justice and a brighter future for our children. It is a testament to our unwavering commitment to nurturing and protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the core of this Bill is a simple, yet powerful principle - the best interest of our child must always come first. This is not just a legal requirement, it is a moral imperative. Our children are our future, and it is our sacred duty to ensure that they grow up in an environment that fosters their wellbeing development and dignity. One of the most transformative aspects of the Child Justice Bill 2024, Sir, is its emphasis on rehabilitation rather than punishment. This Bill recognises that children, by their very nature, have an immense capacity for growth and change, instead of subjecting them to punitive measures that can scar them for life. This Bill promotes rehabilitation and re-integration into society. It embodies the belief that every child deserves a second chance, an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>2550 Child Justice Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 become productive law-abiding citizens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is heartening to see that the Child Justice Bill 2024 continues to uphold key protections for children that were previously addressed in the Media Industry Development Act 2010. It is good to see that the following provisions which were in the repealed Media Industry Development Act 2010are now included in this Bill. (1) Protection of children: The best interest of the child is prioritised, and children are protected from harm. This includes ensuring that children in police custody are treated with care and respect, taking into account their age, gender and social needs. (2) Content restrictions: This Bill prohibits the publication of information that identifies children involved in legal proceedings. This crucial measure protects the privacy and dignity of our young ones, preventing potential harm from public exposure. (3) Privacy: The confidentiality of records related to children in conflict with the law is maintained. These records are kept secure and are only accessible for purposes relating to the administration of justice, safeguarding the privacy of children. It is almost as if we needed a reminder of how essential these protections are. So, thankfully, this Bill ensures they remain intact. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides a comprehensive framework that balances accountability with compassion. It introduces several key provisions that reflect both, legal and moral ideas. (1) Age determination and criminal responsibility This Bill raises the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 years to 14 years. This change acknowledges that younger children lack the maturity to fully understand the consequences of their actions. For children between 10 years and 13 years, the prosecution must prove that the child knew the actions were wrong at the time of the offence. This ensures that only those who have the capacity to understand their actions are held accountable. (2) Diversion programmes The Bill emphasises the use of diversion programmes to handle minor offences outside the formal justice system. These programmes include community service, counselling and educational activities which are designed to address the root causes of offending behaviour and support the child’s rehabilitation. (3) Child Justice Court The establishment of specialised child justice courts ensures that cases involving children are handled by trained professionals who understand the unique needs of young offenders. These courts will operate with less formality, creating an environment that is less intimidating and more supportive for children. (4) Custodial measures as a last resort The Bill mandates that custodial measures should only be used as a last resort and for the shortest period necessary. This is in line with international standards and reflects our commitment to minimising the negative impact of detention on children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to address these specific provisions for children under the age of 13 years, who commit crimes. Under the current legal framework, children under the age of 10</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2551 years cannot be prosecuted for any offence. For those between 10 years and 13 years, prosecution is only possible if it can be proven that the child knew the actions were wrong at the time of the offence. This Bill reinforces these protections and ensures that children are treated with the understanding and care they deserve. Children under 14 years cannot be imprisoned for any offence. Instead, they are placed in approved institutions where they can receive the necessary support and rehabilitation. This approach is not only legally sound, but also morally just. It recognises that children, especially those under 13 years, are still developing their understanding of right and wrong, and should be guided, not punished harshly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Child Justice Bill 2024 is a testament of our commitment to justice, compassion and the future of our nation. It is a Bill that embodies the moral and legal principles we hold dear. By supporting this Bill, we are making a powerful statement that we believe in the potential of every child, that we are committed to their rehabilitation and reintegration, and that we will protect their rights and dignity at all costs. Let us pass this Bill with the generous support it deserves. Let us show our children that we believe in them, that we are here to support them, and that we are committed to building a just and compassionate society for all. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today, in this august House, for a matter of profound importance - the Child Justice Bill 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this legislation is not merely a set of rules, it is a commitment to the future for our children and our society. It is essential that we teach child offenders differently from adult offenders. Children are not mature adults. They lack maturity and understanding that comes with age, therefore, they cannot be held to the same standards as adults. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Frederick Douglass makes a statement that resonates with the intent of the Bill, and I quote: “It is easier build strong children than to repair broken men.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, Albert Einstein, once said, and I quote: “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.” Children are known for their imagination. Mr. Speaker, Sir, research has consistently shown that while teenagers may appear fully grown, they are still in the process of developing physically, socially, cognitively and morally. The Bill acknowledges these development stages by establishing guiding objectives and principles in Clauses 3 and 4, clearly signalling that those children in conflict with the law must be treated differently from adults. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my eight as a Judicial Officer, I have on occasions from time to time, been reminding the Police and asking, “Where are the parents of this child?” When this Bill becomes law, it will create an obligation and, of course, with necessary training, that children should be treated separately. It is the acknowledgment by the State and revision of this Bill of the importance of children, especially so, Sir, in light of the young offenders that we face in these courts.</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>2552 Child Justice Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 A few days ago, I visited a home in Nabua that houses young people. The youngest was 12 years old. There are 40 of them, who are drug addicts, delinquents, for one reason or another, and I acknowledge the Tabua Family who lives in Bougainville and who accommodates these 40 children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they share their lives, their journey from marijuana to ice, to cocaine - the thefts in Nabua, I was even told that one of them had robbed the former Commander of RFMF. So, one reason they have been accommodated in this home is because they have found love. They have found peace. I was told that some may have Police cases, but they have lost contact with them. It just goes to show how we should treat our children. Children are inherently more amenable to rehabilitation than adult offenders. International studies indicate that the likelihood of positively influencing a child’s behaviour through counselling and support message is significantly higher than for adults. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful in terms of the diversion. Madam Minister, you can count on me. There has been some discussion this year with Australia and New Zealand, and next year the ministry is going to take a tour to New Zealand. Sir, you are fully aware of how the Maori community and the regional government have treated this issue in terms of the unique problems facing the Maoris and how they deal with it. Our prisons are full of iTaukei. They start off as young offenders - juveniles and migrate to become a common criminal. The problem in our justice system is that we have not created sufficient diversion. We have left out what we have - our culture and tradition, how to change a man and how to change a woman. And it is about time, and I think with this Coalition Government, we are committed to do that. By focussing on rehabilitation rather than punishment, we can help these young individuals to avoid a life of crime but to instead, nurture them into productive law-abiding citizens. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, diversion can reduce offending rate by up to 70 percent, depending on the quality of the programme. Our Bill introduces provisions for diversity, particularly, Clause 18, regarding Police cautions, or based on successful practices already implemented by the Juvenile Bureau and international best practices. Community-fare based measures have also greater efficacy than custodial orders, and I also call on faith leaders. It is about time that they should step in. I do so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the issue of crime, I see it an issue that really focusses on the iTaukei people. Some of the disconnection that we are faced before Independence, after Independence and, of course, the development phase that we have gone through. So, it is about time that faith-based religious leaders should stand up and make and account, take real action in terms of the rehabilitation of these young offenders. The Child Justice Bill 2024 will replace the outdated sections of the Juvenile Act concerning children in conflict with the law. It outlines special treatment for children at the various stages of the criminal justice process, from the initial police contact, through to trial, rehabilitation and reintegration. The Bill defines a child as anyone under the age of 18, alive both juvenile as criminal responsible is the age of 10. The Bill is crucial because our current Act is outdated and does not reflect Fiji's advancement in the juvenile justice system. The Child Justice Bill 2024 consolidates best practices for handling children in court with the law, while ensuring compliance with international commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2553 In conclusion, Sir, let us embrace this opportunity to enact meaningful changes for our children, transforming lives through understanding, compassion and effective rehabilitation, rather than punishment. Together, we can build a brighter future for all Fijian children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse and support the Bill. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this juncture, we will suspend proceedings for dinners. Parliament will resume proceedings in one hour’s time. Thank you, honourable Members. The Parliament adjourned at 6.30 p.m.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>2554 Child Justice Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 7.35 p.m. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to contribute to the Child Justice Bill 2024 before the House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the onset, the Child Justice Bill 2024 is an essential Bill and a very important one. It is good to see that this Bill is aiming to improve the treatment of children within the criminal justice system by aligning it with international standards for the rights of children. The Bill focusses on addressing children in conflict with the law who are under the age of 18 years, in a way that prioritizes rehabilitation, education, reintegration rather than punishment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally agree that children cannot be pitched similar to an adult in a criminal justice system. They need special attention and greater effort in education, rehabilitation and re- integration. However, it does not mean, in any way, that a child between a certain age cannot be held criminally responsible for his or her actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, setting the age of criminal responsibility for a child to 14 years may seem like a step towards addressing juvenile crime and aligning it with international standards. However, it carries a number of potential disadvantages for the criminal justice system and the community at large. During some of my discussions with the community, the following concerns were raised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, people believe that it is morally wrong not to hold a person below the age 14 responsible for a crime which, in a number of cases, were committed knowingly. They strongly believe that a child who is over the age of 10 years can commit a crime should be held accountable for his or her action. Setting the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years could mean that certain children, particularly those who commit violent crimes or other serious offences, may not face the criminal justice’s consequence, even though they are capable of understanding the wrongfulness of their behaviour. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these people are quite frustrated with this. They have expressed that they are making the system too lenient on young offenders who commit violent crimes. This gravely undermines the trust in the justice system and will cause people to question the effectiveness of our justice policies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if a child who is under 14 years of age, commits a crime and he or she is not held criminally accountable and gets away with a knock in the knuckles, we will be missing opportunities for early interventions. This probably would mean, raising a hardened criminal in the later years. By delaying accountability until 14, young offenders might not receive the rehabilitation or deterrence opportunities they need at this critical development stage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if our criminal justice system delays responsibility until the child reaches 14 years of age, we will be condoning the abnormal and unacceptable behaviours of a child, and this child may never really understand the consequence of such behaviours. For children who are repeat offenders who commit serious violent crimes, setting the criminal responsibility age to 14 years may allow them to avoid appropriate consequence for their action during the time when they could still be rehabilitated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, without early intervention, these children might grow up into adolescence and later, adults, who will continue to engage in criminal activities, perpetuating a vicious cycle of</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2555 crime. This delay for these children in facing the consequence of their actions could lessen the deterrence effect of our criminal justice system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, children are very smart these days. If they are aware that they will not face the criminal consequence of their action until they reach the age of 14, they may not feel deterred from committing crime. If they know that there are no immediate legal consequence, they would be more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour, leading to higher crime rates in the long run. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as children grow, their behaviour becomes more complex. It could be harder to intervene effectively with a 14 year old, who has already been committing crime for years. Early intervention is often the most successful in shaping positive behaviours. Mr. Speaker, Sir, raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years may disproportionately affect children from marginalised communities, who are already at a higher risk of criminal behaviour due to factors like poverty, neglect or family instability. If serious offenders who are often from disadvantaged backgrounds are not held accountable at early stage, our community could see a rise in crime rates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these children who do not face the consequence of their criminal activities, might struggle to reintegrate into our society and thus, continuing a cycle of criminal behaviour that impacts the entire community. This lack of action on offenders could lead to higher crime rates in the community, as these children grow older, negatively affect the public safety and security of the community and, ultimately, having an effect in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, criminal gangs and illicit drug traders will take advantage of the setting up of the criminal responsibility age. Children below the age of 14 will be widely recruited to carry out these criminal activities, knowing very well that a child can get away without facing any dire consequences. By setting the criminal responsibility age to 14, we are openly inviting these gangs to use children in their criminal activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one does not become a criminal just like that, it probably starts at a young age - petty crimes, such as picking stuff from someone's compound, petty garden thefts, picking coconuts from trees that does not belong to you or without the permission of people. If these behaviours are not reprimanded earlier, then these small time petty thefts or activities can get a snowball effect, gradually growing into violent robberies, like the recent one in a supermarket in Nasinu. These are not the people who wake up one day and decide, “Let us go and rob a supermarket.” These are people who have gone through the mill and come to this stage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the public fears that children who commit serious crimes at a young age should face the consequence and should be rehabilitated. Setting the criminal responsibility age of 14 can lead to perception of impunity and leniency. The fear, Mr. Speaker, is that if the Committee believes that young criminals or young children are escaping the justice system because of age restriction, it could reduce public confidence in the justice system. The public and the victims of crime will view the justice system as ineffective, and particularly if it allows dangerous offenders to evade responsibility actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force is also worried about setting up the criminal responsibility age at 14. They are worried that crimes will increase, and public safety is at risk. A balanced approach is needed to ensure children are held appropriately accountable for their actions. I hope these necessary amendments will be done to the Bill to muster the public confidence in our criminal justice system, whilst safeguarding our children. With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>2556 Bill. Child Justice Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very short. I rise in support of the Child Justice Bill 2024 and the point that was raised by honourable Sachida Nand, the next Bill will cater for that which is the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024. Those under 14 years old, if they commit, they will be treated as a child in need for care. That is the second Bill that will cover for that age group and how they will be rehabilitated once they agree if they could be used, given the increase in criminal age to 14 years. Also, in response to the immediate statement by the Assistant Commissioner of Police Crime, Mr. Mesake Waqa, who also raised the same issue, that to change the age of criminality could result in increase in juvenile crimes. But if you look at Clause 13 of the Bill that is before us, which is one of the most important sections in this particular Bill, a child will be considered for diversion. One of the deciding factors there is that a few officers will be empowered to carry out the diversion - Clause 13(1)(a), in a case of summary offence. The officer in charge of the police station, in consultation with the charges officer, will be doing that diversion, or they will be empowered to do diversion. Clause 13(b) in the case of an indictable offence other than murder or attempted murder, it will be done by a prosecutor. So, for murder and attempted murder, they will not be covered in the diversion, but they will have to go through the criminal justice system. Other offences other than murder and attempted murder will be considered for diversion. In Clause 13(2), it talks about the requirements and the requirements also for the interest of justice in subclause (d), “… that the matter be resolved through diversion” in determining whether the diversion is in the interest of justice subject to that subclause (b), regard must be made to the following, the: (1) nature and seriousness of the offence; and (2) background and circumstances of the child. So, if this child is going through diversion once or twice and keeps reoffending, that will be another consideration that needs to be considered, whether this child is taking advantage of this diversion. Also, the views expressed by the victim and the need to ensure there is public safety. If this particular child under 14 or above 14 is committing and turn to endanger public safety, that will be the grounds whether to consider them for diversion or not. The Committee sought clarification from the drafters on the view expressed by honourable Sachida Nand and also the Fiji Police Force, and they have assured us that the powers that will be with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), that is in Clause13(6), “…may issue guidance on the exercise of discretion. So, the DPP will then decide on the seriousness of the offence, the nature of the offence and other things that should qualify this particular child to continue through diversion. If the child does not learn from the diversion plan and all other rehabilitation, then the DPP will then decide whether this particular child will still go through the normal criminal justice system. I just wanted to clarify that point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where diversion will be applied, or the discretion will be with the DPP to decide on whether the child will go for diversion or not. How the juvenile court will then decide the orders on what other punishment the child will have to go through, community work, plus other things that are available there to rehabilitate the child. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, fellow Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise in support of the Child Justice Bill 2024 that was moved in the Parliament by the honourable</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 2557 Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. It is after dinner, Sir, and perhaps, a little story to keep us awake in the course of tonight’s proceedings. Four to five years ago, I was sitting in a court just behind this Chambers waiting for my client’s case to be called. The juvenile list was being called, and the first three to appear would have been roughly 13 years, perhaps 14 years old. They looked messy, scrawny, punk hair style and whole size in stature. I imagined, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they did not attend school and were being charged for gang theft to a house, commonly known as aggravated burglary. The Juvenile Magistrate wanted them to be bailed, so she asked for the parents to be available in the afternoon. In this case, one of the fathers of the young boys comes and says to the Juvenile Magistrate, “I do not want to be responsible for this boy, if he commits another offence or if he does not turn up to court on his next date.” The Juvenile Magistrate had no choice but to order that the child be kept as a ward of the State. In the new Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those types of heart wrenching moments will be overcomed because the new law will provide for a presumption in favour of the release of the child. Fiji’s Juveniles Act will be 51 years old this year. There are features of the Child Justice Bill 2024 that needs to be highlighted in tonight’s deliberation. Firstly, the age of criminal responsibility as has been highlighted by the speakers before me, has now been moved up to 14 years as opposed to 10 years in the previous regime under the Crimes Act 2009. I am aware, as has been raised by the honourable Nand, that the police had had some reservations on the enlargement of the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. But by some benchmark, Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand has a criminal responsibility of 14, Australia is between 12 to 14. For the countries between that bracket, such as Australia, 12 to 14, must be proved that the child knows or understands the context of the criminality that he or she has done. In Canada, 12 years; in Africa between 10 years to 14 years; in the United States it is quite interesting, 14 is the age of criminal responsibility, but it is reduced in case of intentional homicide and other life-threatening offences to 12 years. However, an adult between the age of 18 years to 21 years, can still be sentenced as a juvenile under the juvenile justice system, if it is proved that the person is mentally immature. So, the increase in the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years is of course supported by science. Science that was not developed in 1973, when the Juveniles Act came into law. Science informs this decision-making process and confirms that children below 14 years are still in developing stage, physically and most importantly, psychologically. Afterall, the test of criminal responsibility, is understanding of the wrongness of one’s conduct, and not the physical size of the child. Understanding or knowing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you would understand, is a cognitive assessment and there is no better guide than science. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statutory diversion process is now permitted under Clause 12 and 16 of the Bill. I remember Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2006, when I was at Legal Aid Commission of Fiji, there was a Fiji Australia Justice Sector Programme that had started just to pilot a juvenile diversion programme only for summary offences without the statutory provisions that would allow it to happen freely. Magistrates in those times, were urged to use the discretion they had in sentencing, to manoeuvre their way in between sentencing harshly, as the law required of them and diversion, as humanity would demand, especially Mr. Speaker, Sir, for youth offenders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Juvenile Act, protection of juvenile was also provided. But in the advent of more definition of human rights, science upgrade of police procedure in criminal</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>2558 Child Justice Bill 2024 5 th December, 2024 interrogations, a more defined criminal justice is needed. Now, police conduct in managing child offending is going to be statutorily imposed. Section 25 provides the guardrails and prescriptions on how police should conduct themselves in investigations. Any form of physical force can only be minimally used as necessary and must be documented by a Child Justice Officer. So, we can expect the proceedings would be more informative in the Child Justice Court. The new law would ensure that the timeline of the child encountering the police for the first time and production at Child Justice Court is documented, known, accounted for, and presented in evidence if needed. It prioritises the interests of the child Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is the focus of the new Bill. How do we address child justice? Provide diversion, remove stigma and still be able to create a pathway for a child offender to become somebody better in his or her own life later. The Child Justice Bill will open the opportunity, create intervention and provide the standpost where they can get to know, that their makeup, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has many good thoughts about them. Thoughts, that if they were to be counted, are more than the sense of the sea. It removes the stigma of conviction and sentence from the life of a child. By removing that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world becomes a yolk of opportunity for the child, albeit with a small interaction with the law. I have sat in too many courtrooms, both early in the days as a prosecutor and later as a private practice to see young lives being wasted. Some of their first altercation with the law, handled by adults as and with a system that treats them as adults by default, creates recidivist who go in and out of prison their entire life. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if their first appearance, they would have been diverted, rehabilitated, followed up and strongly urged to reform. Their lives would have been markedly different from the recidivists they are today. We have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to do right to our future generation, even if they fought. The Child Justice Bill will ensure that the rights are fully observed. Their treatment is that of a child. The environment is calm and homely, and every opportunity to create a better life is provided. The parent is involved under Clause 21. The role of the Child Justice Officer is well defined and must be respected by police at all costs. Manner of police interview is now going to be regulated by Clause 24, and the police will be required to develop officers within their ranks in special training in handling child justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution to the Child Justice Bill 2024, and I would urge all honourable Members of Parliament to support the motion that is brought in by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. Thank you very much. MR. SPEAKER.- I think all the honourable members have contributed to the debate on this Bill. I now call on the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection to speak in reply. HON. L. D. TABUYA-Mr. Speaker. Sir, and honourable Members, the passage of this Bill will not be a standalone victory if it happens tonight. It is really going to be part of a broader commitment to try something new, something that is evidence-based and, yes, there may be differing opinions, but they are just that - opinions. They are myths that need to be dispelled and that is where I seek the assistance of us, as Members of Parliament and as representatives of the people, to dispel those myths. When you meet with your communities and explain to them, I think they will understand. When we work together with the Child Care Protection Bill 2024, which will come up next, we really are laying a foundation for a future where each child gets another chance. Talking about</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 2559 second chances, third chances, this is it. It needs to begin from childhood, not when they are older or when they become adults. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to sincerely thank the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, especially in sitting beyond normal hours, and their hard work to bring the Bills in this sitting before the end of this Parliament session. I thank them very much. I also wish to thank our development partners, especially UNICEF, for working with the Ministry to bring these Bills. These Bills have been 12 years in the making, and we have had contributions, and I acknowledge the contributions and hard work of my predecessors, the former Ministers for Women. I thank the leadership and the FijiFirst Government for initiating this, and we have continued this work and here it is today. So, this is something for all of us to celebrate and all of us to be proud of. It is historic. It has been a week of history created here, and I think our children will remember us when they become adults, that we have made this change. I, therefore, seek the support of Parliament to vote in favour of this Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Child Justice Bill 2024 (Bill No. 4/2024) passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. 18 of 2024)]</p></body>
