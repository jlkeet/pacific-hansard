SPEAKER.- The following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements</h4><p>under Standing Order 40: (1) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics; and</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>2490</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 (2) Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts. Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes. After the Minister, I will then invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate, to also speak for five minutes. There will be no other debate. Fiji’s Economic Performance and Outlook HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on Fiji’s economic performance and outlook and Government’s fiscal position. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian economy has shown great resilience, despite the global uncertainties caused by factors such as: (1) (2) (3) (4) slowing global growth; global inflationary pressures; supply chain disruptions; and escalating geo-political tensions and geo-economic fragmentation. Despite these ongoing challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to state that our economic fundamentals have strengthened over the years, especially over the last two years. The economy is on a much stronger footing now that what we had inherited to years ago. Mr. Speaker, Sir, following a growth of 7.5 percent in 2023, the Fiji economy is now focussed to grow by 3.8 percent in 2024 higher than the 2.8 percent growth projected earlier on in June this year. There were some very strong reasons for these upward revisions by the Macroeconomic Committee, an independent committee chaired by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and includes other senior public officials from key agencies. Firstly, the tourism industry which has been the key driver of Fiji’s post-pandemic recovery, has positively surprised us and honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka has constantly talked about this. In the first 10 months – January to October 2024 – visitor arrivals rose by 6.5 percent when compared to the same period last year. The strong growth in arrivals, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is largely driven by higher arrivals from our major tourism source markets including Australia, where the growth of 4.9 percent, New Zealand 3.8 percent, US 8.6 percent. These three countries account for 80 percent of our visitors and despite some of the economic challenges in this country, we have not seen any slowdown in numbers. On the contrary, we have seen stronger growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to highlight that we have recorded new peaks for visitor arrivals in all the months this year and we are going to hit a new record again this year, just slightly below a million tourists. Sir, in light of this strong performance in tourism arrivals to date, the forecast for visitor arrivals for this year has been revised up to 6 percent from earlier projection of 3 percent in 2024. In 2025, we are projecting visitor arrivals to grow by 4 percent, as we expect continuous growth in tourism demand from traditional source markets, coupled with the introduction of the Nadi- Dallas flights from next week which is expected to bring an additional 1,000 visitors on a weekly basis to our shores. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the strong linkages of the tourism industry with the rest of the economy, related sectors such as transport and storage accommodation, wholesale and retail are also driving higher growth this year. While positive contributions are also expected, finance and insurance, public administration, information, agriculture, manufacturing, real estate, mining and</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2491 quarrying and net taxes are also contributing to the overall goal. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to highlight that following the strong public and political support and the business communities support for the recent budget which had sent a very strong message on the stability, consistency, and the transparency and accountability of our economical social policies. This, together with the inclusive style of governance and bipartisanship we have shown Parliament. I want to thank the G9-Bloc for their bipartisan, I am not too sure about the other group, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has helped a lot with improving investor and overall confidence. Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in public sector salaries in the recent budget, increase in the national minimum wages from $4 to $4.50 and from $5 from 1 st April. The strategic decision to have increase in Government spending in key areas. The high remittance flows to reach $1.3 billion this year. The tourism induced picked up and demand and growth in commercial bank lending has helped consumption spending which has supported business and economic activity. All partial indicators for consumption spending, including VAT collections, consumption lending through the financial institutions and income indicators like PAYE collection, FNPF contribution growth are showing stronger spending activity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of investment activity, that current indicators suggest a positive outlook for this year. We have recorded a significant increase in business confidence and investment activity, driven by the commencement of large tourism related projects in the West and also in the North. Other major commercial projects across the country, and the implementation of some of government capital projects. A key indicator of construction activity, domestic cement sales have risen by 11.2 percent up to September 2024. Furthermore, new lending by commercial banks for investment purposes grew by 25 percent in the year leading to September 2024, primarily due to an increase in lending for building and construction sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the recent groundbreaking of some large project such as google and the announcement on the replacement of four critical bridges worth over $300 million, the outlook for investment is very optimistic. Similarly, Sir, investment activity also continues to progress. Investor confidence is currently high, as evident by the new investments and construction happening around the country. I take this opportunity to thank our business and investor community for their very positive engagement attitude and helping Government in building confidence. For 2025, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the growth momentum is expected to continue and as such the growth forecast has now been upgraded to 3.4 percent from an earlier projection of 3 percent. Again, the services sector will be a key driver of growth on the back of strong tourism activity followed by industrial and primary sectors. In 2026 and 2027, based on the information at hand, we are projecting a baseline growth of 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent. While we may be reverting to the long-term average growth rate of around 3 percent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a higher growth rate can be achieved easily if we continue improving the business environment for private sector investment, maintain the momentum of economic reforms, ensure the stability of our economic policies, the transparency of our economic policies and provide confidence through well-crafted coordinated macro-economic policies. Inflation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while our economy is showing strong sustainable growth, we must acknowledge the challenges posed by rising global inflation. We have seen an increase in the cost of goods, particularly fuel, food and transportation. The Government is acutely aware of the burden this</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>2492</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 places on Fijian households, and we are taking necessary measures to alleviate the cost of living. In the 2024-2025 Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had announced numerous income enhancing measures such as: • • • • • • • • • increase in minimum wages and civil service salaries; we are continuing with higher social welfare payments; restored pensions for FNPF pensioners that were affected by earlier reforms; providing targeted subsidies for electricity and water; provided Back to School support for the 2025 school year; fully absorbing the new higher bus fares for students receiving transport assistance; providing the highest ever sugarcane price of $105 per tonne; writing off $650 million in TELS debt for over 53,000 families, amongst other things that we have talked about often; and apart from these; maintained the zero-rated VAT on 22 items in the Budget. All these is over a billion dollars in support for our vulnerable and disadvantaged. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to report that the annual headline inflation year-on-year rate has fallen from the fourth consecutive month to 0.8 percent in November 2024. This inflation outcome in November is significantly lower when compared to 5.8 percent in November last year and is also lower than 3.6 percent recorded in October this year. November 2024 inflation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the lowest in 16 months and is driven by lower prices noted in food and non-alcoholic beverages, transport, housing, electricity, water, gas and other fuels and clothing and footwear, and year-end inflation for this year is expected to be much lower Mr. Speaker, Sir, than our earlier projection of 3.5 percent, and is expected to remain stable in the medium term. On balance of payments Mr. Speaker, Sir, maintaining external stability is critical particularly, in a global economic environment characterised by volatility. The recent years we have seen fluctuations in global commodity prices, shift in trade patterns and changes in investor sentiments. These factors Mr. Speaker, Sir, have had direct implications on our balance of payments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that through prudent macro-economic management policies we have made significant progress in addressing these challenges. Our efforts to diversify exports, attract investment and improve the competitiveness of our industries have begun to bear fruits and I must thank all my ministerial colleagues. MR. SPEAKER.- There is some difficulty with the sound system again. Is it now better? Thank you, you may proceed. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that our ministerial colleagues in different ministries are all working together as part of our National Development Plan (NDP) strategy and all the sectors are bearing fruits. We have seen an improvement in our trade balance with export growth driven by key sectors such as agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Additionally, it happens to boost tourism, and remittances have contributed positively to our current account position. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current account deficit is forecast fall to 4 percent to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2024. From 7.7 percent in 2023 and is expected to remain below 5 percent in the medium term. Moreover, the Government’s commitment to enhancing the external reserves has strengthened our position in managing external shocks and ensuring that we have the necessary resources to meet our</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2493 international obligations. By focusing on fiscal discipline, foreign exchange management and strengthening bilateral and multi-lateral partnerships, we are building a more resilient economy capable of withstanding external pressures. Foreign reserves, our monetary policies and financial sector Mr. Speaker, Sir – again I am pleased to report that foreign reserves are comfortable at around $3.8billion at the end of November 2024, equivalent to 6.2 months of retained imports, and are projected to remain adequate over the medium term. The financial sector remains sound and continues to support domestic activity. Private sector credit growth has picked up to 11.2 percent in October 2024, driven by lending to both business entities and households. Banking system liquidity remained high at around $2.3 billion. Modest (I will not say too high) which is also helping keep interest rate at a near historical low and supporting investment growth, compared to interest rate in other countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our fiscal strategy remains focussed on maintaining prudent fiscal management, while addressing key development needs. Despite the challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, we have kept our fiscal deficit under control, with the target to reduce the deficit progressively over the next few years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now discuss about this state of Government finances and fiscal performance for the 1 st Quarter of 2024-2025, the fiscal deficit for 2023-2024 narrowed significantly to 3.4 percent of GDP compared to 7.2 percent recorded in the 2022-2023 financial year. Government’s total revenue in 2023-2024 stood at $3,646.2 million ($3.6 billion), 28.1 percent of GDP, while total expenditure was 31.5 percent of GDP. This strong performance in revenue is underpinned by a stronger economy, as well as the combination of well-crafted revenue reforms and expenditure policy that significantly improve the paths of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal trend in the first four months of this fiscal year have been promising, as we continue to surpass taxation targets, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first three months of this financial year, August to October, Government’s total revenue collection stood at $1,087.5 million, while total expenditure amounted to $956.3 million. This resulted in a net surplus of $131.2 million equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP. This marks a notable improvement compared to the same period last year when a net deficit of $21.5 million GDP was recorded. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a month-to-month basis, tax revenue collections have consistently exceeded the forecast, reaching a total of $885.2 million in the first three months. This positive out- turn above by $88.4 million or 11.1 percent was primarily driven by stronger collection in all types of taxes including corporate taxes, PAYE (Pay-As-Your-Earn) and withholding taxes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our non-tax revenue was also higher than projected. So, in terms of our overall revenue collections for the first three months, it increased by almost $200 million, $196.1 million or 22 percent compared to the same period last year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total expenditure has also been promising. The first three months amounting to $956.3 million representing 21 percent of total budgeted spending level in the financial year. This comprises $734.9 million in operating expenditure, and $211.6 million in capital expenditure, with a good expenditure mix of 78:22, compared to the same period last year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the public debt while a concern from any countries globally, remains sustainable and we are taking a measured approach to manage it. Government debt stood at $10.3 billion equivalent to 79.4 percent of GDP at the end of July 2024. Debt is projected to be around 77.8</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>2494</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 percent of GDP at the end of this financial year. This is a marked decline from the high of 90.7 percent of GDP in 2021-2022. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of October 2024, Government’s total debt stood equivalent to 75.4 percent of GPD, the debt mix comprise 63.7 percent in domestic debt and 36.3 percent in external debt during the review period. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by saying that as you heard, all the macroeconomic indicators; whether we talked about debt management, whether we talk about our revenue management, whether we talk about our investment policies, the mix of the policies that we put in place in the 2023-2024 Budget and in the 2024-2025 Budget is actually working and showing significant signs of the fact that we have set the economy on a right trajectory. So, in summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would say that: (1) our economy is doing much better than earlier anticipated; (2) (3) consumption and investment spending have both picked up; tourism industry is on track for a record year; and we expect similar trends in 2025 and 2026; inflation has eased to 0.8 percent in November 2024; foreign reserves stood at about $3.8 billion; interest rates remain low; (4) (5) (6) (7) Government revenue collections have surpassed projection for last financial year and for the last four consecutive months; and (8) debt levels have been reduced to below 80 percent now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, risk to growth is balanced, while natural disasters, global conflict, geopolitics, and slowdown in trading partners pose downside risks. There are upsides with tourism, with the Dallas flight and other new routes. Picked up in investments as confidence levels continue to improve and the easing of the labour market as outward migration and resident departures have also slowed down. So, all these put together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is good news for the economy. Good news for the country, and as I said earlier, we want to make sure that the result of this good news also flows to the ordinary people. And as I said we are spending almost a billion dollars in targeted expenditures whether it is for agriculture, social welfare, education, health and it put us in a very strong position to now start preparing for the next budget 2025-2026, and there will be more good news in the next budget. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his response. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Statement delivered by the honourable Minister for Finance is promising and it paints a picture that Fiji is doing well. Mr. Speaker, if the economy is doing well, why are our people not feeling it? The Government proudly announces the growth figures, increased revenues and growing economic projections. They celebrate numbers, but numbers do not put food on the table. Numbers don’t pay rent. Numbers don’t ease the daily struggles of ordinary Fijians. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash!</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2495 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Let me ask this. How many Fijians have felt relief at the supermarket, or when paying utility bills? How many Fijians have seen their hard work translating into a better life for their families with increases in duties, taxes and VAT? For many Fijians the answer is clear. Life has not improved. Instead, the cost of living has skyrocketed. Essential goods and services are becoming luxuries; even butter has become a luxury now.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> This Government has not spared bread and butter, daily staples. Despite the election promise to reduce the cost of living. And I recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Minister Prasad during his campaign, he promised the people of this country; we will reduce the price of beer, butter and chops. Did that happen? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bread price has increased from 71 cents to $1, and 500 grams butter has increased to almost $14, which is the price of a chicken. HON. J. USAMATE.- Wow! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, even he did not spare 60-year-old citizens of this country. When citizens reach 60 years of age, he’s taken away the bus fare from them. HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- And the Bainimarama Government had put that bus fare. Those who are turning 60 they cannot get free bus fares. Mr. Speaker, Sir, families are forced to make impossible choices between medicine and groceries, between rent and electricity bills, yet the Government is telling Fijians the economy is strong and is doing well. If that is true, where is the impact? Who is benefitting? Because it certainly is not the hardworking farmers struggling with rising input cost. It is not the nurses and teachers leaving for better opportunities abroad. It is not the small business owners who can barely keep their doors open. The truth is that this Government’s economic policies are designed to serve a select few. We have seen tax-free holidays given to Fiji Water, pay rise for lawyers and others earning about more than $250,000. All in the name of realignment. They talk about economic growth, but growth for whom? The privilege few, the multinationals, the well-connected elites? Meanwhile, the majority of our people are left our struggling on the margins. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a government that prioritises statistics over citizen has lost its way. Our people deserve policies that lift everyone, not just those at the top. We must invest in our people, lower VAT on essential items to ease the burdens on struggling families, support small businesses that are the backbone of our economy, address the exodus of skilled workers with real opportunities here at home, prioritise capital works that create jobs and improve infrastructure. Those are not abstract ideas; they are steps we can take now to make life better for everyone. So, today I challenge this Government, if you claim the economy is doing well, let the people feel it in their pockets, in their homes, in their communities. Let the benefits of growth reach every corner of our nation, not just the boardrooms of Fiji Water and a selected few.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2496</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, a true measure of success is not found in the graphs and charts and numbers. It is found in the lives of our people, their well-being, their opportunities and their dignity. Lots of promises were made, but people know what this Government is trying to do. They are trying to squeeze every cent out of them, either through increase in taxes, VAT and everything else. People are struggling and poverty is increasing. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the Leader of G-9 Bloc or his designate for his response. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the G-9 Bloc would like to thank honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the update on our economy and the positive outlook it projects, and wishes the Ministry and the Government well. Thank you. Update on the Great Council of Chiefs Meeting HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament; first of all, I congratulate you for holding the post of the Speaker of this august House and I wish you all the best in your term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to provide a Ministerial Statement on the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) Meeting that was convened from 13 th to 14 th November at the Grand Pacific Hotel. Please, allow me just to address a few of the issues that were raised on Tuesday afternoon regarding the non-renewal of land leases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture is a very important sector for Fiji. In terms of renewal for land leases. The land lease renewal is hovering around 85 percent to 87 percent, which is quite a good standard for a country like Fiji. For agriculture, it is allocated roughly about 50,000 hectares of land, and currently only about 50 percent has been utilised. By law, before any lease expires, five years prior to the expired of the lease the iTLTB staff should be visiting the farmers to conduct consultations before their lease expires. We have received the request from the farmers that the five years is too short to prepare them if their lease is not going to be renewed, so they need a 10-year consultation period. So that has been facilitated by the iTLTB at the moment. Few of the issues that have been the main causes of non-renewal of lease are as follows: (1) Breach of the lease contract. In some instances, farmers only utilise a small portion of the land that they lease. The advice from iTLTB is always to utilise the portion that they use, and they surrender the part that they are not using, so that is always one of the main areas of concern to the farmers. That is also the main reason why most of the leases are delayed in its renewal to make sure that the land is utilised properly. (2) When lease arrears are there, lease cannot be renewed if there are arrears on the current lease. So, that is another area which is always a concern. (3) When the numbers of the members of the mataqali or yavusa increase and they need some land for their food security and also for their development. (4) Always when the landowners have seen the yield level of what they can get from the land, for example, if they are planting a certain crop and that area is becoming a well-developed</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2497 area and subdivisions are coming up, they will request iTLTB if that land can be returned to them so that they can rezone it so that they can get better benefits from their land. The current Government is fully supportive of the agriculture sector. Last year, Government provided a grant of $1.2 million to about 218 farmers to renew their leases. The iTLTB is trying its utmost best to do its consultation properly to help the farmers and also to help the landowners in whatever discussions or whatever needs that they require. I thank most of the honourable Members who are here who raised the issues. My advice is if you can visit the nearest iTLTB office and take the details of the leases that has been a concern to the farmers so that they can address these. If that is not addressed there, the CEO is there who you can approach, or else you can raise it with me, and we can try and find the solutions on how to resolve the issues that have been raised by the farmers. The iTLTB will always try its best to take care of the issues that will be raised by the farmers and also the issues that will be raised by the landowners. Our main area of concern now is when people visit the farmers and taking their concerns or complaints just from one side. Please get the information from both sides, which we can easily resolve the issues regarding the renewal of leases. Mr. Speaker, the meeting for the GCC was attended by His Excellency the President of Fiji, Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, the Turaga na Tui Cakau and the chiefs from the 14 provinces including Rotuma. The chiefs discussed significant issues concerning the good governance and well-being of the iTaukei and pass resolutions to that effect. On the first day, members of the GCC were presented with the outcomes of the review of the iTaukei Administrations and the establishment of the Provincial Economic Units. The meeting also heard an update on the review of iTaukei Land and Fisheries Commission (iTLFC). Mr. Speaker, the review of the iTaukei Administration was undertaken by a six-member team from April to July. They travelled all over Fiji and submitted 10 recommendations to strengthen the iTaukei Administration. This includes the iTaukei Affairs Board, provincial, tikina and village councils. The chiefs noted that the last review was done in 2002 by Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC). Two successive reviews tried to improve the work done by the PWC and the work was eventually suspended following the events of 2006. When the new Government came into office in 2022, it prioritised matters concerning the iTaukei, including the review of the legislation affecting them. They were categorised as follows: (1) structural issues; (2) legislations; (3) social issues; and (4) economic issues. The issues were brought before the GCC meeting in Bau last year, and the chiefs agreed that the review of the iTaukei Administration be undertaken to assist in addressing these issues. After the adoption of the GCC Review Report last year, attention turned to the iTaukei Administration. Mr. Speaker, the chiefs also heard a presentation from the consultant on the feasibility study of establishing provincial economic units. One of the issues affecting the iTaukei is the need for economic empowerment. The GCC meeting in Bau decided that it will take on economic empowerment to address poverty issues. We have the resources, but we lack the means to convert these resources into monetary value.</p><h4>The chiefs heard presentations from the two review teams on the iTaukei Administration and</h4><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2498</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 on the feasibility study to establish provincial economic units. After the presentation, the chiefs separated into their confederacies to discuss this report. The presentations after their confederacy meeting, supported the review report and their recommendation. On the second day, the Ministry made a presentation on the village profiling survey for the chiefs to see the status of each province, tikina, and village regarding sanitation, education, business types, health issue to name a few. The chiefs realised that evidence-based policy making was crucial for effective intervention. As a result of the presentation and with the chiefs’ endorsement, we will seek Government’s approval for the creation of a data hub to capture all iTaukei data, drawing first from iTaukei institutions, before moving to other Ministries. The GCC also benefits from an update of the review team of the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission (TLFC). The TLFC is currently undertaking a review, and this is expected to be completed this month. Mr. Speaker, Sir, violence against women and children is an escalating concern. The Chiefs expressed their dismay, when the National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls (NAP) was discussed. Statistics for Fiji in comparison to the rest of the world does not paint a good a picture, and to do not lie particularly in traditional settings. This is why the chairpersons of the provincial councils are our change agents. The chiefs resolved that our efforts in resourcing awareness and intervention must be doubled if we are to be successful in our fight. Mr. Speaker, Sir, economic empowerment must be prioritised. We must clear bottlenecks that hinder growth, and we must create pathways that will generate business opportunities. The poverty statistics is a stark reminder on the conditions in our villages. But we must turn these into opportunities. This is why the GCC supported a paper to revitalise the cocoa industry. Cocoa used to be a thriving industry in the 1980s. We will be discussing this further with the Ministry of Agriculture to see how the GCC paper is aligned to their current programmes. The GCC is encouraging every small window of opportunity to be exploited by the iTaukei as they contribute towards the fight against poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC also discussed the International Decade of Indigenous Languages (IDIL). It gave them the opportunity to address the declining use of iTaukei and Rotuma languages, and how these can be revitalised. Language is the means of expressing our culture which is rich in its various forms. The use of our language has been declining for some time and is more noticeable today amongst our young people. The village profiling survey that I had touched on earlier also points to this truth and the GCC had supported this International Decade of Indigenous Languages. Mr. Speaker, the GCC also heard from our Rotuman chiefs. It was refreshing to hear their voice and the major issues they face. One of the issues they have highlighted was the Rotuma Bill; their concerns will be raised through the appropriate channel from the GCC secretariat. Other issues raised was regarding development and challenges faced by our Rotuman communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC is mindful of the responsibility they must take on going forward. They must contribute to building a better Fiji. They must be inclusive, and they must be chiefs for everyone. Uniting people from the various cultures was a founding legacy of our leaders. Somehow, this got lost along the way, and the result is that we have a nation that is rebuilding. The GCC must find its place amongst this changing world and weave a thread that will join our community together. Mr. Speaker, we have completed setting up the GCC Secretariat and the Chairman of the GCC has been appointed and he is leading the work, guided by the thematic areas of good</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>5 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2499 governance, good leadership, economic empowerment, culture, tradition and heritage, resource ownership, education, health and wellbeing, environment and climate change, gender and violence against women and children. In 2025, the GCC Secretariat will visit all the provinces as it drives the message on social cohesion, reconciliation and unity. A big change in mindset is required, if we are to achieve some success and we will ensure that that is done. Vinaka vakalevu, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, basically in brief, it just displays the jealousy, because of our communal living. If one starts to rise as an iTaukei, then the underline current of the communal living undercuts them from the bottom of the line. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the leader of the Group 9 bloc or his designate for his response. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his update on the GCC. In doing so, I wish to revisit the review report of the GCC that was done in 2023. There were eight recommendations, and two I really wanted to highlight this morning, because they emphasise the importance of how we progress, the momentum of our progress like we are progressing forward or back. (1) Recommendation 4 - GCC being proactive in advocating, directing and oversight of iTaukei interests and aspirations. (2) Recommendation 5 – GCC maintains and strengthens its advisory function in nation - building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC establishment plays a pivotal role at this time. We have seen the Coalition Government that has now produced many prime guidance documents for Fiji, ranging from NDP, our Foreign Policy White Paper, the review of our security, and a list of other prime documents that are very important to be understood in the context of those two recommendations. I am happy to see the indications are positive and good, and under the leadership of the chair, Ratu Viliame Seruvakula, and his secretariat, I think is moving in that particular direction to achieve the intended state of the GCC. Nation building is very important. To influence, lead and be example in nation abuilding. Secondly, it is about reconciliation. The GCC is in a very good position to bring about unity. It has a unifying effect on our nation. At this time, it plays the pivotal role to bring about reconciliation, togetherness and a sense of belonging to the other races that can generate that energy of power to catapult Fiji forward for a better future. In my simple view and understanding of how the GCC works; I have always called for relevancy of this great body, its transparency and its accountability.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2502</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>5 th December, 2024 We talk of the great plans to propel the organisation forward and that it serves the best interest of the iTaukei. However, I just wanted to say a very simple thing this morning Mr. Speaker, Sir. I’m looking forward to the productivity of this organisation. How can we measure our productivity in the areas of agriculture, education, of health, and law and order. I recalled when I was a Commissioner of Corrections, I used to challenge the other provincial leaders to say who is the least represented here? I always remember Tailevu used to top the least, followed by Lomaiviti and so forth. But my point here Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the ability to measure our productivity and our progress. It’s very important. And you talk about economic empowerment, I look forward to innovation ideas. I am challenging my colleagues from my Province of Naitasiri; when do we see an economic hub up in the corridors of Naitasiri? When do we see a central market down in the plains of Sawani, down there, which we did during the period of COVID? If it worked during COVID, why can’t we do it now? I look forward to the day Mr. Speaker, that we will see a Naitasiri restaurant in the central Suva and a Cakaudrove restaurant perhaps in the West, where we can see the various delicacies of our various parts. Thank you, Sir.</p></body>
