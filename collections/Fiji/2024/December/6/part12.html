<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Restoration Payment – FNPF Pensioners (Question No. 305/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the restoration payment from FNPF to pensioners as announced in the 2024–2025 National Budget?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Naupoto for his question.</p><p>Very quickly in 2011, as we all know, the military regime unilaterally reduced the pension rates for</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>2586</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 FNPF pensioners, in a way broke the trust between the Fund and the pensioners. To deny justice, the government at that time also enacted a law to restrict these pensioners from challenging this unfair treatment in the court of law. That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is history. When we came into Government, we responded for a quick temporary solution by allowing affected pensioners to access Government social pension of $125 if they were above the age of 70 or $115 if they were between 60 years to 69 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Members would recall that in the recent budget, we brought some kind of permanent closure to this gross injustice. All pensioners who reluctantly opted for reduced pensions rate or had their pension payments restored to same levels to the new rate which was decided in 2011. However, effective from 1 st August 2024 and moving forward, we have restored the full pension that they were receiving at that point in time and for this, we did not go to FNPF because the FNPF is still looking at the whole issue. We provided a funding of $4 million in the Budget for the reinstatement which is estimated to be around $57 million over the next two decades based on the actuarial estimates and analysis, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has been done. To facilitate the process, the Ministry of Finance had entered into an arrangement with FNPF to facilitate the top up payment to the affected pensioners and so far from 1 st August, 2024, Government has disbursed around $1.3 million to 1,300 pensioners from August to November, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the payments are made according to the pension payment cycle on the 14 th and 28 th of each month. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you did mention that the Military regime unilaterally made this decision way back in 2011. But I want to tell you honourable Deputy Prime Minister that, that decision was based on a presentation that was made by the board and the management for the long-term sustainability of the Funds. So, my question, and I want you again to confirm this decision that you have taken, was it as a result of a presentation again, a request from the board or the management, or is it just a unilateral decision taken by the Government? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the honourable Leader of the Opposition was listening to me carefully, I said very clearly that what happened in 2011 was a unilateral decision by the Government; whether it was based on actuarial advise or whether it was about sustainability, the fact that it was made by a Government without consultation with the pensioners, it was a unilateral decision so that stays there. What I have said very clearly is that the Government recognised the pain of these pensioners and as soon as we came in, we voluntarily (in a temporary solution) we provided the social pension. In the last Budget, we tried to restore the pension from 1 st August, and we have taken the responsibility as a Government to provide funding. I said very clearly that we have $4 million in the Budget for this year and so far, $1.3 million has been dispatched, so that was very clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The issue about sustainability actuarial decision, that is another matter; that the FNPF Board in consultation with the Government if they are going to relook at that. That is another matter. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- The honourable Minister is known for goosestepping, he has just one. My question is from a pensioner who withdrew partially. Partial withdrawal was made for their pension in 2011 during the reform period because they felt maybe they will not get any money et cetera. They wanted to take this matter to court, so my question to the honourable Minister is, in free Fiji when will the Government repeal the 2011 FNPF Transition Act to allow pensioners to take their grievance to the court?</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2587 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What is very clear Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the confusion that the honourable Leader of the Opposition and his member sitting on the other side. One is saying, when are you going to bring a legislation in Parliament to revoke that? The honourable Leader of the Opposition is talking about the justification for that and the sustainability, and they accuse us, so they are confused! She is confused! (Honourable Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I want them to answer this, is she agreeing with the honourable Leader of the Opposition that his point of view is that, they did the right thing? MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, I take your Point of Order, honourable Minister. Can you go on right away?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am answering the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I am just clarifying, will you continue honourable Minister? But answer directly the question that is posed to you. Thank you. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I am answering the question directly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said earlier, this decision that the Government has made to include $4 million in the budget is to restore the pension of those who chose to go on a lower pension that was decided in 2011. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- All the other matters that honourable Kumar is raising, whether we repeal the law that was there in 2011, that is the matter for the Government. As a government, we will make the decision in consultation with FNPF, if it is appropriate. Right now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done as a government is a compassionate thing, we have done justice to all those pensioners and that is where the matter rests at the moment. The honourable Member can ask for an opinion or whatever which is irrelevant. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I consider the question as answered. Honourable Maharaj, were you going to ask the last question on this? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this reform, there was also suggestions that a member could actually get pension, is $100. Now we have actually moved 12 years ahead, even the minimum wage rate... (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> I am coming to the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, please, pose your question now.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>2588</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- The Minimum Wage rate has actually increased by this Government to around $5.50. Has Government plans to increase the $100 pension to, at least, 50 percent, considering that the new Minimum Wage rate with $5 comes to $250? Even the Social Welfare pensioners are receiving $115 to $125. So, this segment of members who have been receiving $100 for the past, at least, 10 to 12 years have been missed out. Is there any consideration to increase their pension to bring it up to par with what the Social Welfare pensioners are getting, Mr. Speaker, Sir? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, the mess that we inherited in terms of how this pension rates were changed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have in the last two budgets, carefully considered, we increase social welfare allowances in the 2023-2024 Budget. We have provided this additional support to FNPF pensioners and going forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Government, we would be reviewing in consultation with the Ministry of Social Protection, how and where we need to increase amounts and I think that is a legitimate question and that is something that the Government will constantly look at. 2024 China International Import Expo (Question No. 306/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on Fiji’s participation at the 2024 China International Import Expo? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the China International Import Expo (CIIE) is actually one of the premier events in China, in terms of the global calendar. I actually attended last year, however, this year the exhibition was attended by the Permanent Secretary for Trade and his team and it took place from 5 th November, 2024 to 10 th November, 2024. Just to give a sense of the size of this event, Mr. Speaker, about 152 countries attended from across the globe, plus regional organisations. The exhibition spaces is around 420,000 square metres and it does actually provide an opportunity for Fiji, we normally have a booth that profiles our trade and investment in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the booth actually was endeavoured to highlight some of our key exports, mineral water, noni, beverages, turmeric, kava products alongside tourism, agribusiness and manufacturing. This year’s expo, of course, reinforced our broader strategy or the strategy of the People’s Coalition Government to boost exports and investment and solidify Fiji’s position as the hub for trade and transportation in the Pacific. With China has one of Fiji’s key trading partners, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our engagement at CIIE is very important in fostering connections of course, and creating new opportunities. Just very briefly, Mr. Speaker, before I sit down some of the discussions that were held while the team was there included a discussion with Modern Star Silk. It is a company that manufactures silk production and there is some discussion around silk production in Fiji and they will be visiting our shores soon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, CHINT Group Co. Ltd, a smart energy company that focuses on energy</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2589 and digital infrastructure is a mega multinational in China and are keen to see whether they can participate in our green transition. Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in keeping with the Aquaculture Bill that was passed into law yesterday, part of the visit also was to continue discussions with the Chinese Government on fisheries and aquaculture. So, the team actually visited the South China Agricultural University Fisheries Research Institute in Nansha, Guangzhou, exploring opportunities for collaboration in aquaculture and sustainable fisheries. Potential projects, such as crab and prawn farming, which would obviously support the rural community, food security and economic diversification was explored, and of course we have invited the institute to visit Fiji, and hope that either of the major universities, whether it is FNU or USP may be able to collaborate with the South China Agricultural University. Mr, Speaker, Sir, we are looking forward to a delegation from China in the next few weeks. There are also some cultural tourism projects being discussed during the visit and again the emergence of cultural tourism is starting to gain momentum, and our delegation from Shanghai is most likely to visit Fiji next year to look at exploring opportunities in that particular area, and I am sure it will be a welcome development from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you can see the China International Import Expo (CIIE) event is normally quite an important event for the country. It was funded by the Chinese Government. So, our visitation was quite targeted and there are some very good opportunities that have emerged, and we shall be following them through in the next few months. HON. LT. COL. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, China is a key development partner and a friend. We import a lot from China, but we are interested in how we can also increase our export levels to China. Way back in 2013, we had some discussions, we sent our dalo to China and we have talked about aquaculture and fisheries products. There is a problem in China, where now products land, particularly agriculture and fisheries products, there is a 16 percent tariff on our products because of our World Trade Organisation (WTO) standing as a middle income country. What has progressed in terms of getting our products into China, that negotiations started way back in 2013. HON. M. S. N KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, it is a continuing discussion at the moment with China in terms of the trade arrangements. We are talking about a Free Trade Agreement, which has some implications on our economy. So, we are sort of handling it strategically. Certainly, if the Government does something it will be done on Fiji’s terms so that we do not jeopardise our industries in Fiji. There are some discussions in trade and we will continue them next year, but certainly a Free Trade Agreement as we all know, will decimate our industry in Fiji, so we have to be very careful in terms of that negotiation. There are other ways to sort out tariff barriers or tariff reductions, and that too is in discussion. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I agree with you, this is one of the most premier destinations in terms of export. Just a quick question on the private sector participation. The question is twofold. Was there a delegation including the private sector from Fiji or did they go out privately? If so, do we have a dollar value to some of the deals that were done with respect to other exports out or imports in? HON. M. S. N KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pretty sure there were some private</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2590</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 sector participants in the expo because of the exhibitions that happened there. I will check for sure, but I cannot remember at this stage. But certainly, some of these discussions are at the very early stages, so it would probably be premature to estimate a figure. Interestingly last year, when I went to the expo, we ended up signing two MOUs that were worth around US$60 million - one to do with noni, which was about $40 million and the other $20 million was someone wanting to set up forestry here. I am pleased to say that the noni production is now happening in Tailevu, so we look forward to seeing that explode, because as we all know, noni is quite popular in parts of China. We will certainly work on that. I will try and get some more information on the potential quantum, but last year was a bit easier to quantify because we had the MOUs, we had done a press release. But point taken and I will report back on that. Measures to Address Illegal Immigrants (Question No. 307/2024) HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji Police Force inform Parliament of measures the Ministry is taking to address this issue, given that there are currently more than 8,000 illegal immigrants in the country? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Virendra Lal for his question. Perhaps, a background to the question, but before that, I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for your first week in the Chair and it has not been an easy week - not a normal Parliamentary week, and thank you for your endurance. Today is also a very important day in my life, not my birthday, but on 6 th December, 1987, I gave away all the powers I had to the late Sir Ratu Penaia Ganilau, and made him President, and I went back slowly to the Camp. Also, in 2006, this room was configured rather differently at the time. I sat in a box in the middle there, and a gentleman sitting here with a red gown, and he used the same sort of gavel, and he said to me “not guilty, you are now a free man, go and join your family.” So, it is a very important day in my life, and I would like to thank the honourable Virendra Lal for bringing up this question. I would like to just go very quickly over the background of the question that points back to Government. I would have asked the Immigration Investigators to wait for you, honourable Lal, after this break to ask you where these people are. But you have got the figures from the former Minister for Home Affairs who made a statement that there are presently more than 8,000 illegal immigrants in Fiji, says honourable Pio Tikoduadua. This number had doubled from one year, as reports from 2023 shows they were 4,709 illegal immigrants in Fiji in January 2023. The number had increased and the Minister then, was very concerned. So, the answer to your question is also the response to the question he had, of the concerns that he had. What is the Immigration Department or Government doing at this time? I would like to go over those. They were started by honourable Tikoduadua, while he was holding the portfolio of the Minister for Immigration. The Office had implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the issues effectively. Key measures in place, intelligence structure, the Fiji Immigration Department has enhanced border management capabilities through the following actions. An intelligence and assessment structure that coordinates information proactively in drawing out the trend of illegal migrants who may intend to</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2591 reside illegally in Fiji. This assessment will point out emerging trends and issues of border security to identify irregular migration movements and provide a border security landscape to avoid an increase in numbers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember my first visit to Australia as Prime Minister, where there was a welcoming service by the Fijian community in Sydney, and I had a big police entourage looking after me and I noted that there we no prayers right through the service and even the benediction at the end of the sermon when the Talatala pronounced benediction, no one closed their eyes and I said, why did you not pray? There was no prayer right through the service and during benediction no one closed their eyes. When they came out from the grog session after, they told me, “ O ira na tevoro era lako tu mai qori. ” You had demons and devils accompany you, who were they? Those people who were with you. Who were they? They are my police security. “ Oi, we thought they were Immigration Officials. So many of our own who are out there in other countries are also worried about being nabbed by Immigration Officials. Perhaps, we should have our own tevoro around looking for illegal immigrants. Mr. Speaker, Sir, integrating all immigration systems with Migration Information Data Analysis System will centralise traveller data, including biometrics and travel history, to enhance border security and streamline operations. Using advance analytics and real-time verification, the system will detect illegal immigration, fraud and security threats through automated assessments. This unified approach strengthens security, improve efficiency, supports data driven decision and ensure it is compliant with privacy standards. Strengthening compliance and enforcement operation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department has expanded the Compliance Unit resources to explicitly focus on surveillance process for geographic locations of prohibited immigrants. It also entails enforcement, operational plans involving security apparatus to facilitate and feed intelligence to execute operation activities without violating any human rights and also reducing the number of illegal immigrants. As we enforce the law, we have to be mindful of the various rights that we enjoy as citizens and also those that are in our country. Developing networks and partnerships with local and international law enforcement agencies to encourage effective collaboration and coordinated immigrants. This approach involves leveraging advanced surveillance processes, data analytics, and intelligence-sharing to track and address unauthorised movements efficiently. Collaboration with other law enforcement agencies ensures a coordinated response to potential breaches while fostering transparency and accountability. This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Caucus I asked the honourable Pio Tikoduadua whether we had been too passive in our enforcement, perhaps we should take a more proactive role with our investigators and our police, actually asking people on the street if they look suspicious - excuse, Sir or excuse Ma’am, do you have an ID; excuse me young girl, do you have an ID and find out whether she should be in school or she should be on the street. Those are some of the things we need to tighten up. Voluntary departure and removal mechanisms – the department is intensifying consultation efforts through stakeholder engagements to facilitate voluntary departures for those seeking to leave the country. This includes fostering open dialogue with community groups, NGOs, and other relevant entities to promote compliance and provide pathways for resolving immigration issues amicably. Public awareness campaigns – the Department adopts a whole-of-government approach to deliver comprehensive information through coordinated public awareness initiatives. By engaging multiple government agencies and stakeholders, these campaigns aim to educate the public, employers and migrants about immigration laws, workers’ rights and the importance of compliance.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2592</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 Legislative reforms and police updates – the department is undertaking a comprehensive review of the Immigration Act to enhance the independence of the institution and address critical areas such as intelligence gathering, emerging immigration pathways, infringement notices and penalties, removal processes and responses to non-traditional threats. We also have multi-stakeholder collaboration through the department and other international and local agencies, like Interpol. Those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are some of the measures put in place to try and encounter the rising numbers of illegal immigrants. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope you notice from the Chair, that this tie that I am wearing, sort of, energises me, and I want to fly this morning. MR. SPEAKER.- I am noticing it. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- My simple question to the honourable Prime Minister is, I did not serve in the immigration portfolio but convening boarder agency meetings and national security meetings. One of the key issues, Sir, that is usually related to these illegal immigrants, is the issue of detention centres - a proper detention centre for illegal immigrants. There have been discussions about purchasing a land, and I just want to know if there has been progress on this key issue. You have a responsibility for this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, there is none, and we have had a recent example, a bad example, of someone who was held up for immigration, non-compliance, being housed with convicted criminals. There is none yet, but it is also something that we must really look into, but better than that would be to just avoid or prevent immigrants staying longer than they should be. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for the answers that he has given to the questions. I am interested in the analysis, if there has been any analysis done to the breakdown or where the illegal immigrants come and in particular the proportion of Pacific Islanders vis-à-vis others from other countries. If there is any information on that generally, and the reasons in particular for Pacific Islanders remaining in country. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there is a data available, they have been analysed and the main reason for Pacific Islanders overstaying their permit or their allowed time, is kinship, not many are illegally employed, mostly the kinsman will just stay on and on. The Fiji citizens are asking for more sympathetic considerations. The analysis that have been taken, and it is not flattering, it is quite embarrassing if we openly mention the countries of origin. But they will have to be brought out in the right media. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, in light of the fact that 8,000 is almost 1 percent of our population being a substantial number, but I know there is a lot being done at immigration. There are likelihood that we will also be looking at strengthening our immigration laws especially because we have also had quite a huge influx of foreign workers coming into the country, because a lot of ours have actually migrated or gone across to other parts of the world to work. So, would we be looking at strengthening our immigration laws which I certainly feel that we can do? On the other side of the coin, honourable Prime Minister, is there a chance that the Coalition Government may look at an amnesty of sorts to see if we can actually reduce the numbers and those that may genuinely qualify to actually stay in Fiji, Sir. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the former Minister for Immigration just whispered to me that it is already now with the Office of the Solicitor-General being vetted so that we can</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2593 HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the former Minister for Immigration just whispered to me that it is already now with the Office of the Solicitor-General being vetted so that we can implement those measures. However, most of those who came in to work, they illegal stamped it because they have changed from the conditions issued to them with their work permit. The work permit could have contained where they were going to be working and for whom, but when they change that, they become illegal immigrants. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think this is the appropriate time to have recess, so we will now suspend proceedings for our morning break. Parliament will resume in half an hour. Thank you, honourable Members. The Parliament adjourned at 10.30 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>2594</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed further I would like if you please join in welcoming the Nalawa Sunday School and Mothers Club from Nalawa, Ra. Thank you for joining us today and indeed welcome to your Parliament. Benefits to Rural Communities - Tourism Development (Question No. 308/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on how the Ministry is ensuring that local communities in the rural areas benefit directly from tourism development? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we also say hello to my tauvu from Ra. As you all know Nadroga and Ra are very closely related. They generally know that we are superior to them. I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management for the question. I welcome the opportunity to address this important question, regarding how the Ministry is ensuring that local communities especially those in the rural areas benefit from tourism development. The Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, is deeply committed to promoting inclusive and sustainable tourism growth, guided by the principles outlined in Fiji’s National Sustainable Tourism Framework (NSTF) 2024 to 2034. This Framework, Mr. Speaker, Sir, guides us to ensure that tourism development is equitable, community-centric and aligned with Fiji’s broader socio-economic goals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Strategy is built on four goals: (1) Prosperous visitor economy; (2) Thriving and inclusive communities; (3) Visible and valued cultures; and (4) Healthy islands and oceans. Each goal carries strongly the participation and empowerment of communities in tourism. Goal 1: Prosperous visitor economy; we want to create laws that suit indigenous-owned businesses and investments. I briefed Parliament over the last few days, Mr. Speaker, about the Summit I had attended in Perth, the World Tourism Travel (WTTC) Summit, and the future of tourism. As projected by WTTC, a significant growth that is expected from indigenous tourism. They believe that without this tourism, we will not achieve what it sets out to do in terms of uplifting the lives of communities across the globe. Goal 2: Thriving and inclusive communities; encourages initiatives like mentoring and training to ensure indigenous participation. Goal 3: Visible and value cultures; while we promote our culture and tradition, we want to ensure we will safeguard it.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2595 A significant factor about tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is how it helps revive cultures and traditions. I have shared in this Parliament about the opening of the Muanivatu Trail in VuadomoVillage, in Wailevu, Cakaudrove. That day, they performed ceremonies, some of which were last performed 50 years ago, we were fortunate that there was still an old person there who remembered this particular part of the ceremony. Through the opening of the Muanivatu Trail, the young people of Vuadomo were able to revive their tradition. That is what tourism does, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Goal 4: Healthy islands and oceans; we want no disparity in our fight against climate change and explore nature and traditional knowledge-based solutions. In order to ensure communities and rural areas benefit, promoting inclusiveness over the last two years, we held two major sport events Spartan Fiji and Fiji Pro. In both of these events, we ensure that local communities and rural areas benefit. For example, at the Fiji Pro event, the organisers rebuilt the cloud break surf tower and gifted it to the people of Tabanivono-i-wai of Nadroga as a legacy asset to monetise the use of their surfing reefs. Of course, there was cash contributions made to Nabila and Momi Villages. Through our Farm to Fork initiative, we are working directly with farmers, fisher folks and the middlemen around the country to strengthen their ability to supply to the tourism industry. Na Vualiku, Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this week, I spoke about Vanua Levu Tourism Development Framework. This entire programme is centred on empowering a significant part of our country, our second largest island grouping and its people, who right now, only see about 4 percent of visitors in Fiji. On tourism awareness, the Ministry, under the leadership of Roko Tui Saravanua is also undertaking community awareness. The team visits communities wanting to venture into tourism and provide them with guidance. Based on these sessions, we are looking to partner with organisations to deliver training, specific to their needs. On laws, very critical way of ensuring the benefits of tourism, we are setting up laws to ensure that tourism benefits are equitable by creating all the regulations to safeguard that. There are a number of tourism legislations that we are now reviewing to ensure that we have a conducive environment for businesses of all types and sizes to grow. One, is access to funding the resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a cornerstone of this strategy to support rural communities and tourism development lies in ensuring equitable access to financial resources. As I shared earlier in the Parliament, the Ministry’s Pilot Tourism Micro and Small Fund empowers individuals and small enterprises in rural areas by providing much needed financial assistance. I announced this about two days ago and the interest it has created has been phenomenal across the country. This programme enables eligible applicants to secure the resources required to either establish or expand their tourism ventures. It focuses on fostering inclusivity by bridging gaps in accessing capital, especially for those operating in remote regions. By offering targeted support, we are enabling rural communities to create sustainable tourism enterprises that directly benefit the local economies and livelihoods. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is steadfast in its commitments to fostering our tourism sector that uplifts rural communities. By embedding inclusivity, sustainability and resilience into our policies, we are creating pathways for rural Fijians to thrive alongside the growth of Fiji’s tourism industry. HON. LT. COL. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have talked about indigenous tourism. Given the resources that our local communities have and the various segments and activities,</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2596</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 forgive me, there are two parts to the question, one is just our local cuisine in the rural areas. Of course, opportunities for activities like, abseiling, mountain climbing, cross country cycling and mountain biking, these are opportunities that can help shape us in bringing the tourists into the local areas. What is the Ministry doing about local cuisine and such activities? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the question from the honourable Leader of Opposition. Indeed, when you talk about food, food is also culture. And this is an area we are developing our tourism. There are a number of renowned chefs who have now produced some publications on the local cuisines which we are supporting. These are a part of the tourism industry which they accept to use in their outlets. It is in their interest because of the cost factor. There is a lot of dialogue on that, and we are seeing many changes. If you go to many eateries now across the country, you will see a high content of local dishes in their outlets, even in the five start resorts, so that is happening. We also have the Farm to Fork programme, whereby the local farmers are aligned to the local operators, the hoteliers to ensure that they grow their produce on demand. They coordinate what they grow with the chefs, or with the food and beverage people in the hotel. So, in that way, you will see a lot of local produce being featured in the menus. Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, there is still a lot to do in that area, as I have said food is also culture. On the overall activities, the phenomena or the challenge that we are seeing right now for Fiji is to create more activities for our visitors. As I keep saying, it is not just about staying in the resort now, they want to go out. Indeed, it is something that we need to address because we can become a boring destination if we do not factor this into the equation. It is part of the dialogue now with the leadership in tourism, to create more activities, hiking, mountaineering and all these activities. The support is there, and if anyone wants to start, we are there to help and our development partners are also there to help us develop that. We want them out there in the country and in the communities. As a way forward, we cannot do without it and we are committed to it. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Gavoka. I apologise, honourable Koya, but you are out of the periphery of my vision as I look down. I think you may need to have a light cough or something to draw my attention. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On a lighter note, the honourable Leader of Opposition mentioned “mountain biking” twice and members of the Parliament may not remember, but I think that everyone should be told that he used to be a 100 metres sprinter. Athletics was his game but when he went to COP21, they turned him into a mountain biker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to COVID, this is to do with our rural areas, there was an exploratory market being looked at, and I believe there was some work done on it and this is the student tourism market and it is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This was and is a great opportunity for connectivity to our rural areas. When I say, student markets, if I may be permitted to explain a little bit. There are people with a great amount of wealth that wish to send their children to places like Fiji, where they can learn the old way of architecture, the old dances, the old way of doing things. This is where our rural communities could benefit quite substantially from it. This was looking at the Indian market where they spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in student tourism. Now, my question to the honourable Minister is, will you be looking at that or try and tap into that source, that our rural communities can engage with them and do extremely well out of it? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a segment we are also factoring into our</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2597 tourism offerings. Some villages are already welcoming students regularly from the UK. Indeed, as we speak, we are also talking to operators who are specialised in that, in Australia and New Zealand, to bring in students for that purpose. India is also a possibility. Yes, it is a segment that we are encouraging and one that is community based driven, and that is the beauty about it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as it helps with the goals to develop community tourism. As highlighted by honourable Koya, these are parents who have done so well, and they are afraid that their children believe that that is the way life is, all the luxuries and all that they have at home, they just want to send them somewhere where they can experience the reality of life. And Fiji, is big in the map, for families like that. So, yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a segment that we know is there, and we are working towards tapping into that segment. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to Standing Order 45(6), Oral Question No. 309/2024 is deemed to have lapsed, so we will now move on to the next question. (Question No. 309/2024 lapsed) iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission Review (Question No. 310/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the status of the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission review? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vakalalabure for the question. In regard to the iTaukei Land and Fisheries Commission Review, the team started their review from September with the help of the Strategic Advisory Group, who guided the step during the review. They have already visited 14 Provinces, doing their consultations. They have also consulted some focus groups on their discussions and they also did virtual meetings, that included diaspora from overseas. Currently, they have also updated the GCC on its last meeting, and they are compiling their report now. On the 20 th, they will discuss their report with the Strategic Advisory Group before they hand over their report to the Ministry. Frequent Traffic Congestion - Suva-Nausori Corridor (Question No. 311/2024) HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on how the Ministry will address the frequent traffic congestion in the Suva-Nausori corridor? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Shalen Kumar for the question. In line with Government’s commitment to improving access to socio-economic opportunities, the Fiji Roads Authority’s (FRA) is actively working towards addressing the frequent traffic congestion. This is part of the broader medium to long-term infrastructure development plan that aligns with the objective set out in the FRA’s strategic plan. With the continued growth in urban development and increasing number of vehicles on our roads, we do recognise the urgent need to find sustainable solutions to this congestion. As a result, in line with Government’s vision we are working towards forward planning to implement a four-lane</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2598</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 widening of Ratu Dovi Road from Nadera to Laqere, Fletcher Road from Nanuku to Laucala Bay Road and Princess Road from Khalsa Road to Samabula. These are vital corridors that once upgraded will significantly reduce traffic congestion. Sir, the Ministry is also currently working on the review of our transport system where assistance has been secured from the Government of New Zealand to develop the Transport Master Plan and Decarbonisation Implementation Strategy. In terms of reference, include a roadmap to deliver the final goal of the transport sector, provide a flexible and achievable guide for future planning and development and outline long-term growth and development for the transport sector. Including in that, as I mentioned, decarbonisation implementation strategy assessing Fiji’s current transport emission, identifying areas for improvement and setting clear and achievable targets. Sir, the master plan will also identify traffic congestion issues and come up with short and long-term solutions to address these problems. One of the pressings issues that we are facing is the supply of new and second vehicles, increasing supply of new and second-hand vehicles and number on our roads which put pressure on our road infrastructure. This plan will also identify the right quota in terms of number of vehicles on our roads. As most of you will agree, there seems to be a lot of vehicles on our roads as compared to the current capacity of our roads. Sir, LTA is also actively currently actively working on a range of targeted initiatives to address the persistent traffic congestion including promoting public transport, review of public transport networks, also development of a sustainable urban mobility plan. A service targeted measure supported by strategic partnership and technical expertise reflects the Government’s commitment to mitigating traffic congestion in the Suva-Nausori corridor. The aim is to create a modern, sustainable and efficient network modalities for all Fijians. In addition, FRA and PWD are also exploring existing reserves for the construction of roads within this corridor. This includes the Suva-Nausori Regional Road. This is alternative road to King’s Road and Princess Road. Their priority is to explore these link roads to the populated Nasinu corridor, residential and commercial areas to ease the movement of traffic. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PWD is now cutting the Wainibuku to Princess Road, and from looking into the Davuilevu Housing to connect to that Wainibuku to Princess Road and also looking into the Koronivia/Naulu. It is also planning and designing the four-lane widening of the King’s Road, from Tamavua-i-Wai Bridge as you see, that old bridge is being demolished, JICA has approved the new bridge which will make it a four-lane and that will be expanded towards Lami. Sir, the FRA Strategic Plan prioritises the introduction of regular National Traffic Coms and Surveys. This will assist in having the research and data to assist us in forward planning. If you go to a lot of cities in Australia, for example, Brisbane and Sydney, there are about ten ways to get into the city and that is what we are working towards in terms of the various routes as already mentioned. As I have already mentioned these includes the Coastal Road, in addition to what I have mentioned, Koronivia Roundabout to Nokonoko and Davuilevu/Khalsa Road link, Koronivia Roundabout to Adi Davila Road, Caubati Link Road, Nabua Bypass Link, Namadi-Vunakece Link, Valelevu Link, Princess Road to Tamavua-i-Wai Road, Wairua Road to Tamavua-i-Wai Bridge, Cement Factory Lami Link Road, Novotel Access Link Road, Wailoku to Delainavesi. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Minister for his answers. He has mentioned the Princess Road and I do remember during our days when we were in government, there was no road hump in Tamavua and a traffic light and speed camera was there. I have seen a traffic</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2599 hump there and because of that, you will find the movement of traffic has increased by half an hour. I am a frequent user of that road. Why would he change from the latest technology to the old one? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That is a good question. There were a few incidents there including the death of a child, I think. So that was done in liaison with the Tamavua Village community in terms of their specific needs. We will still review that and also in consultation with them in terms of what you had mentioned. You are correct, I believe there would be traffic speed cameras but as you know sometimes speed cameras do not deter speeding vehicles these days, so we might make a double jeopardy there to stop people. I take what you have brought up and we will continue to assess the situation. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, another supplementary question to the answer the honourable Minister has given. A simple solution, can take away the hump from there and re-adjust the traffic camera by 30 and that will be income generating too. Also, Mr. Speaker, he mentioned of ten ways of getting to towns and cities in Sydney, but going to Nadi Airport, there are only two ways. It takes an hour to cross from one end of Nadi to the other. Why would you have changed from one way to two ways now? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Nath, you could easily have rephrased your statement into a question by just adding “can you do this and that” and that would have matched the requirement of the question. I think the honourable Minister has taken the essence of your question on board. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- It is a breach of Standing Order 2, it is a new question. So, can you put that again to the Business Committee because that is to do with Nadi? Nadi is quite a complex area …. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about tourism. Nadi Airport is an international airport. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Nath, the question is specific on the Suva-Nausori corridor, there is no other question for any part of the road in Fiji except for the Suva-Nausori corridor, so I will rule your question out of order. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, one of the methodologies used around the world to gather proper traffic information, for cameras and for the LTA to keep track of weight, et cetera, is the use of gantries. In terms of getting traffic flow and the police getting the right information, LTA, et cetera, would you be looking at the use of gantries all across, right through from Nausori to Suva, bearing in mind that we have a 300,000-plus population and you cannot stop people from buying vehicles, that is just a sign of prosperity. Are we looking at that as a new form of keeping track of traffic and controlling? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Definitely, we are looking at that and other means of monitoring and assessing and also formulating the appropriate responses moving forward and strategies. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his very good detailed response. Honourable Minister, you aware of the previous government’s initiative of having a shuttle service from Nakasi so that people who are living in Valelevu if they have to go to Princess Road through the shuttle service they could go, rather than catching a bus from Valelevu, going to</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2600</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 the Suva bus stand, then changing a bus and travelling down because that creates congestion. Honourable Minister, is that plan still there or the plan has been scrapped? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is also linked with the decarbonization of public transport. That project is still there and we also continue to discuss that with Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) as the facilitator in terms of funding for that, and all the ones as you mentioned that had been initiated from the previous government, it would be a pilot project in terms of electric buses which would cover that area. It is still there, and we are progressing with it. Fiji Critical Bridges Resilience Project (Question No. 312/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Fiji Critical Bridges Resilience Project? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for his question. This Critical Bridges Resilience Project is a major capital project which includes the replacement of four critical bridges - Lami Bridge at Suvavou, Medraukutu Bridge at Lami Cement Factory, Sabeto Bridge at Sabeto River and Viseisei Bridge between Nadi and Lautoka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project is co-financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank and there are four key components which include: (1) replacement of the four critical bridges with new resilience bridges; (2) capacity enhancement of the Fiji Roads Authority; (3) identification and preparation of climate resilient solutions; (4) implementation of a gender policy and action plan for FRA. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these four bridges are critical public assets as it connects our cities and towns along the Queen’s Highway. It will improve domestic connectivity and ensure that the new bridges are climate and disaster resilient. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in light of the vulnerabilities induced by climate change, the bridge replacements are being designed to not only provide increased capacity but also designed to withstand climatic events and natural disasters and the new designs can include dedicated pedestrian pathways, thereby ensuring safety. With the support of the ADB and the World Bank, a lot of preparatory works had already been undertaken and I want to thank the Fiji Roads Authority and the Acting CEO for being part of the preparatory works. The project is actually ready for implementation from first half of next year which will obviously create jobs and providing a major impetus for investment and economic activity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total financing for the project is close to US$200 million or approximately FJ$458 million, US$134.5 million or FJ$307 million from ADB. Of this, US$120 million, which is approximately FJ$274.5 million, is concessional financing and US$14.5 million, approximately FJ$33.2 million, is full grant. Sir, US$50 million is being provided by the World Bank which includes US$25 million in concessional financing and US$25 million which will be accessed</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2601 at normal market terms. Government financing of around US$15 million, which is closed to about $30 million, which includes tax duty exemption, land acquisition amongst other things. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that the overall financing package is highly concessional with a grant element of over 50 percent. While we have a direct grant component of around FJ$33 million from ADB, the huge concessionality of the loan from ADB, 40-year term inclusive of 10- year grace period and 1 percent interest rate and World Bank International Development Association (IDA) access, if to the grant element in its present value terms. I want to take this opportunity to thank the ADB and the World Bank for their continuous support towards financing Fiji’s development over the last many years and providing this cheaper source and increasingly building grant components into these climate resilient infrastructure projects. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ADB now has proclaimed itself as a climate bank and the World Bank is also focussing on climate financing, and with the operationalisation of the loss and damage fund which will be administered by the World Bank, the World Bank is going to be the financial intermediary. We, Small Island States, in particular are expected to benefit particularly the grant component from the World Bank and ADB. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project also aligns with the National Development Plan 2025 to 2029 which places emphasis on connectivity and accessibility and more importantly getting the basics right which means investment in bridges, roads, water supply, et cetera, is going to meet the basic needs of our people. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my simple question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, is this part of the current financial year’s commitments as we have already endorsed in this Parliament or is this is going to be for the next financial year? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are elements as part of the preparatory works. As I said, a lot of the preparatory works had already been done. The Government component, Sir, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition would know would include that, but as I said, the project is expected to be implemented in the second half of next year which means that the additional component of the project will be part of the 2025-2026 budget. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. I am glad to see that the funding is coming through. During our time we built or repaired 80 bridges, so a lot of work for the current Minister to be able to do that and I thank ADB for what they are doing. As you can see now, with the kind of money that you are talking about, US$200 million for the four bridges. That is the kind of cost that we incurred to make bridges resilient in this type of environment that we face and that will become worse in the future. In terms of crossings, is there also a focus on getting funding for critical crossings? Because a lot of people in the rural areas are focused on those crossings like the one the honourable Joseph Nand talked about the other day, the crossings in the rural areas. Is there a focus also on those for the rural areas and is there concessional funding and grant elements to deal with those areas? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is a very good question. As I said, as part of the National Development Plan and as part of the implementation plan is being worked out in consultation with the different Ministries, we are hoping that we can put together bankable projects so that we are project-ready to be able to access some of these funding, particularly the Loss and Damage Fund and the other most important fund is the Pacific Resilience Fund which, as I have said the other day in my Statement, that Australia and New Zealand have already contributed to the Pacific Resilience Fund, and we are looking at a total of about $250 million by the end of this year.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2602</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 The Finance Ministers are meeting in March to set out the legal and financial framework, and we are hoping that funding would be available close to end of 2025 or early 2026. A lot of those funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be localised financing and we are hoping that not only seawalls. For example, we have identified about sea walls, we have identified about 40 communities, and we are identifying crossings, as you have said quite rightly, which is going to be necessary as a result of constant impact of climate change, flooding, excessive rain, et cetera. I think that is a very important aspect that we are focused on and hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2025, especially when the Loss and Damage Fund is operationalised, honourable Leader of the Opposition. The decision at COP had been made to operationalise, the Board has been formed, the World Bank has already prepared itself as a financial intermediary, and I think Fiji is in a very strong position with ADB and the World Bank, in accessing some of those finances, particularly the grant component that should come to Fiji and many of the other Pacific Island countries. Irregular Bus Services - Viseisei, Vuda and Vaivai (Question No. 313/2024) HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament as to the reasons why bus services to Viseisei, Vuda, and Vaivai operate irregularly, despite concerns raised by the residents? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this area has a population of around 500 residents. There is an approved service timetable for Vuda and Vaivai, and licensed carrier operating from Vuda. Unfortunately, the irregular bus services can be attributed to road conditions, and we are looking into that. There is an Irish Crossing and the rise near that which needs major cuts in terms of access, especially for large vehicles. The other issue is the issuance of route authority letters. This is normally issued by municipal councils which limits the scope of services to be extended. We are looking at licensed carriers in order to assist with that, I suppose, given the number of passengers at the moment, whom from the bus operators’ view, cannot sustain the bus operations. So, in consultation with the communities, we are looking at licensed carriers which can operate more adaptable vehicles for these communities, and also the municipal council regarding the issues with the route licences and working closely with FRA in terms of the upgrade of that road. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my question, I just wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Apisai Ketenalagi. I saw in the news that he has recently been appointed at Acting CEO of FRA. It is not an easy job but probably he will need the support of all of us here in his role as Acting CEO. Mr. Speaker, Sir, road conditions is under the Works and Rural Development but the transportation is under LTA which is a regulated industry. If the bus has to be there at 7 o’clock, it must be there at 7 o’clock. This issue was brought to us in Delaisaweni, I was in that meeting, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My question to the honourable Minister, how can LTA ensure that the services that the people require are provided as mandated? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes back to the conditions of issuance of licences and they are required to provide the services. It is something that I will need to follow-up with LTA in terms of the compliance with the conditions of those licences.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2603 Yes, I admit that some have not adhered or have not provided the services as required. That is something that we need to monitor and ensure that those who are issued the relevant public service licence carry out their services. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, irregular bus services is mostly because of poor road conditions, as agreed by the honourable Minister also. It is also not only in those areas that I have mentioned but other rural areas also. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament as to why periodic road maintenance works are not done on rural roads? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. When I heard that question, it is sort of a generalised question, but for that road, definitely we are looking into that and I will be following up with the FRA Regional Manager West. I admit, sometimes as a Minister, we have to come down hard on the people at operational level. That is something which is an ongoing challenge, especially, the monitoring, because some things are obvious, but it has been left there for some time. So, that is something that I am addressing within the Ministry and with the operational entities - WAF, FRA, LTA and also MSAF. I do not know but maybe, it is something to do with the attitude or culture, but it is an ongoing process - monitoring and action. The other part is the Programme Maintenance in terms of not only roads but also building, et cetera. So, that whole culture of planning, programming and budgeting needs to come together. As a Coalition Government, that is something we are taking seriously. We have been here for two years, but we are moving towards that. I am sure that after we win the elections, everything will be perfect. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister; all governments do all those things that we need to do to provide for people. But what I am interested in, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that the honourable Minister has pointed out is the condition of the roads, especially in the rural areas. I am just wondering to my mind that we have around 4,000 kilometres of gravel roads and the cost of maintenance is quite high. Would there be then a long term plan or mid-term plan by the Government to have say, half of these roads tarsealed, or at least the worst parts, traction sealed, that is, you seal the hills to make sure that the buses can go, so that we can address this because at the end of the day, the major problem is the condition of the roads. Would there be some sort of a targe to say, half of our gravel roads, tarseal them over a period of time, and that will address that particular situation, at least, to a large extent? Is that something that the honourable Minister is considering? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That is a very valid question. I am not an engineer or anything, but the focus is on the maintenance but we need to move a step up – new roads and tarsealed roads. So, in the formulation of the FRA Strategic Plan which has just been approved, the KPI included there is the number of new or tarsealed roads, extending the number of tarsealed roads. So, that is definitely part of what is currently being done. and moving forward. The tarsealing of roads, some are happening right now, for example, we have budgeted for the tarsealing of the frontage of villages and public facilities, like health centres and schools. So, that is currently happening now, and more will be done in the second half of the year. The honourable</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2604</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 Minister for Finance has also indicated that he will be providing more, in addition to climate financing, to continue to expand that, in addition to the new roads. Public Rental Board Lagilagi Housing Estate (Question No. 314/2024) HON. K. V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on plans for further expansion of the Public Rental Board Lagilagi Housing Estate in addressing housing needs of low-income families, following the opening of its 36 housing flats? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I deliver the response to the question, I just want to give a short brief of the Lagilagi Housing Project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a project that started way back in 2009 by the previous Government, in conjunction with the Pacific Community Network Charitable Trust, commonly known as PCN, together with the German Catholic Organisation. So far, the Government has contributed an investment of close to $16 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the project was for PCN to assist in the construction of low- cost units to provide accommodation to those low-income earners who reside within Jittu Estate informal settlement. When that project started, 117 units were completed, and 36 units were constructed but were incomplete. So, on 17 th January, 2024, Cabinet approved for the Public Rental Board (PRB) to manage and also complete the incomplete 36 units at Lagilagi Housing Estate. I am pleased to inform the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 36 incomplete units was completed by the PRB with a budget of close to $3 million, but they managed to complete within the cost of $1.6 million and is the units are about to be opened soon. I am also thankful to the Ministry of Youth and Sports for coming on board and assisting the Ministry, as well as the PRB, in providing recreational space for those residents who are going to occupy those additional 36 units, as well as the existing 117 families who are currently residing at the Lagilagi Housing Estate. If you happen to drive through that road, you will see that PRB is still constructing the gabion wall, just to retain the side that is fronting the main road, as well as the side of the multipurpose court. If you look at the area itself, close to 160 are on that side of Lagilagi Housing, that is, leaving aside close to another 1,400 families who are residing on the other side of Jittu Estate. The challenge for the Ministry, as well as for the Board, is to construct additional units on the space that is currently available. So, the PRB has come on board, and they were thinking of constructing two-bedroom units but due to space, they are going to only provide a few units. So, we requested them to redesign the model so, at least, we can accommodate more families to occupy those flats. So, that is phase 2 of what PRB is going to do whilst the 36 families will be given their offer for them to actually occupy 36 units that have been completed. There is also another space in that area, but we are still liaising with the Ministry of Lands to also try and transfer that parcel of land to the PRB so that they can construct some more units at the completion of the 36 units. The idea here is to move those people who are currently residing in Jittu. What we have noted is that, in the phase 2, those who were given the flats are those who are not residing at Jittu.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2605 There are some families that are there, who have been paying the charitable trust with the PCN, and now we have changed their consent, we are going to only include those residents who live within Jittu. The reason is that we just want to get people out of that situation, so once we start absorbing those people from Jittu, then PRB can expand further and build some more blocks to accommodate those who are living there, as well as those on the other side of Jittu Estate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is just the progress and update of what the Ministry is doing, as well as what the PRB has done as far as the completion of the 36 units and also plans that we have in mind to assist those other families who reside there, especially low income families. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, honourable Minister, I know that I have brought this to your attention outside Parliament when a few people came to see us. As you are aware, honourable Minister, and I think for transparency sake and for the benefit and satisfaction of those who were aggrieved, (I know the investigations) can you, please, give some assurance on what will happen to those who were aggrieved and what actions are you also taking to address it and, of course, for the future of the aggrieved parties as well because of the unfortunate incident that happened from those who were handling this project? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unfortunate part about this project was that there were some genuine families who were looking for affordable shelter who came on board and also joined the PCN with the hope that they will be given a flat or shelter. What has happened is that those that have actually not been given, there are systems in place, it is like a co-operative system where they go, register and start paying their subscriptions. Some go towards education. They were told, if you want to pay something, you have to mention whether its towards education, accommodation or shelter. The unfortunate part is when they were given a refund, when the impasse happened, that is, most of the families encountered with PCN, the Ministry had gone ahead to refund the money to those who had receipts with either shelter or accommodation. However, there were others who paid for education. What we have done is, if the receipts are from PCN, we have also started processing those that have paid for other means. That was also part of the preparation in the last as well as this current financial year. There were those that were still receiving who were there and we have also received some enquiries on how they could be, especially those who live within Jittu Estate. The focus now is for those who live within Jittu Estate. I think this defeats the purpose of getting some people outside Jittu and not living in informal settlements but living in other formal settlements. That is something that we are also taking on board. Sir, PRB is also in the process, we have done a social survey on those existing tenants that have been offered flats by PCN. They had told the board and also the Ministry that they had paid this much with a copy of their receipts, but these were the ones who were not considered by PCN but were starting to get subscriptions and memberships from those who live within the settlement. That is something that the Ministry, together with PRB, will also do for further reviews to assist those who were affected by PCN. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is that the Special Investigations Report also revealed that there were people who were not meant to be in those flats were there. A foreign person is owning a flat, a 10-year old child is owning a flat and it was all thanks to PCN, the way they were involved and it was their project. Will you be taking any action against those cases because the report has been out from 2020? Because of COVID, et cetera, we could not proceed with that, and of course, it was referred to FICAC. So, FICAC was undertaking the investigation to further confirm those cases.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2606</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue raised by the former Minister is a factual one because there are families living there who are not supposed to be living there. That was the arrangement done by the organisation but something that the Ministry will pursue further and that is something that we are going to do after we have completed, given the offer for those 36 families who will be occupying the newly completed three blocks.</p><h4>MR.
