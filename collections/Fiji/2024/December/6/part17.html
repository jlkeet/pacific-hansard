In FY2022-2023, the import duty on used passenger cars was increased by 5 percent. Additionally, import VAT of 9 percent applicable on electric vehicles was reduced to 0 percent. In FY2023-2024, import excise duty on new and used passenger motor vehicles was further increased by 5 percent. In FY2023-2024, the Government had also reduced the fiscal duty on various food products (canned mackerel, corned mutton, corned beef &amp; beef, prawns and duck) from 32 percent to 15 percent. Fiscal duty on sheep/lamb meat was reduced from 5 percent to 0 percent, while fiscal duty on canned tomatoes was reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent.

In FY2024-2025, the maximum threshold for personal imports concession was reduced from $2,000 to $1,000 and with a 15 percent VAT applied. Prior to June 2020, the threshold was $400 and increased to $2,000 during COVID-19 Budget to encourage imports for personal use and assistance from families overseas.
