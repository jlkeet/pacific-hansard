<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government to deliver his response. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my response to the Statement that was presented by honourable Bala and I thank him for bringing this issue to this august House because it is an important issue because it affects economic development and our economic growth. I was expecting honourable Bala to provide to Parliament some of the informal settlements that he</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2610 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 has completed. However, he gave us some ideas, even some complaints and some of the leases that have expired and have not been renewed to-date. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 48 development leases were acquired by the previous Government. There was no proper planning done on how they were going to formalise these settlements. So, far only three have been completed to-date. I remember during the launching of the Waidamudamu Informal Settlement Upgrade, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that was in 2015. Now, that project is completed. He asked as to when we are going to offer the leases, that is something that we are arranging with iTLTB, making sure that we have all the conditions by iTLTB before we can start giving out the leases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done before we get the leases for all these settlements, we are also going to follow the process on how the allocation will be done. The Cabinet has approved the new allocation policy for those settlers who reside in these informal settlements on how they are going to get their land. I want to remind honourable Bala about one of his promises in 2015. He said that the development of Cuvu Informal Settlement should be completed by the year 2016. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has completed the evaluation of all the tenders from these settlements and is also in the process of allocating the lots to these informal settlements. HON. P. K. BALA.- God is watching! (Laughter) HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, informal settlement is not really a simple task, it is really a difficult challenge which should be a community effort. It is not only by the Government but NGOs should be involved and also the landlords on which these informal settlements are located. With the current Government, I have already said that there is a 12-year plan, with the support of the Ministry of Finance, if you are going to work on four projects in a year, you should be able to complete all these 48 informal settlements. You should be able to formalise them in the 12-year period, so this is the type of planning that we have. When you acquire a lease, you must make sure that you tell the people when you are going to start the project and when you are going to complete the project, something that was missed out when these announcements were made in this august House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to mention about the expired land leases. It comes back to planning, Sir. The land that he mentioned in Ba, a proper planning was done, and that development should have been completed by now. The issue is that because there was no plan in place, that is why the development lease had expired, and the Ministry is faced with a mammoth task. Now, the landowners are coming up with more demands, so we are having some difficulty in re-negotiating with iTLTB to renew these development leases. (Honourable P. K. Bala interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current Government is working very, very had to ensure that we are going to complete whatever targets that we have decided and also agreed to complete while formalising these settlements. We are not a government that just tell the people,</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024 End of Week Statements 2611 “We want to do this, we are going to acquire leases, we are going to just put red paint to number the houses that they have been suggesting in these informal settlements. We are hopeful, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that with support of the Ministry of Finance, as well as the funding from other development partners, we will be able to come up with a solution that is going to, not only resolve issues with informal settlements now, but also going to resolve issues of informal settlements in the future. Role of Society in Addressing HIV in Fiji HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise in this august House to deliver an End of Week Statement, highlighting the role of society in addressing the critical issue of HIV in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the HIV epidemic poses a significant health challenge globally, especially in the Pacific region, with Fiji experiencing a concerning trend in new infections and existing vulnerabilities. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services has recorded a staggering 552 new cases of HIV, just from January to June 2024, a figure that highlights the urgent need for collective actions. Cases were identified across the four Divisions with the Central Division shockingly recording 380 cases, followed by the Western Division with 151 cases, Northern Division with 19 cases and the Eastern Division with two cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while sexual transmission continues to be a primary mode of HIV transmission in Fiji, it is important to note that 85 of the 552 cases (15 percent), were transmitted through injectable drug use, with individuals voluntarily identifying themselves as such. This relatively new factor in our national data is an indication of evolving social challenges, such as drug use and risky behaviour, that require our attention and a concerted effort to curb. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to understand the scale of the challenge we are facing. The 552 cases recorded in the first half of 2024, already reflect a 33 percent increase, compared to the total cases reported in 2023. However, it is crucial that we do not view this increase as a failure. Instead, it is a direct result of the Ministry’s efforts to ramp up testing and early treatment, which is a key component in HIV management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Ministry of Health and Medical Services for implementing new strategies to improve national testing, enrolment into the care of HIV positive individuals, and public health communications to reduce stigma and raise awareness. Further increases are anticipated as testing expands nationwide. According to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the current figures show that our younger individuals, particularly those under 39 years of age, account for 73 percent of the new cases which underlines the need to target our messaging and services to the younger demographic, as they are among the most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of injectable drug use is a growing concern in our fight against HIV. Out of the 552 cases reported, 85 have been linked to drug use through injections, representing 15 percent of all new cases in 2024. This emerging trend poses an additional layer of complexity in managing the HIV epidemic, as it introduces risk behaviours that go beyond sexual transmission.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2612 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the practice of sharing needs and participating in high-risk activities, such as chemsex and bluetoothing (a dangerous practice where drugs are injected and shared between individuals using the same needle), has contributed to the rise in cases. It is important to highlight that addressing this issue requires a broader societal response that includes addressing drug addiction, providing harm-reduction services and offering education on safer practices to at-risk populations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, current statistics show that a significant portion of the newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2024 is from individuals between the ages 15 to 29. These numbers tell us that HIV is disproportionately affecting the younger population, many of whom may be engaging in unsafe sexual practices or using injectable drugs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a society, we must take responsibility for educating our young people. The information they receive about HIV prevention, safe sex and the dangers of drug use will shape their behaviour. Parents, schools, religious leaders and community groups must work together to ensure that our young people are equipped with the knowledge and tools they need to make safer choices. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rising HIV infections in Fiji signals a broader regional health crisis. In other words, this means that the fight against HIV cannot be left to the Government alone. Every Fijian has a role to play in addressing this critical issue. Community support is essential to providing care for those living with HIV and preventing the spread of the virus. In addressing the increasing cases of HIV through injectable drug use, we must be proactive in tackling the root causes of drug addiction and providing harm-reduction services. Society must support initiatives such as rehabilitation services and community outreach to at-risk populations. We cannot turn a blind eye to the dangers posed by drug use in our communities, and it is now a major contributing factor to the spread of HIV. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a firm believer that some of these societal ills all point back to our homes. I urge parents and heads of households to be diligent in your roles and responsibilities, having constant and honest conversations with your children and family members, having quality family times and being attentive to children’s needs and behaviours are very crucial. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate the statement by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services that HIV is not a death sentence. With medical advancements available today, people living with HIV can live long, healthy and productive lives. The key is early diagnosis and timely access to treatment. We must do everything in our power to encourage individuals to get tested and if necessary, to seek treatment without delay. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has confirmed that we have recorded 13 deaths from HIV-related illnesses so far this year, a sobering statistics that reminds us that while treatment is available, not everyone is accessing it in time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest challenges we face in addressing the HIV is the stigma associated with the virus. Many people are still afraid to present themselves for testing because of the fear of being judged by their families and communities. This is where society must step in, and its role is critical. We must create a supportive environment where individuals feel comfortable, seeking help and accessing services without fear of being discriminated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must challenge the myths and misconceptions surrounding HIV, including the outdated belief that it is a death sentence. However, public health campaigns, media</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024 End of Week Statements 2613 and community leaders have a responsibility to spread accurate information and promote compassion for those affected by HIV. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward together, we must all take responsibility for the role we play in addressing the rising number of HIV cases in Fiji. The Government will continue to provide all the necessary services, but we need the support of every segment of society to effectively tackle this issue. I urge all Fijians to get tested and know their status. I call upon parents, teachers and community leaders to educate our young people about the dangers of unsafe sex and drug use. I ask all of us to treat those living with HIV with the dignity and respect they each deserve, and to help reduce the stigma that prevents so many from seeking the necessary help they need. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have withstood many challenges together, and I am still of the firm belief that together, we can turn the tide on HIV in Fiji. It only requires our collective effort, one that involves individuals, families, communities, healthcare professionals, policymakers and faith-based organisations and Civil Society Organisations. I urge all of us to work towards a future where HIV is no longer a threat to our society, and where those living with the virus can lead full healthy lives without fear or discrimination. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government remains committed to improving our healthcare access, increase testing and provide life-saving treatment to all Fijians. However, success will depend on the active involvement of society in raising awareness, promoting safe practices and supporting those affected by HIV. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond and support the Statement delivered by the Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, highlighting the role of society in addressing the increasing number of HIV cases in Fiji. I wish to begin by acknowledging the healthcare workers, partners and stakeholders, who are commemorating World Aids Day with the theme ‘Take the Rights Path” in Nadi today and helping to raise more awareness and build greater understanding in our communities of this major health threat that is facing us all. The chief celebrant is our former President, as well as former Speaker of this august Parliament, His Excellency Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, a fearless advocate and global ambassador for HIV. At the celebration in Nadi today, 23-year-old Mark Shahil Khan has come out, for the first time, to share his challenges as a HIV positive patient, giving courage and hope to many. I admire Mark’s courage, and I wish many more will come out and share their stories so that we can work together to educate our community and help each other to subdue HIV in Fiji. Although I am present here in Parliament today, my voice and spirit echo with them in solidarity and a shared purpose. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is confronting an alarming and unprecedented surge in HIV cases. From January to June of 2024 alone, Fiji recorded 552 new HIV cases, an overwhelming indicator of the epidemic’s growth. The Ministry has reported at many forums and media platforms, including my response to an Oral Question in Parliament in October 2024, on the sharp rise in the number of new HIV cases since 2021. The Ministry will continue to highlight this at every opportunity it gets. The UNAIDS Global AIDS Monitoring Report 2022 noted that in 2010, the estimated number of new infections in Fiji has risen by 260 percent, the second fastest growing epidemic in the Asia Pacific region. Many</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2614 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 individuals are presenting to healthcare facilities with an advance HIV related infections, and the rise in the number of new cases is also linked to the increasing in testing conducted in our health facilities. My fear is that we are still missing a large of group of untested people in our community. Last year, UNAIDS estimated a population of 2,000 people who were living with HIV in Fiji and this is believed to be under reported. Of this, only 1,049 people are on treatment while the remaining 951 remain undiagnosed or lost to follow up. Untreated HIV is not only life threatening, but a key driver of community transmission. In this regard, the Ministry has engaged the assistance of our partners and international technical experts to conduct an assessment of the lightly number of HIV cases in the country. This report will be crucial in qualifying the magnitude of our response to HIV challenges before us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, staggering 82 AIDS related deaths were recorded in 2023 and this figure is expected to rise. This is an unacceptable loss of life. The Ministry is gravely concerned about untreated HIV cases and the delay in accessing care. Many of the undiagnosed or untreated cases involve youths who engage in risqué activity behaviours, including intravenous drug use, chem-sex, further complicated our response for HIV in Fiji. It is essential to reiterate that HIV is not a death sentence. It is a treatable condition with a proper care. People living with HIV can live long, healthy lives. This is the message that we must never stop sharing with anyone and everyone. E sega ni kena i balebale, ni sa tauvi iko ga na HIV, iko sa na mate sara. E rawa ni ko bulabula vinaka tikoga ka qarava vakavinaka tiko na nomu vuli, cakacaka, se i tavi e vale. Esa tiko ena noda vei valenibula e Viti na vuanikau kei na wainimate mo taura me vukei iko, kevaka sa kunei ni sa tiko vei iko na HIV. E nomu dodonu mo qara na bula vinaka. Kakua tale ni madua se vuni. E sa kena gauna meda dolava na noda vakasama kei na noda rai, ka da veivuketaka na sasaga ni kena tarovi na mate ca oqo na HIV e Viti. Treatment also serves as a vital prevention tool, as treatment suppression eliminates the risk of transmission. This means, that those who are on treatment and their viral load is reduced, will not spread the virus to their spouse and sexual partners, their children when they are born and their babies when they breast feed. With treatment, we can also stop the HIV transmission in our community. This is why we must urgently identify and start treatment for those who remain untreated. I call on all these individuals in our community who may have had a test previously and have not returned for their results to come forward and seek your results and engage in our free treatment programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, treatment for HIV in Fiji is free. So, patients do not have to pay for the cost of medicine, as they are provided free by the Government. In addition, the advancement in medication for HIV over the years means that the number of medicines that one has to take for the control of HIV, has reduced significantly from what used to be eight to nine different tablets and medications each day, to only two or one. This has made HIV antiretroviral therapy very friendly and encouraging for those on treatment to remain on the lifelong treatment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, only together as a community can we respond to this challenge of HIV. Our statistics at the Ministry has revealed that the number of new cases amongst illicit drug uses is increasing rapidly. The dual burden of injecting drugs use and HIV is a deadly combination for our people, in particular for our youth and children. Our strategy is to tackle these two scourges with hand in hand and I encourage that when we discuss about one in our communities, we also talk about the other, bringing more awareness and knowledge on how we can address these dual burdens in our midst.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024 End of Week Statements 2615 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges that we need to develop new and innovative preventative approaches quickly, as our current prevention programme will not be adequate for our new HIV challenges. Our current HIV situation calls on all of us to think differently and open our hearts and minds to newer approaches that put our communities back in the driving seat of the HIV response. We will look to the experience and expertise of countries that have gone through similar HIV outbreaks in their communities, and the international best-practice approaches that have brought success in their HIV responses. We are grateful that our partners and developing neighbouring countries who are supporting and assisting us in our response. The World Health Organization, UNDP, the Australian Government and the New Zealand Government amongst others that have provided support thus far and have pledged to provide further support in the future. Government has endorsed Fiji's HIV Surge Strategy, a comprehensive approach that facilitates collaboration with health partners, government ministries, and communities. The surge strategy is pivotal in strengthening HIV prevention efforts, scaling up targeted national testing for key population groups, improving access to life-saving testing and treatment, reducing stigma and discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS, and enhancing the governance of Fiji's HIV response programme. An important pillar of strength is prevention through education and awareness. This is where we require the support of our community, advocacy groups, civil society organizations, faith-based organizations, schools, villages, and communities to educate our children and young people on HIV and its linkages to illicit drug use, as well as the treatment and good long-term outcome with treatment. This is where we can work together to implement prevention strategies and help to identify HIV cases early. Mr. Speaker, Sir, subduing the current surge in HIV in Fiji will require a whole of Government and whole of society effort. With every Fijian is guaranteed their right to health in our constitution, stigma and discrimination remain the main obstacle to accessing timely treatment and support to our people living with HIV in Fiji. I call on all of us to work together to ensure that no one is denied their right to be tested, treated, and supported without fear, stigma, or discrimination. Let us unite in this fight against HIV and protect the rights of those who live with HIV. Get tested, know our status, and ensure a healthier future for our nation. Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to wish your good self, members of the secretariat and the staff of Parliament, members of Parliament, a Merry Christmas and blessed, prosperous and a healthy New Year. Fishing Co-operatives – Rural and Maritime/Coastal Communities HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; a very good afternoon to you all. I rise today to give a statement that will highlight fishing cooperatives in rural and maritime or coastal communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these cooperatives are not just economic entities, they are the lifeblood of our communities’ sustaining livelihoods, fostering collaboration and preserving our cultural heritage. In the heart of our coastal villages and remote islands, fishing is more than a means of sustenance. It</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2616 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 is a way of life. For generations our people have depended on the bountiful ocean to provide for their families and communities. However, in an everchanging world with economic challenges and environmental threats, the need for sustainable and resilient practices has never been greater. Fishing cooperatives Mr. Speaker, Sir, offer a beacon of hope and progress, by uniting individual fishers under a collective framework. These cooperatives enhance the bargaining power of our community members enabling them to secure fair prices for their catch and gain access to larger markets. This collective approach, Sir, not only stabilises income, but also ensures that the benefits of our marine resources are shared equitably among all members. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, fishing co-operatives are at the forefront of promoting sustainable fishing practices. They play a crucial role in educating and training fishes on methods that protect our precious marine eco-systems while ensuring long-term productivity. Through the implementation of sustainable practices such as controlled fishing seasons and the use of eco-friendly gear, cooperatives have to preserve fish stocks for future generations safeguarding the biodiversity that is intrinsic to our way of life. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, we currently have 34 registered fishing co-operatives in the country. Amongst the 34 registered co-operatives, we have 3 youth groups and one women group that registers as a fisher’s co-operative. A breakdown by division with regards to the 33 registered fishing co-operatives in Fiji are as follows: - - 4 Central Division Eastern Division 9 Northern Division - 13 - 18 Western Division 44 Total Mr. Speaker, these are the few opportunities available through the fishing co-operatives, they provide economic benefits to individual fisherman by pulling resources, reducing cost and increasing bargaining power when negotiating prices for their catches or purchasing supplies. Fishing co- operatives promotes sustainable fishing and sometimes additional fishing practices that encourage members to adhere to responsible fishing methods, helping to protect fish populations and marine eco-systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they empower local fishing communities by giving fisherman a collective voice in decision making processes and enhancing their influence in fishery management policies. Co-operatives help mitigate risks associated with fishing, such as fluctuating market prices, weather conditions and regulatory changes by offering support and shared resources amongst members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, beyond the economic and environmental benefits, fishing co-operatives foster a strong sense of community and solidarity. They provide a platform for sharing knowledge, skills and resources, strengthening social bonds and promoting mutual support. In times of needs whether due to natural disasters or economic hardships, cooperatives serve as a support network helping families to weather the storms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the success of fishing co-operatives in Fiji, is a testament to the power of collaboration and community driven initiatives by working together we can overcome challenges, protect our marine resources and build a more prosperous and sustainable future for all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us continue to support and empower our fishing co-operatives, recognising them as essential pillars of our rural and coastal communities. Together we can ensure</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024 End of Week Statements 2617 that the rich legacy of our fishing heritage is preserved and that the benefits of our ocean’s bounty are enjoyed by generations to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Trade and Co-operative is committed to creating an enabling environment where fishing co-operatives thrive. As we continue to invest in initiatives, we are not just improving the livelihoods of our rural and coastal communities, we are strengthening our nations’ future by harnessing the collective power of our people and ensuring the sustainable use of our marine resources. We can achieve lasting economic growth and environmental stewardship for the benefit of all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite all honourable Members of this august Parliament and indeed all Fijians to support and engage in this transformative enterprise as we work together for a prosperous, sustainable and equitable future for our communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my leave, I also want to wish the honourable Members of this Parliament and your good self, Sir, for Christmas and a Prosperous 2025. And to all families of Fiji who are listening in, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous 2025. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I also would like to join with honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure in wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and given it is the second anniversary, almost second anniversary of this side of Parliament. I Wish to thank the other side of Parliament, particularly the G9 Bloc for being collaborative and supportive. We have had some arm wrestles now and again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but it is all in the spirit of trying to serve our nation. So, we thank everyone, including the honourable Leader of the Opposition of course and the G9 Bloc as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought I just reply to honourable Ratu Vakalalabure’s wonderful statement. Just picture this in a group of co-operatives all along the coast of Bua and Macuata, they have a co-operative truck that picks up all their fish starting from Macuata, coming down to Dreketi and all the way to Nabouwalu, on the ferry, back to Suva and then supply in Suva for export. If we are able to achieve that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the essence of co-operatives. Basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of Parliament will do its utmost to push co-operatives as a means to really develop the rural economy. We do not need to look far to see how successful co- operatives are. There is Zespri, the main exporter for kiwifruit out of New Zealand. You have Amul in the State of Gujarat and is the largest dairy company in India and is one of the biggest exporters fact, from India to the rest of the world in terms of dairy, and they are a genuine co-operative. In Sir, being a former Director of Rewa Dairy, the Amul Co-operative is a one man, one boat co- operative. No matter if you are a large supplier or a small supplier, everyone is the same. It is a wonderful testament in how co-operatives can work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell what this side of Parliament, through the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, what we are trying to do is rebuild the co-operative movement in Fiji, ensure that we use it as a vehicle to drive rural development and urban development in terms of economy. At the same time, ensure that our hardworking farmers and fishermen do not get left behind or taken an advantage of by middlemen in the process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will see next year is the international year for co-operatives, the whole year. So, we will be conducting awareness events over the year, starting from January to try and really encourage the co-operative movement and try and make sure that it is a fundamental instruments in terms of what we are trying to achieve on this side of Parliament. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2618 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 Tackling Drug Problems in Fiji HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the menace of drugs is an issue that is now very much in the forefront of our thinking as a nation, as a Government, as Members of Parliament, teachers, health workers, lawyers, magistrates and judges and simply as parents, grandparents and guardians. A few week ago, I had a little chat with Tu Vili in my car, and at the end of our little chat, we came to a gentleman’s agreement - no drugs. As we parted, I asked myself this question, “how can I help Tu Vili stay away from drugs?” I came to this conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that two conditions, if satisfied, will keep Tu Vili away from drugs. First is that Tu Vili simply has the moral courage and integrity to resist the temptation to take or to peddle drugs. The second condition is that there is just no opportunity for Tu Vili to take or peddle drugs. Those two factors that I had just mentioned - temptation and opportunity, make up the formular for fraud. It is temptation, plus opportunity, that equals fraud. When someone is tempted to commit fraud, they will only do so if an opportunity presents itself and conversely when an opportunity to commit fraud presents itself and the person who sees that opportunity, resists the temptation, nothing bad happens. Temptation is personal but opportunity presents itself through the systems and processes that are in place. Mr. Speaker, I have very little to no chance to help build Tu Vili’s character so he can resist temptation; and he has very little to no help at all in this regard. Tu Vili is a child, 15 years old, and lives on the street here in Suva. He lives bravely, I must add, because he has very little other options. He told me his story – raised by his grandmother, never attended school in his whole life. I asked him in iTaukei where he comes from? “O gone ni vei?” He very softly said, “ o au sega ni kila (I do not know).” Mr. Speaker, Tu Vili was seated on a street in Suva asking for money and food at a spot where the cars were driving and turning very dangerously close to where he was sitting. I invited him into my car which he accepted so he can join me and my wife and drive-through and get some food for the three of us. We had our little talanoa session on our way to get food and on our way back to drop him off where I picked him up. Tu Vili is a child in need of care and protection, as defined under Clause 5 of the Child Care and Protection Act that was just passed last night. Mr. Speaker, the funny thing as we parted with Tu Vili that evening, we said our goodbyes, I leaned over and gave him a long Fijian uma, the one pu and tua do on his forehead like I do to my grandchildren. I notice he froze and stood there for a few seconds before he said, “ moce” and then he left. As we were driving home, I told my wife, “ Isa, maybe Tu Vili has never been kissed on the forehead by a grandfather.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I dropped him off, I gave him my MP business card and told him to get someone to ring my number if he needs to speak to me. But I was bothered with this niggling question in my mind, how can an MP like me help Tu Vili stay away from drugs? How can this august House, how can the Legislature help, in support of Government, of course, as they take the lead in this national effort to help protect Tu Vili and our children from the menace of drugs? Coincidentally, last night in this august House, the Legislature, as we passed those two Bills and now into law - the Child Justice Act and Child Care and Protection Act, I told myself, “Yes, we can”. We did help Tu Vili and our children last night. Thank you again to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection and the Government and to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Last night before adjournment, you reminded us of the significance of the work that we had accomplished.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024 End of Week Statements 2619 Let me put another perspective of what happened last night. Last night there were four Bills passed, brought into this House by three women. That is history also. I think all the men on that side owe something to the three women sitting behind them for those four Acts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise for digressing, but I am of the view that we can help by targeting the opportunity side of that equation that I mentioned, and we try and remove as much as we can, the opportunities that are being to bring drugs into this country, and also manufacture illicit drugs within our country. Opportunities are presenting itself in the systems and processes that govern our borders, our ports of entry - both air and seaports, the systems and processes that govern the importation and sale of pharmaceutical drugs and chemicals that are used to manufacture illicit drugs. Overall, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should try as much as we can to reduce the volume of drugs that is in the country, and at the same time, try and stamp the inflow of drugs into the country. We tackle the supply end of the supply and demand chain, because a lot of effort is now being directed towards the demand side. We heard the very inspirational story from the honourable Minister for Justice last night of that family that his showering love to those children and young adults in Nabua, most if not all of them, caught in this web of drug abuse. One of them robbed me, admittedly a few years ago. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can do this via a parliamentary inquiry, an inquiry into the drug problem in Fiji. I think we can be surgical in our inquiry through a very specific and focused terms of reference and find those gaps and loopholes in the systems and processes in the areas, some of which I had mentioned and also look at the laws that needs to be amended to effect the required changes. The findings will be presented to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to the Government and we can progress from there. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that section 129 of the Standing Orders is the enabling clause, I stand to be corrected, there has never been a precedent of an inquiry in this Parliament. The other aspect of tackling this drug problem is deterrent. I will just say that study has shown that it is not the severity of punishment that deters criminal behaviour, rather it is the certainty of punishment and the swiftness of justice that deters. This aspect can also be looked at by this Parliament inquiry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tu Vili Beranavere (that is his full name) and our children need help. Yes, I firmly believe that we in this august House, we can, Legislature can help. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Viliame Naupoto, especially that emotional and heart rendering story. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I first of all, thank the honourable Viliame Naupoto for his End of Week Statement, bringing out to us a real and very serious problem that we are all facing as a nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember when I was in the Opposition, the honourable Tikoduadua had raised the issue of establishing a commission or investigation committee of Parliament to look into the issues and the problems of drugs in the country. I welcome the suggestion that honourable Naupoto has just raised about establishing this drug investigation commission or whatever we will call it, to look into the real issue of drugs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reminded of our responsibilities as leaders; we are national leaders.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2620 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 We study the very simple words of Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, who was looking at Moses trying to organise the Israelites on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land and was having an all day and almost all night sessions trying to run court cases and investigations about who had done what. Jethro said, “Moses, you are not doing that right. You have to organise them into smaller groups - groups of 50, groups of 100, groups of 500 and groups of 1,000 and select men (probably the language now would be “people” or “persons”) who can do that effectively, but select people who are trustworthy, hardworking, fear God and cannot be bribed.” Those were the words from Jethro in the book of Exodus. This is the basically the problem we have in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So many of these things happen because people should be watching, people should be advising, people should be looking after those little groups, even family groups, schools and bigger communities in society - people who can be entrusted with being vigilant in what they do. They have to watch the people and understand the trends of society. As soon as they find out that someone is straying from the boundaries, they would automatically try and find out - where have you been, where are you going, your friends are here, why have you been out, it is late in the night. If the people are vigilant enough and diligent enough, they should be able to nip the problem in the bud as soon as it starts. I do not know what they look like on the streets. The problem with high office is that you get driven here, there and driven home. So, you are not on the streets to see what is happening, what the people are doing. You are very fortunate that you found someone that you could extend a helping towards and help him out. That little uma on his forehead took him time to understand – what was that? Never had any demonstration of love before. So, he must have been thinking, what was that? You said that he was brought up by his grandmother – we must thank grandmothers, widows and mothers who bring up children without the support of a male partner. These are the things that can come up if we establish a special parliamentary committee to look into the problems of drugs and using them. I do not believe that those high up in society in the communities are not involved. When we find a young man with a mobile phone perhaps, and we know that that young man has not been employed, we should be able to go and find out, probably without even asking him, how would he have gotten that mobile phone or other luxury items that people have on the streets now. So, immediately we should have indicators of unexplained wealth or unexplained benefits that people get. We are always hamstrung by the limitations on law enforcements in regards to freedom. People are free, the tell you, “I got it”. You ask, “where did you get it?” The response, “I just got it, I sold something.” Again, you ask, “what did you sell, where did you get what you sold?” Those are the things that perhaps we should be aware of happening right around us. It is a good End of Week Statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I can only promise that we will co-operate to find ways and means of controlling the issue of drugs. When I was talking to the Prime Ministers from Australia and New Zealand, even those Ministers who were here, I am looking at cooperation, border security co-operation. Right now, we are introducing drones and drone operators’ courses to be run here in Fiji, they will be incorporated into our border security operations. We know or we have been suspecting the way the illicit substances have been introduced into Fiji.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>2621 We have a very porous border. So many people can just come in and go out without our even knowing, but once they get into Fiji’s territory, there is very little checks at the outer island airports and ports. Yesterday, the news media asked me, “when did you start putting the canine section’s up?” I said, “I don’t know, it must have been initiated by honourable Tikoduadua.” But if they are out there, that is good then they can control from the point that they have entered, to another point inside the border. How do we find out what is out there coming in? The big catch in Europe destined for Fiji, those are the things that should wake us up. There is a bigger movement out there and we have to look after our people, particularly our young people. Honourable Tikoduadua said that we could become a nation of zombies, people walking around not knowing where they are going, not knowing what they are doing, not even knowing their names. That young man who did not know where he was from, you cannot blame him. He was brought up by his grandmother, probably she did not tell him, “ O iko na gone mai ka.” I asked my caddy one day, “ iko gone ni vei?” He responded, “gone ni Nabua.” I further asked, “ O cei nomu yasana?” He responded, “ Yasana yani I na keba.” Sega cala qori. But that is our responsibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Government will take up this suggestion and we will introduce this body to be run as part of a Committee of Parliament to look into the problem of drugs.</p></body>
