<body><h3>ADJOURNMENT</h3><h4>ADJOURNMENT</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I move: That Parliament adjourns until Monday, 24 th February, 2025 at 10.00 a.m.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that concludes the end of our sitting for this week and this session. I am sure, I speak on behalf of my predecessor His Excellency the President, Turaga Na Tui Cakau and myself in expressing our gratitude to each and every one of you for your contributions throughout this year to the second session of Parliament. For the information of all honourable Members, Monday, 16 th December, 2024 would mark the Prorogation of Parliament. This is not a Sitting day and by tradition Prorogation marks the official conclusion of Parliamentary Session of the year without or within the four years Parliamentary term. The Speaker will notify His Excellency the President of the Prorogation as well as the State Opening of the Parliament. As all honourable Members are aware, His Excellency the President will address the Parliament at the Opening of Parliament. So, once the Parliament is prorogued, Parliamentary business including Parliamentary sittings and Parliamentary Standing Committee proceedings on Bills, Motions and Reports are suspended or ceased until the Opening of the new Parliamentary Session, with the exception of matters that would be deemed urgent and necessary at the discretion of the Speaker. Since this will be our last Sitting for this Session of Parliament, I would like to wish all the honourable Members, all those seated in the gallery and those watching the live proceedings and everyone in Fiji a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous 2025. For myself, it has been my particular honour and privilege to serve you honourable Members and the people of Fiji this week.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>2622</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 I now declare Parliament adjourned until Monday, 24 th February, 2025 at 10.00 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 1.30 p.m.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>i.</p></body>
