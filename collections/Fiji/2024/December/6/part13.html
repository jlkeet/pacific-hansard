<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, I have allowed for the reshuffling of the order for the four Statements today, as follows: (1) Honourable P. K. Bala; (2) Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management; (3) Honourable Assistant Minister for Defence; and (4) Honourable V. Naupoto. Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with a 10-minute response by the honourable Minister responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate. Regularisation of Informal Settlements HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for your understanding on honourable Prime Minister, the matter, and also to my colleague, honourable Naupoto. The honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise today to speak on a critical need to regularise informal settlements, a challenge that has profound implications for our nation’s social and economic development, security and human dignity. Housing is a fundamental human right and as leaders, we are compelled to ensure that every Fijian has access to safe, secure and affordable housing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the urgency of addressing informal settlements is underscored by the scale of the issues. According to estimates, over 200,000 Fijians, roughly 20 percent of our population, live in informal settlements. These communities are open, overcrowded, lack access to clean water, reliable sanitation and basic utilities, and are exposed to high risk of flooding and environmental issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this insecure living environment contributes significantly to poverty levels, which remain at 29.9 percent nationally. With urban poverty, since its rising, informal settlements are also linked to increased rates of crime, drug abuse and social violence. In recent years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, incidences of domestic violence and abuse against women and children have escalated within these communities fuelled by stress, insecurity and lack of basic requirements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not merely a housing issue, it is a national development issue. Informal settlements presents an opportunity to rethink our housing plans and implement innovative, inclusive and sustainable solutions that improve lives and contribute to long term social and economic stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey towards regularising informal settlements is long and full of challenges. Initiatives like the 2014 MOU between the iTaukei Land Trust Board and the Ministry of Local Government, and again renewed in 2019 with the Ministry of Housing, were intended to facilitate development leases, providing 99-year leases and upgrading the settlements with crucial infrastructure. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, progress has been a bit slow. I remember there were 38 development leases issued to the Ministry at that point in time and I believe it has gone up to 40-plus. Many development leases have not been renewed and that leaves the tenants in legal limbo. Funding allocation for infrastructure upgrades are not fully utilised and results on the ground do not reflect the reported progress. Moreover, rising rental costs in some settlements add to hardship for tenants</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2608 End of Week Statements 6 th December, 2024 and unresolved disputes between landowners and tenants under the vakavanua system which continues and creates more instability. Sir, in recent weeks and months, we have been meeting the tenants in some of the informal settlements and this is where all these things have come up. That is why I thought that I will raise this in this House for the Minister responsible to look into. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned earlier on, that after the consultations with the landowning units, development leases were issued after the payment of fare premium for each development lease to the landowning units. The Government allocated funds to carry out the land subdivision with basic infrastructure like sewerage, water, electricity, roads, driveways, footpaths and kerbs and channels. The good thing about this partnership was that the Government will spend funding to develop the landowners’ land and because of that, the landowners will benefit more. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the country’s top valuer is sitting next to me and he will understand when lands are subdivided to according to the standard, definitely the landlords will benefit. This was the understanding at that point in time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had various housing initiatives, like first home buyers grant, town wide informal settlement upgrade programme, squatter settlement upgrade programme, city wide informal settlement upgrade programme, sustainable housing and income generation programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister if he could update us on all of these programmes that I have just mentioned. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was also noted, that many iTaukei landowners tend to earn more if they lease their land for residential purposes rather than giving it out under the traditional v akavanua way. The vakavanua system is really a messy affair, Sir, and tenants are usually at the mercy of the landowners. These are usually desperate and landless people who have no choice but to accept whatever conditions they are given. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to ask the honourable Minister, what is the level of work being done in the informal settlements with active developments in terms of survey plans, topography, survey approvals, approved schemes, EIA, geo-tech, engineering plans, tender stages and the awaiting of contracts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another concern raised by the tenants is whether they will have to pay for the development, and if so, what percentage of the development cost will they need to pay. These are some things coming from the tenants, and I think it is high time we should at least give some hope to these poor Fijians. The Government’s failure to renew expired development leases is a serious issue. I have already raised in this House a case in Ba where the development lease has not been renewed. Tenants have paid iTLTB the premium without having any infrastructure development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite assurance by the honourable Minister for Finance through the tenants that there will be a solution to this matter, the tenants are still waiting, waiting and waiting and have heard nothing from the Government. The way forward requires a comprehensive approach, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address the informal settlement. The Government should work closely with the civil society, landowners and the private sector to generate an innovative housing solution, that not only provides shelter but also creates further sustainable communities. Immediate policy action fast track the renewal of expired development lease to provide tenants with security, implement transparent process to allocate 99 years of lease and conduct audit to determine the status of the infrastructure project in settlements to ensure timely completion. In the 2024-2025 Budget, around $10 million was allocated for the</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>6 th December, 2024 End of Week Statements 2609 informal settlement upgrade. The question is, how much of this allocation had been utilised and what measurable outcomes had been achieved. In August, the honourable Minister gave a statement that three developments namely Cuvu, Ledrusasa and Waidamudamu had been completed. We would like to know, Mr. Speaker Sir, and the tenants also want to know when the proper 99-year lease will be issued. This is bigger than politics, it demands a united effort to fulfil our shared responsibility, to provide dignified housing for all Fijians. Let us take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to turn a crisis into a programme and ensure that no Fijian is left behind. We started this week by congratulating you on your appointment, and today as we are on the verge of finishing this session as this is the last sitting of this year. I take this opportunity to wish you, Sir, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Likewise, I would also like to wish all the honourable Members a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I give the floor to the Minister responsible, given the hour, we will proceed to the necessary suspension motion. For the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
