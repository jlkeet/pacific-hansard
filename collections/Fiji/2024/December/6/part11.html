A. A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order! MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Standing Order 32(3) - Official Report of Proceedings ( Hansard ). Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, 4 th December 2024, (unfortunately the Member is not here), during a response to honourable Jone Usamate, the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry stated that the total amount of 8,000 sugarcane that are left on the farm accumulates to only $80,000. Whether this was deliberate or a mistake, if we calculate 8,000 tonnes by $100, it comes to $800,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member lied to Parliament by trying to portray that only $80,000 was denied, unfortunately, it should be $800,000. I request if the Daily Hansard could be corrected to reflect $800,000. If we read the Daily Hansard, he is asking a question, and I quote: “…8,000 if you multiply by $100, it comes to $80,000, right?” I am correcting him, it is not $80,000, it should be $800,000. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I take your Point of Order. We will refer the matter to the honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I also raise a Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> No, I recognise him now, please. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- In Standing Order 62(1), it states and I quote: “When speaking, a member must not impute improper motives …” The Member used the word “lied”. Using the word ‘lied’, the way he used it, is imputing that he actually lied when the issue is just to correct the Daily Hansard. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member. The use of the word is inappropriate in this Chamber. It is inappropriate in this Chamber, and I would like you to withdraw that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I withdraw the word “lied”.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> In respect of the Point of Order which I have accepted, I have referred the matter for the honourable Minister to come back to Parliament and respond to your Point of Order.</p></body>
