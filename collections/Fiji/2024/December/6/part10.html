<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for this year. I also welcome all of those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on the television and on the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. Visitors - Vusokinawaqa Women’s Club Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the Vusokinawaqa Women’s Club from Nalawa, Ra. Thank you for joining us today and, indeed, welcome to your Parliament. It is my hope that in the near future, some of you will be encouraged to stand for elections so you can represent the people in this august body. Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 For the information of all honourable Members, I have received a request from the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for the Standing Committee to report back to Parliament on the Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 at a later sitting of Parliament. The Standing Committee wishes to undertake further public consultations on the Bill. In that respect I seek your indulgence to allow the Standing Committee for Economic Affairs to report back at a later sitting of Parliament. Is there any opposition? As there being no opposition, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs has the approval to report back to Parliament on the Access to Business Funding</p><h4>Presentation of Papers and Certain Documents</h4><p>6 th December, 2024 Bill 2024 at a later sitting. Upgrade - ICT Infrastructure Finally, on the issue of the ICT glitches experienced in the course of this sitting week, I am to advise, honourable Members, that the ICT infrastructure is currently undergoing its final phase of the setup of the multi-language caption and translation project. In order to test the system and which had to be on a sitting week, there were four platforms operating at the same time that affected the video and audio feed in Chambers. These four platforms are: (1) Real time caption on Audio to Speech Recognition; (2) Testing of the four audio channels and upgrade of parliamentary TV Channel; (3) Streaming of Parliament Sitting on a new internet platform; and (4) Video-on-demand and accessibility through the Parliament website. In light of the implementation of this final phase, my team and I seek your understanding, honourable Members, as we strive to complete this $4.4 million project, which will ensure that our Parliament is more inclusive and transparent for the people of Fiji.</p></body>
