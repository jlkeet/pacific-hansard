<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Compensation for Unharvested Cane (Question No. 263/2024) HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament whether compensation will be provided to cane farmers for the unharvested cane due to the premature closure of the sugar Mills? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will respond to the question raised by honourable Pillay and thank him for his concern for the sugarcane farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all understand the challenges in the Sugarcane Industry, especially the issues faced by the farmers and the sugar industry. In the 2024 season, cane production dropped to 1.33 million tonnes, largely due to the prolonged drought faced by the farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me first explain how the opening and closing of the crushing dates are determined by the Sugar Industry Tribunal. The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) made submission to the Sugar Industry Tribunal for the opening and closing dates of the mill. This is done both on the mill’s operational throughput and estimated crop on the ground. Upon receiving the submission from FSC, the Sugar Industry Tribunal consulted the Sugar Cane Growers Council to determine the dates of the opening and the closing of the mill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon the agreement by the Sugar Cane Growers Council and the FSC, the opening and closing dates are then determined and announced by the Sugar Industry Tribunal as an order in accordance with the Master Award. In most cases, the dates are in favour of the farmers, to ensure they are fully prepared to commence with cane harvesting and the end of harvesting.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>2428</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of this august Parliament, none of the mills closed prematurely in 2024 harvesting season. But all the three extended the crushing length despite having low cane supply. The Lautoka Mill was ordered to terminate crushing on 7 th of October and it closed on 8 th October. So, Rarawai Mill was supposed to stop crushing on 15 th October, it closed on 17 th October. While Labasa may continue crushing until 11 th November, instead of terminating the crushing on 6 th November. Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the farmers are entirely responsible to secure cane cutters both the sugarcane growers and FSC normally go out of their way to mobilise mechanical harvesters, and cane cutters for those farmers that do not have cutters. FSC and Sugar Cane Growers Council have gone to villages as far as the interior of Namosi and Tailevu Provinces, to name a few, to search for cane cutters. Assisted the farmers with transportation to carry cane cutters around and make arrangements for lorries to ensure maximum cane is harvested before the cane crushing. Not only to help Sugar Cane Growers Council and FSC, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Sugar Industry also gets involved each year to assist farmers in the minimal harvesting. The Ministry spending $320,000 on average annually to pay the engaging of inmates to help in the cane harvesting. About 10 cane gangs were assisted annually with an average of 12 to 14 inmates per gang. The inmates are able to harvest over 10,000 tonnes of cane annually. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of the Ministry bares, including the hiring of vehicles, wages and necessary cost for drivers and other utilities while farmers should pay for the harvesting costs. To engage inmates, the Ministry has been signing MOUs with the Fiji Corrections Service each year. We are thankful to both Fiji Corrections Service and Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport who are also involved in the logistics during cane harvesting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years with the support of the Ministry of Sugar, 40 percent of the cane is harvested mechanically, some 100 mechanical harvesters are in use. However, 60 percent of the cane is still manually harvested and the challenge for farmers is securing cane cutters on time, plus a total of 5,402 cane cutters were engaged to manually harvest cane. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be making all efforts to identify harvesters for hilly terrains. However, there is none identified so far that will suit our hilly terrains and soil structure. But I will not stop searching until I find something for manual harvesting farmers. Meanwhile, I sincerely thank our proactive farmers that have gone the extra mile and started redesigning the field structure to allow current harvesters for harvest at least up to 15 degrees terrain. This way we can increase mechanically harvested cane. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, more than enough time was given to farmers to harvest their cane and enough support is provided by the stakeholders. The mill operation could not extend any longer as FSC was bearing very heavy operational costs with start stop of the factories. This is no compensation as such that can be given to farmers for the left-over cane. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total stand over cane for this year is only 8,000 tonnes. As compared to last year, it was 28,000 tonnes. This was a significant decline in stand over cane. This is also possible due to the favourable cane price where farmers made all efforts to harvest their cane. I want to see the continuation of the same spirit of the farmers, Sugar Cane Growers Council and FSC to take the industry to another level. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on one side the Ministry of Sugar encourages farmers to plant more sugarcane and the assurance in this Parliament given by the honourable Minister, that all cane will be harvested and the early closure has left a lot of farms where the cane is still standing.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2429 Can the honourable Minister provide details on the extent of the impact caused by the early closure of the cane mills, on the farmers and on the sugar industry as a whole? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned that there are only 8,000 tonnes of cane standover, as compared to 28,000 last year. We were trying to extend the mill crushing, but FSC’s reasons are that it is very expensive to run sugar mills and therefore with the consultation of the tribunal they had ceased the operations. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- My supplementary question is in his response, honourable Minister for Sugar stated that there was a significant decline in the tonnes of sugarcane produce this year. Previously, if there was a decline, Government was blamed. This time around he is blaming drought season. Can the honourable Minister explain his failure as to why there was a decline in the sugarcane production?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Maharaj… HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Tell them! HON. C. J. SINGH.- …should read magazines and gazettes. The total decline of sugar throughout the world, yes! The decline is purely because of drought. It is God’s creation. It is not my creation. (Laughter) HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the honourable Minister, has confirmed that due to drought there was a decline. So, there can be any consideration in giving assistance to the farmers because of the drought, because they are suffered. Thank you. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we have put 18 different programmes for the farmers and we are asking the farmers to come forward and take advantage of this so that we can increase the production next year. HON. J. USAMATE.- I am glad, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister said that he will help the farmers. Will the assistance to the farmers cover the amount of money that they would have got if all those 8,000 tonnes were actually harvested? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think if you look at the trend of the last 16 years of the last Government, there has always been a stand-over. And so, at least we have improved from 28,000. I am answering! What was the question by the way? Oh, compensation? Well, 8,000 if you multiply by $100 it comes to $80,000, right? And, of course, I think the farmers have understood that we have tried our best and when the season starts next year, they will be the first ones to get their cane harvested. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to withdraw from asking Question 284/2024. The reason being this matter was thoroughly discussed by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection yesterday when responding to Question No. 273/2024.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>2430</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I am sorry because I got distracted by one of the honourable Members here and the yellow card is going to come out in a minute. (Question No. 284/2024 withdrawn) Update on Outsourcing Passport Services (Question No. 285/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji Police Force update Parliament on the status of outsourcing passport services for our overseas diaspora in New Zealand and Australia? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to that question. I start by saying that on February 14 th this year, Cabinet had approved the outsourcing overseas passport services to enhance efficiency through a professional service provider. The outsourcing of immigration administrative services will be implemented through pilot projects in two countries in Australia first, with Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney and another in Fiji, in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this initiative is to enhance our services to our Fijian diaspora communities in selected locations, and Fijians, particularly relatives who want to join their families who are abroad on those work programmes. Therefore, we will be piloting this project in Australia and Fiji. The initiative will eliminate the need to travel all the way to Canberra or to Sydney for our Fijians in Australia undertaking passport biometrics which will significantly reduce travel and accommodation costs. Passports can be lodged or collected at enrolment centres in Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth, or mailed directly to the applicant’s home on completion of processing. Upon successful completion of phase one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, passport administrative services will also be outsourced to the United Kingdom to provide us the service providers in United States, New Zealand and Canada and other regions. Cabinet decision of Cabinet Paper No. 46 of 2024 stipulates that any necessary legislative changes for outsourcing, including fee adjustments, will be finalised with the Office of the Solicitor-General and presented to Cabinet for a review. I solicited and received some responses from our diplomats abroad and also our overseas missions. The Department of Fiji Immigration, Sir, had been advised by the Office of the Solicitor- General to seek public consultation on appropriate administrative fees for passport services through written submission and will also conduct a comparative analysis of other countries services costs. Public consultations were conducted through notices in the print media, inviting feedback from individuals, groups and communities. The notice was also shared on the Fiji High Commission website for responses from Fijian diaspora in Australia. The local community had four weeks to respond, while the diaspora had two weeks. The newly proposed administrative fee structure for Australia and Fiji will be presented at the upcoming Cabinet meeting for a decision. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me elaborate briefly on the security measures that the Department of Immigration will be adopting through the new initiative. The outsourcing process incorporates robust security protocols to maintain the integrity of passport issuance in all the sites. We had an unfortunate note from the United States warning Fiji of our status in the record of world countries on the issue of</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2431 the subject of people trafficking. We are pretty low on the scale, but if we do not look after our processes well, we could drop to Tier 3. (1) Biometric authentication - applicants provide biometric data, fingerprints, photos, et cetera, to verify their identity to minimising the risk of fraud. (2) Encryption and secured transmission - all personal data is encrypted and securely transmitted to Government systems preventing unauthorised access or alterations. (3) Rigorous vetting processes - third party entities handle administrative tasks only. The department will make the final approval, ensuring all applications meet legal and security standards. (4) Regular audits and monitoring - continuous monitoring, random audits and compliance checks ensure adherence to strict security protocols. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the honourable Members may be wondering how much this new initiative will cost the Government. The outsourcing arrangement is cost neutral for the Government, with all expenses covered by the applicants through a fee structure. Processing fee, applicants pay approximately AU$144, plus 10 percent GST, covering the operational costs of the third-party provider. No direct Government expenditure, since the applicants bear the costs, the Government incurs no additional expenses ensuring efficient use of resources. The outsourcing model, Mr. Speaker, Sir, enhances cost efficiency and service quality through the following: (1) Reduce processing times - applications can be processed in an as little as three days compared to the previous five days standard. (2) Resource optimisation - administered tasks delegated to third party entity allowing immigration officers to focus on critical decision making and complex cases. (3) Enhance accessibility - the global reach of the third party provider ensures broader (4) access, benefitting customers in rural and remote areas. Improve customer experience - automation and centralisation of streamline processes, delivering faster and smoother services. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this approach aligns with international trends in modernising immigration services through technology and centralised processing. The cost-neutral framework enables the Government to maintain high service levels without additional financial strain, ensuring long term sustainability. The outsourcing model strengthens security, enhances efficiency and delivers cost effective services while maintaining the integrity of immigration process and avoiding additional costs for Government. MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration for his response. Before I open the floor for supplementary questions, honourable Members, please join me in welcoming in the gallery, the students and teachers of Wainiyavu Primary School in Namosi. (Acclamation) Bula vinaka! You are most welcome to your Parliament and observe its proceedings. Now,</p><h4>shall we move on to supplementary questions. I recognise the honourable Leader of Opposition.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Honourable Prime Minister, it is a good initiative, but it comes with a lot of risks as well and you have highlighted about the security aspects. My question to the honourable Prime Minister, Sir, this is the experience of most countries that are into these online applications, it is the involvement of the agents in the process. We know that biometrics is critical so</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>2432</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 that the applicants can go through the thorough scrutiny process but one of the key issues that I have collected from most of the countries using this, is the involvement of agents. So, how is this being considered, given the path that we want to undertake? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process that we have put in place will include scrutinising of the various types and the agents that are going to be employed. We have to be very careful, will be guided by our agents on the ground and also the government and service providers left vetting approvals from them. Investigation of Reckless Driving Posted on Social Media (Question No. 286/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji Police Force inform Parliament whether the Police investigates cases of reckless and dangerous driving posted on social media? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Pio Tikoduadua had seen the</p><h4>Order Paper and realised that there were three questions coming up and asked to stand aside.</h4><p>(Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by honourable Naupoto. I will begin by addressing the legal framework that emphasised this matter. Reckless and dangerous driving is not merely a traffic violation, it is a grave concern and endangers the lives of our road users. The issue is governed under our local traffic laws, especially the Land Transport Authority laws, Crimes Act of 2009 which provide the robust legal framework for addressing such behaviour. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there is an increasing recognition of social media to expose illegal activities, including traffic offences globally, we must acknowledge the reality of our context here in Fiji. Sir, our law enforcement systems are steadfast and committed, they are not as institutionalised or technologically advanced as those larger nations when it comes to social media users in illegal activities exposure. That, however, is not a reflection of neglect but of unique challenges that we face as a small island developing nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me make one point clear, our law enforcement agencies, including the Fiji Police Force and Land Transport Authority do not turn a blind eye to such matters. On the contrary, they remain vigilant and are determined to uphold the rule law. What differentiates us is not our commitment, but rather the merits and the processes through which investigations are carried out. The Fiji Police Force only investigates reported cases. Therefore, any case of reckless and dangerous driving posted on social media will only be investigated if it is reported by a member of the public to the police force. For instance, the use of social media as evidence in reckless driving cases is a growing area of focus. Videos or images posted online often provide valuable leads and our police do monitor such platforms. However, investigations in Fiji require a careful and thorough approach to ensure that any evidence used in court meets legal standards of authenticity, reliability and relevance.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2433 For investigations to commence, there needs to be a complainant who should lodge an official complaint and the following needs to be established: the date of the offence, time of the offence, place of the offence, witness or witnesses and video footages. Once those are established, an investigation is carried out whereby the alleged suspect is arrested and brought to the police station, charged and summoned to attend court. The court requires evidence and police are obligated to get those and have the responsibility to ensure that a thorough investigation is carried out, and concrete evidence is established for charging and producing anyone in the court of law. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is true that countries such as the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada and Australia actively investigate cases on reckless and dangerous driving when evidence is posted on social media, even with their advanced resources, any information technology, personnel and technological infrastructure, they continue to grapple the significant challenges including: (1) determining authenticity of whether the footages are genuine and unedited; (2) establishing the context of when and where the incident occurred; and (3) providing or proving the identity of the individuals responsible for the act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these examples highlight that no system is without its difficulties, and this is a shared challenge amongst nations globally. However, what sets successful enforcement apart is the active collaboration between the authority and the public. With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge all Fijians to work hand in hand with our law enforcement agencies. If you witness acts of reckless driving, do not just put them on social media, report promptly through the appropriate channels. Together, we can ensure safer roads and hold those who would endanger others accountable for their actions. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Thank you honourable Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can note that $34.85 million has been paid by ACCF in all these number of years and majority of them were motor vehicle payout accidents. A question to the honourable Prime Minister, there was a recent video circulated of a young boy driving a car with his hands off the wheel and had a girl sitting on his lap and if anything has been done by the police in this incident - licence suspended? The second part to that honourable Prime Minister is a suggestion, where we can use the population to work for us in combating road accidents with the latest victim of being a 16-year-old, and the suggestion is if a department within LTA or the police can be set up, people who have dashcams report illegal driving, dangerous driving directly to LTA and they who do, get incentivised because they feel that they can be part of something and then these are taken up and the LTA and the police can look into these matters of reckless driving. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we lost a 16-year-old boy on our roads recently, so just the two parts of the question, honourable Prime Minister. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the immediate past, the honourable Minister responsible for Police has assured me that the report has been made to the Police and they are investigating. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to reckless driving, we do not appreciate drivers driving irresponsibly on our roads, but there has been some cases where the police while investigating these matters, they are harassing every single car enthusiast on our roads, especially along Nasese and My Suva Park. I raised this a lot of times, but can you assure us and the people</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>2434</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 who are watching that the police will not harass every single driver on the road with respect to reckless driving. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Lal, I rule that question out of order. It is not an observation to a subject matter under consideration. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also thank the honourable Prime Minister for his comprehensive answers. However, what we were expecting to hear, the Department needs to make a policy change so that what the honourable Sharma had just mentioned about dashcams and also where we can use live video to victimise or charge the complainant. Is the department thinking of changing the policy on such matters? MR. SPEAKER.- They wish clarification, honourable Prime Minister. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not quite technically up-to-date as you are with gadgets that people put to their cars but yes. Whatever is brought to the Police, they will investigate and use those in the collaboration of evidence and building up of the case before they go to Prosecution. MR. SPEAKER.- We are drawing closer to the end of sitting period this afternoon and for the purpose of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
