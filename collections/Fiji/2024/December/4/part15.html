The Parliament adjourned at 4.04 p.m.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2435 The Parliament resumed at 4.41 p.m. Update on Co-operative Development Grant (Question No. 287/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the new Co-operative Development Grant that was approved in this financial year? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for his question. The co-operative movement and its role as a vital driver of economic empowerment in rural communities is without question. The establishment of the grant this year, Mr. Speaker, is a significant forward in trying to push the co-operative movement and encourage wider participation, which I am pleased to say has started happening. As I mentioned a few days ago that I did return from India and the visit was primarily driven to attend the Global Launch of the International Year of Cooperatives of 2025, which was launched by the honourable Prime Minister of India. In that opportunity I saw some really good models of cooperatives, which is, if anything, reinforced both the determination and drive of the Ministry to ensure that cooperatives become a central part of the People's Coalition's drive to empower and grow the rural economy. The Co-operative Development Fund (CDF) grant was essentially conceived out of the belief that cooperatives has a very important role to play in our economy. Essentially the structure is, there is a maximum contribution of $100,000 that can be made out of the grants and it is flexible because it does have a one-third great contribution which is assessed by an independent committee that evaluates the grant. So, it can work on a one -third, two-thirds basis but also there is an opportunity for straight out grants as well. Because it has been a new grant, so far, the advertisement is still out and we will be starting processing applications soon, but happy to report that out a half a million dollar allocation from this year’s budget, there are already 316,000 applications received so far from various sectors such as ecotourism, wholesale retail, agriculture, catering businesses and fishing. The grant is essentially targeted at acquiring assets, in other words, assisting cooperatives in funding capital injections or equity. Some of the areas that are being required are solar freezers, tractors, solar panels, solar driers, oven, bakery equipment, boat and engines and other things. Sir, 19 applications have been received so far, three applications have been from women cooperatives and one from a youth group. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just based on that information, we have not really turned half a year yet, it probably indicates there is a pent-up demand for support to the cooperatives. So, I suspect we will probably finish this financial year with a large request and, hopefully, that can justify further contributions. In essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from what we can see, the grant is taking up a lot of interest and we hope to continue to push forward and use it as a genuine vehicle to transition people out of poverty into prosperity and ensure that everyone in the rural economy starts to participate meaningfully as we move forward as a country.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>2436</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 Outcomes of Consultation - Fiji’s Cannabis Industry (Question No. 288/2024) HON. R. R. SHARMA asked Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on the outcomes of the consultations and feasibility study that was conducted for the establishment of Fiji’s cannabis industry? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. The decision to develop or establish medicinal cannabis industry in this country for export purposes only, I have to emphasise, is driven really out of a desire to broaden the economy of Fiji in a genuine way. With the rapid growth of the medicinal cannabis industry globally, there is a view that Fiji has the potential or the ability to participate in this growing industry and create a very dynamic ecosystem that can support jobs, create agriculture and manufacturing. One of the things that attracted me as well was the ability to do a lot more research in this area and hopefully create more expertise in terms of research, not only in medicinal cannabis, but also alternative medicines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the approval by Cabinet on 29 th August last year, to proceed with the development of the industry, we established a medicinal taskforce, which is a multiagency taskforce with about 12 Government agencies, which has been meeting regularly up till recently. We obtained approval from Cabinet in the timeframe on the policy regarding medicinal cannabis. There were consultations conducted nationwide and in the communities. We have conducted a feasibility study as well during that time. Essentially, what is left at the moment, is the development of the legislation. Just as a way of brief, the nationwide consultation was held from 9 th October, 2024 to 28 th November, 2024. Of course, it involved nationwide consultation with members of the public, civil society, other stakeholders were invited, and consultations were held in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. In partnership as well, we worked in tandem with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts and we also conducted quite a few village community consultations as we value the people’s voices broadly, particularly in the rural and maritime areas. A total of 17 nationwide and community consultations were conducted. The Ministry registered about 500 participants in all, out of which 75 percent of participants supported the legalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes only. I wish to also highlight that majority of the participants were actually male farmers between the ages of 36 years and 45 years, who voiced the importance of local participation. There is also strong support that we could actually have an ability to drive the overall economy as well. Since then, in terms of the feasibility study, we managed to get support from a donor partner, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to get that going. Right now, there is work being carried out on the legislation with another donor partner, and we look forward to completing that work, even though at the moment, the logistics and timing in terms of trying to review the legislation is proving to be a bit more of a challenge, but we will push through and try and complete the legislation so that we can table it in the House sometimes next year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we feel that the industry has some good potential in Fiji. We do accept that there is some risks through product pilferage or theft and the danger of entering the illicit market, but given the way that the medicinal cannabis is actually governed or farmed in countries like Australia,</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2437 security and production measures are very important. Certainly, as the legislation gets finalised, we will ensure that there are adequate standard operating procedures and security guidelines in place to safeguard that particular concern which is quite understandable. I wish to also reassure the House that upon completion of the Bill, it will go through comprehensive consultation, because it is important that the medicinal cannabis Bill gets thorough scrutiny and hopefully after that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be able to have another new industry in Fiji which will not only increase export and employment but will also generate a level of expertise in the country which is probably needed in terms of research and development and, of course, create jobs for our people. Thank you. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. In light of what you were telling us about the consultations and the feasibility study being very thorough and comprehensive, and in terms of the legislation that is going to be there, is all of that currently centred around it being export specific or are we looking at import also? I ask this question, on behalf of a lot of cancer patients and people who suffer from epilepsy, where it is a well-known fact that this medicinal cannabis works on them and whether our doctors are able to prescribe it now as it is something that really helps them. So, when you are doing the legislation, are you also looking at prior to the industry being set up because I know it takes a while to get it done? Will it be just exports specific or are you looking at legislation that will allow for our medical practitioners here to be able to dispense this and our pharmacists to import it for the time being? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, in consultation, of course, with the Ministry of Health, the advice has been to just focus on export only. The level of details required to even consider importing it into Fiji for use in Fiji at the moment is probably premature and certainly, we have taken the advice from the Ministry of Health and right now, it is focussed on export. May be at some point in the future, we can look at it but I think at the moment, the focus or the authorisation is purely for export only. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, because the honourable Minister said that it is going to be export specific, at the end of the day when you do the legislation, will it be restricted in terms of our own product available in our pharmacies for our doctors to prescribe? Will that be the case? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the question. Like I have said, the advice from the health professionals is that at the moment, they can accommodate export only, but in terms of administering in Fiji, it is a very long process and not advisable at the moment. Strategies for Accessing Public Transportation – Disabled Persons (Question No. 289/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection update Parliament on whether there are strategies in place to address the concerns of people living with disability with regards to accessing public transportation such as buses, boats and airplanes? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very timely question since we are celebrating the week of International Day for People Living in Disabilities.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2438</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, I wish to just start off by acknowledging and thanking Shore Buses, as well as K. R. Latchan Buses, and one more bus company in Labasa - Dalip Buses, for providing reserved seats for people with disabilities on their buses. I thank the initiative, however, I do ask the bus companies, in order to allow that accessibility, to make their buses wheelchair accessible with ramps or even gentle inclines on their stairs. Mr. Speaker, I just want to very briefly just highlight the national structure in place for disability. In 2018, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act commenced. Then the Auditor- General tabled a report in 2020 on the performance audit on the access for persons with disabilities on public transport. This document highlighted, Mr. Speaker, that there is a knowledge gap that is in the public service, as well as the public at large, to be able to adhere to the Act. We have had sessions with the organisations for persons with disabilities, to get their feedback on dealing with disability. An issue that was not highlighted in the Auditor-General’s Report is that persons with disabilities that use mobility devices often have to rely on other modes of public transport, and not buses, due to the issue of inaccessibility. Mr. Speaker, the Coalition Government, as soon as we came to Government, we did a review of the bus fare vouchers that were available to people with disabilities and, of course, it was very impractical and also was not being able to be used by those people with disabilities who live in areas that had no bus services, including maritime and rural areas. So, the Coalition Government converted the bus fare top up into cash, and that is an ongoing process. We have just announced in the budget this year for those elderly who are over 70 years due to frailty to be able to use that transport assistance. But for all people living with disabilities, they should be receiving cash now instead bus fare voucher. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work is ongoing. We have district disability committees that are chaired by the relevant Provincial Administrators and District Officers about making public transport accessible. Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of airports, especially when we go to the Nadi Airport, we see it is more disability accessible, and this has been the feedback also from our regional organisations with people with disabilities finding out that Nadi Airport is very accessible to people living with disabilities. Of course, this will need to be standardised across the country and in other airports as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need to revise the building code, that needs to be finalised and is still in the process so that there are minimum standards for accessibility. So, we still have our buildings, restaurants and businesses that are still not wheelchair accessible or easily accessible with our people living with disabilities. Just to conclude, we have the Fiji National Policy on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities currently being drafted. This is also under the Coalition Government. We are currently working on this Policy to submit to Cabinet. I had just gone through a lot of consultations and an issue that was raised as part of the submission to the Draft Disability Policy is to, perhaps, explore having a separate department for disabilities under the Ministry as well so that their needs are catered too. I think that was something I had mentioned in the past that, perhaps, because of the number of people living with disabilities in our country which is close now to about 145,000 people in Fiji who are living with some form of disability and not just disability from birth, but due to accidents as well as people living with NCDs, we have an increased number of people who are using wheelchairs</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2439 now or unable to move around using walking sticks and crutches. So, we need to, of course, ensure that as we move forward, Mr. Speaker, that we are mindful of this statistic. At the moment, our disability allowance is really for those who have been disabled from birth or some extreme form of disability, but increasingly, the members of the public are submitting their medical certificates to certify some form of illness that affects their ability to work, to be productive or to move around. So, they are also seeking disability allowance. This is something that we will need to consider in the next budget in terms of the numbers that are coming through. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just an effort for Government alone so, please, do not wait for Government. I appeal to our restaurant owners, business owners, building owners and the private sector, please, we need to start putting wheelchair accessible ramps, footpaths, as well as disability parking spaces that are monitored to ensure that those who are not disabled are not using those parking spaces. In addition, disability accessible public conveniences, Mr. Speaker, Sir, button- operated doors on all our buildings, as well as elevators. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have raised this in the past, also for your good office to consider, that even the entrance of our Parliament building needs wheelchair accessible ramps so that when our people living with disabilities come through the front of our house, they can access our house as well. There is an elevator, but they are told to go around to the back, and it is usually very crowded and hard for them to access the back entrance to use the elevators. Sometimes, it does not work and often when it rains, it is very difficult for them to get off from the vehicles to wheel themselves to the elevator, so for your consideration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is something for Parliament to consider. Certainly, there is space in the front of the building to do that as well. On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to thank all honourable Members to continue to encourage the community to work with Government to really look out for our people with disabilities. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the response. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament if there is any plan in place to address the concern of students with disabilities in mainstream schools with regards to providing appropriate transport to students with disabilities in mainstream schools? As far as special schools are concerned, 17 special schools have got special bus for students with disabilities, so are there any plans for students who are in mainstream schools? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for the question, in fact in my visit to Levuka, the Norah Frazer Special School, they were making efforts to send their children to mainstream schools, and that was one of the greatest concerns, was the lack of transportation from their location to be able to get to the mainstream schools. Right now, of course, our special schools have transportation, but it is something that we continue to collaborate with the Ministry of Education in terms of providing transport for our children living with disabilities. But it addresses the greater concern, I think in terms of the fact that school buses for schools in general that used to be provided for in the past for schools are not there anymore, so children are having to travel to the bus stands in order to head home. But this is something we continue to appeal that working with the Ministry of Education to consider bringing school buses back and perhaps with that, we will be able to make our submissions to have those buses available also for our students living with disabilities in mainstream schools. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Thank you honourable Minister for stating that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not just a matter for someone being disabled and not being able to access, but a matter of our senior citizens as well. If someone has to get on to a bus, the first step they take is quite a big leap, that has</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>2440</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 been a concern. While I commend the buses and the transportation that have provided disability friendly seats, the question to the honourable Minister, is your Ministry considering some sort of concession or duty free on the importations of transports, buses and even taxis and vans that are disable friendly, that have ramps that is quite automated and widely done overseas? Is your Ministry considering this, this will encourage more, I guess for every private company and industry. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- I believe that the duty free concessions are already there, especially for hospital beds but it is certainly something that can be extended to transportation as well. This was an issue raised by the bus owners themselves in order to bring in the buses to be disability friendly, but it would be a natural follow up to the provision of those reserved seats on the bus. This is something that we will consider in the next budget. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is slightly related to the last one. Honourable Minister, because our public transport system is entirely sector driven and run. Would you be looking at some legislative changes so that there is a degree of compulsion here on in, from new vehicles that are coming in so that there are disability friendly, and I am talking about buses that are now available worldwide or are fitted with systems where people on wheelchairs can actually get onto the bus and obviously it is packaged up with what was spoken about earlier regarding concessions et cetera. But are we looking at some degree of compulsion on our public service vehicles for a later stage? Because, as you say, the numbers are great. HON. L. D TABUYA.- There certainly is, yes, we review as part of the Audit Report, which did not include the number of people living with disabilities in our country that do not necessarily fall under that Social Welfare Scheme. As we continue looking at that, I think the need to also look at the transport providers to have some quota in terms of the vehicles they bring in. That will be something for the Ministry of Transport to consider, as well as apparently they are reviewing that, so that is something you can answer. It is a very good suggestion to go along with what honourable Sharma suggested. MR. SPEAKER.- We now move on to the eighth Oral Question for today. However, with the concurrence of the honourable Koya, he has allowed Question 290/2024 to be asked tomorrow as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation is set to attend an important Ministerial engagement this afternoon. (Question No. 290/2024 deferred) Strategies Adopted for Strengthening Revenue Streams (Question No. 291/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Local Government and Housing inform Parliament on the strategies adopted by the Municipal Councils to strengthen their revenue streams and institutional strengthening? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question before the august Parliament this afternoon and I thank honourable Tubuna for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary income driver for all Municipal Councils is through the collection of rates. On average rates constitute around 50 percent to 60 percent of the revenue for small councils and 45 percent to 55 percent for medium to large councils. However, the sustainability</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2441 of council operations remains a challenge. As many councils struggle to balance service delivery with financial independence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the challenges the Ministry continues to challenge and encourage the newly appointed Administrators to adopt sustainable operation practices and be more commercially focussed. To address this, innovative strategies have been identified by some councils, particularly small to medium sized ones, to broader their revenue streams and strengthen their financial positions. These efforts reflect the commitment to reducing relying on Government Grants and ensuring councils can meet the needs of their communities effectively, and also efficiently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the removal of business licence fees in 2020 by the previous Government exacerbated the revenue stream capacity of the councils, and small and medium councils had to rely on Government Grant to fund the capital as well as appraisal expenditure and revenue forfeited by councils was around $4.3 million annually. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the councils are now adopting creative approaches to improve sustainability and above is reflected in the increase in revenue in the financial year of 2023 to 2024 by $500,000 across all municipalities and this will continue to improve. Revise fees and charges for markets, garbage fees and public convenience had been adjusted for some Councils, ensuring an immediate boost to revenue streams. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Eight Councils have installed new digital parking metres that will boost the income level. Some have even gone to extent of creating new parking spaces. Also, a boost to their car parking revenue and also some even invested in automated car parking payment systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, property evaluations have also unlocked additional rental income, which optimised asset utilisation and provided a stronger financial for councils. Small councils as Levuka and Sigatoka has maximised their properties for rental purposes including hiring out conference rooms to generate steady income. There are also some strategic investments for some medium size councils, for example, the Nakasi Market, it just opened this year to generate an income $282,000 for the Nausori Town Council. Similarly, for the newly opened Levuka markets is going to generate close to $140,000 in annual revenue from 132 trading stalls in the new market. Also, for the Lautoka City Council with the newly opened Namoli Flea Market, generates an annual income of around $71,000. For Sigatoka Town Council with the opening of the amphitheatre, the sitting capacity of 150 to 200 people to generate $6,000 annually when they promote local events within Sigatoka Town Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, institutional strengthening is the foundation for efficient functioning of municipal councils and the Ministry has reviewed out-dated policies and introduced new financial and human resources manuals to enhance Government standards. Regular financial reporting, stakeholder consultations and detailed performance reviews ensure transparency and accountability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, KPMG Advisory Fiji Limited has been engaged to oversee the recruitment of Chief Executive Officers for all the municipal councils. This transparent process is expected to conclude by early 2025, ensuring that councils are led by competent and forward-thinking leaders. To maintain council's capability in achieving their development objectives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, training programs, clear job descriptions and performance evaluation systems ensure staff are well equipped to meet operational and strategic objectives. The Councils have also introduced programs to develop leadership skills, improve technical expertise, and foster a culture of excellence among their teams.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>2442</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strategies adopted by all the councils across the country, 13 of them altogether, to strengthen revenue streams and institutional capacity, demonstrated proactive and sustainable approach to local governance. These measures reflect commitment to financial independence, operational, efficiency and community driven development. We have continued collaboration between the Ministry, councils and local communities. These initiatives will enable councils to deliver high quality services, foster economic growth and create vibrant and more resilient urban centres. Measures to Curb Police Brutality on Suspects (Question No. 292/2024) HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: With the rise in incidents of police brutality against suspects, can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji Police Force inform Parliament on the measures the Fiji Police Force is implementing to curb these acts? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Shalend Kumar for his question. I would like to start with some statistics on police brutality: (1) 2019 - one case; (2) 2020 - 26 cases; (3) 2021- one case; (4) 2022 - eight cases; (5) 2023 - no case; and (6) 2024 - January to October, three cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the police have a very difficult job. I have had about eight nights with the police being investigated at the CID Headquarters in Toorak. I was not subjected to any brutal treatment. But one night, we had to spend a night in the cell. I had the luxury of having one cell to myself in Raiwaqa, and since then, my grandchildren and great grandchildren call Raiwaqa Police Station, the VIP room when we drive pass. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the late Doctor Tupeni Baba and Attar Singh shared one cell at the Central Police Station, the same night. I say that the police have a very difficult job because, I was on the floor, you do not get any mattress or pillows or anything, you are on the floor and you are trying to roll up into a small, if you can make yourself to be, for some warmth, when another suspect was brought into the next cell. He was probably a more experienced suspect because he just started calling out and banging the cell door and telling the police, “I know my right! I want my lawyer!” All night he was doing that. The police came out to him and asked him, “Look, other suspects are trying to sleep, why do you not try to go to sleep too?” They were very patient with him. So, I have not had any experience, although I spent a night there. The cell has now been promoted to be the VIP room by my grandchildren and great grandchildren. The Police Force has implemented several measures to address and curb incidences of police brutality. Responding to increasing public concern and calls for accountability, the police have their own internal system to investigate any allegations of brutality. Some of the key strategies that have been implemented by the police to address brutality are as follows:</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2443 (1) Restoration of the Police Blue Culture The Blue culture, introduced by the honourable Tikodudua, is the Standard Operating Procedure and culture of policing. It refers to the principles and values that governs the police relationship with the people, rooted into the model Salus Populi, which underlines the safety of the people committing to serving the public with integrity and accountability. In hindsight the most recent past political influence and interferences at the aftermath of the coup culture, it has the grotesquely distorted the role of policing and addressing police is an integral part of that concept. At present, there is an onward assertion towards aligning the Police Force to the blue culture. (2) Use of Force Policy The Fiji Police force has reviewed its use of force policy and has begun the process of enlightening and instilling legally accepted techniques of using appropriate force to corresponding situations. The New Zealand Tactical Response Team from the Officer’s Safety Pacific is currently in the country, training and assisting the Fiji Police in implementing the legal procedure of using force. The programme will encompass training throughout Fiji. (3) Training, Education and Awareness The Fiji Police Force by virtue of the request from Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission is utilising various available assemblies and platforms in its daily programme to inculcate comprehensive human rights training and awareness for all police officers. This training is now integrated in the new professional approach where police officers are to exercise using restraint, de-escalation techniques and respect for human dignity during interactions with the public. Very importantly, this is to ensure that the police officers are adorned with the appropriate skills to handle situations without resorting to violence. (4) Community Engagement and Policing The initiative by the Fiji Police Force in restoring public trust has engendered encouragement by the Fiji Police during Community Policing Programmes for citizens to report crimes and instances of police misconduct. (5) Accountability and Investigation A thorough investigation by the Internal Affairs Division (that is the internal organisation I was talking about) on any case of police brutality. Serious cases shall be referred to the Criminal Investigations Department for further action. The investigation files would be submitted to Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for an independent legal advice. The Commissioner had reassured the public that police officers found guilty of misconduct, would face legal consequences, reinforcing the message that police brutality is a crime that will not be tolerated. (6) Counselling The Fiji Police Force has a full-time psychologist who conducts visitation and counselling to all members of the Fiji Police Force who have been identified to be at risk or have been implicated for the unnecessary use of force. This is done to deter officers from further incidences of the use of force. (7) First Hour Procedure The first hour procedure protects police investigations from allegations of torture and ensures transparency and accountability. It provides clear guidelines for all police officers</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>2444</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 to ensure that all arrested persons have access to legal aid. (8) Strict Supervision Supervisors monitor the performance of their men and ensures accountability of the men and women under their command in conducting briefing and debriefing daily. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a simple question to the honourable Prime Minister. One of the key contributing factors to police brutality is job related stress, you have talked about the use of psychologists, what else is the Fiji Police Force using in order to address this issue? Job related stress, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I beg your pardon, honourable Leader of the Opposition? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- The question is that one of the key contributing factors to police brutality is job related stress, and you have mentioned about the use of psychologists, what else is the Fiji Police Force using to address this issue? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker. Sir, the police officers have to defend themselves and there were times when they will have to use minimum force, as you understand it honourable Leader of the Opposition, to ensure their own safety and ensure they carry out their responsibility of taking the suspect to where he was supposed to be taken. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his comments. I am just wondering especially in cases where there is a high likelihood for violence between, say, a member of the public and the police. Is there any thought of the police to actually use the body cameras to capture the moment of what happens in that particular interaction. I know it is an expensive exercise, but sometimes when you have that body camera, it will stop you from throwing that left hook or the right uppercut. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- I am just catching up with the job. I believe there are moves in that direction but one thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we lack the civic spirit in Fiji. Very few of us would go and assist the police officer execute an arrest. (Question No. 293/2024 deferred) Written Question Statistical Data on Tourism Projects (Question No. 294/2024) HON. L. S.
