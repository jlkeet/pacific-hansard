<body><h3>FIJI TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION BILL  2024</h3><p>FIJI TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION BILL 2024 HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 2 nd December, 2024, I move: That the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 be debated, voted upon and do pass.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I beg to second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on this Bill which is before Parliament for debate, voting and passing pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 2 nd December, 2024. At the outset, may I express my thanks and appreciation to honourable Members from both sides of the House who supported the motion to bring this Bill, being the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Bill 2024 to the stage. I would also like to thank the Steering Committee which was set up to undertake the preparatory work pertaining to this Bill.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2447 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee comprised the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection as Chair, and members being the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs and the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management. On the compilation of the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in drafting the Bill, the Committee had many consultations with victims and perpetrators of different political events. Consultations were held with civil society, faith-based groups, human rights activists, media organisations, political parties and communities in the Northern, Western and Central Divisions. There were also engagements with the youth groups, as well as the diaspora through digital platform. The basic elements of the Bill are drawn from the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1946, and the Committee also learned from global experiences. I would also like to acknowledge with deep appreciation the excellent work which the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, under the visionary leadership of the Commander, Major General Ro Jone Kalouniwai, had done and they have done in inculcating the virtues of truth, reconciliation and healing in the institution. As a result, we are seeing and feeling an atmosphere of togetherness, perseverance and hope, which will contribute immensely to achieving the desired impact and results of lasting peace and harmony for our people and our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, around the world, more than 50 countries at some point, established Truth and Reconciliation Commissions. One of the major purposes of this initiative was to resolve historic injustices and abuses through public hearings, truth telling and reconciliation between victims and perpetrators, as a way of moving beyond the painful past towards a peaceful future. The many lessons from those processes indicate the need to be sensitive to the specific historical, political and cultural context rather than using a model which is deemed universal in relevance and the application. So, while we learn from the many lessons, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Fiji, we have to be relevant to our own cultural and historical context. Through the support of the UNDP Consultant, Mr. Reuben Karanja, from the International Centre for Transitional Justice in New York, there were conversations facilitated around the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at each of these consultations, there were strong support for the setting up of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, from young and old, from rural and urban areas. The central purpose of the Commission will be aimed at the promotion of reconciliation and forgiveness among the perpetrators and victims of various coups and political persecutions by the past Governments through full disclosure of truth in safe and enabling spaces. It is hoped that many who have suffered gross human rights violations, and their families and communities will find healing and closure. On the salient features of the proposed Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill will be known, after approval, as the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act of 2024. In clause 3, the purpose of the Bill states that it is to promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation. Secondly, it is to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling regarding the political upheavals during the coup periods, and to promote closure and healing for the survivors of those events. Part 2 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Fiji Truth Reconciliation Commission, which will comprise of five members appointed by the President.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>2448 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the functions of the Commission and clause 7 of the Bill provides the powers of the Commission. Clause 9, the Bill outlines the procedures for the Commission and its hearings under the new legislation. The Bill provides for the term of operation for the Commission to carry out its obligations under the new legislation, as well as the process for hearing that the Commission may conduct. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the independent and integrity of the Commission is mandated under Clause 10, and Commissioners have to swear an oath before the President, as set out in Schedule 2. The Code of Conduct is set out in clause 12, which requires the Commissioners to be apolitical and to uphold their term in office. Following that, in clause 13 are the conditions of immunity for the Commission which gives a sense of trust, integrity and authenticity. The Bill requires the Commission to provide support to the survivors of historical events, as well as witnesses protection. Clause 17 of the Bill requires the Commission to submit a final report to the President. It is also important to note how the Commission is going to be financed, and that is from budgetary provision by Government. The Commission is auditable as stipulated under clause 20. With the anticipation of knowing the outcomes of such Commissions, it is also important to manage them responsibly regarding funding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we embark on this journey of voicing the truth and working on reconciliation, we must never forget the statement made by the late President of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela, and I quote: “In the end, reconciliation is a spiritual process, which requires more than just a framework. It has to happen in the hearts and minds of people.” In the iTaukei or vanua tradition, when one tries to reconcile, they must have the genuine yearning for change to forgive and also to forget. I understand we are humans, and it is very difficult to forget. This Bill provides a pathway for all to work on reconciliation, as that will allow healing and growth. The vision of this Government is to empower the people of Fiji through unity. Unity and empowerment can only manifest, if there is forgiveness, acceptance and reconciliation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the consultations and have contributed to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate. I have on the batting list a total of 16 speakers from all three sides of the House, if there is such a definition of the House. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for the</p><h4>third reading of the Bill, which he had just presented on the floor of the House.</h4><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2449 Please, allow me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to acknowledge Government's commitment to promote national healing through the establishment of the Fiji Truth and Recognition Commission, which Bill No.19 seeks to establish. There is no denying the fact that Fiji needs this process to address the many challenges we had faced politically and socially as a nation in the past 37 odd years or may be even beyond that, and which have hindered our progress, as a nation, and continues to haunt the many individuals, families and communities who were negatively affected by the impacts of our badly tainted history. Considering the importance of this process to Fiji as a nation, what I would advocate is that this exercise must be approached with a genuine desire to uncover truths. The honourable Prime Minister has stated the words of Nelson Mandela, and I hope that our words will be consistent with the actions that we take. Genuine desire to uncover truths and promote reconciliation and forgiveness amongst perpetrators and victims, who had suffered gross human rights violations at the height of our political upheavals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it my sincere desire, therefore, that Government will provide the leadership that is necessary to see this truth and reconciliation process right to the end. I recall the words of the honourable Prime Minister when this Bill was debated in September 2023, I thought that to me, it was a call - a call not only to try and find out not only what happened before 1987 and what happened before 2000, what happened before 2006, but why did it happen? Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand the timings. I know that the Bill has already laid the timeline, which is 18 months, according to Part 3, Clause 14(3) which states, and I quote: “The Commission must operate for 18 months after the preparatory period.” Of course, the provision for the extension as well. Let us not be driven by political timelines only. Let us put this issue to rest and this is the opportunity for us to do it right, do it well, bring healing into the nation and, therefore, the processes that we take, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very, very critical. We are all for reconciliation, but it is the process that takes us into that end stage, as alluded to in the Bill. That is very, very critical for all of us. Last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the debate in here, we had a long chat with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, asking me about why we did not support the Bill back then. My response to the honourable Deputy Minister was this, “This is not an ordinary Bill, this is a special Bill. Given our history, the sufferings that we went through, we really need to tread carefully.” And particularly, Sir, the involvement of every stakeholder and most importantly, political parties in this process, because if we at the history of our problems in Fiji, politics is the root cause. I have written an article but, unfortunately, the title was not taken by the media - “The Politics of a Revolution”, but I will come later to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In a revolution, politics is always the objective, military is the means. We need to get to the root cause of this and politics is the root cause. We have had elections, we have had constitutions, but despite the result of elections, we still have problems, and the root cause of those problems are political, Mr. Speaker, Sir. And that is something that is very important. This is the time to address this, once and for all. Let us do it right. Let us be genuine, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>2450 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 First, again, the process. I have spoken about the timelines, I urge Government, “Let us make full use of the parliamentary process because that is very, very important”. When honourable Bulitavu was a loyal Opposition, he always talks about the difference between consultations in the Executive and consultations in the legislative framework. That is exactly what we insist on this Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We must be involved. This Parliament - the voice of the people must be involved. And we need to be part of the process because of the involvement of politics in the past. I have quoted Clause 5(2), which will establish the five Commissioners. We do not know whether we will be represented in that Commission or not. And that is why we need to be more careful, involve in the development of this Bill before we come to the actual process itself, because in the end, we will all be answerable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of 51, again, I urge Government, put aside the political timeline. Let us get this through the normal process of legislative work in this House. If this can be referred to the Committee, well and good, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Whether it is early next year or mid next year, if this can be referred to the Committee, because we need this House to be involved. Let me talk on a few critical observations about the Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 5 th September, the Office of the Opposition requested the Steering Committee, together with the technical team from the Fiji Law Reform Commission, to present to us the Draft Bill. We thanked the Steering Committee, the honourable Tubuna and probably honourable Vocea as well, who are part of the Steering Committee that came with the Law Reform Commission. I have talked about the process. Before I touch on the other minor issues in the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did make a submission to the honourable Chairperson, dated 11 th September, 2024, based on the discussions that we had and what was presented to us about the draft. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is one worry that I have in the current Bill, as compared to the initial Draft that was presented to us on 5 th September. And that, Sir, is in Clause 7 of this Bill, as opposed to what was in the initial Draft. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go to Clause 7, the Commission has the following powers. This is the powers of the Commission, and I quote from the Bill: “(1) (a) To examine under oath any witness; (b) (c) (d) (e) to consider any written or oral evidence in hearings regardless of whether such evidence would be admissible in a civil or criminal proceeding; to consider whether to exclude the presence of a member of the public, including the media from any proceedings or meetings of the Commissioners; to exclude any person, if necessary, to ensure the due conduct of the hearings or to preserve order; and to engage consultants with specific expertise in an area related to the functions of the Commission; (2) A person who intentionally misleads or gives false information to the Commission is deemed to have committed contempt of court and may, at the discretion of the Commission, be referred to the Magistrates’ Court.” The first thing that I noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the omission of what was in paragraph (a) of the Draft. This is what has been omitted from this current Bill, that I have just read. This is what was in the draft.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2451 The Commission has the following Powers: (a) (b) to issue summons to witnesses in the form prescribed in Schedule 1; and to call for the production of books, plans and documents and to examine the witnesses and parties concerned on oath. Apart from the way in which it was rearranged, the other omission was in clause 7(2) of the initial draft that states, and I quote: “…failure to respond to a summons issued by the Commission or failure to truly or faithfully answer questions of the Commission after responding to a summons, or intentionally providing misleading or false information to the Commission shall be deemed equivalent to a contempt of court and may, at the discretion of the Commission, be referred to the higher court.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will come back to that, but also the other omission related to this is, is in Schedule. In the initial draft, there were four Parts to the Schedule, but in this Bill, there are only two Parts in the Schedule. Schedule 1 of the initial draft was summons (the form) to be issued by the Commission if and when needed for a person to appear before the Commission to answer to any allegations or have the opportunity to defend himself or herself, and in brackets (still under consideration). What I want to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this, this is why I am requesting this august Parliament, please, get this through the Committee, because there have been changes in the initial draft that has caught us by surprise, and omitted from the current Bill that we are debating before Parliament. So, my question is, when was this change made? Who did it? Under whose authority? Why? Because the powers to summon is so important in the convening of this Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, otherwise, there is no teeth in this Commission. What I want to ask is, again, when was this change made? Was the Consultant aware of this? Was it made by the Steering Committee? Who made the changes and why? This is a very critical part of this Bill. When we talk about integrity, when we talk about transparency, genuineness in our approach, this has been taken away, and then it is coming through Standing Order 51. The credibility of this Bill is questionable now, because of the path that you have decided to take. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very, very critical. I know for a fact that now, we have former soldiers released and civilians involved in the upheavals. I want to go into it, but will they participate? I had a good discussion with the RFMF Team, Mr. Speaker, Sir. “You are doing a great job with the reconciliation”, but I honestly asked them. “The challenge for you will be, when it comes to the truth - the truth telling part of the reconciliation process, because as I have stated, in revolutions, military is the means, politics is the objective. I had raised this issue when I was the Defending Officer for the CRW soldiers during the Court Martial way back in 2004. I asked the Panel of Judges, “Please, release the soldiers. Let us find the politicians who were behind these soldiers because of the objectives of revolutions.” Then we must do this truth and reconciliation well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we need to identify the politicians. They must come to the truth telling. We must identify the businesspeople who supported the coup perpetrators or coup instigators. Chiefs were involved, Mr. Speaker, Sir, religious leaders were involved, so without the summoning power, we are weakening this process and it is already questionable. We are for a Truth</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>2452 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 and Reconciliation, but let us get it right, let us do it well. There is nothing to hide, it is about Fiji, it is not about politics. It is about Fiji in the years to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not go into other details because other speakers from this side will probably highlight on some of the components of the Bill, but I am pleading to Government, we need the reconciliation process, but let us do it right. This Parliament must be involved. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the events of 2006, there was a committee. Probably that would be a better approach, so that we involve everyone. Not all political parties are in this Parliament, but politics plays a critical role and even the political parties that are in this Parliament are not involved. So, if you can answer those questions for me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is something that I look forward to. May I just conclude by saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as I have alluded to, the Bill in its current state and, of course, with the resources allocated to it, to some degree, lacks the power and the legal authority to carry out its functions effectively and efficiently. Finally, I have talked about the Bill, the process and the end state. Linking the objective of the exercise to the final outcome of the process is critical in this whole initiative and without which, this whole exercise will be done with futile ambitions. MR. SPEAKER.- Given the time, I would like to give opportunity for honourable Naivalurua to also participate for his intervention before we adjourn for dinner. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, a bill of historic proportion for our nation and this generation is presented before this august Parliament for debate. This Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024, contains immense gravity and opportunity. While we cannot rewrite our history, we can reconcile, heal and learn from the past. This Bill provides the framework for action, establishing the Commission to achieve the reconciliation, healing and learning essential to our future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for taking the initiative to lead our nation on a journey of truth and reconciliation. I acknowledge the boldness required to call for this. In doing so, the honourable Prime Minister has provided a clear call to what now defines our future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge and thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation for shouldering the responsibility of listening, engaging and shaping the National Reconciliation Framework for that has become the current Bill before us today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have read the document and considered the Commission’s purpose and intent, there are essential aspects to consider and debate before this august Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission will be led by five Commissioners, appointed to undertake the critical work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scope of this Bill is a serious task and a heavy burden. Added that the heavy burden and responsibility is a short time frame for this Commission to undertake its task. These two issues alone will place high demands on the leadership capacity of the Commissioners with their presence needed across multiple hearings and sittings.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2453 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this serious undertaking must be completed on time. While I respect the time constraints, I am also aware of what is being encouraged to come out of the shadows, so that our national healing can begin. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I foresee that future considerations may need to be given to the honourable Minister responsible to return to this Parliament seeking further provisions if need be. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I state this because this is the work of the heart, our nations heart. Finding the heartbeat and providing permission for the public to have a voice and be heard, this is sacred work and a sacred privilege. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note that Clause 8 speaks to the Government's cooperation with the Commission. While I do not underestimate the goodwill this process will generate among our communities, the clause states the following, and I quote: “…The Government and its agencies of the State must cooperate with the Commission to assist with its functions under this Act.” I urge this Parliament and the honourable Government Ministers responsible for the departments and agencies to prioritise the departments cooperation for the nation’s work. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 of the Bill states the purpose of establishing the Commission, and I quote: “…To promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation.” The benefits of social cohesion cannot be understated. Importantly, social cohesion builds on human dignity, a critical resource to nation building. Time does not allow me to go into any length of the benefits that flow from a people who are knitted together with social cohesion, other than to commend the honourable Minister for bringing such depth to the clear and simple purpose of this Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces for his bold step and firm courage to initiate the truth and reconciliation process among our Armed Forces. I was invited to participate in this process and in doing so, I witnessed first-hand the impact of this social cohesion and its effect on human dignity. Mr. Speaker Sir, this Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill provides the gifts of truth and forgiveness, as well as the grace of reconciliation, which are essential for justice and mercy to achieve their true end, our restoration, our cohesion and our future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, every nation carries its history both commendable and regrettable. In this Bill, I see the steps and the opportunity of a reset of our national consciousness to become defined by what we can achieve together and pave the way for our future. Mr. Speaker Sir, I and my Bloc support the Bill. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, our next speaker would be the Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, but that will await our recess. Honourable Members, at this point in time, we will suspend the proceedings for dinner.</p><h4>Parliament will resume proceedings in 45 minutes.</h4><p>The Parliament adjourned at 6.19 p.m.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>2454 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 7.16 p.m. HON S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, Opposition Leader, Ministers, Assistant Ministers, Members of this august Parliament and people of our beloved Nation. I rise in support of the motion before the Parliament. Let me first clarify LOPs regarding the draft, yes from submissions, the draft had amendments based on submissions and finalised. Regarding your concern on provision for summoning of witnesses. The power to summon means following through and prosecuting, that has been allowed for in Clause 9 on Procedure. The Commission must regulate its own procedures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you very well know that the High Court sets its own procedures, this provision allows the Commission to make provisions for summons, its processes and procedures and they can claim awareness around that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say I am very grateful to the honourable Prime Minister and the Cabinet for placing trust in us, the Committee that was established to undertake the work of consultation and developing the legal framework for the establishment of the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission. A process that gave us an insight on where we are as a nation. We look like a happy nation, but when we created safe spaces to engage, we realised how deeply divided and wounded our people are and it was obvious there is a need for restoration of fractured relationships by overcoming grief, pain and anger. We consulted victims and those who took part in the different political events, in groups as well as individuals. The first coup took place 37 years ago and last coup 18 years ago, but pain shared with us was fresh. Both victims and perpetrators shared they have never felt heard and carry the burdens of their trauma, guilt and pain with them. Many have lived in fear. Many were worried about reprisal and victimisation if they spoke. The Commission will now enable them to share their stories with its provisions of victim protection as well as options for in camera proceedings. Everyone we spoke with agreed that there is a need for a space to be created for healing. Some asked for truth, many asked for healing whether they were elders or youth who have seen their elders suffer from their burdens and sharing of painful narratives of the past. As part of the conversation, we started with trauma awareness and recovery sessions with Fr. Ioane Sigarara, a psychologist with speciality in Post-Traumatic Stress disorder. Youth, women, faith leaders, community leaders when they became aware of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder during these workshops, shared their realisation on how deeply impacted their families and communities have been. Hurt people, hurt people, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We rate one of the highest in the world on violence against women and children chart. Our tolerance for intolerable has increased because we have justified crimes committed during each political upheaval, whether it was 1987, 2000 or 2006, no coup can be justified. Emotions used in these political events have tried to divide our people on ethnic lines and dehumanise each other. Sadly, many political leaders have thrived on narratives of division, fear and hate for their own political expediency. But past has happened, we cannot deny our past, we can only learn from it, heal from it and create a new Fiji based on healing and better understanding of each other’s fears, dreams and hopes. This process needs courage and political will, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Our Prime Minister and our Coalition Government has the political will, and hearing from our consultations indicate that for the first time, the whole nation is ready to embrace this process. It will not be easy but is necessary. I would also like to quote South African leader Nelson Mandela, well known and</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2455 loved around the world for his commitment to peace and reconciliation, and I quote: “Reconciliation does not mean forgetting or trying to bury the pain of conflict but working together to correct the legacy of past injustice.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission once established, will be mandated to serve as a guide for all Fijians in identifying and moving towards overcoming the causes and consequences of the political violence, social divisions and economic inequalities that have divided us since 1987. The Commission, through its non-judicial character, and non-retributive approach will facilitate truth telling through public hearings, conduct truth sitting through research, data gathering and analysis, and promote healing and reconciliation. The Commission will set its processes for statement taking and will create awareness on its work. The Commission will identify and recommend institutional reforms, particularly within the State institutions that it determines as responsible for committing, enabling or failing to uphold the State’s obligation to fulfil, respect and protect human rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission Chair will be sourced from global human rights community to ensure trust and transparency in the process. Nelson Mandela when released from prison after 27 years of incarceration chose not to use his suffering and pain to take revenge on perpetrators. He chose to forgive and be a true leader for his nation and a beacon of peace to the whole world. We are hoping these leadership qualities will shine in every sphere of Fiji as we embark on this journey. We have seen the Commander of RFMF, Major General Jone Kalouniwai take a major step within Fiji’s Military Forces to work towards healing the falls that was divided for past 24 years. Almost all segments of our society had been wounded in one event or the other, but resentment and hate will not take us far. If I may quote Mandela again:” Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.” Forgiveness can contribute to creating a foundation for dialogue. It can help release bitterness and anger and facilitate the re-humanisation of being other. This is key to the reconciliation process, which cannot happen without eradicating the dehumanisation factor that has resulted in the stereotyping that we see. We cannot be selfish and use our personal hursts and agendas from keeping the country going forward. Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission provides the opportunity for the whole of Fiji to create a future of hope, healing and truly the way the world should be. I must say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that for once, every group conversations we had, whether it was with faith leaders, youth, women and all the political leaders whom we met, everyone said, yes, this is needed. I hope from here onwards, we will go and I ask Fiji to support the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission so we can truly have a Fiji, the way the world should be. With that, I support the motion. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill before the House. Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is the truth really forthcoming to effect the real reconciliation? By establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in its current form, we are opening the doorway to retraumatise our victims. We are forcibly reopening the wounds that really has not healed, but has slowly been forgotten about, just to please some in the name of tick in the box. The victims will have to relive those ugly and dreadful days. We will be breaking down and re-victimising the victims again. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a victim of one of the coups. I lost a family member because of a subsequent event of a coup. Does this Government think that I would like to relive the trauma without</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2456 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 knowing the truth? I will only reconcile if the truth comes out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Commissioners should have the authority to summon individuals, institutions or Government bodies to provide testimony, documents and other evidence relevant to the enquiry. This power is missing from the Bill. Not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was deliberately taken out, God knows why. Mr. Speaker, Sir, does the Government honestly think that the perpetrators will willingly come forward and tell the truth? Will they willingly divulge the names of the people and institutions that were behind them during the events in question? Do you think these perpetrators acted alone during those events? No! I do not think so, they will have to be summoned and this power is not given to the Commission.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is there:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> It is not there, I hope you can read! Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission does not have the power to initiate investigations, including the ability to independently gather evidence, interview witnesses and review relevant archives. Why set up this Commission and not give them the teeth to bite? The Bill states that His Excellency the President will appoint the Commissioners. The question is, on whose recommendation? What will be the composition of the Commission? What provisions are there to have some sort of gender balance in the Commission? None of these are addressed in the Bill. It is wide open and can be interpreted in whichever way one deems fits so. The Bill states that the Commission may hold in- camera proceedings as necessary. Why should it be? All proceedings should be made public. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission should be empowered to be able to publish comprehensive reports, detailing their findings and recommendations and the outcomes of their investigation. These reports should be widely disseminated to the public, Government and relevant international bodies rather than just reporting to it to His Excellency the President. Mr. Speaker, Sir, powers should be given to the Commission to propose institutional, legal and policy reforms to prevent the reoccurrence of human rights violations. These might include recommending change in laws, education systems or other mechanisms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this case the Truth and Reconciliation Commission can easily be seen as an institution that favours reconciliation over justice, allowing powerful elites to avoid prosecution for their crimes. I am sure most of us sitting know who they are and whom we are trying to protect. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s focus is mainly on individual acts. It is not investigating or addressing the system that causes or favours such acts to happen. It is not addressing the structural system or the institutional setup that causes such acts to happen and thus resulting in the terrible acts of human rights violations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Commission lacks authority to challenge the broader socio and economic systems that may lie behind the gross violations of human rights during the events. I believe failure to do so will fail to have any real and meaningful effect of change in the long run. My question is, is this Government willing to act on the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission? Does it have the political will to do so and will the recommendations of the Commission be ignored or downplayed.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2457 Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Government has the political will to do so then I challenge them to give powers to the Commission and make their report public whilst a copy is presented to His Excellency the President. I believe that for both discretions the answer from the other side would be “no”. They are not willing to go that way. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current setup and the operational demarcation of the Commission will not allow this to happen as they bounded not to make their report public but to present it to His Excellency the President. If this is not going to happen, then why is this Commission being setup? Is it just a tick in the box we were promised and we have done it? Is it that simple? That is what it looks like. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, if composed well and empowered properly can become a very powerful tool for healing and rebuilding trust within our people. I do not see this coming in the current setup. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the truth is not forthcoming then I honestly do not see any real reconciliation happening. This is a sad state. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one only knows the pain of a wound if they have had their finger cut. If you had not suffered that cut, you do not know the pain. I suffered during the coup, can anyone stand up and say, I also suffered directly? No. So, you can only know the pain if you have cut your finger. By having this Truth and Reconciliation Commission setup in such a way, we are letting our people down. Their silence is deafening. I know people are watching with interest and I leave it at that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill before the House. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament. On the outset, the Bill before the House is in fact a heart issue. I thank the honourable Prime Minister for the wisdom in the formulation of the Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my great privilege to support the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill (Bill No. 19/2024) tonight. I wish to focus on clause 6(f) of the Bill which articulates the critical function of the Commission with regards to facilitating trauma support, faith-based or pastoral support, and counselling for survivors. One of the unsung roles that made the foundation of democracy resilient is to confront its darkest days. In a bid to understand, reconcile and hear from them in this respect, the establishment of Fiji’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission is not only timely but pivotal for Fiji's healing, growth, and progress. Important to note is the role illumination of truth plays, but of far more paramount significance is what we do with this truth thereafter. Clause 6(f) of the Bill carves the pathway for our forward journey towards healing, growth and justice with unequal precision. In establishing a trauma support, will indicate our understanding that bearing witness to harsh realities can unearth deep-seated emotional wounds. These wounds, if left unaddressed, can perpetuate a cycle of hostility and unrest, threatening the cohesive fabric of our Fiji. The Commission's commitment to facilitate trauma support is, therefore, a strong testament to our collective will for preserving peace, unity and wellbeing of our beloved nation. Furthermore, faith-based and pastoral support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will play a pivotal role and a vital one in solace seeking process for many survivors. The power of spiritual and pastoral healing cannot be undermined or overlooked, for it produces a huge strength, resilience and hope in people encountering immense despair and distress.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2458 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 By acknowledging this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and building into our mechanism, we respect and honour the individual healing journeys of our citizens, thereby nurturing an inclusive, tolerant and compassionate society that is equipped to rise above its tribulation. Moreover, the Bill underscores the importance of professional counselling for survivors. Counselling offers a safe haven for victims to express and understand their emotions, rethink their past experiences and constructively define their future. Through counselling, Mr. Speaker, we equip our survivors with tools to reclaim their families, rebuild their lives and contribute positively to the society – an invaluable investment for our nation’s future. Building upon my previous affirmation of the Truth and Reconciliation Bill, I would like to approach this from a Christian perspective using the wisdom and teaching of the scriptures from the Bible. Christ’s message in the Holy Bible is one of absolute love, absolute forgiveness and absolute reconciliation which aligns closely with the ideals of this Commission. The Bill also adopts a Christ-like godly compassion for the victims and survivors emulating God’s heart for the oppressed and broken-hearted. In Psalms 34:18, we learn and I quote, “The Lord is close to the broken-hearted and save those that are crushed in spirit”. This Commission seeks to extend the same hand of comfort, to restore the dignity and respect that was taken away from them. The focus of the Commission of future prevention also echoes Christian teaching, emphasising a transformative change in behaviour. In addition, the Holy Bible reminds us in Proverbs 28:13, “Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy”. Similar to this verse, the Commission provides a platform for individual and institution to confess their wrongdoings and renounce violence and oppression and begin the process of healing and forgiveness; in doing so restoring social harmony and justice. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the initial endorsement of the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Bill (Bill No. 19/2024) is an attainable epitome of our collective moral, social responsibilities towards those who have suffered wrong. By supporting this Bill, we are making a commitment to truth, justice and healing, we solidify our stand for human rights, we safeguard the progress made since our independence and we ascertain that the Fiji of the future is a united, harmonious and prosperous nation with all yearn for. As we debate this Bill this evening, let us remember that in facilitating trauma support, faith-based support and counselling for survivors, we are truly nurturing the heart and soul of our society. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I rise in this Chambers today to give my contribution on the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024. I am not a lawyer, Sir, but with little know that I have, you can only make a regulation if the authority is given in the Act itself. I am a Pharmacist, I can be corrected on this. If the law gives you authority, then you can make regulations. Under procedure, there is no authority given to the Commission to do anything that they can summon a witness. If that was the case, Mr. Speaker, all these Commissions can go and regulate themselves tomorrow, and they can start summoning witnesses. However, the law does not allow that. In Clause 9, it only talks about the procedure. That is all I have to say about removing the summoning power of the Commission from the Act itself. Mr. Speaker, there are other lawyers on the other side, they might contribute but, please, you are lawyers. I might be a bush lawyer but you are professional lawyers so be wary about what you are saying in this august Parliament.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2459 Mr. Speaker, the Bill that we are talking about, I admit that one of my iTaukei friends, Mr. Matai Korosaya from BSP, once told me when we brought in Bill No. 17 said, “Let us see, we have a very different kind of thinking. If you ask us, we can give you anything. You people came from India, we gave you land to build your house, we gave you land to do farming and everything. As a friend, if you ask me tomorrow for my house, I will even allow you to come and stay with me. This is the mentality he said of us being iTaukei. But the moment you try and tell us instead of getting anything from us, you will be getting a kick from us.” These are the words of my friend who actually said that. During Bill No. 17, there was ignorance and arrogance. Today, I see that same arrogance and ignorance coming in from the Government side. On one side, we have... (Honourable Member interjects) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Please, listen! MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- ….the honourable Leader of the Opposition standing and suggesting that if we want to reconcile everyone, let us get some reconciliation between the Members of Parliament within this Chambers. That is all what we are actually asking at this point in time, Mr. Speaker. But that same ignorance and arrogance coming from the other side is not letting that happen. The moment we actually make the decision, we will go with it, whether the consequence mean anything, but we will ensure that we have actually passed it. We bring it under Standing Order 51, we will pass it under Standing Order 51. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are talking about truth and reconciliation, we will be speaking bitter today because it is all about truth and reconciliation. We cannot pass this Bill without actually speaking the truth in this august Parliament. One of the truths, Mr. Speaker, is a blatant lie in this Parliament that consultation was done throughout Fiji. I can name two such places where the Steering Committee failed to hold public consultation which were places of interest during 2000 coup. Mr. Speaker, that was in Dreketi and Muaniweni. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Listen, please! It is my time to speak - please listen! We just said that we have done national consultations and then got this Bill. And now we are saying all of a sudden that the Commission will do it on our behalf. If you people have not done it, send it to the Committee so that the Committee can go to these places and talk to these victims. Mr. Speaker, I very well stated on Monday that we should not rush through this Bill. The Bill will open a lot of wounds that have either healed or is in a process of healing or are hidden for ages. Mr. Speaker, we have heard the lies in this august Parliament when we were informed, as I had suggested earlier, that consultation was done all throughout the nation. That was a blatant lie. Mr. Speaker, on that same note, once segment of group of our society had been totally neglected or rather ignored in this particular Bill, and they are females - our mothers, sisters, daughter, granddaughters and daughter in laws.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2460 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will read out the definition of survivors. The Bill states, and I quote: “survivors” includes any person, whether in Fiji or abroad – (a) Who, individually or together with one or more persons, suffered harm in the form of physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, pecuniary loss, or a substantial impairment of human rights.” There is no mention of sexual assault. Ladies were raped. Females were raped. And under the definition, we are not even incorporating sexual harassment. We can go on trying to explain this and that but sexual assault is not part of the definition, Sir. Mr. Speaker, during the turmoil that happened during the coups in Fiji, it was not just a man killing another man, or the action of a man brought drastic consequence to Fiji. What we have forgotten is how our ladies were raped in places like Muaniweni and Dreketi. Ladies had to run all the way from Muaniweni to Girmit Centre to save their dignity. Why did the Steering Committee led by honourable Kiran, not go to these areas to conduct public consultation so that people can have their say in this particular Bill? It is a total ignorance, Mr. Speaker. The very families that had sleepless nights because they were worried about their security that a perpetrator may walk anytime and rape the family member. Mr. Speaker, these are hard realities that we need to look into. There were lot of domino effects actually happening during and post- coup as well. Mr. Speaker, for months, many of these families had to hide a female member in a farm, cassava patch, in the forest as soon as it is 6.00 p.m. These people were never compensated. Because of victimisation and humiliation, they did not even report these matters to the Police and this is a well-known ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Tuisawau? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Standing 62(4)(d) on prohibited references, and I quote: “words that are likely to promote or provoke feelings of ill-will or hostility between communities or ethnic groups within Fiji.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are discussing the Bill and the provisions of the Bill and we should stick around those areas. The pros and cons of the Bill or why we are rushing it through, if you want, rather than going into the details of acts which may have happened but which, at the moment, is contravening Standing Order 62(4)(d). Let us discuss the framework of this. Those kind of matters can be raised during the process where we share those experiences and how we can deal with it and ensure that through that process, we understand what happened and how we deal with it through the provisions of the Bill. I am not saying those things are light or did not happen, but what I am saying is, this may not be the right forum for expressing those. The forum in which we can express those are where we can deal with it in a more professional and more appropriate forum. MR. SPEAKER.- I have taken on board your Point of Order. It does evoke emotional reactions, nevertheless, I will allow the speaker to continue as he was on this issue.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2461</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in these two areas where the consultation did not take place, a perpetrator would actually walk in a house, grabs a lady’ hand and rapes her in the bedroom, while the males in the family are sitting in the living room with a cane knife at their neck. These are the group of people whom we have missed during public consultation to have their input in this particular Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it went to an extent that the perpetrators actually come into the house and if they do not find the ladies, if they are actually hiding somewhere else, males would be beaten the whole night. The whole night, males were beaten so that they can tell where the females are hiding. That was the extent to which these people in those two areas suffered, and the Chairperson of the Committee did not even think that it is important to have public consultation in those areas. What a shame! It does not take much time to ask for forgiveness from others, but it is a shame that she did not find those particular places important for public consultation. Mr. Speaker, why were these two areas and these victims excluded from public consultation? That is one of my biggest questions. It is ridiculous and unacceptable that being a female Member who as the Chairperson … HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order! MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Kiran. HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 62(1), What is being indicated is that we did not speak to the victims of those places, but we did. So what he is saying is not accurate. We have a list of victims who have spoken from those areas, without necessarily having public consultations in those areas. What honourable Maharaj is saying about the victims, we know victims, I have worked with those victims, and we have consulted them. They were the first lot of people we have consulted, and it is improper to say that it was not done. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! Honourable Kiran has pointed out Standing Order 62(1), which says when speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member. Is that what you are saying, honourable Kiran?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. KIRAN.:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Correct, and specifically referring to issues that have been raised by honourable Maharaj, these particular complaints have been heard by the Committee at their hearings in various places. If that is correct, then she has a point under Standing Order 62(1), honourable Maharaj. So, keep away from any other specific reference to those issues that you have raised in respect to that. You may proceed, honourable Maharaj. HON. A. A.

MAHARAJ.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>I received several calls from the members of public stating that they were not consulted and that is exactly what I am saying, Mr. Speaker. We do not have any report from the Committee… HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Hearsay, hearsay! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- …with a list and everything, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and whatever information is at hand, that is what I am speaking on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with what I have actually gathered, I had asked the honourable Prime Minister if he was actually aware, that a public consultation did not take place in those two areas and do we need to continue with the current process to pass this Bill under Standing Order 51or we can still send this Bill to the Committee stage for them to carry out a public consultation and then from there on, we can bring it back with a bipartisan Report from all the Committee Members and have it debated in Parliament. It is a very important question to the honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Now, it is clear that public consultations did not take place in those two areas. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, the process we have, the procedures have been followed under Standing Order 51, so we have passed that stage. What are you trying to do now is plead with the honourable Prime Minister to retract and go back and have further consultation with reference to the Standing Committee? Is that what you are saying? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. All I am asking and all I am requesting is that the honourable Prime Minister to reconsider if this particular Bill can be referred to a Parliamentary Committee which consists of both, Government and Opposition Members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us protect and respect our ladies in Fiji. The Bill is not designed to protect that Government has jumped the gun. The Military is already in the process of reconciliation. Perpetrators are already out of prison and living a normal life. Honourable Prime Minister has already publicly apologised to the nation. Then what is the rush, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to bring this Bill if the process sis already taking place? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of reconciliation is already taking place. What we are saying is, let us have that bipartisan approach in this Parliament and let us incorporate all of these things in the Bill itself before it is passed in this august House. Vinaka! HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today in support of the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024. I also join the honourable Prime Minister in commending honourable Sashi Kiran, the Chairperson of the Steering Committee for her patience and tireless efforts in advancing this critical work. Her dedication, alongside the contributions of the members of the Committee, especially the Assistant Ministers and other stakeholders reflect the united commitment for a Bill that is more than ever crucial, as it embodies the values of truth, accountability and reconciliation. It seeks to confront the pain and trauma of our history, particularly the socio- political crisis of the past. For far too long, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many Fijians have carried the heavy burden of unresolved grievances and unspoken truths living them unrested. And the establishment of this Truth and</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2463 Reconciliation Commission offers a pathway for healing and for closure, ensuring that this painful chapters are not forgotten, but serve as a lesson for a brighter and a united Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission proposed by this Bill will create an open, safe and supportive space for truth telling and healing. It is dedicated to honour the voices of survivors and provide justice through transparency and accountability. Compose of the 5 members, the Commission will operate with diverse expertise, integrity, independence and impartiality. And these qualities are essential to fostering trust among all stakeholders and ensuring the Commission’s findings and the Commission’s recommendations are credible and impactful. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the multi-faceted functions of the Commission, which is strongly supported to one, provide the truth, sharing platforms for survivors to share and hear their experiences. It is not about blame, but about giving voices to those who have been silenced and most importantly, listen. By uncovering the root causes and systematic issues underlying political upheavals, the Commission will address the injustices that have shaped our history. Not only does this Commission intend to provide a platform and uncover root causes of the political upheavals we have faced, it embarks to facilitate trauma support services for our survivors, drawing on the experiences of our faiths and counsellors and this injustices cannot be repeated. Legislation reforms must be carried out to strengthen our institutions, protect human rights and uphold democracy. As this side of the august Parliament have always advocated for, upholding democracy and fight against injustices that have prevailed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the powers entrusted to the Commission ensures that it can fulfil its mandate effectively by hearing, mentioned in Section 15 of the Bill, that emphasises inclusivity and fundamental principles in its operations. This is crucial for ensuring that all individuals regardless of their background or abilities, can participate fully in the Commission’s processes. A further mandate support for individuals with disabilities through provisions such as sign language interpretation, the selection of disability access venues for hearing, and assistance with physical access to these premises. Through recognising the sensitive nature of its work, the Commission will adopt survivor centred approaches, prioritising dignity and well-being. And through robust measures, will be in place to safeguard the identities of the survivors and witnesses especially in cases where fear of reprisal exists. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the heart of this Bill, lies its commitment to supporting survivors. Survivors will receive psychological, medical and legal support, ensuring that their needs are addressed holistically. It also recognises the courage it takes to come forward and the Commission will implement robust mechanisms to protect witnesses from harm or intimidation. The independence of the Commission is a cornerstone of this Bill. Free from political interferences, free from been influenced by any agencies for its operations will be credible and impartial. Furthermore, regular audits and particular recordkeeping will ensure transparency and maintain public trust. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission's final report will present findings, will present recommendations and actionable measures tailored to a Government's capacity to ensuring a realistic and sustainable implementation. So, the question is why is it that this Bill is so crucial? Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is essential for Fiji's future. Confronting our past is not about revisiting old wounds, but about acknowledging the pain, the sufferings and learning from it, to never happen again. It is also crucial to address issues that have been shelved for over 30 years, as doing</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>2464 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 so will pave the way for healing and progress, ensuring that we build a more inclusive and resilient society moving forward. As the late Nelson Mandela wisely said, and I quote: “…true reconciliation does not consist in merely forgetting the past, but in facing up to it and coming to terms with it.” So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides a framework for us to face our history with honesty and integrity, allowing us to heal as a nation and we are fortunate to draw on the experiences of other nations, such as South Africa and the Solomon Islands in designing our Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The South African Commission, born out of the fight against apartheid, demonstrated the transformative power of truth telling and reconciliation in rebuilding a divided nation. Similarly, the Solomon Islands processes emphasised the importance of tailoring reconciliation efforts to cultural and social contexts. We also have the guidance of international experts like Mr. Ruben Carranza, whose work with the International Centre for Transitional Justice has helped nations navigate this complex process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill presents an opportunity for Fiji, to stand united, to listen, to heal and to avoid repeating the horrors of our past. And I urge all members of this august Parliament to support this motion wholehearted. To the people of Fiji, I encourage you to participate in the public consultations. Share your views, your stories, and your hopes for our nation's future. This is your chance to shape a legacy of peace, justice and unity for generations to come. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is not just a mechanism for addressing past injustices. It is a beacon of hope for the future. It reminds us that our strength as a nation lies in our ability to acknowledge our mistakes, learn from them, and grow together. This Bill is our opportunity to honour the resilience of those who have suffered, to rebuild trust within our communities and to create a society where every Fijian, regardless of race, culture or background, feels valued and empowered. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the leader of the party for SODELPA, I speak as well on our behalf to urge that we all commit our hearts to this reconciliation, so that we heal as a nation and move forward. We cannot afford to do lip service as leaders because it will make us hypocrites and we will be remembered by our people as having failed them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we look at the amount of damage that has been caused by all our political upheavals, over the years, all I can say is, what a loss. It is now time to reshape our thoughts and hearts and place our people above our personal interest, above our tribal interest, above racial interest. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a nation, we are stronger together and weaker divided. Lastly, by way of this Truth and Reconciliation Bill, we, as leaders, must all vouch that we put an end to the usurping of powers via illegal means. Never again must Fiji go through the dark days of a coup and we must denounce coups, not only to protect our future generation and our economy, but also the word of God provides crosses to us that whatever we do as leaders, will be felt by our people, our family for generations to come.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2465 Mr. Speaker, Sir, together we can ensure that Fiji’s future is defined not by its division, but by its commitment to justice, to peace and reconciliation. Vinaka saka vakalevu and may God bless Fiji. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think when I stood up before you for the first time, Sir, I did mention that this is a hot house where there will be many occasion for many arguments to come, that would be very sensitive et cetera and it is very visible today, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill that is before the Parliament, I think what needed to be spelt out, was spelt out quite clearly and succinctly by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and you could see how passionate he was when he spoke about it, enough for him to become emotional. What he portrayed today is what the general populous portrays. This is a very emotional topic, this is not something that can be washed over, this is not something that can be rushed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is an important document, and I want to congratulate the honourable Minister for Education, because I think he said many things that are extremely good and they hit the nail on the head. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate, a couple of days ago, when this Bill was brought before us, again hit the nail straight on the head when he stood up straight, and the first thing that he said was: “without truth, you cannot have reconciliation.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you and I both know, and some of the other lawyers in this Chambers, one of the most important parts of the law and justice is when someone takes a witness box and the first thing they say is: “I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are not just words that should ring through in this document, in various forms it can. I want to just reiterate also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the original document, the draft document that the honourable Leader of the Opposition spoke about came to us, it was quite heartening to see, and I want to spell this out to the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, it was quite heartening to see the actual stipulation of the powers of the Commission and it contained that particular provision that the honourable Leader of the Opposition referred to regarding the issuing of summons to witness in a form prescribed and to call for a further production of plans, books and documents and to examine witnesses and parties concerned, on oath. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all heard it, the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation responded to it by saying: “it is covered under Section 9 of the Bill.” Which says, subject to this section the Commission must regulate its own procedure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you and I both know there is a difference between procedure and power. We might fight it about all day, but there is a difference between procedure and power. The authority to summon someone, to call someone to give witness, you must get that authority from somewhere and that particular initial draft gave the authority to the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission to allow them to summon people and that is the very reason why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see that is divided into Sections 7 and 9. One is to do with the powers of the Commission, and the other is to do with the procedure of the Commission. We cannot muddy the waters, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Even in Court, the authority for a witness to come, you have to issue a subpoena for them to come. It is not an easy thing to do, with this current document the Commission will not be able to summon anyone to come and give witness. They are going to be at the mercy of the decision of the person who wants to, whether they want to or not, you are not going to be able to.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>2466 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 And, one of the most important things here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the ability of the Commission to actually probe forensically, look at something or ask for evidence that may be with the Police or the DPP or any other institution, where is the authority to do that? You cannot say that it is going to be covered under procedure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, without the truth we will never ever have any reconciliation. There are many people in this country, including those of us sitting in this Parliament that are quite emotional about how this actually works. I do not think this side of Parliament and especially the 16 of us are saying, that this should not happen, but what we are saying is, that it should be done thoroughly and properly. There are many countries around the world that have done this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have gone through this. Some have been successful, very few have been successful, but most have not been successful. Purely because they have not been able to address everything. We are not going to be able to cover every corner, but at the very least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the experience of all those countries having done that and our own experiences, our own way of doing things and how we reconcile, we must do this thoroughly. In its current form, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular Bill is not thorough. There are questions that remain, will the Government adopt that Act upon the reports when the recommendations come out? Who is actually going to be the Commissioner? Does it say that they have to be apolitical? How much flexibility is there? Will the Commission be an independent institution full of integrity? We already have problems, I see honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics going like this. Sir, give us a chance, you just need to hear us.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Independent:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> Yes, I know! I am reiterating what is in there. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this entire Parliament is actually on the same page, they are on the same page, we are not saying do not do this! We are on the same page, but what we are saying is, please ensure that it is done thoroughly. The fact that it was brought under Standing Order 51, it got through, but we are still saying and we are asking for the Prime Minister to revisit it and say, please take it back so that we can get the consultations done. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission within the actual Bill says that it has these particular powers to examine under oath any witness. How are you going to bring those witnesses? Clause 7(1) states and I quote: “(b) to consider any written or oral evidence in hearings …. (c) to consider whether to exclude the presence of a member of the public, including the media from any proceedings …. (d) to exclude any person, if necessary, to ensure the due conduct of the hearings …. (e) to engage consultants with specific expertise in an area related to the functions of the Commission….” Those are the powers that it has. What other powers should it have and does it align itself to the fact that the functions of the Commission are to facilitate enabling spaces and engage all relevant stakeholders in the reconciliation process? They have not even engaged with all the relevant</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2467 stakeholders in bringing this Bill to Parliament, to examine the nature of antecedents, root causes and accountability, there is a whole host of stuff that is actually in there, but the very power, the very authority that allows them to summon anyone and everyone is gone. It is not a small matter. Yet, until now, even the Chairperson has not given a reason as to why. That question was asked by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. Why did you take that provision out? Why is it that the Commission will not be able to step into the Police Force, ODPP or anywhere with those information to be able to extract it? Without that power, this Commission is toothless and powerless. How can that be? How are we going to do justice to every victim of anything that has happened post- 1987? Mr. Speaker, we are all on the same page. We just make sure that we have to come to the right agreement with respect to how it is done. I keep hearing from the other side, trust the process. You have not even gotten the process right to bring this Bill. You have heard the stories already from the previous speakers. We cannot do justice to those people that are aggrieved, and I can tell you this much. Sir, if I may relay a story. In my days when I was practising, Sir, there was a particular client who was still in prison for murder. He was a very intelligent man and he said to me one day, “Boso, one minute of incarceration is a lifetime of pain.” If you equate what he said to one minute of violence inflicted on anyone is a lifetime of pain, whether it is mental violence or physical violence. Honourable Alvick Maharaj raised an issue that, where is the specificity with respect to sexual crimes that have been committed? You can get out of it. Where is it? So I am just saying that it needs to be thorough so that anyone who is sitting on the Commission is able to do his or her job properly without fear, without favour or without any prejudice. That person needs to be able to understand that I am empowered to go and get the evidence regarding this to seek. What are we seeking? We are seeking the truth, Mr. Speaker, so that we may reconcile because remember we are not going to do this over and over again. This is a one-time thing. We must learn from the other Reconciliation Commissions that have actually happened around the world. Some have been brutally violent, yet even their Reconciliation Commissions have not been able to do this. How are we going to do this? Are we going to inculcate the findings into our educational system? Are we going to teach our children that this is what happens to X, Y, and Z and it should never happen again? How are we going to do it? We cannot treat this lightly. With all the passion in the world, Sir, this side of Parliament is asking for a fair whack at the cherry. I urge the honourable Prime Minister along with all of us that are saying, “we must revisit how we actually do this.” We have not completed the particular process. It is not about not bringing this to the House, it is about getting it right. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission is there to actually address a hugely long period of violence in the past. Some of the atrocious activities that have gone on, if it was a normal one, that would mean that that person or persons would be incarcerated for life. But under the guise of a coup or a takeover, or whatever it is, a lot has gone on and we are looking to try and bury all of that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that we realise the failures of the Commissions around the world come in many different forms. As I said earlier, incorporating these things into our education system, some of them were not implemented in these particular places. We must ensure that we integrate what we actually learn into our broader framework of our society. Where is that? Where is the thoroughness that we actually all have the ability to do? There are so many intelligent people in this House who know this. This is not about politics. This is about playing with people’s minds. We cannot play with people’s minds. Whether it is one victim or a thousand victims, we cannot mistreat or illtreat them because they have been damaged.</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>2468 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 The passion with which honourable Maharaj has actually spoken regarding some of the victims who have spoken, you can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when he does raise it, up comes someone to say, “Point of Order.” If it is raising issue here, what will it do when we have this Commission sitting in place? People will not come out of fear. We must remove the fear from here. In effect, if you look at this, these things are done by looking at what you want to achieve at the end. What do we want to achieve? There are things in here which actually spells it out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is the purpose behind this Truth and Reconciliation Commission? Clause 3 simply states and I quote: “(1) The purpose of the Commission is to promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation. (2) The purpose of this Act is to facilitate open and free engagement in truth-telling regarding the political upheavals during the coup periods and to promote closure and healing for the survivors of these events.” The first line does not even speak about truth. It ought to and it should say that the purpose of the Commission is to promote a truth-telling exercise and then to promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation. Where is the truth? Mr. Speaker, Sir, without the truth, we are not going to have reconciliation. We cannot treat that is just a normal document, like one of those Bills that come to our House, we fight about it, it is passed and is forgotten about. We cannot. This is historically one of the most important documents that has ever come through this House, and I am talking about from the day this House became what it is, because of our history. It is so important for our children and our grandchildren to learn from our history. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all want to heal. We all say grand things in this House about what needs to be done, what we want to do, but we do not succeed. This is the one opportunity we have to be on the same side and to be honest and truthful with our populous, because that is what our duty demands us to do as Members of Parliament. This is a very emotional subject, it is something that is going to raise the temperature even more, I know there are other speakers after me. We want this done also, but we want it done properly. In its current form, we do not agree with it because it is powerless, it does not do what it is supposed to do. I think learning about what has happened in many other jurisdictions is a lesson to all this. Will this document properly address all our human rights abuses? Will the perpetrators be brought to justice? Will there be a recompense? Having a Truth and Reconciliation Commission must be for the right reasons. Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will never be an end and the need for truth and reconciliation is a must for us to grow as a nation and for us to be really truthful about who we are, what we are and what we stand for. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- The good old book states in 1 Thessalonians 5:18 and I quote: “In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank God for my life and the rare opportunity that confronts me today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, though my contribution to this motion may appear irrelevant to many in this august House, nevertheless, this is the ultimatum and mission given to me for my family and my people, if I should have an opportunity in this House to remember the devastating impact of the “little war” in terms of the identity crisis that they have suffered for generations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I count this as that rare opportunity to briefly outline this tragic event which I believe should also be covered by the work of the Commission under clause 3(1) of the Fiji Truth</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2469 and Reconciliation Bill. While we are still focussing on the modern political upheaval, let me take you back to the biggest and devastating upheaval in Fiji’s history. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is with some measure of regret that this august House, not to mention the whole of the country ignorantly forgotten or purposely downplayed the impact of one of Fiji’s terrible, historical and bloody political exploits that left hundreds of hill people of the Sigatoka Valley homeless, seeking refuge in other districts or islands and thousands of people shot dead and hanged by the then Colonial Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 148 years today in 1876 barely two years into Fiji’s Cession to Great Britain in 1874, the “little war” broke out after the failure of negotiations between the natives and the native constabulary forces to appease the natives from blaming the Colonial Government of sabotage and criminal intimidation that the great measles pandemic swept through the nation in 1875, killing a quarter of the population, roughly 40,000 people was purposely brought by the new settlers to wipe away the natives in order to possess their land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result, the natives of the Sigatoka Valley in Navosa took up the traditional arms of clubs and spears against the whole provinces of Fiji including the neighbouring Nadroga and Namosi, who assembled at Nasaucoko in early 1876. About 2,000 in total, assisted by the modern weaponry of the new government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was a David-Goliath struggle between sheer brute force against a well- armed auxiliary native force backed by the Colonial Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government was pushed to its limit for several months. After some time, the government prevailed in killing people in caves namely the Tawaleka, Nahehevia taking them as prisoners and hanged or shot them dead. The natives were finally conquered with the leaders Jolame Mudu of Naqalimari and Nabisiki of Noikoro who were brought down to Sigatoka for the final judgement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the emancipation, the natives returned home, they were not be bu. They were not to build forts and never to return to full normalcy and now some are still in their exiled home. Mr. Speaker, Sir, instead of requesting compensation from the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission for the lives of men, women and children who died at the duration of the “little war”, we plead with the honourable Prime Minister to continue the good work of helping and building the inland town at Navatumali in Keiyasi, not only improving the infrastructure by building their lost identity taken away from them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the moving of the Navosa Provincial Office from Natuatuacoko to Lawaqa in Sigatoka in 1944, the people of Navosa want a province for themselves. Demographically it cannot be joined and subjugated to a chiefly leadership that is not identical to the ethos and identity of their cultural environment. Navosa has 12 tikina and Nadroga has 10. The two provinces are not equal partners or players, one of them automatically becomes a footstool and subjugation in the name of the game. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Natuatuacoko office moved to Sigatoka in 1944, it was a temporary move to improve communication. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it did not appear that it will last this long - 80 years. To quote from the Bible</p><h4>the popular song, "Truly they are sitting down and wept when they remembered Zion" this present</h4><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>2470 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 arrangement has strongly impacted the identity crisis of the province.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more than 20 tabua have been presented to various provincial leadership,</h4><p>head of the then Native Land Trust Board, including two to three Prime Ministers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 27 th May, 1999, a large delegation of Navosa people representing the 12 tikina converged in Suva to formally request the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Fijian Affairs, the late Adi Kuini Vuikaba Speed, Tui Noikoro and her Permanent Secretary, Ratu Meli Bainimarama about the separation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the apex, the optimum level, the level that should have been the climax of everything that for generation the people of Navosa had aspired to. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was the promise made to them, and I quote: “Be rest assured that Navosa will now become Fiji’s 15 th province”, Ratu Meli Bainimarama told the large delegation. “That is it, I will now work on the other aspects as required before the declaration of Navosa as a province.” ( Fiji Times 28, 1999) However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the untimely death of Adi Kuini Speed had put the Navosa movement in disarray and threw the work of decades into confusion in terms of healing the identity crisis which has been stalking the province for generations. I sincerely hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the separation of the two provinces would be a matter of urgency by the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, esteemed Members of this Parliament, fellow Fijians who are watching this live Parliament tonight, I rise today with a heavy heart not to reject the idea of reconciliation but to urge caution towards the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as proposed by the Coalition Government. While reconciliation is a noble aspiration, we must ask ourselves at what cost. Who will bear the burden of this process? And will it truly heal our people or deepen the very wounds we are trying to close. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members, let us not forget the silent cries of our people, every victim of past atrocities carries scars, both visible and invisible. For them, a Truth Commission is not just an exercise in dialogue. It is a reopening of the pain they have fought to overcome. It is a forced return to a chapter they have desperately tried to close. Honourable Members, do we as leaders have the right to demand this of them? Reconciliation must be built on compassion, not compulsion. Asking victims to relive their anguish, risks re- traumatising them and plunging our nation further into emotional turmoil. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not be fooled by grand promises of reconciliation. This Commission, while presented as a path to healing, carries the dark potential to re-open wounds that have barely begun to heal. Imagine the mother who has lost her son in the chaos of past injustices, or the young girl whose life was forever altered by the acts of cruelty. For them, this is not just about re-visiting history, it is about being forced to relive the anguish they have fought to overcome. Who will stand by these victims when this process tears apart the fragile peace, they have managed to build within themselves? Is it truly just to subject them to this tantamount under the guise of reconciliation? Mr. Speaker, Sir, our nation’s resources are not infinite. In this time of economic struggle, when families barely afford necessities due to high cost of living, is it justifiable to divert millions of</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2471 dollars towards this Commission? Every dollar spent on this initiative, is a dollar not spent on building schools, improving hospitals, getting water to Tamavua, fixing our potholes that are on the streets, or alleviating poverty.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, are we, as representatives of the people, prepared to stand before them, and</h4><p>explain why their struggles must wait while we chase uncertain goals? Furthermore Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a grave risk that this Truth and Reconciliation Commission may become a potential platform for political manipulation. The Government, with all its power and influence could use this Commission to promote its own agenda and selectively target individuals or groups potentially deepening the divisions within our society. What about justice Mr. Speaker, Sir? The Commission by its very nature, cannot prosecute those who committed atrocities. Will we allow perpetrators to walk free? Their heinous crimes forgiven in the name of reconciliation? How will the victims feel seeing their oppressors absolved without consequences? Reconciliation without justice, is an empty promise. One that risks alienating those who suffered the most. Let us be realistic about participation, many of those affected by the events we seek to address, may choose not to engage out of fear, trauma or distrust. Their absence will leave gaps in the narrative, unheard voices and untold stories that undermine the very purpose of reconciliation. Can we truly call it a Truth Commission if it is incomplete? Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members, this path is fraught with danger. It risks harming the very people we aim to help. It risks exhausting resources that could uplift lives. It risks dividing us further, at a time when unity is paramount and above all, it risks betraying the trust of the Fijian people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, reconciliation is not achieved through Commission. It is achieved through honesty, fairness and genuine commitment to justice. We must invest in strengthening our communities, addressing root causes of division and providing real support for the victims. We must not open old wounds without the tools to heal them and let us tread carefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the road ahead is treacherous and the stakes are too high for us to fail. I do not support this Bill before Parliament. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to briefly address a matter of profound importance to our nation. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill. While the pursuit of the Truth and Reconciliation are indeed, a noble objective, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is imperative that these goals are approached with honesty, fairness and respect for the rights of all citizens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill in its current form pertains to undermine the very foundation of our democracy, contradicts the principles of the 2013 Fijian Constitution and deepen existing divisions within our society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not a simple Bill, here we are discussing the events of the last 37 years. This Bill comes at a time when Fijians face unprecedented hardships, and let us not ignored the reality on the ground, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Fiji as a nation is in crisis, and the TRC is nothing more than a convenient diversion... (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>2472 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 HON. P. K. BALA.-...rather than a serious attempt at truth seeking, reconciliation and healing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TRC should not be imposed, just because you have numbers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government points to international examples of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, but their understanding of this is shallow and weak. They should go and research more and see what was the approach taken, and not just come here and talk about Mandela and all those. This Bill is not about reconciliation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a political tool… (Chorus of interjections) HON. P. K. BALA.-... and not a path to unity. It is about the political agendas, the current Chair has acted with self-proclaimed powers over all our people making statements about healing and issuing apologies without any authority. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no formal or informal discussion between the Government and Opposition. I have checked with honourable Leader of the Opposition whether there was any invitation from the honourable Prime Minister on this subject matter, and he told me there was none. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no invitation from the Government to join in Cabinet's Sub- Committee or any Committee on the TRC to put together the draft terms of reference for submission to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us be clear, only a consensus Commission will work, not an imposed one. We should have engaged in a sincere process of dialogue given our special circumstances as a multi-racial, multi-religious country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TRC Bill are set to cover the period from 1987 to the present, and we have just heard from honourable Alipate Tuicolo, going back 248 years. It all will come, and we need to be prepared for this. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it raises the question, why not include from 1977? When the NFP was denied to form the Government? That was a coup without gun, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Expecting this scope to include this… There you go! This is the kind of people we have in this Parliament, and here we are talking about truth and reconciliation. Expanding the scope to include this period would provide a more comprehensive understanding of our political history. In addition, forming a three-person commission with one member from the Government, one from the Opposition and one independent Chair would ensure a balance and a fair process. We would have supported such a structure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I take back to all of you in 1996, the Honourable Prime Minister worked very closely with the then leader of Opposition on the review of the Fiji Constitution Commission. There was a consensus. I want to ask the Honourable Prime Minister that he was able to do that in 1996. Why can’t he do it now? And I know in his response he will consider all what we are saying, because as I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not a simple document. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must ask why is this Bill being pushed through so quickly? What is the urgency? Who truly stands to benefit from the people? The people of Fiji deserve transparency and genuine efforts towards reconciliation, not a hasty decision that will steer up uncertainty. Let us take the time to address the real issue facing our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, reconciliation is not a magic bullet. It requires courage, honesty and a commitment to justice. We cannot achieve truth when the process is political and agenda driven. The reason why I am saying this, because the Opposition was not consulted on this very important</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2473 document. Let us not forget we are also elected Members here! We have the same right like you! We all are equal here! MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. P. K. BALA.- We need proper engagement with all Fijians as equal citizens, Mr. Speaker. Sir. And as a starting point, let us commit to a genuine process of reconciliation. One that respects our Constitution, addresses the needs of all Fijians and builds a future based on equality, unity and shared purpose. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to press the reset button on this process. Let us have a parliamentary process. We can discuss here. We can refer this to the Select Committee, and from both sides we have Members in it, and I know we all will support it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call for a genuine reconciliation. Truth and reconciliation are not important to be reduced to the political convenience of the Coalition Government and its chosen few.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you, and I do not support this Bill in its present form and ask that</h4><p>common sense prevail this evening. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill that is before the Parliament and that is Bill No. 19 of 2024. I think the purpose of the Bill, as it reads in clause 3, the purpose of the Commission is to promote social cohesion through healing and reconciliation. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate open and free engagement in truth telling regarding political upheavals during coup periods to promote closer and healing for survivors of these events. It is very important. It is very painful to open up wounds, but we need to open up those wounds if they are infected because it will remove the pain. We have heard from the submission from my fellow colleagues, from the G16-bloc on their various perceptions of the various coups that have happened in Fiji. Some have talked about the 1987 coup, some have focussed on the 2000 coup, and some have treated those events in isolation. I have not seen or also talked about in its entirety the other coups that also happened in 2006 where many too were also victims. Most are civil servants, most are even sitting on that side of the Parliament, even lost their jobs, given to some political decisions that happened during that period. They are also victims. They will also want to go through the Commission and want to get some answers from those whom they think owe it to them, an explanation. This is the pathway, the process that we need to trust, honourable Bala has gone into lengths saying that this is a political tool, it is not a reconciliation tool. At the same time the honourable Bala is asking for a Committee to be set up by Parliament though a bipartisan approach that will include politicians. This particular Bill is proposing that the Commission will be apolitical. Will leave it as it is, to be apolitical, so they can independently assess and analyse political events and those who are victims of those events or the perpetrators can tell their stories freely to the Commissioners who will be apolitical. So, I do not know what the honourable Bala wants. Whether he says that this is a political tool, and at the same time, he wants politicians to participate and form a Committee, to review this particular Bill. He needs to confirm on what he wants. At the same time the honourable Bala had gone right back to1996, on a bipartisan approach where the Leader of the Opposition then, the late Jay Ram Reddy, with the honourable Prime</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>2474 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 Minister, had worked on a bipartisan approach and the talks that led up to the review of the 1990 Constitution that led to the review of the 1997 Constitution that was enacted through an Act of Parliament. It came through Parliament, not like the Constitution that the honourable Bala is talking about, that was decreed into being and it was an enabling Constitution, just like the 1990 Constitution. We are hoping that after this Truth and Reconciliation Commission, once we bury all that, we will also be able to review and come to freedom where the people of Fiji will be given that choice to select and give their views as to what type of Constitution they want to govern them. These are some of the stepping stones that will reach full political emancipation or freedom, and that should be the aim. I do not know what honourable Ketan Lal was saying when he said that victims should not be compelled, while the Bill clearly states that the survivors will be protected and that is in Clause 16 - Survivor support and witness protection. He is saying that victims should not be compelled but the victims will come in and share their story to the Commissioners. At the same time, honourable Koya has been saying that there is no provision in this Bill that summons witnesses. I do not know whether they know what they are talking about. One is saying that no victim should be compelled, while the other is saying that the victim is compelled. They are contradicting each other. This confusion is coming out from the G16 Bloc contributions. (Honourable Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Again, let me take a point that was raised by honourable Koya in regards to the powers of the Commission that was read out by honourable Sashi Kiran, that was clause 9. So, I urge honourable Koya to read clause 6(j) which talks about the functions of the Commission, which are to do all things to the fulfilment of the objective of the Commission. That needs to be read together with the powers of the Commission in clause 7 and that will come down to the procedures that the Commission will then make to regulate its own procedures in summoning witnesses. That should be read together. It is a pathway that allows this Commission to see that all things that lead to the fulfilment of the objective of the Commission is done by the Commission. The other thing that the honourable Leader of Opposition raised was the truthful confession. I think there is provision in this particular Bill that talks about if you give false information or if you give a false confession, you will be dealt with by the law where the Commission can refer you to the courts. So that is also taken care of, and you should not worry about that. Again, Mr, Speaker, Sir, the purpose and the objective of this Bill is to bring unity, and this is what our nation badly wants at the moment. We need to reopen those wounds, despite them being painful and at the same time, we find solutions, we find healing amongst ourselves and given all the provisions that are given within the Bill, whether Commissioners are also allowed to invite traditional leaders and also religious leaders that will further advise the Commission in coming up with a decision. On the other note, a point that was raised by honourable Sachida, in terms of the Commissioners making a report. In clause 17(3) and (4), it specifies that the copy of the final report must be presented to the State to allow the implementation of the recommendations and the State must take responsible measures within its available resources to implement the recommendations provided in the final report. So, it allows for lessons that will be learnt from the findings of the Commission, and also the recommendation that will allow the State to put in measures and policies to educate us and also our future generations that we do not return to those dark days.</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2475 Another provision that was highlighted by the honourable colleague and friend, honourable Maharaj. There is no provision in this particular Bill that talks about women and sexual offences. If you go to clause 15(10), it says that the Commission may implement special procedures to address the needs of particular survivors such as children and those who have suffered sexual abuse, as well as working with child perpetrators of abuse or violence. So that is also in the Bill. There is also provision in the Bill where those survivors, all those victims, through hearings, will be able to also bring out their case and they are also protected, and at the same time, will be supported from whatever trauma they face, including those who suffered through sexual offences. Again, some of them also raised the point of the Commission that it will be apolitical, and they will be guided by the Code of Conduct that is there in the Bill. It will guide how they will conduct themselves as Commissioners so that they are independent and they will be guided by how they should act with all fairness. Those are some of the things, Mr. Speaker, from what my colleague from the other Bloc – G- 16 have shared but, again, this particular Bill, especially in clause16(3), talks about witness protection. It removes fear, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It allows the perpetrator to come voluntarily, knowing that this particular law, whatever he or she will come and confess, cannot and will quote from clause 16(3): “No evidence taken under this Act is admissible against any person in any Civil or Criminal proceeding, except in the case for a person charged with intentionally giving false evidence before the Commission or intentionally misinterpreting evidence in a manner intended to mislead the Commission or other participants.” So, the perpetrator in here, whoever is a witness, is also protected and this protection will allow them to remove that fear and come out freely, give their story freely, whatever part they played, that the victim may want to know, to find out the truth, so that particular wound that is there for long can be healed. Those are a few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that other colleagues of mine have shared and I have given my views on it. Also, on this truth and reconciliation, it proposes accountability can hold institutions and groups and individuals of their actions. In addition, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission also proposes that healing can help people move on with their lives by providing a space to share their stories and experiences. Many people are awaiting this particular Commission because for years, stories have haunted them and they also want to move away from their past, given what they had faced individually, or as a society, and they want to be released, so that they can release whatever is holding them back. It provides a platform of story sharing and also it puts our history records straight. Also, in nation building when we move towards a Fiji where we are truly free after reconciliation and we work together towards a constitution that we all agree on, these are some of the values and some of the events that we will look back and say, “Oh, we have come this far and we, as a nation, will be strong because we are not tied to our past, we are now forward looking and we want to be united as one as all Fijians.” Those are few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have identified and also share here through my contribution to the debate, and I urge all honourable Members of this House, from Government side, from the G-16 side and from our side - the G9 Bloc, for all of us to support this Bill, if we want to</p><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>2476 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 move this country forward. We have gone past Standing Order 51, we are in the substantive matter and we cannot go back. Although the honourable Leader of the Opposition took a jab at me when he stated that when I was an Opposition Member, I used to argue that in the Standing Order 51, the consultation by the Executive is totally different from the legislative consultation. But, again, I said on the other day that given the urgency of the Bill, given the inadequate policy that was there in the Aquaculture Bill, that needs that urgency that is why Standing Order 51 was relevant at that particular time. However, for this one, I can say that Standing Orders 51 is quite relevant too because it is long overdue for us. I am a political victim, not only as a politician but as a politician who was also going through being victimised not only in here, but also during the time I was in prison. But to come back and have survived, we know that we have that faith that one day when I will walk out of that prison cell. That was what Mr. Nelson Mandela said - when I walk out of the door that lead to my freedom, I knew I had to leave all my bitterness behind. If I still have that bitterness, I would be still locked behind bars of prejudice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, both the oppressor and the oppressed need to be liberated and that is what I hope for, that one day Fiji will be liberated. I see this as a tool not only now but it is also prophetic, and many evangelists prophesied that there will be a Truth and Reconciliation document for Fiji, and I think this is a godly time. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024. While I understand, Sir, the intentions behind this Bill, I believe it will only serve to reopen old scars and many of our people have worked hard to heal. Under the leadership of the former Prime Minister, we achieved something truly remarkable. We were finally welcomed and called Fijians, where anyone born in Fiji is a Fijian. This identity made us all feel at home, fostering a sense of unity and belonging that transcended ethnic and cultural divides. It is a significant step towards building a cohesive and harmonious society. Over more than a century, the descendants of the Girmityas have an integral part of Fijian society. We have built our lives here, contributed to the nation's development and forged strong bonds with our fellow Fijians. Mr. Speaker, since the real question is, who also want reconciliation but do not like is the TRC really for? Mr. Speaker, Sir, as my colleagues have already said, we also want reconciliation but we just do not want reconciliation for the sake of reconciliation. We want a genuine reconciled, sincere, and our humble request to the honourable Prime Minister is that the Commission not to be a toothless tiger. Sir, generational acceptance is not something that can be legislated or imposed, it is earned through shared experiences, mutual respect and understanding. The Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill, while being intentional, risks undermining this hard-earned acceptance by dragging painful memories and divisions that many have already come to terms with. I stand before you as a fourth generation Girmitya but the truth is, I am a proud Kai Ra from the province of Ra. The people of Ra are proud and happy people, yet I ask what is this Bill really for? Who is this Bill really for? These questions resonate deeply with me and many others who share similar sentiments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill by the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister aims to address past political upheavals and human rights violations. Whilst some see it as a way to heal and prevent future conflict, others worry that it might reopen old scars.</p><div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2477 The honourable Prime Minister himself has already asked for forgiveness, not once, but many times and we have all forgiven him. Yet, we seem to be going down the same path, again, where all those special ceremonies are forgotten. We have made significant progress in fostering unity and reconciliation in Fiji. The inclusive identity of being Fijian has brought us closer together, allowing us to move forward as one nation. Re-opening old wounds through this Bill could potentially undo this process, reigniting old grievances and divisions that we have worked so hard to overcome. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge my fellow Members of Parliament to consider the potential consequences of this Bill. Let us not jeopardize the unity and harmony we have achieved. Instead, let us continue to build on the foundation of acceptance and inclusivity that has brought us this far. Let us honour the spirit of unity and acceptance in our beloved nation. We need to stop using the pains of the past as means to be honest. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not understand what they are trying to prove from this Bill. Yes, I am sure the Deputy Prime Minister will try to belittle me saying I did not read the Bill or something, to divert from the fact that this Bill is really just his political football. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a united nation of amazing people who want to live a happy and prosperous life, but this Bill seems to be trying to take the attention away from the true problems the people of Fiji are facing everyday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I oppose the Truth and Reconciliation Bill 2024 and urge my colleagues to do the same. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Members of this august House; today, we stand on the precipice of history, at crossroads between the burdens of our past to the promise of a brighter future. This motion – the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is not simply an administrative measure but an act of nation building. It is a call to confront our past with courage, humility and unyielding commitment to justice. Mr. Speaker, no nation is without its shadows and Fiji is no exception. From the arrival of the Girmityas in 1879 to the political upheavals of 1987, 2000 and 2006, we have been shaped by moments of profound struggle and division. These events etched into the memory of our people have tested the very fabric of our society. They have exposed our vulnerabilities, but they have also strengthened our resilience. Yet, Mr. Speaker, resilience alone is not enough. True healing requires that we confront the uncomfortable truth of our history. It requires that we say, without hesitation or equivocation, what happened during those dark chapters was wrong – 1987 was wrong. Our honourable Prime Minister had confessed to them – 2000 was wrong, 2006 was wrong and if you are to charter a new course, we must begin with three recognition. Honourable Members, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission represents a momentous opportunity, a chance to live the value of our history and give voice to those who have long been silenced. It will provide a sacred space for truth-telling, a forum where the stories of victims, survivors and perpetrators can be told, recorded and honoured. Through this process, we do not aim to open old wounds, but to cleanse them, to allow them to heal in the light of truth. We, Fijians must come together in a spiritual conversation, to speak and hear the truth, heal our differences and</p><div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div><p>2478 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 reconcile as a nation and as a people. The recently concluded National Security and Defence Review has laid bare a stark reality. There is a profound trust deficit within our nation, Fijians distrust their governments, the governments of the past, their institutions and too often even their neighbours. This lack of trust is a threat, not just to our stability, but to the very ideals upon which this nation was founded. Mr. Speaker, in this context, it is heartening to acknowledge the proactive steps taken by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces towards reconciliation under the leadership of Major-General Ro Jone Kalouniwai. The RFMF has embarked on an internal process of reflection, reconciliation and restoration. Recognising its role in the past political upheavals and striving to rebuild trust with the Fijian populace. This initiative serves as a testament to RFMF’s dedication to transformation and offers a beacon of hope for national unity. Mr. Speaker, if the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to succeed, it must serve as more than a historical exercise. It must become a bridge, a means of restoring trust and building faith in the idea that Fiji can and will rise above its divisions. This is not just about uncovering the past. It is about shaping the future Mr. Speaker, history is watching us today. History will judge this House today. The eyes of the Fijian people are upon us, and so too are the eyes of our future generation. They will look back at this moment and ask us whether we had the courage to face the truth, whether we had the vision to seek reconciliation and restoration and whether we had the wisdom to build a nation rooted in justice, equality and in unity. Let us give them something to be proud of, let us ensure that they inherit a nation where diversity is celebrated, whether the bounds of trust are unbreakable and where the ideals of democracy and humanity shine brighter than before. Mr. Speaker, this Commission will not solve all of Fiji's history but it is a beginning. It is a chance to turn the page not by forgetting the past but by learning from it. It is an opportunity to declare with conviction that Fiji's best days lies ahead, not in spite of our history, but because we have chosen to confront it and grow for it. I urge every Member of this House to rise to this occasion. Let us seize this moment with gravity and hope, the hope that it demands. Let us establish this Commission as a beacon of our commitment to truth, reconciliation and a united Fiji. Mr. Speaker, I support this motion that is before the House. MR. SPEAKER.- We now have two more speakers. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this important this notion, motion, Bill that is before the House. I think that is one of the most important things that we have ever discussed in this Chambers as the honourable Faiyaz Koya has said. As I have sat here today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and listened to the various viewpoints that have been expressed, one thing that gives me a bit of comfort, despite the differences in what we are saying, as I sit and listen to the different views, I sense a shared desire amongst all of us that are sitting in Parliament today discussing this. I sense that shared desire. We have the same vision of what we want; a better Fiji and we all know the things that have impacted on our country that is holding us back from achieving what we aspire to, which is that better Fiji. These are the sentiments that have come to me as have I sat here, gone in, come back inside, gone out, come back and the thing that comes to my mind is this novel that we read about when we were in secondary school, the novel of Cry, the Beloved Country. As I sat, I sense of crying for the</p><div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2479 country that we want in this country and we know that truth and reconciliation are part of the processes to get there. If we look at the purpose of the Bill that we have, clause 3 is very clear. It talks about the importance of promoting social cohesion through healing and reconciliation. Social cohesion is fundamentally important for a country like Fiji, we have people of different beliefs, of different ethnicities come together to be a country. We need that social cohesion, that cement that binds us together so that we can fully become what we can be as a country, and that maybe one day we can aspire to be the way the world should be as it was said years ago. Later on, events have happened in our past that showed that maybe we were not the way the world should be. There were things that covered over. But then I think to my mind is something that is important for us. Now, there have been various ways that we have tried to build this social cohesion. We have talked about the issue of the common name; common name so that everyone in this country have a sense of common identity in the country. I am glad now that the terminology of Fijian is something that has bind us together. These are the kinds of things that have a social cohesion; when we can identify together with a place, the common name that has come through gives us a common sense of identity and a focus away from ethnicity, which has been our big stumbling block over the years, to take us away from that view on just ethnicity. Look at other things related with class, the rich and those are not so well off, as more of a stronger focussed on the things that have held us back in the past. Over and above this, we have talked about in the Constitution, the development of socio- economic rights, free education to lift people up. These are the things that bind us together. Social cohesion has come through this way, upward mobility, shelter, housing, good quality of life and for us, we talked about equal lease distribution, making all iTaukei feel equally important, equally valid so that what we stood for, when the lease money comes you are equally valid, that gives you that sense of togetherness or social cohesion. When you talk about social cohesion, one of the things that is important to get self-cohesion is action; things that you do so that you make the elements of society cohere together, they become one. That is something that we have been doing over the past few years, not perfectly, but it is something that was moving there. What I am trying to say here, Mr. Speaker, that healing also comes through action. Healing through action, healing and reconciliation come from shared values and, I believe also by class equality; equality of all people within the country is something that we need to do. Of course, the words that come to mind and all of us believe in this; all of us on this side, all of us on that side, we believe in this. Love your fellow man as you love yourself. There is no one that can say that they do not believe in that and that is what I have sensed. One thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also truth, truth precedes reconciliation. When you have truth preceding a reconciliation, the output is trust. When people understand the situation as it should be. The question for us is, can that truth be done by invitation only or sometimes do you have to compel the truth in order to get the reconciliation? Maybe in some cases, and we believe, this is what we are talking about, sometimes that truth, you need a sense of compulsion to make it happen. There are a lot of things happened in this country where people have not spoken the truth. There are things in this country, we know some things happened, but the things that happened behind that, we do not know - 1987, 2000, 1977, all of these other things, we do not what happened behind it. The figures that we can see, but we do not see the shadowy figures in the back, the ones who are pulling the strings. That is part of the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You see the pons, but you do not see those who are pulling the strings, and that is a fundamental important part of getting to the truth. So, without truth, how can we reconcile?</p><div><a name="92">Page 92</a></div><p>2480 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 This question needs to be asked and known, who were the instigators? Why do they go scot- free? Some people end up in prison but the real instigators, they go scot-free and we say for the rest of us, let us reconcile, even though these people are scot-free. This is a very important part of talking about the truth. Truth telling is critical and this is our point that truth-telling may require compulsion. We do not believe, the Bill as it is now has that element of compulsion that is strong. To make that compulsion enviable, you cannot violate that sense of compulsion that makes sure that people will tell the truth where it needs to be told. That is a major concern that we have from this side. When you have that compulsion to tell the truth, then the trust will grow. Trust is knowing who did what and why? Who was behind it? Who are the shadowy figures that we have not seen? Alot of time we limit our discussion to the pons, to the people whom we see, but not the shadowy figures in the background on what they did. Who were the movers and shakers? If you want to reconcile, those movers and shakers must come clean because they hide behind veneers, curtains and rooms, and they hide in the darken alleys, in the little cupboards, you need a light to be shone so we can see. That is all part of the truth that needs to come out. When this truth is apparent, the trust is built up, then the reconciliation can move forward. That is an important aspect. People want truth. This needs to be done in an environment where we deal with it transparently. Those who started these things, they must come clean. There must be systems and mechanisms and powers in this Bill that make sure that they are coming clean actually happens. That is fundamental, and that is, I think, where the difference is. We all want the same thing but we believe on this side that is lacking. People want truth on things that have hurt them badly. Listening to the debate that we have here, we have seen the amount of hurt that has happened over the years in various areas, in 1987, all of these other things; Navosa history, colo wars, indigenous slavery. A lot of iTaukei do not know about indigenous slavery. They did not know what buli used to do, take this person, give him to the estates. All those kinds of things you do not know about, enforced labour in colonial times by the buli, girmitiya, Navosavakadua, whole villagers being taken from Ra, based in Kadavu, et cetera. These were all part of our history. A lot of people do not know about these things. However, when that truth comes out, then we understand things, why they happened and that helps us to reconcile with what has happened to us. Melanesian history, all of this in the sense of victimhood, in all of this, truth helps to get people through. What truth? This truth, the forces that drove what happened, whether it was colonial interest, power struggles, ethnonationalism, local elites who used the message of ethnonationalism to serve their own interests. They talk ethno-nationalistic issues to serve their own purposes. That is part of the truth. All these needs to come out. All these needs to be illuminated. People use that to serve their own message to get power, look after their own interests. Religious fundamentalism was very powerful in the past. These are some of the things that need to be addressed, very touchy things, but we need to shine light on it, illuminate it and talk about it. So, who were the instigators? The spiders, that is part of the truth. I know that it is a very touchy subject, but we need to cauterize it and that truth will free us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, reconciliation unlike repentance is a symmetrical relationship. Repentance is different, I did something, I repent. Reconciliation means that both parties are in a symmetrical relationship, they need to be able to share truth. So that both parties can see each other’s side and then they can reconcile. If the truth is not given on both sides then how can they reconcile? It is symmetrical relationship.</p><div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2481 Catharsis happens when both parties come together and that is what we want. We want that better country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have been reading over these past two days about Truth and Reconciliation Commission. One thing I have realised, one of the quotes that I have, “these mechanisms, they are not created to take mankind to heaven but to save humanity from hell.” I have read that somewhere and I just wrote it down. I cannot remember where I saw it, but in one of the readings that I had. That is what it is. It cannot elevate you to that particular level but save you from going down to the depths of where you do not want to go. Another thing that is very important in all of these is impartiality and the perception that a person is impartial, that a system is impartial and those that are working the system are impartial. These are the things that build trust. If people feel that things are partial in the system or the players are partial, that is the thing that takes away trust. So, all Commissioners, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was thinking about this, are appointed by the President. There is no control over by us on who those people are and there is no oversight, but the President is voted in by the Government of the day. So there could be in some minds see that as an undue influence of the Government on who the President appoints. It is very important that when we put the Commissioners together, everyone sees them as entirely impartial. This is one of the issues we think needs to be dealt with by us and looking at this. Representation of major parties has been suggested, it could build trust. Honourable Bulitavu has suggested maybe we should not put the politics into it but that is something that we need to weigh out. How do we make sure that the key players are not only impartial but seen as impartial? They are perceived as impartial by all parties. That is fundamentally important. Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the Bill, the functions of the Bill focussed largely on the victims. That is okay, that is a good thing, but there is very little on the perpetrators. Hardly anything on the perpetrators except maybe clause 6(d) which talks about creating a platform for social accountability which is good through constructive interchange between survivors. But that is just creating the platform, and clause 6(i), which talks about creating a platform that promotes a culture of truth, reconciliation and healing. But in both of these parts of clause 6, you do not find anything that holds perpetrators to account. That, I think is an important element that is missing. I noticed that in the Bill it says, the powers of the Commission can examine under oath but this issue that we are talking about, about the powers to summon. The honourable Sashi Kiran has said that the power to summon is now in clause 9 but in clause 9 it states in a procedure. If it is up to the Commission, a procedure is up to Commission whether they have this procedure or that procedure. If it is critical, the Commission must have the power to summons, this must be a policy, that must be inviable, that you cannot violate. The only way that you can do that is by writing it in to the mother legislation itself, rather than leaving it to regulations or schedules which a Minister can change at his whim. The things that are fundamentally important, they should be inviable, they must be written into the law itself, not placed in a procedure, not in a schedule, not a regulation, they must be embedded in the law itself. If it is critical, it should be protected so that it cannot be removed, it should be inviable, and that is one of the concerns that we have as you have heard from the various expressions that were made from this side of the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We do not want our Truth and Reconciliation Commission to be like a “cleanex” Commission, just a lot of emotional release but is easy going on perpetrators. That must not happen! We do not want this to be just an exercise for Government to legitimise itself by what it does, by putting everybody through the process of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Without completing the process of truth telling, you can just kick the can down the road, but eventually you would have to deal with it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when there is an ugly, unresolved</p><div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div><p>2482 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 injustice and that is what have Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as you have listened to the comments, and there are many unresolved issues in this country. We know! There are many of them before we became a country, before we became a colony. There is a lot of things that are embedded in our psyche, in the history of our parents, our tribes and our families, that are embedded there that are unresolved. And these are the kinds of things that pull at the fabric of society. And there is an opportunity to hold it out well and layout in the sun and deal with it in public through a trust commission. Mr. Speaker, Sir, few other things that I want talk about, while the key purpose of the Bill is to facilitate open and free engagements, the Bill itself has failed to define what truth telling is. This as I have said before, is fundamentally important to this whole exercise. Part One, Section 32 appears to confine the purpose and work of the Commission to the coup periods. This seems to eliminate those in in other things beyond the coup periods and some of those things have already been expressed in this Parliament. If I go with it at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker Sir, this is my concern, and I think we all agree. We all agree to the need for truth and reconciliation. Everybody in this country knows that we need truth in order to get to reconciliation. We agree that truth is necessary for reconciliation. We can all also agree that the right process brings the right output and the right outcome. And my contention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill, as it is right now, is not strong enough in ensuring that the truth will come out. When the truth comes out entirely, those shadowy places that are in the dark shadows, when they come out and we can see that people can feel that the truth is known and that will help reconciliation. As I said, it has to be a symmetrical relationship between the parties. Everyone has got a lot of hurt in them, that needs to be addressed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, the way forward that I see that this Bill needs to be improved. What we have here needs to be improved. The truth and reconciliation are needed. We need to be able to work on this together. You have taken this to consultation as part of the executive. We need the legislature, the people’s Parliament, which includes us on this side, to be part of that process. We have not been part of that process. We have not been part of that process of scrutiny. You have done as the Executive, Assistant Ministers have done that, but we need the legislature to do this and one of the most critical things in our history, so we need to be on this together. We need to join it together, all of us! We need to allow the full scrutiny of the people represented by the Members of Parliament on this Bill, not just the executive! Allow the in-depth scrutiny by the rest of the people, not just the executive. That is a fundamental of law And I appeal to the honourable Prime Minister, please Sir, do not ride on the tyranny of the majority. Allow us all to participate, to review this Bill again, to improve it because we do not want to get this truth and reconciliation wrong. We have to make sure that it serves a purpose. We do not want to pass a Bill today and later on find that we had flaws on it, that we could have corrected if we had worked on improving this in partnership together in this Parliament. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by saying, that no one, in his or her right frame of mind will ever oppose or refuse to cooperate in a process that in my view and in the views of so many people in this country, is going to be a watershed moment in our independent history. Before I go on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me thank all the honourable Members who have spoken, and with their wisdom and experience including honourable Minister for Education, as the leader of the SODELPA Party have supported this Truth and Reconciliation Bill.</p><div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2483 And I want to thank honourable Bulitavu, for unravelling the legal buffoonery that came from the other side, Mr. Speaker Sir, about elements of the various clauses in the Truth and Reconciliation Bill. Unfortunately, the honourable Leader of the Opposition got caught into that buffoonery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to say this to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, that as honourable Members of Parliament, it is all our duty to lead by example and desist playing what I call “gutter politics” by opposing this Bill, which in fact lays out the basis for putting a permanent closure to the darkest chapter of history of our independent nation. I heard from the other side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of them who oppose the Bill said they know what is best for the nation. They said they support truth and reconciliation. No legislation ever passed in Parliament is going to be perfect, is going to have every nitty-gritty detail, every opinion covered in that law. That is why laws change, as time evolves, and as the need arises. But in this case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the important thing is this, that our honourable Prime Minister had the guts, had the courage in 1996 to work across the aisle, when he was in power. He had the Government on his side, but he worked on the other side and offered reconciliation, offered his hands of friendship and worked with the then Leader of the Opposition, Justice Jai Ram Reddy and delivered one of the world acclaimed 1997 Constitution. That was an act of reconciliation! That was an act of genuineness! And here again today, this honourable Prime Minister is again offering us and has set out to do what he tried to do and what he achieved in 1997 as part of this Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I know in 2017, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we moved a motion for truth and reconciliation, same language was used that I heard from honourable Members today, that it will incite ill-will, hostility. This is what we heard, but nothing of value in life is ever easy. And if it is, indeed, invaluable to the social, political and economic advancement of our nation, the task becomes even harder. Then, we discovered on 13 th September, 2023 when a motion for Parliament to approve the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission moved and enable articulated by the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, a role that was given to her by the honourable Prime Minister, was approved despite the strong resistance from the Opposition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the future back beacons. I know just a month ago the honourable Leader of the Opposition was reported in the media to be fully supportive of the Truth and Reconciliation Bill and the processes outlined in the then proposed legislation. As the honourable Minister for Defence said, “we thank the Commander of the RFMF for leading the way for reconciliation within the Military” and honourable Naivalurua talked about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, truth and reconciliation or reconciliation and truth telling is not for the faint hearted, but it is the best way forward for a genuinely united and harmonious nation. It is a vital cog in the ongoing task of the Coalition Government to reset the moral compass of our nation. The Commission is a prerequisite to genuine healing, which is so crucial to our effort to make Fiji what we all want, the land of hope and opportunity. And again, I want to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this process is not going to incite ill-will or hostility, nor impinge on rights and freedoms of our people. I cannot imagine and I cannot understand, when honourable Members from the other side are talking about ill-will and hostility being created as part of a truth and reconciliation process. You look at all the functions of the Commission, the process, cooperation, procedure everything that is in</p><div><a name="96">Page 96</a></div><p>2484 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 this Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, lays down the process, which is going to bring people together, which is not going to create ill-will and hostility. Our people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you know they talk about politics, yet they were all politicising and politicking when opposing the Bill. Prejudging the work of the Commission. Honourable Usamate, if I heard him correctly, he said “Oh, His Excellency the President is appointed by the Parliament and by the Government” and by extension, he was implying that His Excellency the President is going to be impartial in appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. What an insult, Mr. Speaker. Sir! In fact, he might have breached the Standing Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by saying something like that and the Bill is very clear that this is going to be an Independent Commission, independent of the state, independent of political parties. How can that be politicised? The Government is bringing this Bill to Parliament, and as I said, we are not saying that every law that comes in this Parliament is going to be perfect! But this Government, this Prime Minister has had the courage and the vision to bring it in this Parliament, and they are saying “oh we want to support this, but no, we do not like some of the provisions” that is a political throw away on all of those on the other side who are opposing this Bill hide behind, because they know that the people of this country want reconciliation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they want it! They there already reconciling and yet they are the representatives of the people. This is an opportunity for them in this Parliament, if they do not like a certain elements of the law, I would have thought that they would support this Bill, that this is a step in the right direction. We are not going to solve every little problem that, Honourable, Usamate, was talking whether it is education, health, infrastructure, social cohesion, merging interests, you know, he was almost like reading a first-year sociology assignment. We all know that! But the important thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this reconciliation process, is leadership. We can disagree with little provisions here or there, but what is required in this, is leadership. Leadership is about averting disaster not creating conditions in which it thrives. This is a quote from late Justice Jai Ram Reddy’s speech 28 years ago and he further said, “creating an environment conducive to unity can be a slow process.” There is no overnight solution. With genuine goodwill, united as a mighty collective force and a willingness to sacrifice personal gains in the national interest, we can succeed. And this is precisely what the Honourable Prime Minister and this Government is trying to do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this Truth and Reconciliation Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I say a little bit more on one of the provisions, let me just respond. I think it is important to respond to some of the comments that were made by honourable Members from the other side, because people are listening to this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it really pains me to hear Honourable Maharaj putting out the lies and the venom, and playing the same gutter politics that I think was being played by his former leaders, and in particular his former General-Secretary of now a dead party, I guess. But what is the need for those kind of lies and venom when we are talking about reconciliation? What is the need, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Honourable Sachida Nand was talking about the fact that the report will only go to the President. I mean, that shows a total lack of understanding. The Bill says that the recommendations of the Commission will go to the State. They have not actually read the Bill, and they are trying put that out as a shortcoming of the Bill and opposing it. And that is why I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they</p><div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2485 are using this legal buffoonery, you know this misinterpretation and telling the people out there that this Bill is going to create ill-will hostility, bring pain and open up new wounds. I cannot understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how this effort, through the Truth and Reconciliation Bill, will do that! I am surprised that honourable Praveen Bala and honourable Alvick Maharaj, not just today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a leader, the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, a woman leader of national stature, someone who has done so much work in the NGO sector. This constant barrage of attacks on her, just because she is gaining the popularity of the people out there and they are worried about politics! They are saying do not play politics, but they were playing politics, because they want to pull her down. Yet, she has done so much work in the last so many years, and particularly in the last two years in Parliament, and I take my hat off for her. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think from all the provisions in the Bill, and particularly section 6, 7, 8 and 9, and particularly when you look at section 6, the functions of the Commission. It lays down very clearly what the Commission sets out to do. It is just needs leadership and this Parliament and us as Members of Parliament, have a real one lifetime opportunity in this country, in this Parliament, to bury the dark days of the past. We have this opportunity. I urge the honourable Leader of the Opposition, to change his mind now! Because today in his speech, he has failed as a national leader! He had the opportunity to bring his group, but I know he has his own challenges in those group. But again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, you will go down in history, and all those who will not support this Bill today will go down in history as betraying the people of this country and missing the one-time opportunity in this Parliament. One time opportunity in this Parliament to create history. And honourable Leader of the Opposition, you have the opportunity now! This is your moment! Support this Bill, or else you will go down in history as a weak leader, weak in…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> …standing on the truth.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> …weak in standing on the truth, weak in getting your group in a direction, and you will go down in history as living with the legacy of the past leaders that you were part of. I urge you, honourable Members on the other side, please support this Bill! This Bill is the right Bill, it is timely, it is appropriate, and this is going to create history! If you want to be part of history, support the Bill, otherwise you are not part of this history that we are going to create, and this honourable Prime Minister is going to create for this country. I support this Bill very strongly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call upon the honourable Prime Minister to speak in reply, if I may offer some clarification. In my trade, it is called non-binding unsolicited views on certain issues that were raised by the Members. It may help one fully to understand the Bill before you. On the interpretation to be accorded to Section 9, and the powers of the Commission through the subpoena witnesses, I am very much drawn to the views of honourable Bulitavu in how Section 9 should be understood and interpreted. On the issue of consultations and the Committee’s not visiting certain areas and hear victims, the Committee’s consultations in my understanding was not for hearing of victims, although they did hear some of them in the process. Consultations was for the purpose of building the legal frame for the complaints and even confessions to be heard. And that is where we are now, under Clause 15, that provides a mechanism for hearing from those victims.</p><div><a name="98">Page 98</a></div><p>2486 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 As I have said these are purely for clarifications over doubts that may exist, again, its non- binding and unsolicited. I now invite the honourable Prime Minister to speak in light of the Bill. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions. It has been very enlightening, and I mentioned the other day, that I had tried to move this motion in the Business Committee when I was Leader of the Opposition, but the very same reasons coming up today, that it would open up old wounds, also came up at the Business Committee at that time. The honourable Leader of Opposition and the honourable Usamate were both at that Business Committee Meeting, as well as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. What happened then, was I had tried to introduce this as an opposition motion, to avoid the pit falls of 1987, 2000 and 2006. So that we move forward with our eyes open knowing why Rabuka did what he did, why George Speight did what he did, and so on. But that was not accepted, and two weeks later, you know, when I came back and said well those are the eyes of March. On 15 th March, this year was the sad shooting in Christchurch. They had not gotten to the bottom of the differences that existed in their country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all those that have contributed, and I thank you for your clarification, and I would just like to say that my contributions, I shared at the Committee under the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation had many consultations. I did not say, that they went all over the country, everywhere and consulted with everyone. They said they had many consultations with victims and perpetrators of different political events. Consultations were held with civil societies, faith-based groups, human rights activists, media organisations, political parties, communities in the North, West and Central divisions. They did not say that they went everywhere, honourable Member. The functioning of the Commission is very clear in the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir. From day one, I had stayed clear of the preparatory work for the Bill, because so many people are always pointing at me. They probably thought that I would hijack the Committee, but I congratulate them for finishing their work and coming to the Parliament with the draft Bill. The Commission will operate independently and will be reporting to His Excellency, the President by nature and virtue of their appointment as well. The Bill itself says it applies to the State, the State is obliged to act. I have highlighted the part here on that section which says that the report is submitted and the State has to act. So, it is not a toothless Commission, the State must state the recommendations for the State implementation Section 17. The State must take reasonable measures within its available resources to implement recommendations provided in the final report. It is not a toothless Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I once again thank everyone who has contributed. Government will continue to do all within its power to act with the existing law to allow people to come and present themselves before the Commission without in any way being subjected to fear, intimidation or violence. Life will go on normally, and people will be able to present their views freely. We have to expect the media as well as those who act as keyboard warriors through the social media to act responsibly as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the assurances of our most highest consideration, I recommend this Bill to the House and respectfully request that the question be now put.</p><div><a name="99">Page 99</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2487 MR.
