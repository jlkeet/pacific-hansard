<body><h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3><h4>SPEAKER’S RULING</h4><p>Point of Order – Honourable Jone Usamate Honourable Members, I have a ruling on the Point of Order by honourable Jone Usamate yesterday. I will now rule on that Point of Order raised by the honourable Member on Tuesday, 3 rd December, 2024. On the issue of concern, whereby he raised that before the ruling was delivered on the Point of Order by honourable Alvick Maharaj, the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection was given the floor to speak. I have taken the time to carefully peruse the Uncorrected Hansard Report of Monday, 2 nd December, 2024, and I can confirm that I had given the floor to honourable Maharaj for his Point of Order and immediately after that, I gave the floor to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection to speak. I can also confirm that after the honourable Minister for Women, Child and Social Protection had spoken, I proceeded to deliver my ruling on the Point of Order by honourable Maharaj. Honourable Members, Standing Order 74(3) and (4) are very clear. Clause (3) provides, and I quote: “When a point of order has been stated, the member who raises it resumes his or her seat and no member, except with the Speaker’s permission, may rise until the Speaker has decided the matter.” Clause (4) provides, and I quote: “The Speaker may rule on a point of order when it is raised without allowing any discussion except from a member permitted by the Speaker.” Honourable Members, it is very clear to me as the Chair that Clause 4 overalls stands over Clause 3 permission, that in fact, the Speaker has the right to permit any Member before he makes a ruling on the Point of Order. Honourable Members, I want to assure the honourable Jone Usamate and all the honourable Members that there was no breach of procedures nor any deviation from the accepted practices as clearly outlined in Standing Order 74(3) and (4) - no Member except with the Speaker’s permission may rise. In that respect, I hereby rule that the Point of Order raised by honourable Jone Usamate in yesterday’s proceedings is out of order and the matter shall rest there.</p></body>
