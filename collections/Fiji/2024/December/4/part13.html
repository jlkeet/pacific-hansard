PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to deliver a statement on Fiji delegation’s engagement at COP29 which concluded on 24 th November in Baku, Azerbaijan. The Government has recognised climate change as the greatest security threat of our times and one that we cannot address alone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government acknowledges the importance of engaging in multilateral processes such as the climate change Conference of the Parties (COP), to ensure our voices are heard and the challenges we face are recognised and addressed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I provide an update on COP29 outcomes, I would like to extend my sincere and deep gratitude to all civil servants and officials involved in preparation for COP29 and their direct engagement in the negotiations held in Baku. I want to take this opportunity also to thank the honourable Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity to lead the Fiji Delegation this year, and for his advocacy and leadership both at the regional level, and at the international level. I would also like to acknowledge our chief negotiator, PS Shivendra Michael, Ambassador Amena Yauvoli, and other senior people within the team for providing timely and expert advice across the agenda items and throughout what was very contentious and difficult negotiation process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were very well prepared this year. Led by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change with support from the Ministry of Finance, we organised technical working group meetings, prepared well-consulted policy briefs, prepared a communications strategy and held pre-departure delegation briefings for both Ministers and government officials. In the interest of transparency and accountability, we announced the Fiji Government delegation, disclosed how much government funds were being utilised and funding sources for delegates, and held press conferences to answer any questions from the media and public, unlike of what we saw in previous years I was always our intention that this process be people-centred and contact sensitive, transparent and accountable. This year, Fiji took a 57-member delegation to COP. Ninety percent (90 percent) of the delegates were fully funded by external partners and through funding arrangements in place annually to support the Small Island state participation in these critical meetings. The total cost of the COP29 engagement to Government was only FJ$239,000 contrary to some of the misinformation or disinformation with figures such as $6 million, et cetera, put out by people outside of this Parliament. Mr. Speaker Sir, we ensured that our delegation was interagency and multi-stakeholder, engaging various ministries, indigenous people reps, youth, academia and even Members of the Opposition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the few countries at COP which had in our delegation the honourable Leader of the Opposition and two other members. And I want to take this opportunity to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his participation and for his contribution and support to the delegation in Baku. I would also like to say Mr. Speaker, Sir, that government had made a strategic decision at this COP to send a larger ministerial delegation, due to the high political nature of this year’s</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2397 negotiations and the decisions which allowed us to engage fully when key unsolved negotiations issues were taken to the ministerial levels for decision. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year Fiji identified 14 priority thematic engagement areas including climate finance, loss and damage, oceans, mitigation, adaptation, indigenous people and local communities and gender, to name a few among others. There were over 90 agenda items under discussion and our negotiators worked in teams to cover all relevant items. Each thematic area was assigned a ministerial lead, thematic lead, core lead, and support officials. I must say that it is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the Fiji Government delegation that we were able to not only cover each priority thematic area, but also Mr. Speaker, Sir, influence outcomes at key junctures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing the climate crisis is not just crucial for our environment, it is crucial for protecting the lives and livelihoods of Fijian people, and protecting the stability and growth of our economy. To be able to respond effectively to the scale of the challenge that we face as small island state, we need to face and access predictable and adequate climate financing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, COP29 in Baku was dubbed “the finance COP”, because all parties were mandated to agree to a new target for the amount of climate financing that parties would commit to deploy annual to support developing country. This new target was required to replace the current target to deploy US$100 billion per year as climate finance. The new target referred to as the New Collecting Quantified Goal (NCQG) has been under negotiation for over two years and was required to be agreed at COP29. And given this slow progress to date, to reduce global emissions and support resilience-building, developing countries urgently require financing to implement both their mitigation commitments and adaptation plans. At COP29, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our negotiation teams worked diligently to secure the best possible outcome across the negotiation streams. In many cases both ministers and negotiators started their day early in the morning, at 6am sometimes, and often finishing in the early hours of the next morning sometimes as far as 3.00 a.m. or 4.00 a.m. We face many challenges given the state of current geopolitics, and in the final days of COP29, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) were left with no choice but to walk out of the negotiation room as our priorities had not been properly accounted for within the financial decision text that was before us. Although the situation was politically and technically challenging, these actions serve to increase the ambition and ensured that there was no risk that the parties would adopt decisions that represented a step backwards. Fiji, Barbados and Samoa, as well as high-level representatives from least developed countries and the European Union, the US and others including Australia, constituted a small group of 15 individuals that in a closed room setting negotiated to salvage the COP29 finance deal. Together, SIDS and LDCs represented the majority of developing countries, and we used our weight as SIDS and Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), as a joint block to push for progress and ambition. While the final outcome falls short of our expectations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it represents a significant improvement from the original version. In fact, it does not cross our redlines. The final COP29 decision on the new quantified collective goals fall for climate financing from all public and private sources to reach US$1.3 trillion per year by 2035. Within that goal, is the commitment to ensure that developed countries take the lead on providing US$300 billion per year by 2035.</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>2398</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 While this goal represents a tripling of the financing floor, developed countries are currently committed and it sits within the broader the US$1.3 trillion-goal. I know the deal has been criticised for seeking to achieve the $300 billion through a wide variety of sources and for the decision to include contributions from developing countries to multi-lateral development banks within the scope of the sources contributing to this target. In fact, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition would know, the discussion on the contributor base took a lot of time, particularly in the first week, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While this is a pronounced challenge for some of the larger and wealthier high emitting developing countries, it is less of an issue in our context and circumstances. And we can take some comfort with the understanding that an increase has been committed alongside elements of the decision which recognise the need to address many of the access issues we face. The decision includes commitments to support nationally led approaches and simplify access to international climate funds. While the decision fall short of the direct commitment to scale our financing for loss and damage, it does recognise loss and damage issues and includes specific mention of the need to develop new and specific solutions for SIDS and LDCs. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the AOSIS’s position which includes us, the Pacific Small Island Developing States, we initially went into the negotiating room with a US$39 billion finance floor that, obviously, was not acceptable, but we see the US$300 billion as a floor and we feel that a large chunk of that should be available for small island developing states. The other significant event, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the operationalisation of the Loss and Damage fund. In fact, the World Bank is going to be the financial intermediary, and we hope that all the mechanisms and processes, the board for the fund for responding to Loss and Damage has also been appointed. We are hoping that by at least 2026, Small Island Developing States would be able to access some of those funding. Mr. Speaker, this new finance goal will replace the previous US$100 billion per year target, and despite some of the gaps in the cohesiveness of the decision, Government will work to ensure that the new targets and commitments are seen through in our engagement with development partners and international climate funds. We have no choice but to hold parties to account, and to ensure this deal will translate into the new and additional financing we need urgently to increase and scale up our response to climate change here in Fiji. Other important outcomes Mr. Speaker, Sir, achieved this year, include progress to further agree on guidance and rules for carbon market mechanisms. The honourable Prime Minister talked about this the other day, and the agreement on new guidelines for transparent climate reporting. The extension of the enhanced Lima Work Programme on Gender (LWPG) and climate change and a decision confirming the institutional arrangements between the Fund for responding to loss and damage and the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one other issue that we advocated very strongly and pushed for was the funding allocation for the new Pacific Resilience Fund (PRF), which the Economic Ministers, including Australia and New Zealand agreed for Tonga to host the Secretariat. That fund we are targeting US$250 million by the end of this year. And I know Australia and New Zealand have both committed significant funding towards the Pacific Resilience Fund. We are hoping that by 2026 that fund will also be operational and that a lot of those funding that would be available for Pacific Island countries. In fact, the decision to set up the PRF was a decision of the Pacific Islands. It was approved by the Finance Ministers this year. We are going to</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2399 have a special Finance Ministers meeting in March to ensure that all the legal, financial and institutional mechanisms are put in place and that the fund would be ready and available for Pacific Island countries by 2026. The other advantage of that fund, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be that a lot of those could be localised at the community level, to build community resilience for the Pacific Islands in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that I was actually feeling very good, and I must say that I was proud of the leadership our delegation across the COP29 Negotiations. Fiji was appointed as the G77 and China coordinator for adaptation, where they were entrusted to coordinate a group of 134 member States. Our officials continued to coordinate Pacific priorities in relation to loss and damage proactive engagement in the board of the Fund for responding to loss and damage. In addition, our PS for Environment and Climate Change was selected as co-chair of the Oceans and Climate Change Dialogue alongside Brazil and Belgium. And again, this was negotiated by us through our respective grouping in bilateral meetings. And Fiji worked with the large friends of the Ocean Constituency to agree on the landscape and the language of the Annual Ocean Statement, which was delivered on behalf of 93 parties in the closing plenary by the Permanent Secretary for Environment and Climate. Beyond the negotiations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ministerial high-level delegation, along with relevant officials, engaged in various side events and in bilateral meetings and stakeholder meetings. The Ministers were there, explored a range of new and emerging potential partners to support our efforts and the delegation, through these engagements and the media, amplified Fiji's needs, challenges, achievements in ways that will continue to unlock benefits beyond the scope of COP29. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ultimately, we have to understand that this is multilateral process and there are always going to be difficult challenges, compromises and trade-offs to navigate. But I must say that again Fiji played a very important role. Fiji was seen as a leader amongst the AOSIS group and our negotiators lived up to those expectations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to always remember who we do this for. And we must continue to work with the volition and willingness to overcome the challenges put in place by those that resist the science and its implications. Our future depends on it, our children and grandchildren depend on us as leaders to ensure that there is a sustainable future forward. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all those who were part of the delegation, including those who were funded by other agencies, but had the Fiji badge and were part of the Fiji delegation and supported the Fiji delegation in all our negotiations. MR. SPEAKER.- May I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his statement. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, I do acknowledge the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for his leadership and thank him for his Ministerial Statement. As he alluded to in his Statement, I was part of the delegation, but now I am giving my response as the Leader of the Opposition again. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did caution the independent members who attended from the Opposition. We are here as delegation, national delegation, let us look at national priorities that respect the leadership, but at the same time make the most of the opportunity to learn from COP. Because just by attending one COP it does not mean you understand COP. Know the intricacies, complexities and</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>2400</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 the diversities in COP and let alone the politics of COP. I will come back to that later, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We all understand the importance of Fiji’s participation to COP29 or COP conferences for that matter. They are global gatherings where 190 plus nations come together to address the urgent crisis of climate change as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. I do not have to go back into it. We went into COP29 with high expectations - a finance COP. But let us not beat around the bushes as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not been able to achieve, and our expectations were not met. And that is something probably beyond to our control, but more to the developed countries. But of course, the fight does not stop, and we need to continue. And not only fighting, but of course diplomacy as well, and that needs to start even after now for next year. The promises from way back in 2009, the new collective quantify goal, we still fall short, and we made our demands. Again, this is very important because of Article 2 of the Paris Agreement of the 1.5, particularly for the Small Island Development States. Because now in COP they are trying to dilute the voices of the United Nations particularly the special circumstances of SIDS and there is a lot of effort now in trying to quieten that voice. And for us it is very important because 1.5 is to stay alive as the late Foreign Affairs Minister of Marshall Island, Tony de Brum usually mentioned in previous COPs, Mr Speaker, Sir. So, the financing is very important, but we are not there yet. And particularly for us, the link to the other articles whether it is on loss and damage, whether it is on adaptation and mitigation, as alluded to by the Finance Minister, Sir. The delegation. Do we really need to send a big delegation? I leave that to Government to answer, but I know that Government has learned their lessons from what they used to say in the past. We know that this is the biggest existential threat that faces Fiji and the Pacific Island countries. And we need our voice in COP. But I leave that question to Government to answer it, because unfortunately a Cabinet Member questioned the delegation in a … HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- …very irresponsible. As raised in the Point of Order on Monday, but I will ask the honourable Prime Minister to sort that out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is very unbecoming of a Cabinet Minister to raise such question on the delegation. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji on 29 th October, an article by Maureen Penjueli stated that, or asked this question, is Fiji losing its global standing? Probably that is what provoked Government to send a big delegation. At the same time, I know that we are investing in our young talents as well, but sort that out Government, please. I will sum up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just allow me probably a minute. We need to prepare now for the next COP. I stated last year when we came back from COP, that Fiji’s delegation needed better organisation for greater impact. I know that the preparations have been good, but there are still a lot that we can do now. We do it now! Not wait for the next COP. Not wait for the next few months. The first thing that Government needs to do now is call for a debrief. A hot wash or an after- action review, whatever you want to call it, let us do a debrief now!</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2401 Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that debrief must also bring in the technical people, the negotiators, Ministers, and of course, diplomacy as well, because now the honourable Deputy Prime Minister learned his lesson. I raise the issue about diplomacy, because when we are stuck, our technical people are telling us, “Oh, the developed countries are telling us this”, but we have friends in the developed countries. That is where diplomacy plays a very critical role. Going back to the delegation, this is something that we need to consider. Lastly, thank you for allowing me to say this. I would suggest to your good office, in the parliamentary workshops that we are doing. let us a workshop on multilateralism and regionalism because according to the foreign policy statement that was released lately by the honourable Prime Minister, that is a force multiplier to our foreign policy. Every member of the delegation and especially Ministers, you can just go and read the piece of paper that is given to you by the technical team, but you do not understand COP. You do not understand the politics of COP. That is why we need to have some sessions on multilateralism and regionalism. He is talking about AOSIS, Pacific SIDS, G77, that is regionalism into multilateralism, and how we use diplomacy to get our issues across. There is a lot to discuss, I look forward to the debrief, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. I will ask the honourable Prime Minister to sort out the issue between the honourable Minister for Sugar and the rest of the delegation. MR. SPEAKER.- I now invite the Leader of the Group of Nine bloc or his designate for his statement. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Professor Biman Prasad for the Ministerial Statement. I also want to acknowledge this leadership at COP29. I also want to say my big vinaka vakalevu to the entire Fiji contingent that participated in the many events, the talks, the discussions and the negotiations during COP29. Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, it is great that our nation has a seat at the table, obviously for the support, and I agree that it is vital for us to ensure that the voices of Fijians and the small island nations are heard on this global stage. However, while participation at COP is undoubtedly important, it is equally essential that we ground our climate change response in a strategy that empowers us as a nation and people, and not just passive recipients of external solutions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must not only be part of discussions but must also focus on building our own agency and resilience. We must invest in our capacity to respond to climate change in ways that are both practical and culturally appropriate for Fiji. Our knowledge, our indigenous knowledge and traditions, and our local solutions should not just complement international efforts, they should be the foundation of our strategy. Let me highlight a critical point –our indigenous knowledge. In our villages across Fiji, we have seen that local community-driven solutions are often effective. Taking for example, the nana traditional practices in Rewa, using mangrove plants to prevent riverbank erosion. This is a solution grounded in centuries of local knowledge and is proving not only to be cost effective, but sustainable. However, we often see these local solutions sidelined or overshadowed by foreign-designed interventions. The seawalls, while important, can be expensive and impractical for many of our communities. They are not the only answer, nor should they be the only solution to every problem we face. Instead, we need to invest in scaling up awareness and application of our indigenous practices.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>2402</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 The nana system in Rewa is one example, but there are many other such practices throughout Fiji that could be adapted and replicated in other vulnerable areas. What we need is a national strategy that blends the best of both worlds: global knowledge and local wisdom. The solutions that come from foreign experts are valuable, but they must be combined with the creativity and resilience that comes from our own people. By recognising and investing in our own knowledge systems, we do not only strengthen our response to climate change, but also position ourselves as leaders in the global conversation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is crucial to tell the world about our vulnerabilities: our rising seas levels, our disappearing shorelines and the impacts on our way of life, it is equally important to celebrate our agency. We must change the narrative. Instead of focussing solely on what we lack, let us shine a light on the incredible ways in which our communities are really adapting, innovating and finding solutions. This is not a story of helplessness; it is a story of resilience, of ingenuity and of hope. At COP29 and beyond, Fiji should be proud to showcase both our needs and our strengths. Yes, we need support from the international community, but we must also be clear, that we are not begging for help. We are asking for partnerships based on mutual respect, recognising that we too have much to contribute. In conclusion, while international platforms like COP29 are vital for raising awareness and forging global alliances, let us not forget that the effective climate change solutions come from the ground up – from the communities who live the reality of climate change every day. Let us invest in these local solutions, build on our traditional knowledge and move forward with the confidence that we the people of Fiji, have the agency to chart our own course in the fight against climate change. Once again, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the immense work and his great leadership at COP29. MR. SPEAKER.- I want to thank the honourable Tuinaceva for his response on behalf of the Leader of the G9 Bloc. Honourable Members, I think it is an appropriate time to suspend our proceedings for our morning tea break, so Parliament stands suspended and will resume in half an hour. The Parliament adjourned at 10.33 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2403 The Parliament resumed at 11.25 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, firstly I would like to apologise for the late start of this session. The Secretary-General and I have been meeting with the President of the Australian Senate, the honourable Sue Lines and her Australian delegation for the purpose of strengthening our link, our relationship with the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament. Walesi Technical and Financial Investigation HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji who may be listening to this broadcast through Walesi or livestreaming or on radio today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to present to this esteemed Parliament the findings of the Walesi Pte Limited. It consists of two parts - Part 1 is the Technical Assessment of Fiji's Digital Television Transmission Setup and Part 2 is the Special Audit on Walesi's Financial Management and Governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, someone in this Parliament in the last few days brought the words “inaptitude” and “incompetence” on the People’s Coalition Party. All I can say, Sir, through this report, right back at you to the other side of the Parliament. From the outset, Mr. Speaker Sir, these findings reveal a troubling legacy left by the previous government, one marked by mismanagement, lack of transparency and a reckless disregard for public resources. Mr. Speaker Sir, I stand here today with absolute clarity, recalling the relentless boasts of the previous government about the so-called Digital Television Initiative. They hailed it as one of their proudest legacies but let me be unequivocal. Walesi, under their leadership, was no legacy. It is a travesty. A colossal failure wrapped in incompetence, mismanagement and empty promises. The governance - reckless. The planning - non-existent. The execution – a national shame. Walesi was not a triumph. It was a stain. A glaring example of arrogance and neglect, a testament to how low leadership can sink when blinded by vanity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a disgrace, and the people of this nation deserve better than the hollow wreckage they have left behind. Under the guise of modernisation, they pursued an agenda of control. The now-repealed Media Industry Development Act is a testament to this. A law that stifled media freedom under the pretence of development. Today, as we examine the results of these investigations, it is evident that Walesi was yet another instrument in their flawed agenda. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I share to this august House and the people of Fiji the findings of Walesi Audit, I would like to make one important point. Digital Telestrial Television (DTT) is undeniably a vital asset for a developing nation like Fiji, offering access to information education and public services, including broadcasting of our parliamentary sessions. But, Mr. Speaker, if implemented properly and managed well, it represents progress and opportunity for Fijians. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the service has value, its implementation under that side of the House was plagued by poor management and governance, lack of accountability and oversight. I will share part one of the findings. Mr. Speaker, the technical assessment was conducted with the assistance of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and engagement of an international expert in digital terrestrial television, who has uncovered systemic flaws in the design and implementation of Walesi’s digital television network:</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>2404</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 (1) Non-compliance with regulatory standards Walesi failed to obtain the necessary operating and spectrum licenses for its operations, so you can argue it was operating illegally. This not only exposed our nation to risks of interference from critical services like civil aviation, but this reflects poor oversight and negligence in complying with basic international telecommunication obligations. (2) Limited accessibility While Walesi provided free set-up boxes to low-income households, encryption policies forced families earning over $30,000 annually to purchase proprietary services which are supposedly “Free-to-Air” services. This undermined the principle of universal accessibility. (3) Suboptimal Network Design Mr. Speaker, the network was implemented using a Multi-Frequency Network (MFN), a model which has significantly higher operational costs compared to the most efficient Single-Frequency Network (SFN) which is recognised globally for providing better coverage and cost-efficiency, especially in countries like ours. This basic failure of planning reflects lack of foresight. (4) Poor Technology Choices Despite the global standards in 2016 pointing to the transition to more modern technology the H.265/HEVC codec, the network instead utilised H.264 codec. This decision Mr. Speaker, meant that over 200,000 set-top boxes distributed at significant public cost, were outdated from the beginning and the question was not “if” but “when” these would need to be replaced, making this an absolute waste of public funds. (5) No Sustainable Operating Model Mr. Speaker, the review highlighted the absence of a sustainable framework for Walesi’s operations. There was no structured revenue model, no strategic pricing for broadcastings utilising the network, and no long-term plan for infrastructure maintenance. This was a fundamental failure to think beyond the immediate. Incompetence and inaptitude. The special audit or the financial audit into Walesi’s operations paint even a bleaker picture. One of fiscal irresponsibility, poor governance and outright waste: (6) Mismanagement of Public Funds. From 2015 to December 2022, Mr. Speaker, that side of the House disbursed a staggering $123.6 million to Walesi. Despite this massive investment, the company has remained heavily reliant on Government funding, due to its inability to generate sufficient revenue. Mr. Speaker, 10 payments totalling $9.3 million, could not be substantiated, as relevant documentation was missing. This lack of records made it impossible to confirm whether these payments complied with the funds intended purpose or legal requirements. The audit was also unable to identify the actual cost of the project against the budget. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no budget and so the detailing of cost was not really transparent. However, as reported by the report, an analysis based on the purchase of inventories and additions to property, plant and equipment between 2015 and 2022 indicates that project costs exceeded $70 million. (7) Procurement Violations and Governance</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2405 Procurement regulations were routinely ignored. In fact, Sir, there was never a tender on anything in Walesi. High-value contracts, including a $3.6 million project management contract were awarded without tendering. In fact, the tenders were waived. The Project Manager for the DTTV Project, who got paid $3.6 million for the duration, revealed some very interesting facts, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The review by the audit revealed the following: • The scope of work was very broad; • The deliverables and timeline were not detailed; • The contract did not have a closure and cost limit • Additionally, progress reports were never submitted to the Board in a consistent manner. • There was no evidence to indicate the projects were properly monitored, as there was no documentation provided during the audit. • There was no closure or status report provided when the consultant exited. • There was no evidence also to confirm that there was a proper handover performed by the Project Manager on the termination of the contract. Some of the facts, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on top of this $2.2 million of red-flow batteries, purchased for backup or discarded due to improper storage – a shocking wastage of taxpayers’ money. Poor project management was highlighted very heavily, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the report and other things that I mentioned exemplify these issues. On top of that, Walesi did not even have a contract register of authorised vendors from 2015 to 2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, beyond that, Walesi was operating without after strategic plan for years. Basic policies, including risk management and procurement frameworks were either absence or incomplete. These lapses allowed inefficiencies and irregularities to flourish unabated. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on top of that, as we have seen through that side of the House with so many delays in financial reporting. This is what the re-audit report said - timely financial reporting and publishing of audited financial statements by public entities are indicators of good financial management that demonstrate transparency, accountability lay use of public resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financials for Walesi were totally delayed, which is again a sad indictment on this whole affair. (8) Ambiguity in the Legal Framework Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audit revealed significant gaps in the legal framework governing Walesi. The 100 percent government-owned company was not even covered under the Public Enterprises Act, further weakening oversight mechanisms and accounting structures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these findings obviously suggest a high level of mismanagement and waste, and in addition potential breaches of the law. As such this Government will not stand by idly. I wish to assure this august House that the findings of the technical report,</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2406</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 as well as the Special Audit will be forwarded to the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption today for further investigation and action. Mr. Speaker, any evidence of abuse, misrepresentation or fraudulent activity will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law. The findings of these investigations are a sad indictment on the previous regime. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame on them! They demand immediate action to safeguard public resources and restore trust in our institutions. Mr. Speaker, Walesi does have a role in terms of communication in Fiji, however, be assured that this Coalition Government will not repeat the mistakes of the past. We are committed to implementing reforms that ensure Walesi serves the interest of all Fijians. In fact, we had already started work on this. (1) Overhauling Governance Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the leadership of its new board they are developing a comprehensive strategic plan to guide its operations. This plan will include robust policies for procurement, risk management, and compliance with Fiji’s laws and regulations. All future requirements will adhere strictly to transparent tendering processes. (2) Enhancing Accessibility Encryption policies will be reviewed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that all Fijians have true free-to-air access without the need for proprietary devices. Technical upgrades based on the ITU recommendations will also be prioritised. (3) Strengthening Accountability Mr. Speaker, Sir, spectrum licenses and frequency registrations will be expedited to bring Walesi in line with licensing practices and protect critical services from interference. Monitoring and evaluation frameworks will be established to ensure efficiency and transparency. (4) Creating a Sustainable Model Mr. Speaker, Sir, a transparent fee structure will be introduced in due course, together with the review of the Telecommunications Act. This will create a revenue stream that supports Walesi’s operations while keeping services affordable for Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon reflection it is clear that there has been a significant level of abuse in the operations of Walesi. In my estimate, based on the figures and number that I have presented, $80 million or at least 68 percent of the spending to 2022 can be considered as wastage and abuse by the previous government. Just imagine this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we could have used this money for hospitals, roads, bridges that could have been constructed from this fund. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the Walesi investigation reminds me again of Nabukalou Creek - beautiful at high tide, but when the water recedes it reveals the filth underneath. Like the Fijian say, bulubulu boro vulavula, the surface seems pristine, but beneath it lay shameful, wastage and abuse. In two words, sa duka.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2407</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Look in the mirror:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Public funds vanished into thin air, a disgraceful squandering of resources. Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. The findings of these investigations expose the failures of the past in stark detail, and we will fix them! They also represent an opportunity to correct mistakes and rebuild trust in our public institutions. Under this Coalition Government, we will ensure that Walesi transitions from a symbol of mismanagement and abuse to a model of innovation and public service. Our commitment to the people of Fiji is this –we will serve them with integrity, transparency and honesty. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me first thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement on Walesi and also for all his hot air that has come up with respect to Walesi. Hot air and inflammatory words about being ineptitude and travesty, empty promise …. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! Continue honourable Koya.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p><p>He uses really inflammatory words like ineptitude, mismanagement, travesty, poor management, et cetera. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister in his speech pointed out that there are issues that he has found and those issues that he will be referring to the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC). Once you say that, you ought to be mum on that particular topic, because it immediately is something that is gone into investigation. To come here and grandstand and talk about all of these things is not good. It does not bode well. Honourable Minister, I thought you were better than that. Send it for investigation. We all look forward to the findings, but please, yesterday in this House, there was a matter that was brought up regarding the boxing. We were told to stay mum about it because it is a matter under investigation. It is the same thing, honourable Deputy Prime Minister! MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Koya, can I remind you the difference is, in this case it has not been referred to. It is in the process of being referred to, whereas in the case of the boxing, the matter is already in the hands of the Commission. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I agree with you, but in light of the fact that he is raising it and about to report it, why come here and grandstand on it? Report the matter and then come back after the investigation is complete. That would be the honourable thing to do. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. F. S. KOYA.- We are not privy to the report, so answering it is quite impossible. Let me just remind him about what Walesi has done. Walesi has provided free-to-air digital television services to all Fijians. It has offered a change from analogue TV to now digital TV. As of March 2023, Walesi had reached 90 percent of the Fijian population. We had provided free digital services to 200,000 households; that did not exist! You tell me about the waste! Absolute garbage coming from the other side.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>2408</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, to do all of these, there is a cost attached to it. Of course, the estimate of the project was $200 million. The Government of Fiji provided $100 million, and the remaining came through a combination of private sector investment and donor contributions. If he has issues, like he says he has, and he wants to refer it to FICAC, please do so. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- I hope that interjections are also dealt with in the same manner:</span></p><p>This particular project was a major investment by the Government of Fiji. I am glad to say that there is going to be continuity, because there are lot of households that are actually dependent on Walesi. When he talks about mismanagement, what he needs to do is also realise that, before Walesi came, the only way to watch television in Fiji was through analogue television. That is the system that uses radio waves to transmit images, sound, et cetera. This is a digital platform which we can actually grow. Walesi is a significant and a huge improvement over the previous analogue television, and it provides sharper images, more television stations and clearer sound and most of all, this allows the rural and outer island areas more access to television, more access to the digital platform. So, all in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he forgets to mention all the good parts of Walesi. As I have said earlier, Sir, we are not privy to the report at the moment. If we were privy to the report, we would be able to dissect it but I’m not going to, because he is going to report the matter to FICAC. And we should be honourable people and leave that alone to the institutions, the incredible institutions that we have, to deal with that in the manner that they should. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Group of 9 Bloc or his designate for his response. HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to reply to the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communications. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already spoken in this House about asking for clarifications from the Minister responsible in terms the allegations of wasting taxpayers’ money, in terms of Walesi involvement. But I am thankful of the findings of the report. He has clearly articulated in the findings, that while he presented this morning, and we as a group of G9, we acknowledge the report and thank him for that. I know he has been given the biggest run around by the media and the journalists to deliver the report in this august House. We thank him and we are looking forward towards the progress of the report and investigations. Vinaka. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 3 rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting 2025 HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this august House, members of the media, ladies, and gentlemen; today, I rise to highlight Fiji’s immense privilege and responsibility in hosting the 3rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting or known as RAMM in 2025. This decision, endorsed by Cabinet and fully supported by the Coalition Government demonstrates</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2409 our unwavering commitment to fostering regional unity and advancing shared progress within the Pacific aviation sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting is a cornerstone event, uniting Pacific nations to collaboratively address challenges, identify opportunities, and shape the future of our aviation landscape. This platform is not only a reflection of our interconnectedness as a region, but also vital mechanism for fostering practical solutions to the shared issues that we face. As a Coalition Government, we recognise that aviation is the life blood of connectivity for Pacific Island nations. It is fundamental to our economies, our communities and our aspirations for growth and development. Hosting this meeting reaffirms Fiji’s leadership in steering meaningful conversations and initiatives in the region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, RAMM 2025 is not merely a gathering of aviation leaders, it is a strategic opportunity to address critical priorities for Pacific, aligned with the Coalition Government’s overarching goals for sustainable development, economic resilience, and regional collaboration. The main objectives of the meeting are as follows: (1) Strengthening Regional Cooperation - Building stronger partnerships among Pacific nations to address aviation-related challenges including infrastructure gaps, regulatory alignment, and safety standards. This collaboration ensures that no nation is left behind in our collective journey toward progress. (2) Enhancing Air Connectivity: Improving air links across the Pacific to facilitate trade, tourism and investment. Enhanced connectivity will create pathways for economic opportunities and directly benefits the livelihoods of our people. (3) Advancing Sustainable Aviation Practices: Charting a path toward greener aviation by exploring frameworks to reduce carbon emissions, invest in sustainable technologies and mitigate environmental impacts – actions aligned with Fiji’s climate leadership. (4) Capacity Building: Strengthening the technical expertise and operational capabilities of aviation sectors across the region through shared learning and technical assistance, ensuring long-term resilience and adaptability. (5) Ensuring Safety and Security: Working collaboratively to uphold international aviation safety and security standards, ensuring passenger confidence and maintaining the integrity of our air transport systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is focussed not just on hosting an event but on driving actionable and impactful outcomes for the Pacific region. The anticipated outcomes for the Pacific region. The anticipated outcomes of RAMM 2025 include: (1) Actionable Policy Frameworks: Agreement on practical strategies and frameworks that member states can adopt to strengthen their aviation sectors, promoting regional harmony and efficiency. Increased Funding and Investment: Identifying opportunities for investment in infrastructure and technology, enabling advancements that will enhance aviation services across the region. (2) (3) Streamlined Regional Policies: Aligning aviation policies to promote seamless operations, reduce barriers to travel and support more efficient movement of people and goods across borders. (4) Expanded Partnerships: Fostering collaboration between governments, private sector stakeholders, and international organisations to build a resilient and dynamic aviation ecosystem.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>2410</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 (5) Accountability and Implementation: Establishing mechanisms to monitor the progress of agreements reached, ensuring that commitments translate into measurable benefits for all Pacific nations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO) Pacific Ministers Meeting held in Suva last month, emphasised tourism’s transformative role in driving economic growth and regional cooperation. Central to this vision is aviation, the lifeline connecting our island nations and enabling the seamless movement of people, goods and services. Tourism and aviation are intrinsically linked with improved air connectivity directly enhancing access to Pacific destinations. This not only supports the growth of the tourism sector, but also fosters economic opportunities across industries such as hospitality, agriculture and retail. For Fiji and our neighbours, these linkages are critical for creating jobs, stimulating investment and uplifting livelihoods. In the newly endorsed Strategic Plan for SPTO, connectivity is one of the Strategic Focus Areas highlighting the importance of harmonised efforts to enhance air connectivity, strengthen infrastructure and streamline regional aviation policies. Together, these initiatives ensure that Pacific nations remain competitive, resilient and united in their pursuit of sustainable development. By hosting RAMM 2025, Fiji reaffirms its commitment to fostering these synergies and driving meaningful progress. The Coalition Government remains steadfast in its vision of aviation and tourism as cornerstones for regional integration, economic prosperity and shared growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government views RAMM 2025 as more than an event, it is a platform to reinforce our collective commitment to the prosperity of the Pacific. By hosting this meeting, Fiji is leading by example, demonstrating our dedication to a vision of regional connectivity, sustainability and shared growth. The Coalition Government’s ongoing investments in the aviation sector, including infrastructure development and capacity building, underscore our readiness to host such a transformative event. Moreover, our focus on outcomes ensures that RAMM 2025 will have a lasting impact not just for Fiji but for the entire Pacific community. Honourable Members, Fiji’s hosting of the 3 rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting in 2025 is a testament to our regional leadership and our commitment to advancing aviation as a driver of development. Guided by the Coalition Government’s vision of progress, sustainability and inclusivity, we are determined to make RAMM 2025 a turning point for regional aviation. Let us embrace this opportunity to collaborate, innovate and create a stronger and more connected Pacific. Together, through partnership and shared purpose, we will soar to new heights. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for this response. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all let me congratulate the honourable Minister in getting the approval to host this RAMM 2025 meeting because it comes at a very opportune time and it is sorely needed, especially in light of the fact there were many discussions were held – it had that happened at the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) meeting which the honourable Minister and I both attended and there are issues that the Pacific needs to deal with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to reflect on something that was said by the erstwhile Secretary- General to the Pacific Islands Forum, Mr. Henry Puna. He had said, and I quote, “there will be</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2411 fatigue in the discussion of some issues” and it is a very important topic. There will be fatigue with respect to civil aviation issues that have been discussed, but it is time that we need to move in a direction, because we all know Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is great for tourism that we are actually hosting these events but from a regional perspective, it is very important that we lead the way in these discussions, because we are a major part of the region’s airline network. Mr. Speaker, Sir, civil aviation, especially in this region, we have to explore new and innovative ideas. We have to solidify our region, because as I said at the ICAO meeting on the last occasion that the honourable Minister and I both attended, I saw the solidification that exist within Africa and the support that they received out of the European Union. We need to also start to engage with the assistance of our development partners, Australia and New Zealand because they lie on the same region to see what can be done. What lies at the hub of this and probably the most important thing, something that we really need to tap into, and it is good for our economies also, is the topic that was discussed in Dubai which was sustainable aviation fuel. It is something that is hugely important to us, especially in light of what has been attended to in recent weeks regarding COP29. I am really quite sorry that our honourable Minister was not able to attend, because that would have been fantastic opportunity to raise all those issues that he did quite well in Dubai. Our development aspirations and commitments also need to be a huge part of these discussions. As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, especially because of climate change issues and it should be at the head of our discussions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the support that is received by Africa with respect to sustainable aviation fuels because it is an industry comes from Europe, but the Pacific had zero support. So, it is time that we got together, some of our Pacific Island neighbours were not even able to attend the conference due to financial constraints. Fiji leads the way in this, we are hosting these things. I am sure we can lead and show the way for the Pacific and speak on behalf of the Pacific, and my discussions with Australia and New Zealand at that particular time, were that they would be readily and willing and able to assist in any way, shape or form that they can. Honourable Minister, I hope and wish you well in the discussions that are going to be held at RAMM and from a Pacific perspective and from the words of Mr. Henry Puna, the former Secretary- General, let the discussions make sure that they are not, fatigue is not embedded in those discussions, because they can be ongoing and long, but moving forward there is a lot of movement in terms of innovation. The little portion that I spoke about is actually quite a big portion about sustainable aviation fuels, it could mean new industries to us. It could mean what the honourable Minister for Trade has spoken about with respect to diversification, it could mean a hell of a lot if we start producing sustainable aviation fuels to make sure that we have a bigger and better economy that we can deal with whilst we are doing our part with respect to climate change and living in a sustainable economic environment. I wish you well honourable Minister for the Conference, and I wish you well in all the preparations and I wish Fiji a successful RAMM in 2025. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Statement this morning. I mentioned yesterday the fact that we are now hosting another meeting here in Fiji, again showcasing its ability to host and manage these meetings very well. Our facilities and the way we run these meetings, it also shows the leadership role that we play in these sorts of meetings and discussions.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>2412</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 I read with interest the connection between aviation and tourism – very true. Regionally, yes, and for a small and a group of island state like Fiji, distant, it is very true, aviation and tourism connects very well. Also, planes provide a faster turnaround for the tourists who do not come here and stay for long. When that is available to the outer islands, I think there is an old airport in Biaugunu airstrip, you had a look at that also. That localises this connection of aviation and tourism, and there are some of the airstrips that are on our outer islands, perhaps needs to be worked on. I hear the development in Savusavu for ATR, I think this augurs very well. I am not sure about the one in Taveuni, I think it is coming, and I thank the Ministry for its leadership in this area. I certainly echo the sentiments of honourable Koya, we wish you well in the meeting which Fiji is also the best in this area of looking after aviation, which is so vital for tourism in Fiji. Progress and Achievements of the Formal Employment Services HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by congratulating you, Sir, for your election as the Speaker of this august Parliament, and I look forward to working with you. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to update this august Parliament on the progress and achievements of the Formal Employment Services (FES) which is the local arm of employment at the National Employment Centre under the Employment Ministry. The Formal Employment Services, Mr. Speaker Sir, has undergone significant transformation over the past two years and the services provided by the FES team have not only evolved, but have been reshaped to meet the growing needs of our workforce and the demands of the rapidly changing labour market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since its inception, the National Employment Centre has evolved from a small-scale operation that was initially focussed on local registration to a more comprehensive and proactive service designed to enhance job opportunities, community engagement and employment empowerment locally. The landscape of Formal Employment Services has changed significantly with greater emphasis on accessibility to our local job markets, outreach and personalised services. Our approach today is more holistic, focusing not only on matching individuals to jobs, but also on providing training, skills development and support mechanisms to ensure sustained employment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year with the suspension of the registration of foreign employment due to the huge number of pending applications, we turned our focus on registration for local employment opportunities demonstrating an unprecedented boost in engagement with both jobseekers and employers. This is largely due to the extensive community awareness campaigns and employer engagement initiatives that have been undertaken to reach out to villages and even the outer islands. This initiative was essential to bridge the gap between the potential employees and employers, and the results are evident and beyond our expectations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our ongoing efforts, we have focussed on registering jobseekers from rural and remote areas, providing them with access to local opportunities, that they would not have had otherwise. This initiative has been enhanced through various outreach programmes, including local registration drives in key locations such as Levuka, Ovalau in the Tikina of Nasinu where we connected with local communities directly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Employment Centre Act mandates the conduct of Life Skills training and Employment Skills training, both of which are crucial in preparing our workforce for local employment.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2413 Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Life Skills training is designed to equip individuals with soft skills necessary for success in any workplace including communication, teamwork and time management. It also helps foster personal growth, building confidence and resilience in our local jobseekers. Employment Skills training focuses on the practical, technical skills required to thrive in specific industries. These trainings have become essential in building a workforce that is adaptable and capable of contributing effectively to our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, early this year we strengthened our arrangements through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Australian Pacific Training Coalition (APTC) for the delivery of employment skills training, ensuring that the programmes offered are aligned with the current industry trends that meet the needs of all employers across the country. The programmes provided by APTC are designed to equip jobseekers with the technical expertise needed for employment in sectors with high demand such as construction, engineering, hospitality and community services, which includes caregiving. These training programmes ensure that our workforce is not only job ready, but capable of thriving in the rapidly evolving job market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this training programme which covers up to Certificate III and Certificate IV is provided by APTC, are free of charge. Mr. Speaker, Sir, both trainings are vital in today's rapidly changing job market. They provide individuals with necessary tools and competencies to not only secure jobs but to succeed in them. The need for these training programmes is clearer now more than ever. As they ensure that our workforce remains competitive both locally and internationally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also partnering with other training institutions to provide skills training. Sir, as highlighted earlier the team conducted awareness and local registration drives in Ovalau before providing life skills training to the job seekers there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with the Ministry's commitment to support the needs of our local jobseekers, the NEC team has also been organising job fairs across the country. This platform not only provides an opportunity to jobseekers to connect with potential employers, but also an avenue, to showcase the skills and capabilities of our workforce. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Western Division job fair held in Nadi earlier this year was a resounding success. A total of 612 jobs were secured within the two-day event for the region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, similarly, the Suva job fair at the end of October, also provided a total of 1,289 job openings with 605 jobs offered on the spot and the remainder sourced through continued engagement with employers. This success reflects the tireless work being done by the team to connect jobseekers with the opportunities available in both our formal and informal sectors. The Suva job fair also provided the opportunity for my Ministry to promote the Coalition Government’s commitment to collaborate through public and private partnerships for effective utilisation of resources and also reaching out to the widest sector of our community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints for their commitment and support towards the initiative and for providing a free venue for the job fair. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the church has also offered to host similar events at any of their centres nationwide. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week the team hosted the Northern job fair which was held in Labasa and attracted a huge crowd at the Labasa Civic Centre. This event was also a success, with 40</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>2414</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 organisations offering 194 vacancies for people in the North. Such events empower communities and provide platforms for both employers and job seekers to connect and bridge the gap in accessing employment opportunities. While we are engaged in this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have other services on the spot, for example, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS) representatives to provide the TIN numbers and also our expertise in terms of refining their curriculum vitae. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the support from the Fiji Police Force Jazz Band who were conducting community awareness in the North and came to support my Ministry, providing entertainment and awareness to our citizens last Thursday at the Labasa Civic Centre. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the 5 th to 7 th November 2024, that is from tomorrow until Saturday. We are also partnering with the Ministry of Youth and Sports to host a fair for the youth in the Central Division at the National Stadium where they will have their sporting events and other activities together with the job fair. The youths will be able to access employers who will be present there and then see who matches what. Hopefully, a number of jobs will be secured there as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also organising a job fair in Ba, mostly likely by the end of January or early February, where we will get the jobseekers right from up to Tavua and Rakiraki together to meet with employers and secure jobs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are going to provide a bus to those who are going to travel from Rakiraki and Tavua to Ba. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through these efforts of the local arm of the National Employment Centre, the Ministry has made great strides in resetting the employment landscape. Our work is not only about filling job vacancies, but also about building a sustainable local workforce, empowering individuals and ensuring that no one is left behind in the quest for employment opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward, we will continue to refine our approach, strengthen our collaboration and partnerships with all the stakeholders to expand our reach to all the corners of the country. The road ahead is one of continued transformation and I am most happy with the progress we have made and the positive impacts we are having on the lives of our fellow ordinary Fijians. It brings great satisfaction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, seeing the smiles and acknowledgement from our very own people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, approximately 2,500 plus jobs that have been secured so far means 2,500 plus families have actually been sustained and benefitting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the jobs are available out there. It is about connecting the jobseekers with the potential employers. And as we continue to do this, we are going to assist with poverty alleviation, we are going to assist with eradication of social problems, we are going to engage our youths beneficially, gainfully as well as meaningfully towards contributing to our nation building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative will continue, and I am sure there will be more jobs secured in future. I also wish to very briefly respond to honourable Usamate. He is a very old friend of mine. The contribution yesterday regarding the TVET training programmes that we need to emphasise on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that TVET training was available at our school level, from Year 9 and Year 10 onwards. Those centres were attached to the secondary schools in those days, and they were very successfully done. After that they could attend Fiji National University and continue with the Level 3 and Level 4 and then enter the job market. We also saw the opening of the technical colleges in 2014, I believe, 2015, 2016, and then closure of technical colleges in 2019. When the technical colleges were open, all the TVET centres</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2415 were closed, and then later on, the technical colleges were also closed, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, we lost our TVET trainings completely there. Honourable Usamate and I worked together at the National Productivity and Training Centre at FNU, and we also fought very hard resisting the annexure of the NTPC into FNU, but we both failed. I was removed from my position and honourable Usamate came into Parliament, and then he forgot to continue the fight, unfortunately. I do not blame him at all, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Unfortunately, there was a single boss those days and no one else had any say. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! (Laughter) HON. A. D. SINGH.- So, we are now coming back, we are reopening the technical colleges, and we are reopening the TVET centres, thanks to the Ministry of Education and the honourable Minister. The training is now ongoing. Thank you very much for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I would now invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his five minute response. HON. J. N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations. While I acknowledge the progress and achievements of the Formal Employment Service (FES) and the National Employment Centre (NEC), it is crucial to remember that this initiative was established under the Bainimarama Government in 2009, which the former Minister Usamate was a part of. The NEC was a fast forward-thinking response to the pressing issues of unemployment, aiming to provide skills training, human resource development and job placement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note, that during the last election campaign there were voices within the current Government that were critical of NEC and its initiatives. It is somewhat ironic that now in power, they have to come to realise the value of NEC and are expanding its services. This shift instantly raises questions about the constituency and sincerity in their policy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Formal Employment Service has indeed played a vital role in helping individuals, especially school leavers, the unemployment and those re-entering the workforce to find formal employment. However, the current Government must ensure that the expansion of these services is not just a political manoeuvre, but a genuine effort to improve the employment landscape in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must also address a critical issue facing our nation today. The mass exodus of trained professionals leaving Fiji for opportunities abroad. This brain drain is depleting our skilled workforce and creating gaps in essential sectors. The NEC must be empowered and reduced to providing targeted services that can quickly upskill our citizens to fill these gaps. It is not enough to simply place people in jobs, we must ensure that they are adequately trained and prepared to meet the demands of the modern workforce. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the NEC has other services such as the Foreign Employment Services and the Fiji Volunteer Service which have provided additional facilities, there is still much work to be done. The Government must address the underlying issues that contribute to unemployment and to ensure that NEC is adequately funded and supported to fulfil its mandate effectively.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>2416</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, sir, while I commend the NEC’s effort and progress made by FES, I urge the Government to remain transparent and consistent in its policies. The well-being of its citizens and the reduction of unemployment should be the family focus, free from political agendas. We must work together to ensure that the NEC can continue to support our workforce and address the challenges posed by the loss of skilled professionals. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Nand. I will now call upon the Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate for his response. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond briefly to the Ministerial statement presented by the Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations, honourable Agni Deo Singh. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister for updating this august Parliament on the progress and achievements of the formal employment service of the National Employment Centre under the Ministry for Employment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the formal employment service is one of the three main services offered by the National Employment Centre, namely, the Foreign Employment Service, the National Employment Service and the Fiji Volunteer Service. With the NEC facilitation role, I commend the Minister and his team for the work that they do in assisting the youths and fellow Fijians to secure jobs both locally and in the foreign markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, youths who are engaged in formal employment locally, will develop good work attitudes and stand a better chance of securing employment in the foreign markets. My political career has always focussed on assisting our youths in securing jobs both locally and in foreign markets. Mr Speaker, Sir, when youths need jobs, I stay up late at night, preparing resumes for our youths and liaise with local companies and organisations in securing jobs for these youths. With that being said, I take this opportunity to commend all the companies that provide job opportunities for our youths, hence, a special mention to the following companies and organisations who continue to assist me in absorbing these youths in the workforce: Fiji Sports Council, New World IGA Fiji, Ashabhai Company Limited and Punjas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, I must thank the Ministry of Employment and the Ministry for Youth and Sports for organising mini job fairs, where they are committed in connecting people, especially our youths with a wide range of opportunities across different industries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by the honourable Minister, both of the Ministries will be holding a two-day youth fair in the Central Division from the 5 th to the 6 th of December, 2024 at the HFC Stadium. The Ministry of Employment needs the support of all the Members of this august Parliament and stakeholders in addressing the issue of unemployment in our nation. I thank you for this opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this point, we will suspend the proceedings for lunch and we will hear the last two Ministerial Statements from the Minister for Justice at our first session this afternoon. Parliament is adjourned with proceedings to resume at 2.30 p.m.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2417 The Parliament adjourned at 12.29 p.m.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>2418</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.45 p.m. Job Evaluation Exercise - Fiji Corrections Service HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Ni sa bula vinaka saka na Turaga na Sivika. I join my fellow colleagues, those who have spoken before me and after me to congratulate your appointment as Speaker of the House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, k emuni na wekaqu turaga mataqali, o ira na luvei keimami, ni kalougata tiko, I also welcome those joining us on livestream from across the globe; I will be speaking in light of the Fiji Corrections Service Job Evaluation Exercise and its Implementation. I rise to update this august House of the approved Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) of the Fiji Correctional Services. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary goal of the JEE is to enable the Fiji Corrections Service (FCS) to attract, retain, develop talent, skills and capacity within its organisation while remaining competitive in the labour market. This initiative also ensures the alignment of FCS’s role with its organisational structure, functions and pay scales, promoting the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, please allow me to provide a brief background on the JEE. The Fiji Corrections Service adhered to the standard tendering process, including advertising for a consultancy to undertake a JEE. Following a thorough selection process, Maxumise was engaged as the consultancy agency. Consultations and interviews were conducted with FCS officers as part of the exercise. The JEE was concluded and a report dated 9 th October, 2023, provided comprehensive recommendations, including, if I may list them first: • • • • • • Review and evaluation of roles, responsibilities and skills; Assignment of appropriate salary bands and remuneration based on competency assessments; Establishment of base salaries for future recruits guided by the JEE; Adoption of role descriptions as position descriptions for incumbents; Training to address identified skill gaps; and Enhance contract management practices reflect the incumbent roles and vacant positions. The JEE was approved in the Cabinet sitting of June 2024. Cabinet also approved in principle that it would be effective from 1st August, 2024, unfortunately, it was not to be backdated and that the final implementation and roll out would be subject to finalisation from the Ministry of Finance. However, the implementation of the approved JEE for Corrections Officers has generated mixed reactions. These mixed reactions have been the result of the lack of information exacerbated by rampant spread of misinformation and disinformation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my intention that by addressing the issue in this august House that we will be enlightened, particularly for our Members across the floor who have failed to address the plight of officers over their many years in government. There are several phases in implementing the new policy. The proposed salary structure is informed by the JEE and FCS Remuneration Policy, reflecting post-COVID-19 market conditions. Implementation follows a phased approach. The phases considered are:</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2419 • • • • • • Full implementation of the new salary bands, effective August 2024, pending the outcome of the Individual Competency Assessments. Adjustments will include mandatory allowance increases and a review of other remuneration policies. Stages of Implementation to align with the recommended median. Realignment of the organisational structure. Update and implementation of HR policies. Identification of personnel and inclusion of 81 new posts over the next three financial years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in essence, there has been a need to constantly re-adjust to correctly re-align the pay structure to the experience, qualification and the demands of the role. To this end, a number of HR-related activities have been undertaken to strategically align the manpower structure to the accepted level and supported by its structural framework. In principle, this would mean that the implementation of the JEE recommendations is to achieve the following: • • • • • Realignment and redesign of salary band to reflect the JEE recommendations; Increases that is aligned to the position and not the rank; Realignment of the Fiji Corrections Service structure to address current operational needs; Review the introduction of enhanced remuneration policies and the resulting increased budgetary allocation for personnel emoluments; and Additional manpower and posts identified to strengthen the role of Fiji Corrections Service. Eighty-one is really a record for the history of FCS. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an organisation chart has been developed to reflect the current new positions. Correct remuneration packages that are consistent with the role expectations as opposed to the traditional ranking remuneration expectation is a major shift following the approved Corrections Reforms and the JEE. In implementing the policy, the framework that has been developed is clearly defined with clear expectations. This is something that was not done in the previous administration, in fact, I will proudly say the last JEE or something to that effect reflected for the Fiji Corrections Service was not done for the last 40 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual manpower level can now tally with the Person to Post, what is normally called P2P framework that reflects the approve number of manpower resources. Each post should have a corresponding Job Description to clearly demarcate positions and avoid overlapping of responsibilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the progress made, FCS has faced some challenges, and these include: • • • • Assigning personnel to the correct salary bands based on JEE evaluations. Implementing the new salary structure across FCS. Lack of detailed job descriptions to guide the HR processes. Adjusting staff placement to align with the updated organisational structure.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>2420</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 • Transitioning to a performance-based rank structure tied to posts, as recommended by the JEE. To address these challenges, there has been continued dialogue to identify and secure sufficient budget allocations to support salary increments, as well as providing targeted training programmes for FCS officers. Additionally, the establishment of a monitoring framework to oversee the progress and effectiveness of the JEE recommendations is crucial. The implementation has proven to be fruitful and a challenging exercise that requires meticulous analysis to put the correct pay structure into its correct position. The sum of plus $12.5 million was recommended and approved in the 2024-2025 Budget to cater for the 879 staff on the ground, inclusive of the 81 new positions for 2024-2025. This is the start, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is still must left to implement. It is clear that the intention to implement with one year roll out period with the requisite changes though commendable, will require a strengthened comprehensive HR system and mechanisms to fully implement it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is anticipated that once the JEE outcome is fully implemented, a detailed report will be provided to Cabinet and subsequently the recommendations to this august House. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the JEE has made the traditional rank structure redundant. The rank is no longer an attribute of the individual officer but is attached to the post they hold. Officers wear the rank and receive the pay associated with the post to which they are assigned. MR. SPEAKER.- May I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his response. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the honourable Minister for Justice’s Statement regarding the Fiji Corrections Service JEE and its implementation. While the Opposition supports genuine reforms aimed at improving our Corrections system, I must express my grave concerns about the lack of depth and accountability in the Government’s approach to this issue. To the honourable Minister, you had 24 months to do this, yet you are still blaming the previous government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, justice is a principle I hold dearly, and it is a value that should not only guide our treatment of inmates but also extend to the hardworking Corrections officers who are the backbone of this institution. These men and women are entrusted with the critical task of maintaining order and supporting rehabilitation, often under extremely challenging circumstances. Yet, the Minister’s Statement fails to adequately address how this JEE will directly improve their lives. Corrections officers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are often overworked, underpaid and left to operate in under-resourced facilities. They endure dangerous conditions daily, placing their own well-being at risk to serve the public. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. K. K. LAL.- Is it just, Mr. Speaker, to burden these officers with these challenges while offering them little in return? How will this exercise address their safety concerns, enhance their working conditions, and provide fair compensation that reflects their invaluable contributions?</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2421 Justice also demands fairness in professional development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since this Coalition Government’s term, Corrections officers have faced stagnation in their careers. Promotions are few and far between, and there is little incentive for these officers to remain committed to their roles. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister must explain how this exercise will open pathways for professional growth, provide opportunities for advanced training, and ensure that officers are rewarded based on merit and performance. Anything less would be an injustice to their dedication and sacrifice. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I call on the honourable Minister to expand this exercise to include robust training on human rights, ethics, and privacy protection. These are non-negotiable aspects of a modern justice system. Officers must be equipped to handle inmates in a manner that respects their dignity and prepares them for reintegration into society. Too often, we have heard troubling reports of mistreatment and privacy violations within our correctional facilities. Without proper training, these incidents will continue, undermining the core principles of rehabilitation and fairness that our justice system should embody. Mr. Speaker, Sir, justice must also be evident in how we approach rehabilitation. This evaluation exercise cannot focus solely on administrative restructuring or job titles. It must include a comprehensive plan to improve rehabilitation programmes, invest in vocational training, and expand educational opportunities for inmates. A truly just system is one that believes in second chances and equips offenders to reintegrate successfully into our society. Another critical concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the mental health and well-being of our Corrections officers. The Minister has failed to mention any measures to address the psychological toll of working in such a high-stress environment. Justice for our officers means providing them with access to counselling services, mental health support, and mechanisms to reduce burnout. A JEE that ignores these realities is incomplete and unjust. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I must question the sincerity of the honourable Minister and this Government. Time and time again, we have seen big announcements with little follow-through. Where is the detailed plan? Where is the funding allocation to support these reforms? Most importantly, where is the accountability? The people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, including our Correction officers and inmates deserve more than empty promises and superficial changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition G-16 will continue to stand for true justice – justice for our Corrections officers, justice for inmates and justice for the people of Fiji. This requires a holistic, well-resourced and principled approach to reform, not political rhetoric. I urge the honourable Minister to rise above platitudes and deliver real, meaningful change. MR. SPEAKER.- I now invite the honourable Leader of the Group of Nine Bloc or his designate for his response. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Justice on the JEE for the Fiji Corrections Service, but before I do that, allow me to join my other colleagues in conveying my sincere congratulations to you on your appointment as our Speaker. We wish you the best on your term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for someone that has served in the organisation, together with my colleague, the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, we worked very hard to see this done. At first, I must</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>2422</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 thank the Coalition Government for keeping to their word and meeting the needs of the organisation under the JEE. Sir, not many people understand the work this organisation does. It is really a very tough mission. Apart from their primary function to look after those who are incarcerated under their care, turn them around and make sure they do not come back, they also play a significant role in national reconciliation. The ability to teach, train and turn them around in understanding as offenders and the ability of the organisation to help in the reconciliation of the offender and the victim. This is a tough call, Mr. Speaker, but I thank the organisation as they continue to do this under the Yellow Ribbon Programme. The other part that they are also doing in addition to their primary function is on nation building. They play an absolutely critical role, and I will call on the Government of the day that special consideration be given as you explore and try and understand and review the work that this organisation does, consideration be made on their role as a nation builder as an organisation. Sir, this organisation’s primary function is really to turn people around, those who have gone off track they go back on track. Mums and dads return to the community, join the community and their families. That is a difficult call. But my point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is really, I am trying to emphasise a simple fact for this organisation that they must be fairly remunerated and not only for them, their families, their conditions and above all the Force Protection issues that protects them in carrying out their work. Having said that, there also must be a balance in looking after those who are under their care, the inmates. They should be treated humanely, and they must comply with international norms of any organisation like the Corrections Service. Sir, I thank the Government of the day, the Coalition Government for sticking to their commitment and I urge that in the next budget session, consideration be given to this organisation in light of the work they do. Update on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I rise to update this august House on the work done by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) for 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to begin my address with warm congratulations to Nancy Tikoisuva on her acting appointment as the Acting Director from 11 th July, 2024. Well done Ms. Tikoisuva! With your strong leadership, we have already started seeing changes and growth at the ODPP. The belief in your leadership coupled with a competent skilled team is evident in the provision of the necessary financial resources by the Ministry of Finace for the new Financial Year 2024 to 2025. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and the Ministerial staff for having approved the establishment of the Nasinu office. Nasinu Municipality in the 2017 Census had a population of 92,043. Its land area is the largest of any municipal area in Fiji, and more than twice that of the Capital City of Suva. The current projections for Nasinu population is approximately 120,000 persons at an estimated growth rate of 2 percent per annum. The current refurbishment of the Nasinu office will allow for two prosecutors to be stationed in Nasinu and attend to the four Magistrates Courts in Nasinu. Nasinu also has the largest volume of</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2423 cases in the country. It is anticipated that with additional financial resources in the next budget cycle, the ODPP will be better equipped to address the large volume of cases that is handled at the Nasinu Courts. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budget has steadily increased from 2022 with a budget of $6.3 million to this $8.6 million this year. With the staffing of 52 prosecutors (31 female and 21 male), 35 established administrative staff (25 females and 6 males) and 12 unestablished support staff. The ODPP has a ratio of 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you might just note, in terms of lawyers in the legal profession, there is a huge difference of more women than men. Prior to this current ratio, female staff was much higher, it has only been through a diversity inclusion approach that has allowed for more male staff recruitment, an approach that was shunned for reason best known to the previous administrators. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the professional structure of ODPP is part of the strategic focus of the Office this year. This professional restructure has led to the intensive JEE. This JEE has provided the ODPP with formation and baseline data to make informed financial decisions with respect to the prosecutors pay, providing motivation to the prosecutors, providing opportunities for prosecutors to access training and enhancement of knowledge, skills and competency of prosecutors. It is important for the information of this august House that there has been no JEE at ODPP in the recent history. There was a JEE for civil servants in 2017 that provided some information, but none as detailed and as comprehensive as that which has recently been completed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the DPP is also focussed on the provision of intensive, targeted and specialised training on cybercrime, cyber enabled crime, and in January 2024, a digital forensic investigation training to prepare and equip our prosecutors on the evolving nature of the crime. In fact the need for training in this area is more urgent now than ever before, given the increasing cyber-related crimes that have been reported. For us here in Fiji, the recent M-PAiSA scam and the eBay shop online recruitment scam is a classic example of the prevalence of cyber enabled crime. The M-PAiSA scam alone is estimated to be worth $614,435.89. Presently, there are 650 cases under investigation at the Criminal Investigations Department of the Fiji Police Force. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need for continued learning by prosecutors in specialised areas of interest is growing. The need for collaboration with development partners who can provide technical and targeted training is crucial. These trainings have boosted the prosecutors’ knowledge in special areas. Apart from the cyber and digital evidence training, trainings in forensic evidence, assets recovery, money laundering, virtual assets and mutual legal assistance have now been explored more than ever before. The Office of the DPP has embarked on a Volunteer Legal Internship Programme (VLIP). This deliberate move is part of its succession planning and strategic direction. With the phasing out of the paralegal programmes and rolling out of the VLIP, that will now allow law graduates who have been admitted to the bar to obtain work experience and be ready for Legal Officer positions as and when it grows. The Volunteer Legal Officer (VLO) also provides invaluable support to the prosecutors with their trial preparations and logistical support. This new initiative of the legal internship programme essentially translates to moving files, better preparation and better research as the VLOs are able to do the necessary research for the prosecutors. The streamlining of some of the processes has allowed for the efficiencies in the assessment</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>2424</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 of the evidence or in the withdrawal of cases where complainants or accused persons have passed away or moved away overseas. Some of these cases have been dragging in our Courts. Part of the streamlining of the processes has also led to the Office of the DPP actively working with police prosecutors, initiating a process that will allow files to be assessed more quickly under the supervision of legal officers and senior supervisors. The Office of the DPP has also utilised the legal vacation period to visit all prosecution offices in court divisions to discuss cases and issues arising out of their cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also note the cases of delayed response time, although now with more capable and competent team, the response time has improved and it is anticipated that with the continued strategic recruitment, the delays will be minimal. In terms of the delay in disposal of cases, it may also be attributed to trial dates setting which is highly depended on available court dates and sittings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are fully aware of this issue. In some instances, witnesses not being available or accused persons are on bench warrant. It could be a combination of many factors. There are 46 Courts in Fiji and each day, the prosecutors are expected to conduct trials. Trials also affect the prosecutors’ other desk work such as providing legal advice or analysis of the evidence to respond to representations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, strategic planning has resulted in new purpose instead of vision. As a Constitutional office, the ODPP has a specific mandate of always upholding the rule of law through efficient and effective prosecution service and values of independence, courage and fairness, with the four strategic priorities and an implementation plan from 2025 to 2030. The Office of the DPP prosecutors only now appreciate and understand their calling and profession better. From trying to secure a conviction, a practice common under the former suspended DPP, prosecutors now prosecute a case dispassionately and fairly, even if the outcome is against them. All officers now benefit from international, local and specialised training where they have never received it before as only a select few had been attending for many years under the past Administration. Prior to 2023, there was no succession planning and no strategic direction. The change in leadership and the implementation of the new purpose and strategic direction of the ODPP is the epitome of strategic planning, and in turn clearly translates to improved service delivery to our people. The Office of the Public Prosecutions is not for the faint hearted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and my learned colleagues in this Parliament - the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection and turaga mataqali on the other side, honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu can attest to this. And I say it again, to be an officer of the DPP is not for the faint hearted. Legal Officer carriage annually is averaging 40 to 60 files per officer, depending on seniority. The Senior Legal Officers around 60 to 80 files and Principal Legal Officers, obviously, more. Some Officers carriage of cases files have been reduced through mitigating measures, such as withdrawal of files where the accused or complainant has passed away, disposal through conducting trials back- to-back with the court. There are 3,000-plus case files daily, as each day, fresh charges are laid in courts all over Fiji. A large part of the prosecutors’ load is mitigated by Police Prosecutions who conduct summary cases.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2425 Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the staggering statistics, it is critical that we all be reminded and appreciate that the court load for criminal cases is also the load of the ODPP. Whilst the load of some officers may seem smaller compared to Police Prosecution, it is because the Office of the DPP appear in all levels of the Court. Police Prosecutors only appear in Magistrates Court, so their volume is higher in terms of criminal files. The load of the officers in ODPP includes criminal summary offences, appeals to the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and the Serious Fraud Division also has the load of doing Civil Forfeiture before the Civil Courts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiative of the ODPP would not be possible without the support of the development partners such as the Council of Europe, UNODC, AFP, and many others. The independence of ODPP, the demands of the job, the competing priorities and striking work-life harmony is an ongoing issue. Fair and effective prosecution is essential for the maintenance of law and order. Every case should be decided on individual merits, however, the decision-making process should apply in all cases. Every prosecutor has the duty to ensure that the right person is prosecuted for the right offence, and that the court is given all the relevant evidence in each case. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of the prosecutors must always act in the interest of justice, not principally for the purpose of obtaining a conviction. Prosecutors must be fair, independent and objective. They must not be influenced by racial, gender, religious or political views or beliefs. With the completion of the JEE, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increased training and the greater access to training opportunities, I have no doubt that the ODPP will continue to uphold the ethics of prosecutors which have been defined and articulated in the Prosecution Code 2003, and I quote: “It is important to observe that in a just society, the conviction of the guilty is in the public interest, as is the acquittal of the innocent.” MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his response. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise, again, to respond to the Ministerial Statement on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. While the Government has chosen to highlight the achievements and plans of this institution, we must take this opportunity to emphasize a fundamental truth - the independence of the ODPP is not just a guiding principle, it is an unshakable cornerstone of democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the independence of the ODPP is not something to be negotiated or debated, it is non-negotiable. There is no ‘may’ in this, there is only a must. The ODPP must stand as an institution that operates free from political interference or external pressures, and I acknowledge the honourable Minister also emphasised that, I am happy to hear that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, any attempt to blur the lines, overstep boundaries or politicise its functions would be an unforgivable betrayal of the public trust. This Office cannot be and must not be weaponised. Integrity, honourable Minister for Justice, cannot be compromised.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2426</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>4 th December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is troubling that in recent times, the integrity of our institutions seem to be under strain. The ODPP, like all other pillars of our judicial system, cannot afford even the perception of compromise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world is watching us. Our people, our investors, our financial institutions and our development partners are all carefully observing how we conduct ourselves and how we uphold the rule of law. Any deviation from the highest standards of independence and transparency will tarnish our reputation and erode public confidence in our judicial system. The stakes are high, honourable Members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister points out to the ambitious plans of the ODPP, let me remind this Government that no ambition is greater than the preservation of judicial impartiality. The evolving nature of crime, while a valid concern, Mr. Speaker, must not be used as an excuse for any action that could compromise the independence of this critical institution. Even that hint of selective prosecution, political influence, or even the slightest hint of impropriety, will have far reaching consequences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot allow a single institution within our judicial system to be compromised, not for political expediency, not for convenience, and certainly not for personal or party gain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the government is truly committed to justice, it must prioritise the protection of institutional independence and integrity above all else. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the honourable Minister has outlined the work of the ODPP, let it be very clear - the Opposition will not tolerate any weakening of our judicial systems or institutions. We will remain vigilant and ensure that the integrity, independence and impartiality of the ODPP and every other institution in our justice system remain intact, as per the 2013 Constitution. On the outset Mr. Speaker, Sir, and at the end I wish the honourable Minister well in ensuring that all that he has spoken of will be adhered to by his Ministry and the ODPP. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate for their response. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Director of Prosecutions is motivated by the principle that it is the interest of justice that the guilty be brought to justice and the innocents are not wrongly convicted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Constitution also requires Parliament to provide adequate funding to the ODPP, and I wish to thank the honourable Minister for Justice for the update this afternoon. This has been long overdue. Sir, I have been in that office in the past five years, and I have seen a lot of changes in the DPP under leadership of the current Acting DPP, Ms. Tikoisuva, who is a prosecutor at heart, a strong lady. I wish to thank Ms. Tikoisuva and the staff at the ODPP for the work that have been carried out in the past years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work of the ODPP continues to grow and demand the skills and commitment of legal, technical and corporate professionals. I wish to thank the Government for continuing to make steady and careful progress towards building an organisation that is both, modern and professional, and which formally promotes and upholds the rule of law.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2427 I strongly believe that training and development programmes are essential in sustaining the delivery of a high-quality prosecution service, and I am glad that the honourable Minister for Justice had alluded to that this afternoon. This is also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an advantage of having a local Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), as they will better understand our jurisdiction rather than bringing in an expatriate who is not really aware of what is going on in our country. I am glad that an office of the DPP is now opening at Nasinu which is long overdue as it is a densely populated area. This should have been done years ago, but I thank the Government that it has now opened a branch at Nasinu Town, and I am grateful for that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also an issue of work overload by the prosecutors in the past. I am glad that there are now 42 Prosecutors in the ODPP and I believe that they will hire prosecutors, increase it to 50 or even 60 or 70, because the work of a prosecutor is not easy. You know the work of a prosecutor. Two Prosecutors manning Nasinu Office alone is not enough, prosecuting or making three or four trials in a day is too much. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe under the leadership of the honourable Minister for Justice, a lot of changes will be done in the ODPP. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you.</p></body>
