<body><h3>BSP FIJI BILL 2024</h3><h4>BSP FIJI BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) BSP Fiji Bill 2024 (Bill No. 22/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5 th December, 2024, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this Bill is fairly straightforward Bill. This is in relation to the BSP bank which is currently domiciled in Fiji as a branch of the Bank of South Pacific which is the parent company. What the bank wishes to do is to change from a branch to a full subsidiary governed under the Companies Act of Fiji and under any other governance supervision arrangements that we have within our mechanism. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cabinet following the request from BSP, the Ministry of Finance took a Cabinet Paper and the Cabinet gave the concurrence and asked for further consultation with BSP management. Further to that, a stakeholder consultation, with BSP management which actually called for written submission on the proposed restructure and the proposed BSP Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, direct invitations were also given, there were face-to-face consultation that was held with the stakeholders and all of them were represented during the set time for consultation which was on 8 th October, 2024, held at the BSP Conference Room at their Fiji branch. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the urgency of the Bill, if I can, because I know that would be perhaps one of the points that my colleagues on the other side might raise, but because the request was made by BSP, by a parent company and the senior management who visited Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two methods of converting or moving away from a branch to a subsidiary: (1) transfer by agreement (which involves other processes, so the best way to do that and the preferred option is); and (2) by legislation. There are precedents in Australia, New Zealand and in Fiji we also have that precedent. For example, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Decree 1991 and ANZ Transfer Regulations 1991, Colonial Fiji Life Act 1991, Australia New Zealand Banking Group Bank of Hawaii Act 2001 and, of course, the Bank of South Pacific Act 2011, so this is not a new thing. The other reason why we rushed this Bill into this session is because the new financial year for BSP will start on 1 st January and if we did not do it in this session, then they would have difficulty moving towards a fully-fledged subsidiary governed by the Companies Act 2015 of Fiji. That is the</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2446 Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 4 th December, 2024 reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have moved this motion under Standing Order 51, and I urge honourable Members to support this. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for the debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Sir, I will give over to the Whip. I think the honourable Whip wanted to speak. MR. SPEAKER.- He is referring to you, honourable Koya. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, obviously, this has been brought under Standing Order 51, but I think it has a valid reason, it needs to be done and this is not like something new. We will have time to munch over it and then come up with something, if there is something within the substantive Bill, but in order to get it done, especially in light of the fact that it needs to be done before January, we do not have any problem and issue with this coming under Standing Order 51. So, all in all, we support the current motion before the House. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Bloc-9 Group, we support the motion, given the urgency, given the bankâ€™s financial year starts in January, and that is quite urgent given this is the only sitting of Parliament that these changes can be done. That meets the requirement for Standing Order 51 to go through the shortcut provisions of the Standing Orders so that the Bill passes without delay under Standing Order 51. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to thank the two honourable Members from the Opposition for supporting the motion. I do not have anything further to add at this stage, but during the debate tomorrow, I will talk about the Bill a little bit more. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put Motion agreed to.</p></body>
