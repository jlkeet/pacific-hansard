The Committee during its public hearing on 19 th November, 2024 was informed that since June 2024, the ACCF board decided to transfer all employment and school accident cases back to the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations (MEPWR). This Report contains five recommendations for consideration by relevant authorities. The Committee is grateful and commends the ACCF for the forthright discussions held with the Committee during their public submission and we wish them well for the very important work that they do. I thank the members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the secretariat for compiling this bipartisan Report.

To improve the overall standard of performance in the civil service, the Ministry provides various trainings and career development opportunities that are open to all civil servants, including courses on leadership, governance, project management and human resources.

L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Review Report - Audit Bill 2024 HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Assistant Ministers, I am pleased to present the Standing Committee on Public Accounts Report to Parliament. This Report provides the results of the Committee’s scrutiny process and the proposed amendments to the Audit Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17 of 2024). First, I wish to thank the previous Speaker for giving the Committee the opportunity to look at the Bill. We normally look at accounts, dollars and cents and this opportunity opened our eyes and challenged us as well. We look forward to other opportunities and I wish to mention that the Committee Members are now considering doing legal courses. The objective of the Audit Bill 2024 is to repeal the Audit Act of 1969 and provide for standardised provisions in line with international standards and best practices. Also, the Bill is in line with the establishments and functions of the Office of the Auditor-General as mandated under Sections 151 and 152 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji. The Audit Act 1969 also provides the legal framework for the duties and powers of the Auditor-General and the principal objectives of the Act are to provide for the salaries, duties and powers of the Auditor-General and the auditing of public accounts and other related purposes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, historically this exercise to review of Audit Act of 1969 began in 2018 but was not able to be finalised. This review is one of the public Financial Management Reform Policy Action that was recommended under Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA). In 2023, the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics with the Office of the Auditor-General undertook a comprehensive review of the Act and conducted wide consultations with stakeholders. The changes were also needed in line with the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) and International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) audit requirement standards, hence this Audit Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee examined the Bill in a tactical manner in which all the stakeholders were informed and given the opportunity to provide submissions on the Bill. Advertisements were published more than once in the Fiji Times and through the Parliament website and Facebook page with invitation letters. It was sent also to the relevant Government departments and stakeholders to provide submissions. The Committee had conducted consultations around key</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>4 th December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2395 locations in Fiji including, Vanua Levu and Viti Levu. Further to that the Committee had also conducted public hearings within the Parliament precinct. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formulation of the report was possible through the information gathered from stakeholders’ consultations, including the Committee’s session with the Office of the Auditor General and Solicitor General’s office. The four-week exercise and the information gathered really assisted the Committee in its decision of the necessary amendments that need to be in the Audit Bill. In comparison to other audit entities especially in PASAI and INTOSAI member countries, where our office is a member of, we are happy to say that all the audit requirements will be met, except financial independence and referrals to the Ministry of Finance. This is due to the fact that the Office of the Auditor-General is not ready or cannot be financially independent in a short period of time. However, plans are in place under PEFA which is currently doing an assessment to have this looked into and adjusted within the next three years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, the Committee wishes to thank all the stakeholders who participated and contributed to the consultation process on this Bill in which relevant information was collected which assisted the Committee to formulate this bipartisan report and make the necessary amendments to the Bill. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to also thank the honourable Members of the Public Accounts Standing Committee for their input into the production of this bipartisan report. My Committee colleagues, honourable Sakiusa Tubuna the Deputy Chairperson, honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Naisa Tuinaceva. I also wish to thank the alternate members of the Committee who took part in the deliberations and consultations namely, honourable Taito Rokomatu and honourable Penioni Ravunawa who stood in as alternate members pursuant to Standing Order 111(5). I also wish to thank the hardworking Secretariat, the drafters at the Office of the Solicitor General, the Ministry of Finance and staff of the Office of the Auditor-General for the finalisation of the Bill. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Report to Parliament with a proposed amendment to the Audit Bill. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to Standing Order 121(1) and Standing Order 86, the Standing Committee has now tabled its report accordingly and the Bill is now set for Consideration by the Committee of the Whole Parliament on a future sitting date.</p></body>
