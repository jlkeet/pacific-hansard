<body><h3>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3><h4>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 20/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or any other Committee of Parliament; (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5 th December, 2024 and that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move that the Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 be now debated in this sitting of Parliament. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, needs to be put to debate now as there has been sufficient discussions on the same with other Ministers. The Presidential Pensions Act 1994 provides the legislative framework for the pension of the former Governor Generals and Presidents of Fiji. This law was enacted during the term the SVT-GVP Coalition Government which I led from 1992 to 1999. The provisions allow for the payment of pension as well as other benefits as follows: (1) Provision for the installation, connection, maintenance and rental of a telephone in any private residence of his or hers, and to meet all charges in respect of local calls originating from such telephone. (2) Provision of a Ministerial-type vehicle and a driver, including free-travel on scheduled trips of government ships. (3) Medical treatment, hospitalisation, drugs and all other hospital services locally, provided that where local specialised treatment and medical treatment overseas including the cost of treatment, accommodation and air travel necessary, such expenditure may be incurred at the discretion of the Prime Minister. (4) The provision of an annual budgetary allocation of an amount of $30,0000 per annum and subject to periodic adjustments, to enable the person in receipt of the pension, to hire personal staff as required. (5) Provision of security protection at the discretion of the Prime Minister. To be eligible for additional benefits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the current law, as it stands, a President must have completed five years of service. This term in Office in the Act should be consistent with the provisions of the term of Office in the Constitution. Constitutions prior to the 2013 Constitution provided for a five-year term in office for President and Head of State. This was reduced to three years in the 2013 Constitution, but the Act remained unchanged. In fairness to Presidents who serve only three-year term in office, which is a complete term, it is important to amend section 8(1) of the Act to make it consistent with the Constitutional provisions and to allow the incumbent to be eligible for all benefits provided for in the Act.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2263 I accordingly move that this Bill be now progressed further to debate, pursuant to Standing Order 51. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion, specifically on the provisions that had been cited. At the end of the debate, we would have the Right of Reply from the mover. Honourable Members are reminded that you are allowed a time limit of only 20 minutes. Are there anyone who wishes to intervene? HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion that is before the House. I think it is necessary to go through Standing Order 51 given that it has only one amendment, that is, section 8 and it is long overdue. Given that this should have been done by the previous government when the 2013 Constitution came into being, this particular Act is to be inconsistent with the Constitution. I do not see in any way that this should be taken to the Committee given that this minor amendment can be debated in the substance on Thursday. I support the motion that it goes through Standing Order 51 because of this amendment, it only brings it to be consistent with the 2013 Constitution. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, just a small contribution on the Bill. We also do not have issues with this Bill being brought under Standing Order 51 as it is a minor amendment which is aligned to the Constitution. What we are doing is, with regards to the appointment of the President having two terms, then it becomes six years, so it is only appropriate to align the law as required by the Constitution itself. Just a small question, once we amend this Bill and it becomes an Act whether it is going to be applied retrospectively because we have a President who has vacated office or is going to be from the day it is to be gazetted and moving forward. If we gazette it now, the President has already resigned so even though he had served for three years, he will not be eligible if it will not go in a retrospective manner. Can we get clarity on that before we vote on the motion, Mr. Speaker? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, the obvious answer to that question and suggestion is yes. It applies to the immediate past President, and it makes the provisions of the Constitution compliant with the Act or the Act complying with the Constitution. MR. SPEAKER.- Are there anymore interventions? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there being no other response required at this time, I commend the motion to the House. MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
