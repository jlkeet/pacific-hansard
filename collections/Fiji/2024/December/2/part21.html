<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF HEALTHAND MEDICAL SERVICES 2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES 2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 2 nd October, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. LAL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports, the Ministry’s role to emanate from its core responsibility of delivering quality, preventative, creative and rehabilitative centre services to the population through its hospitals, health centres, nursing stations throughout the country, consistently within the demand from the public. There is a significant focus to maintain a continuum of care from community level to primary healthcare service, to tertiary level care at Divisional Hospitals. This is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support a broad range of relevant policies, standards and protocols to ensure safe and high-quality service are delivered at the health sector assistance level from nursing stations, health centres in Sub-Divisional Hospitals to Divisional Hospitals. The Standing Committee, in its deliberation, identified areas that the Ministry encountered: (1) Strengthening the public private partnership can lead to a more innovative solution that will help improve infrastructure and better service delivery.</p><h4>(2) The geographical isolation of Fiji’s maritime and remote areas presents formidable</h4><p>challenges for effectively delivering healthcare services here in Fiji. The pandemic highlighted gaps in Fiji’s health system, particularly in the capacity, infrastructure and its workforce. The COVID pandemic’s profound impact in Fiji’s Ministry of</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>2286 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 Health and Medical Service, leading to significant changes in its policies and operations. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services has evolved and landmarks from COVID pandemic. The Standing Committee looks forward to its improvement service delivery of the best healthcare to the people of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is open for debate on the motion. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a small comment, before I contribute to the motion towards the debate, I would like to say that natural justice prevailed whereby Mr. Daniel Kim of Grace Road was granted bail after being unlawfully detained for more than 400 days. Finally, justice has prevailed, and I wish him all the best for his case about the Judicial and Constitutional Review on Monday next week. Coming back to the Report, I would like to thank the Standing Committee for the deliberation that they have actually done with regards to the Ministry of Health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one wants to lose our loved ones, especially knowing that disease or condition was treatable, but treatment was not available in our public hospital. It becomes a very sad situation when we tend to lose our family members just because medicine consumables or regents to perform tests are not available. This is why we need to have a hundred percent effective, efficient and reliable health care system. We need to reform the health care sector to change the policies and institutions to improve its performance and the health of the population. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to have the political will to revolve the health system. We need to ensure that health care is accessible to everyone, unfortunately this Government has criticised the Bainimarama Government’s policies about health system in Fiji at every stage. We used to ensure that people get quality and efficient treatment through the PPP programme, but unfortunately this Government has diminished or basically crippled this policy as they do not have the money to pay private doctors. Because of this reason, they cannot include more doctors and dentists in the PPP programme. Fijians must go and sit in lines at public hospital for hours to get treated. This is ridiculous, Mr. Speaker. All this government can do is blame, blame and blame. They should go and ask the people in the Western Division about the level and quality of treatment they get from Aspen Medical, a policy decision made by the previous Government, and on the other hand, look at the Nadi Hospital managed by the current government. The service is pathetic at government-owned hospitals and medical centres. It is two years now and what have they done? Basically, nothing! When Keiyasi Hospital was built, the decision was criticised but now that it is done, the Government cannot maintain and operate it properly. We need to build new hospitals in deprived areas to make healthcare available to the un-deserved population. Let us see if we can come up with any more new hospitals in this term of Parliament. We have just been hearing about the 100 Bed Super Speciality Cardiology Hospital that is to be built by the Indian Government. What we recently heard is that the Government is not even able to provide land to build this hospital. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Hogwash! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- I do not know how far this is correct but the honourable Minister,</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2287 in his response, can elaborate on this particular matter. Healthcare organisations can play a pivotal role in increasing the health literacy of affected groups by the expanding educational programme. We need to improve the efficiency of the health sector. How can we do this when the Ministry cannot even retain the experienced medical staff to bring efficiency into the system? Medical professionals are leaving, not just because of greener pastures but the Government is failing to provide a conducive working environment. Staff are made to work overtime even when they are not rostered. While workers are giving a hundred percent towards their work, the support needed is not provided by the Government. Patient experience needs to be improved and that is what we were doing through the PPP programme. Fijians had options to visit GPs early in the morning and then end up at work rather than waiting for hours at public health facilities and returning home with a sick sheet. The patient’s record is still kept in files while we have the Patient Information Systems (PATIS). Why are we not implementing whereby records are entered in PATIS? We should use technology to improve efficiency and patient-care quality. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it takes months to get a medical report at any public hospital and that too at a hefty fee. This Government cannot provide medical care on time therefore I am requesting at least provide medical reports on time. We need to improve coordination between departments as treating patients is a holistic approach. It would not be possible to give the best treatment if departments do not coordinate and provide adequate support to the specialist. We need to ensure that we prioritise patients and their safety, reduce clinical errors that leads to deadly consequences as we had with one such case in Nadi and are still waiting for an outcome of the inquiry that was taken by the Ministry for a patient named Ashika; the family is still patiently waiting. Improving the quality of health care should be paramount. To improve the quality, we need human resources, equipment, infrastructure, medicine and consumables. Quality can only be improved when the doctor is surrounded by qualified people providing support towards the management of the patient. We need to put patients at the centre of health care delivery. The patient needs access to right care, at the right time to get the best results. The staff at health centres and hospitals needs to provide customers a friendly environment, and they need to realise that they are there for the patients and need to give them such care. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the waiting room areas are not pleasant. Most of the health centres do not have adequate sitting in the waiting area leading to overcrowding. Some of the health centres do not even have awaiting area, let alone chairs to sit. The deteriorating infrastructure of the medical facility is really worrying everyone. Looking at the condition of toilets in some of the facilities is very worrying. Toilets that do not even have toilet pans to sit, taps are running without water and no toilet paper for sanitation. The stench coming from washrooms is unbearable, imagine a patient suffering from diarrhoea visiting those toilets when the Government cannot even provide toilet papers. For some of us, it may be a laughing matter, but the general public are suffering. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must mention that we need to change the membership of the National Medicine and Therapeutic Committee while on one side we are trying to bring in TGA, FDA and EU standard medication, on the other hand, the medication we are using are very old. It is becoming difficult to even source this medication under the new standard. While new, effective and more economical medicines are available, our essential drug list that is reviewed by the National Medicine and Therapeutic Committee are still using medications that are now part of archive in developed</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>2288 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 nations. We should have the private sector and other stakeholders’ representation in the National Medicine and Therapeutic Committee. Our people deserve better and newer treatment. We need to ensure that the health care is financed sustainably. When the previous government started giving a certain percentage from FNU levy towards improving the health care sector, this Government overturned it. This Government has underutilised CAPEX, all they are doing is increasing the OPEX, reduce the expenditure, stop overseas trips, save money and put it for the good use of the health sector. Stop using the civil service to employ failed candidates and supporters. We need good people to do good job. Medical field, Mr. Speaker, Sir, human resources is very specialised. We need specialists and that comes with experience and cost. We need to fork out more money to pay better salaries across the sector to stop our health workers from migrating. Mr. Speaker, Sir, medical system cannot function if equipment in hospitals are not operational. We need to ensure that our biomedical staff are well trained to maintain these equipment. Most of the time, people are complaining that equipment are down, and we do not have biomedical staff to fix the machines. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 90 percent of the health centres do not have pharmacists to dispatch or control the inventory. We cannot expect a staff nurse or pharmacy attendant to control inventory thus leading to medicine shortage and wastage of medicine all over the nation. This leads to poor patient management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot needs to be changed to improve the healthcare system, and I hope that the honourable Minister will take the considerations of the Committee and implement them as soon as possible. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to congratulate you on your appointment as Speaker of this august House, and I wish you well. I must thank the Committee for their deliberations and work on the Consolidated Annual Reports from 2016 right up to 2021. It is the report that I hold here, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I fully agree with my colleague on the issues that he has raised. It is something that I believe that did not start all of a sudden last year. It is something that has progressively been there and likewise this Government is doing something about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to again thank the Committee for their work, and I do note that in their Report, they had raised key findings and recommendations. There are about 12 finding and 11 recommendations. As per the previous two Reports that had been debated, the Annual Reports for the 2016-2021 Consolidated Report are mostly outdated, and the findings together with the recommendations is something that the Ministry, not only this Government, the previous Government, has rectified some of the issues: Recommendation One: The Ministry should submit its Annual Reports on time. Since taking office last year, that was one of the first initiatives that I had requested the Ministry to report all relevant Annual Reports. I am glad to say that this was done last year and likewise I can say for certain that 2021-2022 Report has been done as well and now with the Vetting Team.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2289 Recommendation Two: In terms of the review of the regulations and policies to ensure medical professionals are adequately equipped to deal with similar unprecedented situations as similar to COVID-19. Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has commanded a number of reviews, especially on the legislation part, endorsed by Cabinet, some are in the review stages and some will be tabled in Cabinet for endorsement. Therefore, in the consequent period next year, we will be tabling Bills for review and also planning the feedback that we get and then we have amendments to each. Recommendation Three: The Ministry to work with relevant stakeholders to address challenges pertaining to infrastructure development and related crucial areas such as the current staff accommodation. Again, this is one of the areas that I had mentioned, it is not something new. It has been there for quite some time and through the Ministry and some of its new initiatives, we are seeing changes in repairing, renovation of certain facilities, not only within the Government, but starting last year, we have opened up the assistance. We recognise that we, as Government, cannot work alone. Therefore, we have asked for assistance from the private sector, especially from the Board of Visitors for certain facilities and they have come on board. They have stepped in and assisted the Ministry in terms of partnering in infrastructure development and also not to forget the development partners who have stepped up and assisted us, especially DFAT and MFAT. This partnership has shown an impact on the ground especially with the renovations and improvement of certain facilities within the Suva and Nausori corridor, and now going up to the West and hopefully before Christmas, we will commission the new Momi Nursing Station facility. Recommendation Four: The Ministry should review the current staff retention policy to address the staff migration challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one of the initiatives that I am proud to say that this Government is doing and through the ongoing dialogue between the Ministry, Ministry of Finance, Civil Service, we have come up with plans and there have been improvements in remuneration of nurses, other cadres are also being included in the review, and based on the review, we will peg them to their appropriate remuneration going forward. Recommendation Five: The Ministry should work closely with international organisations and donor partners. Since coming into office, we had started a donor co-ordination, partnership with the relevant donor partners and through one of those donor partners, they are assisting us and likewise, learning from them as well. One of those partners is the World Bank, through an initiative have come up with a Health Sector Review of 2024. It is a good report, worth reading and it will highlight what the honourable Alvick Maharaj has said, of course, is mainly here. Recommendation Six: The Ministry should increase awareness on social media platforms. Yes, that is being done through our media team, not only in terms of putting out notices but also trying to be ahead or be proactive against misinformation as well. The Ministry should address the challenges faced by the medical profession on accessing transport to the rural and maritime areas. Sir, this is something that the Ministry is also improving on, especially in the</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>2290 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 maritime areas, we have through the budgetary allocation of last year and this year provided outboard motor boats to those living and serving in the maritime areas with facilities in the Lau Group, Central Division, Beqa and even Naililili in Rewa and up to the North, Visoqo Nursing Station and other areas, Lagi, Rabi and Kioa as well. Together with the outboard boat, also the Ministry is providing backup vehicles for certain areas and for hard-to-reach places in the interior of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Recommendation Eight: The Ministry to ensure that healthcare workers go through proper training in handling biomedical equipment. As raised by honourable Maharaj, this is a cadre that we intend to support because going into the future, we see that they are used to be of great importance. As medicine progresses, there will be a need for them, and this is why the Ministry is investing in this cadre as well. Recommendation Nine: The Ministry to do a comprehensive analysis to determine the factors contributing to the extended waiting time as raised by honourable Maharaj, this is not something new. The Ministry in its current form is transforming Primary Health Care Project, something that we will do and again this will be part of the World Bank Health Sector Transformation and Scaling. Recommendation Eleven: The Ministry should ensure that the services provided by Ba Aspen Hospital and Lautoka Hospital under the PPP should continue. I will let the honourable Minister for Finance elaborate more on that but nevertheless the Ministry, through dialogue with relevant partners in the partnership, have come up with an agreement to see that this can be done properly. In its initial setup, the Ministry of Health was not consulted. So, in this new partnership agreement that we will be moving forward, all parties will be consulted and therefore it is an agreement, I believe, that will reach new heights in terms of services in the PPP for our people in the West. That is my contribution on what the Ministry is doing and again, I would like to thank the Committee and wish them well on their future deliberations. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution to this motion is not just as a Member of Parliament but as a voice for every Fijian who wants a health care system that works, one that is accessible and effective. Let us look at the reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A reality where election promises are broken, budgets are underutilised, and people’s lives are hanging by a thread. During the period under review, Fiji faced 14 cyclones, two of which were Category 5 and the once in a century COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these enormous challenges, the Bainimarama Government stayed focussed on improving Fiji’s healthcare. We implemented forward thinking policies that made healthcare more accessible with the new and upgraded infrastructure and prioritised staff training and retention. Nursing stations like Dawasamu, Namara, Nabou, Cuvu, Nawaicoba and Tau were upgraded to health centres with doctors and nurse practitioners in charge. That is progress, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Unfortunately, during their term, I was informed by the residents of Nawaicoba that there were days that this health centre was under lock and key, not even a single nurse or the doctor was there. I hope that matter has been sorted.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2291 The Bainimarama Government also offered incentives and embraced a Public-Private Partnership model to improve health care delivery. Initiatives like the GP subsidy scheme, private dentist subsidy, laboratory test subsidy and the free medicine programme helped Fijians access quality health care. Let us not forget the establishment of state-of-the-art facilities like Heart International Aspen Medical, Pacific Specialist Health Care, and Nasese Private Hospital, which brought specialised treatments, like open heart surgeries, stenting within the reach of many Fijians. That was through the various incentives that were provided. After TC Winston, we rebuilt and upgraded critical facilities like Ba Hospital, Nakasi Hospital, Navosa Hospital, Sawakasa Health Centre, and the Makoi Maternity Hospital. These are the facts, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Our Government knew that investing in health care professional was essential. Salaries were increased; some technical staffs stared at $28,000; and specialists earned over $140,000 annually; scholarships and overseas training opportunities were also expanded to ensure we trained out talents. Now, let us fast forward to today. Despite a bigger health budget, the system is collapsing. Nurses who graduated in December had to wait six months for employment, while those already in the system were overworked. Where is the strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir? We hear that there are only 200 midwives for 300,000 childbearing women, and last year alone, 500 midwives migrated. We produce 50 midwives annually, sponsored by the Australian Government but they are not even bonded. This is poor planning having a huge impact on women’s health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the underutilised 2023-2024 Budget is another glaring failure. Of the $1million allocated for staff quarters, $800,000 was not used. Labasa Hospital had $5million for upgrades and less than $1million was spent. We were given reasons like electricity was not there. Another $5 million for special maintenance and not a single cent was used. For urban hospital equipment, only half of the $4 million allocation was spent. Out of $12.3 million for biomedical supplies, $7.4 million was unspent. Dental equipment, $1.2 million allocated but only $37,000 was used, and this Government claims to prioritise healthcare. Mental health is in crisis, but the budget for St. Giles Hospital was slashed. When questioned during the Budget Committee of Supplies discussion, the honourable Minister said it was sufficient. Mr. Speaker, Sir, health care workers tell a very different story. The outsourcing budget for emergency clinical services was cut by $1 million. Yet the honourable Minister claims the capacity has improved. Really? Meanwhile, CWM Hospital cannot even conduct basic blood tests because there are no regents. Patients and health care workers alike are suffering. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me paint a heart wrenching picture of reality that many Fijian families go through. A father, overwhelmed with fear and helplessness, watched his critical ill son clinging to life in the ICU. It is a Sunday, a day when hope should flourish, but instead this father is forced to spend $500 on urgent medicine because the hospital shelves are empty. Imagine the anguish of that father as he walks into a pharmacy knowing every dollar spent is a desperate bid to save his child, but the pain does not end there. Nurses driven by desperation by the lack of resources pleaded with him to share the life-saving medicine with other patients of other families who simply cannot afford them. And if you are wondering who this father is, let me tell you that this father is no one else but honourable Aliki Bia. He shared his story with me, and I was deeply touched with the pain and suffering he went through, and his child is still in ICU. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just a story of one family, it is a stark and devastating reflection of this Government that has failed its people. The sorrow of that father echoes the anguish of</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>2292 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 countless Fijians who are left to fend for themselves when they are most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while hospitals are in crisis, the Government sends a 56-member delegation, including nine Ministers, to COP29. Fijians are asking, why is this Government prioritising junket trips, as termed by honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry, over their health? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government promised to improve healthcare but instead, it has deteriorated. Many Fijians now look back and say, thank God COVID-19 happened during the Bainimarama Government. Health care is not just a line in the budget, it is a lifeline. This Government must stop fooling the people who trusted them with the election promises. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I also would like to thank the Standing Committee for their very comprehensive Report, and I hope this Government will pay attention towards improving the health services in this country. I know they are very busy producing reports, consultations, reports and consultations and only in today’s paper I read that NCD’s is definitely a crisis in this country, but one has to ask why, NCD’s is a crisis in this country? Look at the cost of living, can people afford food? These are some realities on the ground. MR. SPEAKER.- I will rule out of order. You are completely out from the topic we are discussing. It is about the Annual Report. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- The Annual Report also mentions NCDs, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, this is a real reality on the ground, and I am urging the Government to look at the cost of living so that people can afford decent food. They are suffering because they cannot buy food, they struggle when they go to the supermarket and see the cost of proteins, cost of milk, that is the reality on the ground. I know you do not want to hear this, but I am speaking from the public who have related stories to me, and I am speaking from my very personal experience when you go and shop in the supermarket. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me this opportunity and I hope the honourable Minister will take heed of this. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to contribute to the debate on the Consolidated Review Annual Report for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016 to 2021. I will only focus on the Standing Committee’s recommendation. Firstly, I commend the call for the timely submission of the Annual Reports. This procedural, yet critical aspect provides a wealth of information that enables us in this Parliament to understand proposed plans and improve in a timely manner to benefit the people we represent in this Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report falls in the uncertain and unchartered time when Tropical Cyclone Winston a category 5 cyclone swept through the southern hemisphere taking away 44 lives and devastated more than 60 percent of our population. Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic where more than 800 lives were lost due to COVID. Also, during these two turbulent times it has exposed cracks in our health system. The recommendation by the Committee on 6.2 addresses this by urging the Ministry to learn from this crisis and to ensure that our medical professionals, the equipment, the healthcare infrastructure are well equipped to deal with such situations in the future. Although infrastructure development and personnel accommodation for staff are normally not debated in the health sector’s report, but the</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2293 impact on boosting the staff morale and the service level quality is undeniable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore the Standing Committee recommendation for the review is essential. The Standing Committee’s attention to staff migration is also concerning. Our health care sector is losing talented health professionals overseas and we must tackle this through an attractive staff retention policy with regards to their salary, wages, resilient work environment and welfare support. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our partnership with the international bodies is essential in building healthcare facilities and counteracting the ill-effects of climate change. As I noted a surge in drug abuse, NCDs, HIV/AIDS which cannot be ignored, and the Ministry should deploy massive outreach potential at least on all social media platforms to create awareness for our population Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is imperative to consider our established local settings, the structure to be consulted and be involved in fighting for NCD’s and drug abuse. The ecumenical faith-based organisations, the vanua, the community set-up are critical in addressing this national crises through awareness, preaching, teaching and through talanoa. Already alluded to by the honourable Minister, transport is another integral enabling tool for medical professionals to reach the hard-to-reach places in our rural communities. We need good vehicles, and also for the maritime and the coastal areas, we need good boats that are safe for the transfer of staff and also patients. To improve the service in health care centres, a reduction in waiting time is essential. To ensure that healthcare workers are properly trained in handling biomedical equipment and also capacity building and support for our biomedical engineers and biomedical technicians. I fully support the Private, Public Partnership oriented health care services at the Ba Aspen and Lautoka Hospital, and we look forward to seeing the Ministry continue its efforts towards achieving the SDG targets. Before I resume my seat Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask all honourable Members to support the many initiatives that has been mooted by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services recently, which include the Fiji Health Adaptation Plan 2024-2030, it was announced in COP29 in Baku last month. Also, the initiative of the National HIV Surge Strategy to counter the rise of HIV/AIDS cases by intensifying and testing capacity, increasing community awareness for HIV/AIDS. The commencement of the third steps for NCD conducted through collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) also is the intention to strengthen primary health care and to resource the primary health care initiatives. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcome and the recommendation out of the health audit by the World Bank, in the allocation of 3.5 percent of our national GDP towards health service is not worthy and also we can challenge ourselves to go forward from there. It will serve a strong basis for our health care development moving forward. In all this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the honourable Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Finance to look for necessary funding to enable the honourable Minister to be able to deliver this health sector initiative effectively. Lastly, I fully agree with the Standing Committee’s recommendation and urge my honourable colleagues to offer their support to this motion for the health benefit of all Fijians. I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to contribute to this debate. Vinaka.</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>2294 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services for very clearly laying out exactly what the Government and what the Ministry of Health has been doing over the last two years. I also want to thank honourable Ravunawa for a very sensible contribution, unlike the hypocrisy that came from honourable Maharaj and honourable Premila Kumar. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these two honourable Members, when we were in Opposition, twice we moved a motion to have inquiry into the health system and they were sitting here, this side of Parliament and they opposed it. The result of that, Sir, and the fact that we are discussing 2016-2021 Annual Reports is a demonstration of the failure that happened in the health system delivery under the FijiFirst Government and their leader. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they should listen. Thank you, Sir, because I was listening to them very carefully. Let me point out, then I will tell you a little story as soon as we got into Government, very early I went to Dreketi and I went to Wainikoro, when we entered Dreketi Health Centre and I entered the doctor’s consultation room, there was dust, there were tiles falling apart, the two nurses on the other side were in tears, saying “Sir, this is the condition in which we work.” We fixed that health centre Mr. Speaker, Sir, in about six months in 2023. When I saw the quarters of the doctor and it was falling apart, and she was still committed and serving almost 15,000 people in that area. From there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we moved to Wainikoro, we got there and I asked the X-ray person, how is your X-ray department? She said “Sir, I have been coming to work, punching then filing and going back because the X-ray machine has not worked for four months.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, we built Nausori Health Centre in one year, we got the New Zealand Government to support building the health centre and the honourable Minister and the honourable Prime Minister went and opened, That health centre Mr. Speaker, Sir, was falling apart, people did not want to go to that health centre, they were serving 70,000 people and today you go to that health centre people have told me in Nausori, Mr. Speaker Sir, “thank you, we now feel like going to the Nausori Health Centre.” This is the level at which the health facilities were left. Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Maharaj, if you had listened he was not here and if he was here he would have listened to the honourable Minister for Health, all the things that he is doing. He talked about the PPP, I gave a detailed explanation in the 2024-2025 Budget Address, how that agreement was done. It was almost unlawful what was done. Government is paying every single cent....</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Take them to Court:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this Government is now sorting that out. We like Public Private Partnership. The abuse that was happening in the previous system, we have plugged that hole, we are now working out how it should be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Yes, not everywhere, not every health centre has been fixed in two years. Not every pharmacy, not every instant things happen, and we have to understand why people complain, they complain to me as well. However, for honourable Kumar and honourable Maharaj to come here and pontificate and forget completely what they had left, be a bit honest. I know it will take time for you to get used to being in Opposition. You probably need two terms in Opposition before you come into Government</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2295 to be able to understand the frustration that one has, because when you are in Government or in Opposition, you get the same kind of complaints from people. We do not mind honourable Members from the Opposition coming and talking about it, I used to do that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I know, honourable Maharaj learnt it from me, he is experienced enough. But you also admit that when you are in Government what went wrong. I think that will be honest, that will be more helpful and that will be appreciated by people on this side. Let me talk about the budget. Honourable Kumar, out of her 10-minute contribution, there is only one thing that she said that made sense out of so many that she said, and that was about budget utilization. Yes, there is an issue. Our budget now is about 4 percent of GDP. The WHO’s standard is about 4.5. We have moved away from the low budget that we had before to about percent of GDP, 0.5 short of the WHO international requirement of 4.5 percent which comes to about $580 million and includes the payment that the Government makes to the PPP. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has been very honest. We have not denied any time that there are problems and that is why this Government called for a review of the total health sector. What the Report shows, they should read the Report. What it shows very clearly that in the last, almost 15 years to 20 years, our health outcomes of an upper middle-income country, our health outcomes is equivalent to a low income country.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Richard Naidu:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> In the 1970s and 1980s, the Report says very clearly that our public health outcomes, the incidents of NCDs were much lower than what we have now. We, as a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also introduced policies. I know, honourable Kumar was opposing that. We put tax on sugary products and she was talking about why we are not doing anything too. She is talking about cost of living. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the last Budget, all our policies apart from the budget in 2022, 2023 and 2024 where we increased funding for social welfare for other sectors, in the last budget we addressed the income side directly, we increased the salaries of civil servants, we raised the minimum wages rate from $4.50 to $5 from 1 st April, 2009. We have seen the impact of that. You look at the consumption. You look at the economic activity. You look at the confidence now in the economy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is up there and the outcome of that is what the honourable Minister for Health just said about some of the things, “things are happening, there are problems, and we admit that. But it will be fixed, it is being fixed and I would suggest to people like honourable Maharaj who is a health sector man to appreciate these things better. When you come to Parliament, give some constructive suggestion instead of playing politics. We still have 18 months before we get into the election mode. So, I will ask them to wait for another year before they get into an election mode and start talking like this.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just speak the truth:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Government is completely on board. We have got this Report; the World Bank is with us, the partners are with us, the $650 million project. Phases 1 and 2 will deal with the incidents of NCDs, Primary Health Care and that will reduce, in economic terms, it is a no brainer because if we spend more money in the public health sector, we stop more people from coming up, ending up in hospitals. Economically, it makes sense, health wise it makes sense, it improves productivity, it makes things better for everyone, not in terms of only health outcomes, but for the economy.</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>2296 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2 nd December, 2024 HON.
