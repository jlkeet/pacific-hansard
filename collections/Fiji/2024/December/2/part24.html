<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>Reply to Written Question No. 271/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government (Ref. Page 2261) MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT (Hon. M. K. Nalumisa) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to Question No. 271/2024 is as follows: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to respond to the question that by virtue of the Local Government Act 1972, the Special Administrators were appointed in December 2023 to implement the much-needed constructive reforms in local government. The appointments were purely based on merit through a due diligence process. Locals with an understanding of community needs were chosen as Special Administrators. Under the direction of the Special Administrators, the Municipal Councils have been functioning autonomously. The salary and entitlements of Special Administrators as per the Higher Salaries Commission Act 2023, is determined by the Higher Salaries Commission. The Special Administrators salaries determination is based on the size of the Councils, which is small, medium and large. In addition, the salary of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and acting CEO is also determined by the Higher Salaries Commission. Part A The Municipal Councils currently have Special Administrators who are acting as Chief Executive Officers. The Councils where a Special Administrator is acting at CEO are: Suva City Council, Nasinu Town Council and Tavua Town Council. There are no Executive Chairs, as noted in the honourable Member’s questions, as the Ministry do not consent to the creation of a new position within the Council Structure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dates and salary level to the Acting CEO are as follows: This salary is calculated similar to the civil service acting, that is, 95 percent of the difference of the salary of the Special Administrator and the CEO is added to the base salary of the Special Administrator. 1. 2. Suva City Council • Acting CEO: Mr. Tevita Boseiwaqa • Date of Appointment: 4 July 2024 • Salary as approved by the Higher Salaries Commission: annual remuneration of $159,386 Nasinu Town Council • Acting CEO: Mr. Felix Magnus • Date of Appointment: 4 July 2024 • Salary Level: Annual remuneration of $79,549.80 3. Tavua Town Council • Acting CEO: Mr. Sireli Korovulavula</p><p>v. • Date of Appointment: 22 October 2024 • Salary Level: Acting Salary for Acting CEO is not yet implemented as approval from Higher Salaries Commission is still pending. He is only paid the SA Allowance of $12,000/annum until the approval from the Higher Salaries Commission Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rationale for appointing the Acting CEOs for the Councils was essential to ensure the streamlining of municipal services, improving infrastructure development, strengthening the revenue streams, bringing about financial stability, preparation of annual accounts and publication of Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to the appointment of the Acting CEOs, the Ministry had sought legal advice from the Office of the Solicitor-General on the legal implications of the same. The decision to appoint Acting Chief Executive Officers for the three Councils is an interim arrangement only. The appointment will end as soon as the Councils are able to recruit a qualified and suitable CEOs to lead the respective organisations. The Ministry of Local Government and the Municipal Councils understand the need to fill the substantial positions in a timely manner. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as such, the Municipal Councils have engaged the services of KPMG Advisory (Fiji) Pte Limited as the Recruiting Agency to support the Councils in the recruitment of the Chief Executive Officers. The service of the local executive recruitment firm is to assist the Municipal Councils in the end-to-end selection and recruitment process for the positions of Chief Executive Officers. This independent and transparent process is to enable the Councils to recruit personnel who have the skills and experience required for the position. The recruitment process is planned to start this month and is anticipated to be concluded by early 2025. The Ministry is hopeful that the Municipal Councils will be able to recruit visionary applicants who can contribute towards the reforms and success of the Councils amongst other priority areas of the Councils. Part B Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Special Administrators are entitled to allowances which are paid monthly. The allowances are based on the size of the Municipal Councils. The Special Administrators are also entitled to meal and travel allowance for out of town or city expenses for any meetings such as local government forums, payable by the Councils. It is worth nothing that the large and medium councils pay the allowances from the Council funds whilst the Ministry pays for the Special Administrators of the Small Councils. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total expenditure for Special Administrators and Acting Chief Executive Officers for the 13 Municipal Councils from January to November 2024 amounts to $944,670.68. The table below provides the total allowances paid to the Special Administrators from January to November 2024 by the Ministry.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allowances of the Special Administrators of the 13 Municipal Councils have been approved by the Higher Salaries Commission as required under the Higher Salaries Commission Act 2023.
