<body><h3>FIJI TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION BILL 2024</h3><p>FIJI TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION BILL 2024 HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51(3), I move: That the -</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2264 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2 nd December, 2024 (a) Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 (Bill No. 19/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or any other Committee of Parliament; (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Wednesday, 4 th December, 2024 with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, you are aware,this Bill was moved by First Reading on 3 rd October, 2024. However, Standing Order 51(3) permits Bills to be fast-tracked at any stage. In that respect, this motion is in order. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move that the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 (Bill No. 19/2024) be now debated in this session of Parliament. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, needs to be put to debate now as there has been sufficient awareness and consultations undertaken, encompassing a broad cross-section of our society. I commend all those who have been participating in this. On 10 th September, 2023, Sir, this august House approved a motion to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Cabinet subsequently appointed a Steering Committee to consult and develop the legislative framework for consideration by this august House. In drafting the Bill, the Committee conducted consultations with both victims/survivors and perpetrators of various political events. Consultations were also held with civil society, faith-based groups, human rights activists and advocates, media organisations, political parties, communities in the Northern, Western and Central Divisions. The Committee also engaged with youth groups as well as our diaspora community through digital platforms. The basic elements of the Bill are drawn from the Commission of Inquiry Act. The Committee also learned from global experiences. Over the years around the world more than 50 countries at some point, established Truth and Reconciliation Commissions. One of the major purposes of these initiatives was to resolve historic injustices and abuses through public hearings, truth-telling and reconciliation between victims/survivors and perpetrators, as a way of moving beyond the painful past towards a peaceful future. It is hoped that many who have suffered gross human rights violations, and their families and communities will find healing and closure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those who were in the Business Committee in the previous House will remember that I tried to move this motion with the Business Committee at that time, but it was not allowed. Now, I move that this Bill now progress further to debate pursuant to Standing Order 51. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion has been tabled in the House and I think for all of us in this country, given the history that we have been through and all the tumultuous things that we have had in the past, we know the impact that it has had. It is not only having an impact on us, it has had an impact on those who come before us and it will happen again, it will have an impact on those who come after us. I am not only talking about the events of coups, but I am also talking about all the things that ever happened in this country that have shaken this country to its very core. It is important that we do this. I think in all of our teachings, we talk about reconciliation and truth; that is true. I agree with</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2265 all of that. I agree with all the tenets that we have that these things need to take place, but what are the concerns that we have? The honourable Prime Minister has talked at length and very eloquently about the fact that this is based on a lot of work done by Committees and the research that they have undertaken. But I think this critical Bill that we have here which people in this country have different views about, while it has gone through the lens of public opinion and the Committees that have done their work, I do not know the bureaucrats or the Civil Service that they have done it, it has not gone to the fine lens of the representatives of the people. It has not gone to the lens of their scrutiny and they are seeking their own opinions on this particular Bill because one of the things that we are talking about in truth and reconciliation, there are two aspects of this. There is the aspect of reconciliation and the aspect of truth. What we tend to do a lot when we are talking about truth and reconciliation, we focus a lot on the reconciliation without the truth. True reconciliation happens when the truth comes out. It is important that we address and talk about these things because what we intend to do, we only talk about it to people in our own little niche and people that think like us. We need to talk about it openly. I think Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important that this Bill, rather than being fast-tracked or going to Standing Order 51 for us to debate it immediately, it should go through the full parliamentary scrutiny. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. J. USAMATE.- We should allow the representatives of the voters of this country, their representatives who sit in Committees to have the opportunity to look into the Bill itself, to look into the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. I believe, ultimately, in my heart and mind that it is absolutely necessary that this Bill should go to Committees. Let us consult with people. Let us, the representatives of voters, let the House of democracy also consult the people of this country. It is on that basis, Sir, that I do not agree with this motion to take it quickly for us to vote on it this week. I prefer to see that it goes through the Parliamentary Committees system. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Usamate, I had allowed you just a bit more freedom to speak on the motion, but if you had continued, I would rule you out of order because this is specifically on a technical nature. The motion is relevant only in so far as a process of how this Bill is going to come through the system and at a later stage in the arguments, my understanding is that you will indulge yourself in what you talked about on the merits or otherwise of the motion. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I was trying to say that the motion calls for it to be debated upon immediately. What I am against is that the idea of technical aspect to this nature for us to vote on it immediately this week. I am against that and I am, therefore, putting it to the Committee. MR. SPEAKER.- I accept that. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to make a very brief comment on this, and perhaps in response to honourable Usamate’s concern, this Bill was already tabled in Parliament. It is there and honourable Members have had a lot of time to look through it. The consultation that has been done throughout the country is quite extensive, and so the timing is also very important, as the honourable Prime Minister said. I think we should be really grateful that the honourable Prime Minister, under his leadership,</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>2266 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2 nd December, 2024 has taken the step to do this process through reconciliation in this country. The term of this Parliament is another two years. It is urgent, it is appropriate, and there has been enough consultation and discussion. Honourable Usamate has already seen the Bill, he knows the consultation is taking place, therefore, I think it is reasonable for the honourable Prime Minister to move this Bill under Standing Order 51 and have this debated on Wednesday. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe we are actually debating on the motion itself of actually bringing this particular Bill under Standing Order 51, and I tend to totally disagree that we should expedite this particular Bill. When it actually came two months ago, we could have gone through it under Standing Order 51 and send the Bill to the Committee. They would have had two months to review and bring back the report. We were actually given the Audit Bill 2024, we are reporting back on this Bill in this Sitting. I do not see as to why we are actually rushing through this Bill. It has taken us long, it has been more than 30 years that all these things started and now, when we are just on the verge of going out for public consultations, doing it in the right and proper way. Parliamentary procedures are there for a purpose. We should not bypass the system. It was placed in Parliament for the first reading, and this was supposed to be the second reading, and the Bill was supposed to go to the Committee. Now, we are amending the procedures, using the Standing Order, to convert a normal process into Standing Order 51. If this is about truth and reconciliation, what do we actually have to hide? It is not about me and you, it is about the general public. It is not about reconciliation between Government and Opposition. Let us take this particular Bill to the people who are affected. the Bill needs to go to the general public to have their opinions heard, and that is why we have parliamentary Committees to do that. There is a process in place. Why are we trying to bypass the process? What is the need to actually rush this Bill through under Standing Order 51 to get it passed in this particular sitting? If it is all about the general public, it is all about the people who have actually committed something, and it is about the victims as well, let the parliamentary Committee go and have a discussion with these people, bring a report back and then we can contribute. It is all about the process, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I personally do not agree on this particular motion to amend to actually expedite this particular Bill, I still urge the honourable Prime Minister to stick to his initial motion of sending this Bill under Second Reading to the Committee for public consultation. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I go along with my colleagues regarding this particular Bill. This is a government that talks about ‘people listening government’, ‘government that consults’, but they are not listening to the people. What is the role of the legislators? The role of the legislators is to scrutinise the Bill, and the Committee is not given an opportunity to scrutinise the Bill. Why should we be relying on civil servants to go and consult, bring the Bill here, and we should be stamping it. It is the work of the Committee to take the Bill into the community, get their feedback, bring it here and then we can go through the Bill and, finally, make our decision. But, unfortunately, the very listening government today decided not to listen to the people. You are talking about democracy, you were talking about change. Is this the change people wanted? You criticised a lot about Standing Order 51. What happened today? Now, you are moving away from the real issue. Where is consultation? It is all about hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is the word</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 2267 that describes your behaviour today, and I am extremely disappointed that the very government who said, “We will bring about the change”, what are you doing now? Is this the change people expected? Shame on you! HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I am listening to the Opposition, they might become the government, that is why I said the Opposition, it is possible. So, be positive, do not look at things negatively. But when I listened to the very individuals who are raising this issue, when we were in the Opposition, they were utilising the Standing Order 51. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! Can you take your seat, please, honourable Minister? Honourable Members, I would like some decorum in this Chambers. Please, pay respect to the speaker while he is delivering his intervention. You have every right to respond, if necessary, and I will allow you that opportunity, if need be. But allow the speaker to proceed without as much disturbance. It does, in fact, affect his train of thoughts and I wish you Members to, please, respect the speaker who is addressing the House. Can you please proceed, honourable Minister? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Just to continue, Mr. Speaker, out of the Bills that were brought up by the very individuals who are raising their voices today, about 90 percent came through this Standing Order. And when you compare it with this Government, a very small percentage of what we are bringing up goes through Standing Order 51. It does not mean that we are a lenient government, that we are a friendly government, that we cater for everyone that we will not use Standing Order 51, of course, we have to use it for a specific reason which the honourable Prime Minister has alluded to. Also, when we look at that, you have to really take into account the environment. The environment right now is for reconciliation, and if you look at the Commander, I thank the Commander of the Fiji Military Forces for the work that he has done. I commend him, and in line with that, it must go hand in hand with what the Government is doing. Some of the concerns you have raised regarding what the people might bring up, it will be catered for in this process, as we move forward, and there have been wide consultations. We have seen it in the media and also with the work of those moving around other countries regarding the issue.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, honourable Usamate. HON. J. USAMATE.- Standing Order 60 on Relevance, we are talking about the technicality. The honourable Member is going on a trip of looking backwards. He needs to focus on the issue at hand and talk about it, not talk about what happened in the past. He always does this. What he is talking about, Sir, is completely irrelevant to what we are talking about here. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Just to conclude, everything is in order. When you look at Standing Order 51(3), the motion to proceed without delay in relation to a Bill may be moved at any stage of the progression of the Bill through Parliament. We are a law-abiding Government, that is</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>2268 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 why we are doing it. MR. SPEAKER.- I think we have had enough interventions on this motion. I will now invite the Prime Minister to speak in reply. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I respect all the views expressed by the honourable Members of the Opposition and I just draw our attention to the essence of this motion to have this Bill processed through Standing Order 51 and I took a great risk moving this motion today because I know that we have, on the Government side, a minority in the vote. It is your vote, you allow us to go through and debate this on the date mentioned - Wednesday, 4 th December, for its adoption. I commend the motion before Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast: Ayes - 34 Nays - 14 Motion agreed to.</p></body>
