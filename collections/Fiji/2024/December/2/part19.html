I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports, which was tabled on 1 st October, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Consolidated Review Report is for the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts. The Ministry of Education is a Government Ministry, responsible for providing the education that is holistic, innovative, responsive, inclusive and empowering. This education system enables our children to realise and appreciate their inheritance and potential contribution to a peaceful and sustainable Fiji. The Committee, in its deliberation, highlighted significant key findings, to name a few: (1) The Denarau Declaration The Denarau Policy Framework contains the strategic way forward for the Education Sector for the next 10 years. It is important to acknowledge the policy and the implementations of the Declaration. (2) Review of the Education Act The review of the Education Act needs to be expedited to align with current best practices, societal changes and educational priorities.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2269 (3) Issue on drugs Currently, drugs have a significant impact on the lives of our children. The Ministry is working with relevant stakeholders to address this very important issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry of Education is very critical. The Ministry requires urgent action in response to a challenge of the environment that our children are currently encountering. On that note, Sir, I thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. A list has been provided to me for those who would be speaking. There are three from the Opposition and two from Government. I will first invite honourable Pillay to address Parliament. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your appointment as Speaker of our Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts for the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. This comprehensive review highlights the significant strides made by the Ministry in various areas, as well as the challenges that remained. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Strategic Plan by the Ministry for 2018-2021, and the new framework for 2023 to 2033, as stated in the Denarau Declaration, are commendable. But, most importantly, we must say that the establishment of the Education Commission to review the curriculum is a critical move. But we have to ask ourselves, how are these changes going to be implemented, to ensure that the system remains relevant and effective? The registration of 24 new ECE Centres, eight primary schools and four secondary schools between 2018 and 2021 is a good indication of the Ministry’s efforts towards increasing access. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this is a positive development, we must consider the sustainability of these new institutions. Are we providing adequate resources and support to ensure their long-term success? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights the Ministry’s efforts in trying to address drug and substance abuse among students. Collaboration with parents, police and other stakeholders is important. However, we must question the effectiveness of these measures. Are we seeing a tangible reduction in drug related incidents in our schools? But more can be done to support our students and prevent substance abuse. Hiring full time counsellors in Divisions and Districts will provide much needed support to our students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must ensure that these counsellors are well trained and ready to handle various challenges our students face. How will we measure the impact on student wellbeing and academic performance? Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing truancy is another critical issue. Community engagement and support services from part of the Ministry’s policies and strategies in the right direction but we must ask ourselves, are these measures enough to keep our children in school? What more can we do to support families so that education remains a priority? Digitisation of examination records is a major task that was preserved our education history had improved administrative efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to ensure that this work is completed without delay and adequate budgetary provisions are made to maintain this digital records.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>2270 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress of the Ministry in the achievement of SDG4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable, quality education is commendable though there is much to be done in terms of leadership changes, high staff turnover and budgetary constraints. How can we ensure a more stable and enabling environment for our educators and students to thrive. The Ministry’s advocacy for a government mandate to build schools and hospitals during each term is a forward-thinking approach. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must support this initiative to ensure that our infrastructure gives space with our growing population and educational needs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while much remains to be done, I am on the view that this Report is a step in the right direction. It provides a clear roadmap for the future of education in our country with continued commitment and collaboration we can overcome the challenges and build a robust education system that serves all our children. With that, Mr. Speaker, I fully support the motion. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in support of the motion before Parliament. First of all, I would like to thank the Standing Committee Members for compiling this Report. I know it is a little bit outdated report from 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. It is very important that the Report needs to be provided on time, as timeliness of this Report will be able to allow the Ministry to provide proper strategic direction, decision- making in terms of the operations of the Ministry. The Ministry of Education is working very hard to provide its Annual Report on time. In commenting on the Standing Committee’s recommendation regarding the Education Act review, we take note of the comments. It has been recommended by the Committee and the Ministry of Education has also taken steps by obtaining the necessary Cabinet approval to commence the discussion on the review of the Education Act. Currently, the 1978 Act and the 1966 Education Act has been shared with the Fiji Law Reform Unit to assist the Ministry of Education in the review process which is anticipated to be finalised by mid of next year, June 2025. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key features that the Ministry would like to ensure to be included in the Act. One is to have its own regulation, the areas that need to be scrutinised in terms of the compulsory education in current age on Year 1 to Year 12 to be in line with Section 31 of the 2013 Constitution, the right to education. The second part is the inclusion of ECE as part of the lower primary education aiming to reduce the entry age from the current year five to year three or below. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the TVET subjects to be offered in the mainstream education programme for Year 9. Just on the Denarau Declaration, it is the result of the Education Summit which was done in 2023. We intend to have the 10-year sector plan to be completed and drawn up by early next year, 2025, the first quarter, so that will cover the entire seven thematic areas that have been identified in the Denarau Declaration document. The review of the Act will also include the inclusion of extracurricular activities; the school fundraising activities; the curriculum review and benchmarking and scaling of marks at external exams in both primary and secondary schools; benchmarking of external examinations and the quality assurance process of setting of marking of examination papers; the financial management of school funds or free education grants; the school enrolment age is also needed to be reviewed; and the automatic progress or retention of students in the education system, also to be reviewed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue that has been identified by the Standing Committee on the</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2271 Education Commission, the Ministry of Education has commenced the groundwork on the appointment of the Education Commissioners, which will be partially funded by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). As of today, six commissioners have been identified and their appointment letters will be issued before the end of the week. The other recommendations that has been addressed by the Standing Committee are the collaboration with other stakeholders, the appointment of officers and counsellors, and the retentions or alternative learning methods for dropout students. Over the past so many years, there has been no tracking system to identify the whereabouts of students who have dropped out of the school system. At the moment, the Ministry of Education is closely working with UNESCO in upgrading the FEMIS database to capture information on the number and details of school dropouts. We are also trying to explore whether these FEMIS numbers that are being given to students, whether they can also take it up with them when they enter higher education or in the job market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the measures that have contributed to improve retention of students within the school system. The $200 Back to School financial assistance to assist parents with the combined annual income of $50,000 or less. The Ministry’s e-learning programme and the introduction of Learning Management System (LMS), where teaching will be conducted online to assist students and make learning more exciting. The reintroduction of the Matua Programme in 2003 at the Nabua Secondary School has positively assisted in the school dropouts through the readmission of students back into the education system. The Ministry also plans to expand the Matua Programme to other divisions. In terms of the vocational technology, this would be introduced as a mainstream subject in 2025 at Year 9 as one of the strategies to retain students in the education system. This will be piloted in 15 selected secondary schools prior to the full implementation of the programme. These initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will provide alternative pathways to students who are not academically inclined. On the drug issues, that has been identified by the Standing Committee, this is a major issue in the country which has infiltrated our school system, as students have been used to either peddle or use it to drown their problems. The Ministry is undertaking the following actions to address drug- related issues through the Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC). They have the existing policy to train teachers on how to handle drug related issues in schools. Due to the increase in drug related reported cases among youths, SAAC has discussed and approved, revising its awareness package and programmes to target at risk schools and strengthen parental and community engagement. The International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking programmes conducted on an annual basis in schools will be evaluated to ascertain the effectiveness of its purpose. Counsellors in schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has already established divisional counsellors in four counselling hubs in the respective education divisions and the Ministry will propose establishing school counsel petitions in its 2025-2026 budget submission. There are 35 teacher counsellors within the education districts who are mobilised to attend to cases when the need arises from each district. The Ministry is also working together with other NGOs, which provide counselling to intervene into the lives of the students who use drugs. Regarding the building of more schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry in consultation with DFAT, will be conducting the infrastructure reviews in schools. This is supposed to be due at the end of the month of November. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school enrolment policy which is currently being drafted by the Ministry</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2272 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 of Education is anticipated to minimise rural-urban migration of students which is one of the reasons for overcrowding of classrooms in urban areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sustainable development goals, the actualisation of the ten targets and eleven indicators in the SDG4 is reflected in the ten-year Ministry of Education sector plan and 2023 Denarau Declaration. In terms of the budget for transport, total funding of FJ$37 million was allocated for the transport assistance scheme of which 40 percent is allocated for RSL and 60 percent for e-ticketing. There are currently discussions for reviewing the rate from $1.12 to $1.64, an additional amount of $2.8 million will be needed. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Minister for Education. There are three more in the batting line up for this motion. HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to contribute on the motion. Firstly, I would like thank the Standing Committee for the comprehensive Report. The Standing Committee have come up with some very good findings and recommendations. I have picked two findings of the Standing Committee, and I will be talking on that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I will talk on retention and school dropouts. According to the data provided by the Ministry of Education, a high number of students drop out of school every year. Last year, that is 2023, 1,162 students dropped out of school before completing primary education and this is an increase of 34 percent compared to 2022, where the number was 755. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last five years, the highest number of students dropped out of school in 2023 before completing year eight, that is more than 1,000 students which is a huge increase in school dropouts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see this school dropout issue as something of great concern to everyone in Fiji. The Free Education Grant and Transport Assistance were two great initiatives of the former Prime Minister Bainimarama, and it had a great impact on reducing student dropouts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of the Free Education Grant 10 years ago, Government has invested around $650 million dollars through the free Education Grant to 738 primary, 176 secondary and more than 870 ECE (Early Childhood Education) centres. The Free Education Grant eased the financial burden on parents, students, teachers and the school management committee. One reason why students are irregular to school apart from the many other reasons, it is poor bus service. I have raised this in Parliament before and I am raising it again, many people from the interior, from the remote areas they have raised concern. I want to highlight some of the areas. I have received concerns from people of Viseisei back road, Wairabetia, Vuda back road, Vaivai and Raviravi. They have raised concerns regarding bus services not provided to students in those areas and they have to hire taxis, they have to pay huge amounts of money every week. Mr. Speaker Sir, I have raised this issue previously in this Parliament, but nothing has been done. Children are the world’s most valuable resources and is the best hope for the future. Children are the future of our country, and we want to see all of them educated. We do not want to leave any child behind. If the Coalition Government fails to address the school dropout issue, then we will see an increase in youths on the streets committing crimes. We can already see teenagers who should be in school, sitting on the streets asking people for money, when other children their age are in school. And then, we have the drug problem, which is</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2273 of probably, the greatest concern right now. Mr. Speaker Sir, drug cases in schools increased to around 3,500 in 2023. The Ministry of Education must come up with innovative initiatives and work closely with parents, school heads, teachers, school management, faith-based organisations, non- government organisations and other government ministries, to minimise issues. Mr. Speaker Sir, the other findings of the Standing Committee is teacher shortages. This is due to mass migration of teachers. Fiji has lost thousands of teachers in the last two years, the main reason is attractive salaries offered to teachers in countries like New Zealand, Australia and Canada and many more. The number may increase because most of the teachers have received only seven to ten percent increase in salary which is not enough compared to the huge increase in the cost of living, VAT and corporate tax. Teachers play a crucial role in setting our children’s future. They deserve better pay. Mr. Speaker Sir, each month, more teachers are leaving the profession and who can blame them. Their dedication is not being rewarded and this is affecting our children’s education. If the Coalition Government’s approach does not change, we risk losing more talented teachers to countries that value their contribution. Our teachers are stretched thin, as teacher resignation has created a vacuum and is directly affecting the quality of our children’s education. I support the motion, thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir for the opportunity. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution on the motion moved by the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts Annual Reports for 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in performing their mandated duties and compiling the Consolidated Review Report of the years in review which highlights the Standing Committees key findings and recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noted that the Standing Committee has come up with eleven recommendations and I will be focussing on three of these recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with recommendation 4.5, the Standing Committee recommends that the Ministry introduce different learning programs to address the increasing number of student dropouts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to an article published in the Fiji Times on 19 th October, 2024, about 4,589 students dropped out of the formal education system before completing primary education and 5,726 left before completing Year 10 between 2019 and 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is, indeed, worrying and needs the attention of all the stakeholders involved in the education of our children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation put forward by the Committee is in line with the 2023 Denarau Declaration on thematic area 1A which focuses on the curriculum and sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee’s recommendation 4.6 states that the Ministry in collaboration with other key stakeholders undertake collective measures to combat the issues of drugs in school, and further on recommended on 4.7 that the Ministry appoint more professional counsellors in schools to effectively address students who are affected by drugs and other social issues. These three recommendations by the Committee can be termed as a band-aid solution, a temporary fix that does not address the root cause of the problem. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that the root cause of all these problems lies on the parents neglecting their roles and responsibilities. The parents should always be involved in the nurturing of</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>2274 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 their children. If the home has a solid foundation, which is found in Christ alone, then these children would be able to withstand any social issues and challenges that they face in life. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Ellen G. White clearly states in her book “Education” on page 284, and I quote: “In the formation of character, no other influences count so much as the influence of the home. The teacher’s work should supplement that of the parents but is not to take its place. In all that concerns the wellbeing of the child, it should be the effort of parents and teachers to co-operate.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can utilise all the resources we have, involve stakeholders and undertake measures to combat these social issues and if parents continue to neglect their roles and responsibilities in educating their children then all our efforts will be in vain. A collective approach which involves the vanu a, religious bodies and stakeholders will only be effective if parents and guidance take the leading role in character development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity and I support the motion before the House. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee for the Report. I also want to thank the honourable Minister for Education for providing a detailed response on the Report highlighting some of the achievements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is significant that we are actually debating 2018 and 2019, 2019 and 2020 Report because when we came into Government, we realised the mess that was existing within the education system. It was purely the result of haphazard, ill-conceived, out of touch policies that were introduced over so many years. I will give you an example and honourable Hem Chand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has got a habit of generalising. He was talking about mass-migration of teachers, teachers leaving because of their salaries. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Let me give you real statistics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Ministry of Finance and the funding that we provide. We are currently funding 13,325 teachers, up from 12,793 at the end of 2022. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Net increase of 532 teachers. In fact, we are hiring more than the rate of resignation. We recruited 1,600 teachers and only 1,000 had retired or resigned, this is the statistics. Let me point out few other things that honourable Hem Chand was talking about, some are real issues, and the honourable Minister for Education talked about it. First, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he talked about drop out, people leaving the system, students not being able to make it; that is correct. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is the reason, what are some of the factors? Education policies, when it is considered, must be considered by experts. It must be considered in a carefully carefully calibrated manner based on data and evidence, and nothing of that sort was done when they were reforming the education system. It was all haphazard.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2275 We, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were in Opposition for eight years called for the appointment of an Education Commission. It is this Government under this Prime Minister that we have appointed an Education Commission. We also took actions head-on immediately when we came into Government. Within few months of Government, the honourable Prime Minister announced this package; the new initiative of providing $200 per child from Pre-School to Form Seven and we provided 227,000 students in 2023 that $200 which helped them to get back to school. In 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again more than 200,000 and again in 2025, we are providing more than $40 million for more than 200,000 students to get that $200. I want to say to the parents, “the applications are still open, it is going to close on 5 th December and if parents and students have not applied, we encourage them to do so.” The other point about infrastructure that honourable Hem Chand mentioned and he is right, infrastructure Mr. Speaker, Sir, is absolutely important. But what has happened over the last 10 years or 12 years, rural-urban migration has continued. Schools in the rural areas have faced depopulation in terms of enrolment but Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the urban areas, if you look at Suva and Nausori areas in the last 10 years, hardly any single classroom has been built, hardly any new school has been built. As the honourable Minister for Education said, it is this Government that got the Australian Government to do an audit of 80 schools between Suva and Nausori areas and we are now embarking on building additional rooms and classrooms. We have also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two years completed the renovation, the building of new schools in many parts of this country including Vanua Levu. We had in the last two years done so many things that is now addressing the mess that existed in the education system. We have also, and I want to point this out, the TELS Loan Scheme was another disaster that they presided on. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- So, when we came into Government, we replaced the Loan Scheme with scholarships based on merit - $650 million was written off and I will tell you the result of that. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Thank you Mr. Speaker. The result of that scheme, we wrote off that loan, we provided in place of that a merit-based scholarship. We are putting in $150 million for new scholarships and with the new scheme, we are actually giving more scholarships than all the students that studied under the TELS Loan and Scholarships. In fact, the statistics is this, we are supporting 9,940 continuing students, but we are actually giving scholarships to new 10,830 students. That is the difference, that is the kind of good thinking and good policy that we have implemented as part of this Government’s policy. Let me point out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have two minutes, a few other things with respect to infrastructure and the policies that support our students. I know honourable Hem Chand talked about bus services, in fact, part of the reason why the bus industry in the state of disrepair is because of the policies that was put in place. For many years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did not get a bus fare increase, they were artificially kept down... (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>2276 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … and a lot of the bus industry players could not run rural services because of what was there. What we have done in the last budget is to ensure that the bus operators get a reasonable return on their investment. We are now subsiding, we are now paying 100 percent of school fares for the students and we have put in... (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … additional $16 million to $17 million. That is the kind of good policy that we are putting in the education system, and the people of this country are now appreciating, they can see the difference. They can see the truth from the lies that they were told in the past. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee, I think their recommendations are very important and the Education Commission that this Government has appointed, the Denarau Declaration is going to fit in and make sure that any policy going forward will be based on data, based on evidence and based on that, we will get good policies for education that will work. HON. J. USAMATE- Hogwash! MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, let me assure you that some of these interruptions I see are on the verge of disorderly conduct under certain rules of the Standing Orders. I will tell you that I had in my other life been a referee in rugby. So, I will have no hesitation whatsoever to issue a yellow card to anyone who misbehaves in this Chamber. Just bear that in mind, honourable Members. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, upon the deliberations that were done this afternoon, we thank the honourable Members for the positive contributions in regards to these Reports. Upon our deliberations on the review of Annual Reports, the Committee recommends the following, that the: (1) Ministry submits its Annual Reports on time.
