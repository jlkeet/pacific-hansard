<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are at the tail end of the Oral Questions for today.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my other colleagues in welcoming you to Parliament and congratulating you on your appointment and also congratulate our Fiji Sevens Team for their achievements after a long droughts time. I hope both will bring us the much relief which we desperately need. Naduruloulou Research Station (Question No. 267/2024) HON. S. NAND asked Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament on the progress in converting the Naduruloulou Research Station to solely focus on research and development of organic agriculture in Fiji? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, organic farming contributes to the protection of the environment and mitigates the impacts of climate change. It improves the long-term fertility of the soil, increases levels of biodiversity and reduces pollution on the environment while maintaining high and more welfare standards. I thank the honourable Nand for the question as it provides an opportunity to inform this august Parliament and the nation about the plans behind converting Naduruloulou Research Station for organic research work. This will be the first amongst the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) of the Pacific region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Naduruloulou Research Station, a pivotal agricultural research facility has been undergoing a transformative process to evolve into an organic station that will be crucial in the research and development of organic products in Fiji and the Pacific. This initiative is in line with national commitments under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) towards achieving sustainable agricultural systems and meeting the increasing demands for safe food. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the transition of the Naduruloulou Research Station to an organic station began in 2022. Since then, no synthetic fertilisers or chemicals were allowed into the station. The management of the fields has been through mechanical and manual means. The Research Officers at the Naduruloulou and Koronivia Research Stations have been working in partnership with the Pacific Community, Pacific Organic and Ethical Trade Community (POETCom) to facilitate the transition of the station towards obtaining organic certification under the Pacific Guarantee System with aspiration of ultimately achieving the global standard of third party certification. Mr. Speaker, Sir, upgrading and improving the infrastructure in the station is key to support this transition. The Ministry is currently engaging in discussions with the neighbouring village of Kasavu and nearby settlements regarding the plans for the station and these are primarily to reduce the risk of cross-contamination of synthetic materials and non-organic agricultural activities around the periphery of the station. This transition cannot be achieved in isolation and requires collaboration with local, regional and international organisations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress achieved at Naduruloulou Research Station in its shift towards</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2259 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress achieved at Naduruloulou Research Station in its shift towards becoming an organic facility is commendable. The ongoing assistance from the Government will facilitate the establishment of a certified organic agriculture station. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of organic agriculture into Fiji’s production system is an option to ensure the sustainability of our natural resources. The Fiji Organic Association was established in 2006 and the Ministry of Agriculture has been collaborating closely with them in the development of the organic farming sector in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry has developed a bacterium culture to restore soil microbial populations and build soil fertility in cultivating areas. This culture was launched on 10 th June, 2020 and so far been distributed free of charge Fiji-wide from almost all agriculture stations. It has been developed to target compost which were also launched as organic fertilisers in 2022. The continued production and supply of organic fertilisers for free to farmers, more than 300 tonnes have been supplied to assist farmers who cannot afford chemical fertilisers and may one day transition to becoming full time organic farmers. The National Organic Policy is in its finalising stage and this will guide the organic sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conversion of Naduruloulou Research Station into a centre of excellence for organic agriculture research is a strategic move that aligns with Government’s broader agriculture and environmental policies. It demonstrates our commitment to fostering a sustainable agriculture future for Fiji, enhancing public health, support sustainable tourism and creating a more resilient agriculture sector. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister update Parliament on what crops or species are being propagated in Naduruloulou Station, and is this knowledge or species being disseminated to the to the farmers, and in particular what crops are these? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Naduruloulou Research Station is mainly a tree crops station. Most of the tree cops that are grown locally are propagated from Naduruloulou Research Station. We also have cocoa and coffee as part of our tree crops propagated there. Apart from that, we have indigenous fruit trees also, in addition to lime because of the demand from the public. These are being propagated and distributed sometimes according to orders from interested farmers. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Telecom Fiji &amp; Kordia Group - Boosting Fiji’s Digital Connectivity (Question No. 268/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V:</span> RAVU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on how Telecom Fiji, in partnership with New Zealand’s Kordia, is progressing in boosting Fiji’s digital connectivity? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable member for the question on the ICT development in Fiji, particularly with regards to the North. But I guess before I do that, in way of context, perhaps in the last two years of the current People’s Coalition Government under the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, you would been seeing the transition that is happening in the ICT space that we are trying to rapidly evolve to capture the advancements in digital technology and also as a result, enhance connectivity services to our people, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>2260</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 Just this past Saturday, the honourable Prime Minister did the groundbreaking ceremony, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for one of the biggest ICT developments and in my view, Sir, probably one of the most significant historical events in Fiji in the recent past, when he performed the groundbreaking of the Google Data Centre. Google is in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and with this, it signals a new dawn, in terms of how the ICT industry will be conducted in Fiji. It also signals to the rest of the world that one of the largest tech companies in the world has come to our shores. It will certainly attract with it, some investment as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the developments and certainly now, with regards to the Northern developments as it were, Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL) had actually forged a partnership with Kordia, which is a New Zealand state-owned enterprise. It is a major provider of television, radio broadcasting facilities and communication networks. The partnership is aimed at implementing Telecom Fiji’s Northern fibre connectivity project. It aims to extend the connectivity between Labasa onward to Seaqaqa, and then onward to Savusavu to the submarine cable landing station. It is scheduled for completion in January 2025 or at least the first quarter of 2025. It is about 75 percent complete according to Telecom, so it is tracking well Mr. Speaker, Sir. Under the partnership, Kordia is supplying transmission equipment, that will be used to deliver high-capacity fibre links between Savusavu and Labasa. These high-capacity fibre links will reduce dependency on microwave links between Savusavu and Labasa which are of course limited in capacity and susceptible to disruptions during adverse weather. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a key feature of this project is its integration with Fiji’s domestic subsea cable which connects Vanua Levu to Viti Levu via the Tui Samoa cable. This will further strengthen the national digital backbone of our country and create seamless network across the two main islands. And if you have been hearing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the explanations by the learned Deputy Prime Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, Honourable Viliame Gavoka, about the initiative in the North, what is being done through Telecom, will set up Vanua Levu well in the years to come. It is, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a game changer for Vanua Levu and for Telecom and it allows them to leverage technology into the North and it will not be too long when we will start seeing business process outsourcings (BPOs) opens up in the North, I suspect, and other ICT industries a lot closer to the Northern Division. In my view Mr, Speaker, Sir, that is a welcome development and as most of us believe on this side of the Parliament, Vanua Levu will be the next economic frontier for Fiji.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Identified Sites for Starlink Satellite Services (Question No. 269/2024) HON.
