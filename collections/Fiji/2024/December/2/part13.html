<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> The following honourable Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40: (1) Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; (2) Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; (3) Honourable Minister for Education; and (4) Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will also be a response from the honourable Leader of the Group of Nine or his designate to also speak for five minutes. There will be no debate. Launch of the Hydrogen Dual-Fuel Generator Demonstration Project HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, bula vinaka and a very good morning to you all. May I take this moment to extend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as Speaker of the House. Your appointment to this significant role marks a new chapter in fostering robust and constructive debate within this esteemed chamber. In reflecting on the principles of parliamentary democracy we are reminded of the timeless words spoken by Speaker William Lenthall in 1642, and I quote: “May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.” These words encapsulate, Mr. Speaker, the essence of the partiality and dedication that defines the role of the Speaker; serving as a guardian of fairness, balance and the dignity of this august Parliament. We look forward to your guidance and leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we work together to uphold these principles, ensuring meaningful and respectful dialogue that benefits our nation. Once again, congratulations on this well-deserved appointment. I also would like to add to your congratulations, my congratulations to our victorious Fiji Sevens team to the coach Osea Kolinisau, captain Jerry Matana, and the members of the team. We congratulate them on this win in Dubai 7s after a period of about 22 months. The drought has truly broken, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to share a groundbreaking and transformative milestone in Fiji's journey towards sustainable energy and decarbonisation. On 26 th November, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji gas, in collaboration and partnership with the Obayashi Corporation of Japan and Halcyon Power of New Zealand, hosted the groundbreaking demonstration of a hydro dual fuel generator at their Lautoka depot. This project represents a significant leap in our efforts to transition towards cleaner energy sources and reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>2222</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, simply put, this project is about testing how Fiji can use a cleaner fuel, in this case, hydrogen, to produce electricity. Hydrogen fuel is created using renewable energy such as geothermal power, which comes from heat inside the earth. Unlike our traditional diesel, which produces harmful emissions, hydrogen is cleaner and releases only water when used. This generator at the Lautoka depot is trial run, helping us learn what works and what needs to improve before we adopt this technology on a larger scale. More importantly, it will help us understand the infrastructure and policies we need to support hydrogen use, making it easier for us to adopt this clean energy technology on a larger scale. Hydrogen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is seen as a game changer. It can replace fossil fuels in many areas from powering generators to fuelling vehicles and vessels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this achievement traces back to the New Zealand Trade Mission in 2023, which I headed. During the mission, we reinforced the strong relationship between Fiji and New Zealand under the Duavata Partnership. This partnership underscores our shared commitment to mutual economic progress, climate action and sustainability. As part of the Mission, we engaged in productive discussions with the New Zealand Government, which has laid the foundation for what has now become this remarkable hydrogen project. During the mission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also had the privilege of visiting the Tuaropaki Trust Hydrogen Production Plant and witnessing the process of how green hydrogen energy is produced. The power plant harnesses geothermal energy to produce green hydrogen. Through the Tuaropaki Trust, Halcyon Power Ltd oversees the production of green hydrogen and facilitates its transportation from New Zealand to Fiji, where it is utilised for the hydrogen dual fuel generator installed by Fiji Gas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is, of course, a pilot project but is part of a broader initiative supported by the Joint Crediting Financing Support Programme administered by the Ministry of Environment of Japan. Through the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), Financing Support Programme, the Japanese Government has played a pivotal role in making this project a reality. This partnership reflects more than just financial support. It symbolises a transfer of knowledge, technology and vision. Japan represented by Obayashi Corporation has contributed technical expertise and financial backing, while New Zealand, a global leader in renewable energy, has supplied the green energy and has shared its vast experience in developing hydrogen powered solutions. Together these partnerships exemplify the power of international cooperation in driving innovation and sustainability. I also commend Fiji Gas for their vision and commitment to this initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project sets the stage for Fiji to lead by example in the Pacific, demonstrating how renewable energy solutions can create a greener, most resilient future for all. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call upon the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me take this opportunity to congratulate you. Much has been said already, but on a lighter note, you fill a seat that has been filled by many experienced people, and a lot that happened. So historically, there is a very hot chair that you sit on, in and amongst some very hot–headed politicians, but welcome to the House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to take this time to congratulate our Fiji Team on their win, and</p><h4>seeing that I only have five minutes, I’ll get right to the point.</h4><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2223 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular project is actually good, is great for Fiji. It is a major step also for us in terms of looking towards sustainable energy solutions and it is also something that we have been doing for many-a-year, but it is in line with all of our commitments that we have actually made in terms of green energy and energy solutions. One of the most important things that we must remember, Sir, and this has to do with the use of hydrogen. This particular hydrogen that arrives in our country has also been sourced in a green fashion out of New Zealand. So, the supply chain itself is green before it actually gets here. And in light of what is happening around the world and many other larger countries not doing as much as they can in terms of climate change and addressing the issues with respect to climate change, any little bit that we do as Fiji, or any little bit that we do as a little company or even a large company, makes a difference. So, congratulations to Fiji Gas and also many thanks to the Japanese Government and to the New Zealand Government also that have been involved in this. Special congratulations to Fiji Gas for getting this done, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said, one of the most important things is the supply chain that currently exists. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must all do what we can with respect to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We can see from around the world, in the news, every day, what is actually happening to all our different countries, with all the different floods etc. With us approaching our hurricane season, we should always learn to expect the worst and do the most that we can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So, in short, Mr. Speaker, Sir, congratulations to Fiji Gas and commend the honourable minister for bringing this to the house and letting us all know about it. On a final note, Sir, I hope and pray that Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) is taking note of the amount of projects that are actually trying to come online with respect to supplying energy and they seriously look at how viable it is and making it more viable for us to be able to invest in it, whether it is solar energy or hydrogen energy or dual-powered generators etc. Because from what I understand, I think that EFL has not really being playing ball in terms of people wanting to invest in the renewable energy sector, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Koya, I take on board your advice to the Office of the Speaker. Before I call on the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate, I welcome in the gallery, the High Commissioner of Australia to Fiji, His Excellency, Mr. Ewen McDonald. Welcome, Your Excellency to our proceedings. (Acclamation) HON. A. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your appointment as the Speaker of this august House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement. It is great to hear and witness how the Government is taking action on Fiji’s ongoing journey towards sustainable energy and decarbonisation. Mr. Speaker, I was part of the Fiji delegation that recently returned from COP29 and this topic on sustainable energy and decarbonisation, once again, was discussed at the various levels during the COP, as this was part of the Paris Agreement. I learned that the whole idea of having this decarbonization and also the drive towards sustainable energy, which is the overarching goal, is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above the pre- industrial level and pursue effort to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>2224</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 pre-industrial level. So, by supporting the hydrogen dual-fuel generator, Fiji is on the right track, and I thank the Government for honouring its commitment towards the Paris Agreement. Once again, I congratulate the Government and also acknowledge the partnership between Fiji Gas and Obayashi Corporation and Halcyon Power Ltd, in bringing this project to our shores. We, the Group of 9, would like to see more of this clean energy project and it appears from what has been said by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, that the partnership appears to be the way forward for Fiji. So, once again, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement on this subject. Research on the Utilisation of Senile Coconut Stems HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and all those tuning in live on Parliament’s Facebook channel - ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, firstly my warmest congratulations on your appointment as Speaker of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, I rise to deliver a statement on the progress of the Ministry of Forestry’s research work on the utilisation of senile coconut stems under the project Coconut and Other Traditional Forest Resources for the manufacturer of engineered wood products. At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the support and assistance of the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR), Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (QDAF) and the Pacific Community (SPC) for the opportunity provided to the Ministry of Forestry, to participate in the five- year project on the coconut and other non-traditional forest resources for the manufacturer of engineered wood products which began in February 2021. In addition, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to acknowledge the support and assistance of the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Rural Development. The current project on coconut and other non-traditional wood and forest products follow the previous ACIAR funded research project in 2009, which installed new research equipment in the Ministry of Forestry facility in Nasinu. Mr. Speaker, this resulted in the successful demonstration of the technical feasibility of peeling logs from senile coconut stems using spindle-less lathe technology to produce suitable veneers for the manufacturer of coconut-based engineered wood products. Mr. Speaker, the Coalition Government endorsed the project to the agreement in early 2023 and is providing the much- needed assistance through the provision of a very experienced team with skills and a range of disciplines to support the adoption of a coconut wood product value chain, here in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, the project is working on delivering and validating wood processing technologies to transform coconut and other currently low-value forest resources into high-value engineered wood products suitable for the local and international markets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by enabling new resources, such as senile coconut palms to be used in high- value wood products, there are many benefits that can be expected. Importantly, our farming communities are able to clear this significant number of unproductive coconut palms and use the payments received from selling the logs to clear their land. This, in turn, enables them to replant their land with new palms or other valuable crops in mixing cropping systems which may be profitable and more resilient to the impacts of climate change.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2225 Mr. Speaker, Sir, our timber industry can produce new innovative products which can be used locally in speciality joinery and furniture manufacture, along with pursuing high value export opportunities. Employment opportunities are expected along the new value chain. All projects have their own share of challenges, and this project is no exception. The real challenge lies in our forest industry that can quickly take up this opportunity and make the necessary investments and adopt the technology. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about an industry that is so used to processing conventional timber species and will, therefore, need a lot of convincing to adopt the new technology and process senile coconut logs. But this is not insurmountable, as the project is vigorously pursuing a number of strategies which will be able to yield the necessary outcomes in this respect. This include the direct participation of the private sector in Vanua Levu through the Hyoulin Sawmill (Fiji) Limited, a subsidiary of Long Investments Limited. This company is willing to work with the project to achieve its goals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, the Ministry of Forestry, through the project, has supported the sawmill with the construction of a steam box which was commissioned last month. This will enable the heat conditioning of coconut and other non-traditional forest resources in preparation for veneer processing before they are manufactured into engineered wood products. Preliminary testing was successfully completed, paving the way for the project team to further investigate the integration of senile coconut stem processing into commercial production. This also offers opportunities to enhance yields and to improve veneer grade of other log types through more optimised processing pathways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the project is also undertaking research on utilising the mahogany Grades 4 and 5 from Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL) as a core species. The FHCL is having issues in selling Grades 4 and 5 logs due to their poor quality, and the project has provided an opportunity for utilising these low-quality mahogany logs. Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project team has also completed the development of a financial modelling tool that will provide valuable guidance to those who are interested in participating in the value chain, and will have immediate benefits to the plywood producers, especially in defining profitability pathways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, most segments of the model have been tested and proven valuable for FHCL in assessing their mill-delivered log costs and costing structures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Valebasoga Tropik Boards Limited, another plywood processor in Vanua Levu and a collaborator in the previous project recently expressed its interest with a strong willingness to participate and to ensure the success of the project. This project will have positive socio-economic and environmental impacts, including the source of income for farmers, as well as ticking the boxes for suitable forestry by using senile coconut trees. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to reply to the Statement. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- May I join other honourable Members who have congratulated two sons of Kabara - you, Sir, as Speaker, and Kolinisau as coach for the national sevens team.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>2226</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 I thank the honourable Minister for bringing up the subject on the utilisation of aged coconuts and other non-traditional forestry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the subject is current, and I have found that during our cyclone seasons, most of these trees come across with a lot of damage. During TC Winston, I had visited around the islands in Lau, Lomaiviti including Taveuni where there were a lot of coconut trees that had been damaged by the cyclone and basically were lying there, ripe and matured coconut trees. In Vanuabalavu, I remember that I organised the coconut trees to be cut and the logs to be put together. Unfortunately, the transportation for the trees to be transported to Viti Levu was a barrier due to cost. Although the furniture company, Pacific Green in Sigatoka had agreed to purchase these for the benefit of the landowners and the coconut trees on the islands both in Lomaiviti and Lau, transportation could not be met. I had asked the New Zealand Navy, but unfortunately, they were not in a position to transport because they participated in the rehabilitation in these islands, but they did not have the facility to transport it on their ships to be brought back to Viti Levu. I remember very well during the cyclones also, the huge number of pine plantations that were damaged and standing that could not be harvested. These includes Tailevu North and also the coast of Ra including Kadavu and Lomaiviti where pine trees were damaged but remained standing. I would urge the honourable Minister as we are now into cyclone season (October to March) if she could look at that situation. If the cyclones come and simply make these valuable resources available, if transport could be arranged for these to be transported to the mainland and be utilised for the benefit of the landowners. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Group of Nine or his designate. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I join my colleagues in expressing our congratulations to your appointment to the position of Speaker and also congratulations to the sevens team; a long time coming win this morning. I thank the honourable Minister for her statement. Palm wood or coconut wood, I think part of the furniture in this Parliament is made out of coconut and they turn out to be beautiful, very tough furniture, for those that buy furniture also from Pacific Green. I certainly agree with honourable Koroilavesau. I am sure you know in Kabara and Vatoa, there are a lot of coconut trees on the outer islands. It used to be used for the framing for the Fijian vale vaka Viti in the Lau Group because they curve well because of the round structures of the houses in Lau. Now, all the houses are concrete block and wooden frames. And those coconut trees are also available and as mentioned by honourable Koroilavesau, yes, it is the cost of transporting them to the mainland to where the sawmills are, is the main issue. I hope that we can keep looking for solutions to get those coconut trees over. And as she mentioned, it will also encourage the re-planting of coconut trees that will be more fruitful in a sense. The honourable Minister talked about non-traditional forest products. I mention the African tulip for one, it is all over the place and everyone wants to cut it down. They are huge and big. Perhaps, a bit of research into the African tulip and see what can be done to those trees. I know a few years back, there were some research done into it; is to pulp African tulip because it is very wet, there is a lot of fluid in it. Dry it out, turn into pallets and then use it to fire up the boilers that boil the water for the generators that generate the electricity like the bio-electrical factory that is sitting in Nabou. I encourage the Ministry of Forestry to continue their research into the non-traditional products in our forestry especially because of the fact that we cannot keep cutting out the traditional woods that we have. We need them to protect our water sources so that we continue to have our clean drinking water that we so very much enjoy here in Fiji.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2227 The fact that Fiji is a small island and the connectivity from the ridge to the reef is there, and if you mess up with the biodiversity up the hill, it goes right down and even goes right down to our reefs. It is a worthwhile project to look at the non-traditional forest products and see how best we can turn them into products that can be economical, with high value and helps improve the living standards of the people, especially those that live out in the rural areas where these products are available. MR. SPEAKER.- I know that the honourable Minister for Education is ready to deliver his Statement but I am advised by the Secretary-General that this is a convenient time for our morning tea and coffee break. We will now suspend proceedings, and Parliament will resume in half an hour. The Parliament adjourned at 10.22 a.m.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>2228</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.10 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will resume from where we were before</p><h4>adjournment.</h4><p>Fiji Year 8 Examination Provisional Results for 2024 HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I would like to take this time to congratulate you on your appointment as Speaker of this Parliament. I wish to convey my best wishes to you, Sir, during your tenure in Parliament. Also, I would like to join the other Members of this Parliament in congratulating the Fiji Team for winning the Dubai Sevens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to brief this august House on the recently announced Fiji Year 8 Examination provisional results for 2024. All Year 8 students are given 30 days to apply for recount and remarking of scripts. As a nation committed to the advancement of our education, the overall pass rate of 69 percent is a significant indicator of the progress we are making, as well as the challenges that lie ahead of us. First and foremost, I would like to take this time to extend my congratulations to the students who worked diligently throughout the year to achieve these results. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, there has been a lot of criticisms, exaggeration and blame game with reference to the 2024 Fiji Year 8 Examination provisional results pass rate and the failing numbers. Sir, at this point I wish to emphasise on a quote by Carl Sagan, an American astronomer, and I quote: “One of the criteria for national leadership should therefore be a talent for understanding, encouraging, and making constructive use of vigorous criticism.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministerial Statement will provide a comprehensive analysis of the provisional results for 2024, and it will also highlight a few trends and insights as this information will be useful to students, parents, stakeholders, teachers and policymakers, in making informed decisions and planning for the future. But before I move on, Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight in this Parliament some of the initiatives that the Coalition Government undertook when it came into office. We started off with the re-engagement of retirees. We reviewed the Retirement Age Policy from 55 to 60, to allow teachers to continue their teaching programmes. We removed the ‘No Jab No Job’ Policy. We conducted the Fiji National Education Summit. We also established the new Education Commission. We also undertook visitations to schools in the rural and maritime areas and took the opportunity to listen to their queries and concerns that had been raised by teachers and stakeholders and try, to the best of our ability, to accommodate the concerns that they raised. We also restructured the Curriculum Department within the Ministry of Education by putting in the right resources and the exact number of personnel to ensure that the heartbeat of the Ministry of Education, which is the Curriculum Development Unit plays a very important role and they be resourced accordingly. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we introduced the school chaplaincy and the school Board of Governors. All of these were undertaken to try and improve the education system.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2229 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to take this time to reiterate that the national pass rate for the last eight years from 2015 to 2024, has shown fluctuation over the years, with a notable decline in 2022 and a significant increase in 2024. The highest national pass rate for Fiji Eighth Year Examination was achieved in 2024, which is 69 percent. The lowest point was observed in 2022 with the national pass rate of 62 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the limited information that is within the Ministry, we could only gather information from 2018 in the number of enrolled students in Year 8 and are as follows: (1) 2018 – 16,954 students enrolled, and the pass rate was around 59 percent; (2) 2019 – 17,396 students enrolled, and the pass rate was 69 percent; (3) 2022 – 17,924 students enrolled, and the pass rate was 62 percent; (4) 2023 – 19,554 students enrolled, and the pass rate was 67 percent; and (5) 2024 – 19,396 students enrolled, with the pass rate of 69 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you compare the rural and urban, the number who sat in the rural areas was 7,914 and the pass rate was around 66 percent. In the urban areas, 11,054 sat, with the pass rate of 71 percent. The trend for results in rural areas compared to urban centres depicts that more students are not performing well at schools located in rural areas. For instance, in 2017, the pass rate in rural areas was 61 percent and in urban areas was 73 percent. In 2018, 51 percent in rural areas and 65 percent in urban areas. In 2019, 64 percent in rural areas and 73 percent in urban areas. In 2022, 57 percent in rural areas and 66 percent in urban areas. In 2023, 63 percent in rural areas and 70 percent in urban areas. In 2024, 66 percent (increased from 2023) in rural areas and 71 percent in urban areas. I would like to also share the ethnicity breakdown of students enrolled and sat in the Year 8 Exam. For iTaukei, the number of students who sat was 13,714 with the pass rate of 67 percent. For Indian students, 4,449 sat and number of pass is 73 percent. For Rotumans, 648 sat and the pass rate is 76 percent. Other students, 157 sat and pass rate is 78 percent. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason for the fluctuation of results in the 2024 provisional Year 8 examinations for the last eight years includes but not limited to the: (1) Curriculum Changes - the curriculum was not aligned well with the student needs and interest and local context. We take heed of the call by the honourable Prime Minister that there is a need to review the curriculum of the Ministry of Education. (2) The high student to teacher ratio, the overcrowded classrooms and reduced individual attention and support for students. (3) Poor school management, weak leadership, lack of planning and inadequate monitoring of academic performance. Student-related factors include: (1) Low academic preparedness. (2) Students attending Year 8 classes with weak foundation skills in key subjects such as mathematics and literacy. (3) Lack of motivation and disinterest in learning or lack of understanding about the importance of education. (4) Behavioural issues, disruptions in class or lack of discipline among students and stakeholders. (5) Attendance problems, irregular school attendance due to illness, family responsibilities, or lack of interest.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>2230</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 (6) Parental and family factors, limited engagements of parents in their children’s education such as not monitoring homework or attending school meetings. (7) Parents are also noted to not be supervising and monitoring their students’ schoolwork at home or homework. (8) There seems to be a need to improve on educational issues regarding curriculum reviews, curriculum changes to accommodate the changing needs or the inadequate teacher recruitment and retention strategies. Over-emphasis on rote learning and exam results rather than conceptual understanding. Community factors include: (1) Issues on violence, substance abuse, lack of access to support services, lack of access to digital learning, as evidenced in school visits to the rural and maritime areas. (2) Lack of accessibility, particularly during periods of remote learning. (3) Unclear or overly difficult exam questions that do not reflect the curriculum that has been taught. (4) Weak systems of monitoring in addressing individuals or group learning deficits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier, this is not only limited to this list, but there are other contributing factors as well and addressing these factors require a collaborative approach among schools, among families, among policymakers and among communities, to create a supportive learning environment and an effective education system. There is always a general question that has been raised on catering for students who have failed. Sir, as a way forward, the Ministry of Education is looking at introducing technical vocational education training at a lower level from Year 8 or Year 9. And we also have to review the so-called no repeat policy, to allow students to go through this process. The automatic progression is something that we have not explored to see how many of those students, over the past years that I have mentioned, have automatically progressed into Year 9. Sir, we found that there is lack of monitoring tools, but we have noted that in 2023-2024, there has been a steady increase in those that enrol in Year 9 and, perhaps, we can contribute that to the $200 Back to School assistance that was issued for those students who are enrolled in the education system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current practice is that all students who have completed Year 8 or primary school level, are supposed to be enrolled in Year 9 at secondary school. This is something that we are trying to review and monitor. And I also wish to inform this august House that all students completing Year 8 Examination and for Year 9 in 2025, we will have to review the recruitment policy accordingly. On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, any parent or guardian who still faces difficulty in enrolling their children into Year 9 will have to contact our District Offices so they can be assisted accordingly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, English has an average national percentage pass rate of 57 percent in the last three years. Mathematics, however, has been low for the last three years, achieving 41 percent national pass rate, and we are working on reviewing the teaching contents and also the mathematics paper accordingly. Sir, I wish to assure this august House that the teams from the Ministry of Education are collaboratively working to improve the Year 8 results. An ongoing review of the curriculum will be conducted to ensure it is relevant, aligned with the needs of the 21 st century, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills among our students. We have also set ourselves to have strict monitoring</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2231 of head of schools, whose schools fall under the Hope school category for the last three consecutive years and a circular to this has been sent targeting such schools. We are also reviewing the automatic progression of students and school visits will be undertaken targeting individual Hope schools and Follow-Up schools. We are also working on trying to increase the outreach to maritime and remote rural schools. I have a list of strategies that is here, but I think I am compressed for time. This year’s results serve as a reminder, Sir, that education is a shared responsibility, and it takes the collective effort of the student, teachers, parents, vanua, lotu and the Government to ensure that our children receive quality education. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I encourage all stakeholders to take inspiration from the achievements of our students and to work collaboratively towards enhancing our education system, because together, we can ensure that Fiji remains a place where every child has the opportunity to not only learn, but also to grow and succeed. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment as the Speaker of the House. Secondly, I would like to congratulate the Fiji Sevens Team for winning the Dubai Sevens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate all Year 8 students for completing eight years of primary education and wish them well for their secondary education. I would like to also thank the teachers for their hard work and effort. Fiji Year 8 Examination is very important for Year 8 students. Examination plays a crucial role in a student’s career. The purpose of examinations is to measure the knowledge and understanding, promote discipline and time management, prepares one for real world challenges and provides fair and objective assessment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was listening very carefully to the honourable Minister for Education and if I heard it right, he mentioned that 41 percent of students passed Year 8 Mathematics. That is quite alarming. The other thing that he has mentioned is 56 percent of students who are studying in remote rural areas have successfully completed Year 8, compared to 71 percent who are schooling in urban areas. Analysing examination results is important because it can help improve teaching and learning. Using exam results data effectively is key to improving both, school and student performance. While basic scores are useful, the real value comes from deeper analysis of examination data. By using advance and thorough analysis methods, the Ministry of Education can find important trends and patterns to guide their decisions and help students and teachers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that the analysis of the Fiji Eighth Year Examination includes the following: • How did the students in rural remote areas do in their examination, compared to urban area students? If this can be done thoroughly subject by subject and school by school. • Why did students not do well in second subjects in certain schools? • • Is it because of lack of resources or is it facilities or is it because of</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2232</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 • not meeting teaching learning hours? In here, monitoring comes in. If you look at the results in remote maritime schools, it is only 56 percent compared to urban which is 71 percent. So, my question is – was proper monitoring done by the Education Officers in respective Districts? (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. H. CHAND.- After the analysis of the examination results, the Ministry should come up with plans so that students can be assisted in areas where they are weak. The Ministry should also plan and provide support, guidance and training to teachers in areas where they need training. About 14,000 students have met the benchmark and 31 percent, that is around 6,000 students did not do very well in Year 8 examination. So, what are the plans? What will the Ministry do? How will the Ministry assist these 6,000 students who did not do very well in the Year 8 Examination? MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call upon the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate. HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to reply to the Statement by the honourable Minister for Education in regards to the Analysis of the Fiji Eighth Year Examination. At the outset, Sir, I would also like to join my fellow colleagues who have already congratulated you on your appointment as the Speaker of this august House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the much-talked-about issue recently around the country, as well as on social media. I thank the honourable Minister for the thorough statement and the analysis that he has given, highlighting some of the initiatives and also the work he is currently doing in terms of the review of the Education system. He also mentioned about the pass rate that has improved, but I believe that a major concern at the moment is also what the honourable Member has just alluded to, that over 6,000 students could not make it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, still on the Fiji Eighth Year Examination, I would also like to question the validity or the significant of sitting the Year 8 Examination. In speaking of this, if you look at all the secondary schools in Fiji, at the moment, in terms of their intake to Year 10, majority of the schools are selecting students after getting the marks from their annual exam or third term examination. Not all the schools are using the Year 8 exam to intake students into schools. So, I agree with the honourable Minister in terms of the review and how significant the Year 8 Examination is, because a lot of schools are selecting students to secondary schools from the 3 rd Term Exams. Secondly, this is an issue which we should not play a blame game to. As shared by the honourable Minister, it is a shared responsibility. What has happened, has happened, and the onus is on Government and all of us sitting in this august Parliament to work together with the Minister responsible as to how we can improve from here. There is a lot of doubts and areas that we need to connect to try and improve, despite the improvement of the passing rate. We need to focus on those that could not make it. Now, some of the very foundations of the areas that we need to look into is the family. Speaking of families, parents are most important in terms of the upbringing of every child that goes to school and speaking of parents, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look around the country at the moment, there are a lot of young parents. My questions, and I raised these issues a lot:</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2233 (1) (2) (3) Is enough awareness or counselling created to these young parents in terms of the upbringing of a small child into the education system? Is the curriculum still relevant to the current situation we are in, in terms of the evolving world? Things do evolve and change? Is our curriculum still relevant to the changes that we are currently undertaking? Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just focussing on the different levels of our education system, first is the Early Childhood Education (ECE). I believe that there needs to be more focus on ECE, which is the very foundation of the upbringing of any school kid around Fiji. It has also been raised last year about the level of the education system that is there to cater for the ECE because of the number of students, non-readers that are there in our school systems. So, with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know time has caught up on me, so I thank the honourable Minister for the thorough analysis on the Year 8 Examination Results. Beijing Platform for Action +30 Regional Review HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Good morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir and honourable Members of Parliament. I wish to join my colleagues to congratulate you in your election as Speaker of Parliament and wish you the very best as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the recent Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on the Beijing Platform for Action +30 Regional Review which is held in Thailand earlier last month. The significant event brought together over 1,200 delegates including Ministers, senior officials, women rights organisations, civil society and development partners from across the Asia Pacific Region to assess our progress and challenges in implementing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action over the past 30 years. Every five years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this review is conducted, and it will remain as one of the most comprehensive frameworks for advancing gender equality across the globe. Next year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will celebrate the 30 th year of the Beijing Platform for Action, so as part of the build up to this celebration next year, each country is to present its Review Report on the Status of Gender Equality. For Fiji, we had successfully compiled our report and earlier this year, Cabinet endorsed our Review Report. At the Conference, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji reaffirmed its dedication to the 12 critical areas of concern outlined in the platform. Notably, Sir, this Beijing Platform for Action is adopted under the leadership of our current Prime Minister and the areas of concern include, to name a few: women’s health, women’s education, women’s economic participation, women’s political empowerment and, of course, the elimination of violence against women and children. As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with alignments to the critical areas of concern, Fiji was able to participate in emerging issues which were not there 30 years ago but is certainly a rising trend and an area of concern in the review of the Beijing Platform for Action and that is the issue of technology facilitated gender-based violence or online violence. For Fiji, we shared the data, which was given by Fiji’s Online Safety Commission, where it indicated that 62 percent of women are experiencing online violence compared to 38 percent of men. In this context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we shared how Fiji is making progress as well in implementing our National Action to Prevent Violence Against All Women and Girls or Fiji NAP, as well as the forthcoming Women's Economic Empowerment National Action Plan and the work</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>2234</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 we are currently doing to gender mainstream across Government Ministries and agencies in terms of institutional capacity development, as we may commonly refer to, specifically gender responsive budgeting across the Ministries and agencies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to just briefly share some of the key activities and milestones shared at the Conference that Fiji has been able to achieve, especially as we are currently in the 16 Days of Activism period to end violence against women and girls. The first, Sir, is the engagement with the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC). I wish to acknowledge and commend the GCC, especially the Chairman, Ratu Viliame Seruvakula for prioritising violence against women and children. It is truly significant that they have prioritised this and put this on their agenda because the traditional setting, is a key setting to look at the root causes of violence against women and children, especially emphasising on building respectful relationships between girls and boys. We appreciate the collaboration between the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the iTaukei Affairs Board in reinforcing the efforts to create safe spaces across our villages and our settlements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am even more grateful for the commitment of Government with the very recent amendment to the iTaukei Affairs (Great Council of Chiefs) Regulations, which spells out the Great Council of Chiefs mandate. Just this week, the amendment has been made to Regulation 14(e) specifically, which states that the Great Council of Chiefs is to advocate and set strategic directions to address violence against women and girls. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the faith-based setting. We have already started working with faith leaders and faith-based organisations on a communication campaign which they have launched during the 16 Days of Activism. This campaign aims to foster awareness and drive behavioural change within our faith settings. I wish to commend the House of Sarah Coordinator, Reverend Sereima Lomaloma, and her team for their impactful video titled, My Faith Says No to Rape. This collaboration with faith leaders and the Ministry, as well as SPC, Pacific Women Lead and Australian Aid, highlights the power of collective advocacy to end violence against women and girls in Fiji. Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have conducted a gender analysis of the Fiji Online Safety Act. The Ministry, together with the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA), undertook this gender analysis to address technology facilitated gender-based violence, which is a growing concern in Fiji. This analysis has identified gaps in prevention, protection and reporting mechanisms for women and children, and provides actionable recommendations. The findings will be presented during our Members of Parliament retreat and will form future legislative review and actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very grateful to UNFPA for this partnership. Fourthly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be convening a forum for young women aged 18 years to 25 years old to coincide with the 16 Days of Activism, which is on 5th December. This is to gather insights from our young women on how gender-based violence or how violence online affects their lives. This forum will provide a platform where they can share their experiences, in particular, on their online challenges, seeking their perspectives on necessary protections and responses. The outcomes of these discussions will be documented as well and will be presented at our Members of Parliament retreat this month, and it will be presented by one of their own peers. This direct engagement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensures that we are capturing the voices of our young people, especially our young women who are suffering greatly from online violence.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2235 The fifth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what is called a National Community Attitude Survey. Starting in January, with the technical support from UNICEF, we will roll out a national survey to examine society’s attitude towards women and children, and the need to be able to create key messages for an aggressive communications campaign to target those attitudes that are causing violence and to be able to help in change of behaviour of these attitudes. This survey will not just be talking to women and girls, as is being done conventionally to date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but will also include talking to our men and boys. Sixth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is enhancing responses to victims of and survivors of violence when they present themselves to our Fiji Police Force (FPF). As we know, Sir, through the Fiji NAP, we are trying to look at the prevention of violence before it starts and not just response. What we have done as part of the 16 Days of Activism is that the Ministry has partnered with the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre (FWCC) where we have been conducting awareness sessions or refresher courses with the FPF in terms of strengthening the implementation of services they provide to victims who present, as well as survivors of violence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what the Fiji NAP represents, collective effort by all players and I wish to acknowledge the continued support and technical expertise by the Fiji NAP Secretariat, as well as the FPF and the criminal justice system. I also wish to thank the Government of Australia for their generous financial support and technical support of the NAP Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am excited and committed to forging this partnership in making 2025, hopefully, a transformative year, particularly, in violence prevention and response. This will mean, of course, continuing to collaborate with our partners and stakeholders and will involve strengthening partnerships with other organisations such as UNFPA, UNICEF, UNSCAF, UN Women at Women Deliver. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Conference in Bangkok, Fiji had the opportunity to chair the Conference on the final day, culminating the adoption of the report on the Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on the Beijing +30 review, as well as the closing ceremony. Mr. Speaker, Sir, five years ago, my predecessor, Ms. Mere Rakuita, chaired the very same Conference. The selection of Fiji to chair these regional conferences shows Fiji’s leadership in the Pacific, in Asia and to the world, and underscores our commitment in empowering women throughout our region. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on the review of Beijing Platform for Action has provided a renewed momentum and a renewed commitment in reinforcing our commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment. Our active participation in the Conference and discussions have been significant and beneficial. I would like to extend my gratitude to the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership and also to Cabinet and to Government and, of course, Parliament for your continued support, as well as encouraging the implementation of the NAP GBV since it certainly is a bipartisan effort as it had begun from the previous Government in developing the NAP GBV, as well as now our turn to implement it effectively. It is only together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we can protect, advance the rights and well-being of all members of society, not just women and girls, our boys as well, our men, our persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups that we are charged with. Hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue to carry on striving for a more just and equitable Fiji.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>2236</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 MR. SPEAKER. – I will now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. HON. V. LAL. –Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go on to my reply, I would like to take this opportunity to, once again, congratulate you, Sir. I wish you all the best and looking forward to working with you. Similar to my other colleagues, I also would like to congratulate the Fiji Sevens Team and Coach for the win. On the Ministerial Statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection for her Statement on Fiji’s participation in the Beijing Platform for Action, +30 regional review. While I acknowledge the efforts made by the honourable Minister and her team, it is imperative to critically examine the outcomes and the actual progress on the ground. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Beijing Platform for Action +30 regional review was, indeed, a significant event, providing a platform for assessing our progress in gender equality and women’s empowerment. However, the Minister’s Statement, while highlighting some advancement, fails to address several critical areas where our efforts have fallen short. Firstly, the honourable Minister spoke about the implementation of gender responsive policies and programmes. While these initiatives are commendable in Chile, the reality is that many of these programmes lack adequate funding and effective implementation. Women entrepreneurs, particularly in rural areas, continue to face significant barriers in accessing financial resources and support. The Government’s effort must go beyond mere policy announcements, and ensure tangible support reaches those who need it most. In the promotion of Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education for girls, the data shows that gender disparities in education persists, particularly in higher education and vocational training. The Government must take more robust measures to ensure that girls not only have access to education but are also encouraged and supported to pursue careers in STEM fields. This requires a comprehensive approach, including mentorship programmes, scholarships and addressing societal attitudes that discourage girls from these fields. The honourable Minister also mentioned our commitment to addressing gender-based violence. While awareness campaigns and legal frameworks are essential, the reality on the ground tells a different story. Reports of gender-based violence remains alarmingly high and many survivors still lack access to adequate support services. The Government must prioritise that establishment of more shelters, council services and legal aid for survivors. Additionally, there needs to be a stronger focus on prevention, including education and community engagement, to change harmful attitudes and behaviours. Furthermore, the honourable Minister’s Statement did not adequately address the issue of intersectionality. Women and girls from marginalised communities, including those with disabilities, businesswomen and LGBTQ+ individuals face compounded discrimination and barriers. The Government’s policies must be inclusive and address the unique challenges faced by these groups to ensure that no one is left behind. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and Beijing +30 Regional Review has provided us with valuable insights and best practices from across the region. However, it is clear that our government needs to do more to translate these insights into concrete actions. We must hold ourselves accountable and ensure that our commitments are not just words on paper but are reflected in the experiences of women and girls in Fiji.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2237 In conclusion, while I appreciate the Minister's efforts and the progress made, it is crucial that we critically evaluate our shortcomings and take decisive actions to address them. Let us work together to ensure that the principles of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action are fully realised, and that gender equality becomes a reality for all. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now invite the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your appointment as the Speaker of the House. Mr. Speaker, Sir, across the Pacific, accelerated action is needed to meet the ambitions of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, including SDG5 on Gender Equality and all other SDGs. Despite significant strides in women's education and health and some progress made in women's political representation in the past three decades, progress towards gender equality and the empowerment of women appears to be stagnating and even regressing in some areas, such as labour force participation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, women and girls in the region continue to face discriminatory social norms and gender stereotypes - high levels of gender-based violence, disproportionate unpaid care and domestic work burden, among other challenges. The level of political will to address these issues remain inadequate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover women and girls have been more disproportionately affected by multiple and interrelated crisis that are expected to continue or worsen in the absence of accelerated action. Mr. Speaker, Sir, women play a very crucial role in Fiji’s economy where their contribution are often unrecognised. There is far more work to be done in Fiji, but we have made important gains over the past 25 years in education, maternal mortality, access to health services, women's representation in leadership positions and participation in Parliament and increased public awareness and recognition of women's rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have enacted progressive legislation and regulatory framework. A good example which is stated by the honourable Minister for Social Protection in relation to the amendment of the iTaukei Affairs (Great Council of Chiefs) (Amendment) Regulations 2024. It is a good move, Sir. The Government, in particular, has led a relentless effort to end violence against women by changing the laws governing sexual assault to make it easier and safer for a woman to come forward and feel secure under the law and confident that justice will be delivered, and by speaking out at every opportunity to shame the very notion of violence directed against women and girls. As you are most aware, Mr, Speaker, Sir the removal of the law which is discriminatory to sexual victims and now the law corroboration has come into play where there is no corroboration needed under our Fiji laws. I thank the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for its policies and programmes that enables women to pursue enhanced opportunities and excel in all aspects of their development, be it in education, leadership, career development, empowering them to reach their highest potential in life. Sir, all children in Fiji attend primary school with 92 percent of girls completing secondary school. Female students make up 57 percent of the graduates of tertiary institutions. Women hold five of 55 seats in our Parliament and half of those female parliamentarians are here today serving as Ministers or Assistant Minister in the current Government. Almost 30 percent of leadership positions in the Civil Service are women. Sir, under the 2018 Employment Relations (Budget Amendment) Act, it has been amended to increase the level of maternity leave and introduce paternity leave so that women can have assistance with childbearing in the home. The 2018 amendment to the Succession,</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>2238</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 Probate and Administration Act now guarantees inheritance rights to women living in de-facto relationships. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot take pride in certain achievements. We cannot rest. We expect steady transformation as more girls in Fijian classrooms and universities translate into more women participation in the formal economy having greater access to financial resources and serving as government and business leaders, engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists, doctors and financiers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are determined to have an inclusive and equal Fiji, and I ask the Government that we must not stop until we get there.</p></body>
