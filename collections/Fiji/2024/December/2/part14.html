<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Evaluation of Erosion – Rewa Riverbanks (Question No. 259/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament on the current evaluation of the erosion issue along the Rewa riverbanks, specifically between the central Nausori Town boundary towards Lakena Point? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, foremost let me offer my congratulations to His Excellency the Turaga na Tui Cakau, Ratu Naiqama Tawakecolati Lalabalavu on his appointment as our new President of the Republic of the Fiji Islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to congratulate you on your new appointment as a Speaker of the House. This is a momentous occasion and your election to this distinguished position reflects the trust and confidence placed in your leadership, integrity and dedication to serving the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the honourable Member’s question, I rise to address the concerns raised regarding the ongoing erosion issue along the Rewa riverbank, particularly between the central Nausori Town boundary and Lakena Point. This area is of great significance both in terms of its natural environment and the communities that depend on it for their livelihoods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the soil erosion index, the country is losing over 50 tonnes of soil per hectare each year through run off which is four times the average in tropical areas. The consequences of the expansion of agriculture and the increase logging activities of rainforest on erosion have been significant. The effects of erosion include degradation of land, reduction in soil carbon, decrease productivity and sediment accumulation in rivers leading to an increase in flooding and harm to coral reef by transport of sand sediments. Erosion also poses a direct threat to critical infrastructure including nearby roads, residential properties and community facilities. Communities have expressed concerns about the safety of their homes, access to transportation routes, potential loss of arable land and biodiversity loss in preparing zones with destabilised riverbank habitats impacting the ecosystem. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, through the Waterways Division is actively addressing this critical issue. The ongoing assessments indicate that this stretch</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2239 of the riverbank is significantly impacted by erosion is significantly impacted by erosion due to several contributing factors, including high river flow velocities during peak rainfall seasons, increased sediment load from riverbanks upstream activities such as agriculture and land clearing, insufficient recurring vegetation leaving the susceptible to erosion, encroachment and unregulated developments near the riverbanks and uncontrolled sand extraction works close to the river. Multiple site visits and technical surveys have identified critical erosion hotspots, particularly where the river meanders sharply, creating areas of heightened flow velocity and stress on the banks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the potential threats posed by this issue, the engineers from the Ministry of Waterways Division are examining and analysing flow patterns and sedimental transport to determine the root cause and develop effective interventions. Meeting with stakeholders including residents, businesses and local government representatives are also being conducted to incorporate their input and ensure solutions. These entities, each with legal jurisdiction within their area, are essential partners in formulating an effective solution to address the erosion challenges along the section of the Rewa River. Currently, the Waterways Division is collaborating with key stakeholders, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the National Disaster Management Office to develop a National Waterways Strategy and incorporate inputs into Disaster Risk Reduction Plans for the Rewa catchment. These consultations aim to develop comprehensive, sustainable strategies for addressing erosion and other water related hazards in the region. Additionally, the engineers are leveraging drone-based mapping to monitor changes in riverbank profiles, providing real time data to guide decision making and project implementation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also considering these additional strategies aimed at mitigating erosion and reinforcing the stability of the riverbanks. The planting of vetiver grass and native vegetation, as a nature-based solution to naturally stabilise the banks shall reduce erosion, improve structural interventions by installing boulder revetment at critical locations for immediate protection and constructing groynes to redirect river flow and alleviate pressure on vulnerable areas. Silt removed from the river is deposited along the riverbanks as part of the riverbank protection works and this have started at Vunimono, Toga and Nasilai are portions of the Rewa Riverbank. Enhancing awareness and regulation through developing and introducing Riverbank Management Guidelines to minimise encroachment and regulate activities along the riverbanks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to a balanced approach, combining short term stabilisation measures with long-term riverbank management practices. A comprehensive project proposal will be submitted through the Ministry’s budget submission to secure the necessary resources for implementation. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges the critical need to address erosion along the Rewa riverbank to safeguard lives, infrastructure and environment. The Ministry's prioritising the completion of technical assessments and will commence remedial works as soon as possible. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while some people would just see this as soil erosion, I see that the resources of the qoliqoli owners are washed away. Is the Ministry considering some kind of compensation to the i qoliqoli owners for the washing away of their resources into Rewa River? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you wish to comment? (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>2240</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now there is no talk of compensation, but I am glad that question is being asked from that side of the House because they did nothing during their time. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his explanation, I think a very in-depth explanation of the factors that are affecting the erosion. By the way, Sir, congratulations on your appointment and congratulations for the son of Kabara who also got, after 22 tournaments they did not win anything. It had to take a boy from Kabara to take Dubai back after nine years. I want to thank the honourable Minister for his long, very good and in-depth explanation of the various factors and I understand that they are still continuing the investigations while they decide what to do. Part of the things that he talked about was the lack of vegetation on the sides of the river and at the same time, maybe the impacts of the extraction of gravel and sand from the river. I noticed the day I drove past last week that the dredgers are right on the side of the river. If I understand, these dredgers are supposed to be in the middle of the river. So, in the interim while his awaiting that, is he also considering liaising with these dredgers to move to the middle of the river, and at the same time whether there is any approach to get those who own the farms there to actually plant trees and plants along the edge of the river to protect …. MR. SPEAKER.- Do you need to answer that, honourable Minister? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- The dredge owners have been told exactly that, to move into the middle of the river. Status of Fiji’s National Carbon Strategy Roadmap (Question No. 260/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Information, Immigration and Fiji Police Force update Parliament on the status of Fiji’s National Carbon Strategy Roadmap? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish I could just show him this and ask him to go and read it because that was adopted in COP29. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also add my words of congratulations to His Excellency the President and our gratitude to the immediate past President. Also, my congratulations to the sevens rugby team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the question from the honourable Tunabuna. The Coalition Government, I believe, have made significant strides in developing Fiji’s National Carbon Strategy Roadmap and there is the copy. It was embraced by COP29. A lot of work had gone into that, and I would like to also thank the Australian Government for seconding an official from the Australian Government to the Prime Minister's Office to help out in climate change matters, who was with us for one year and has gone back.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2241 In essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strategic roadmap has been developed to support the process required for Fiji to safely and effectively engage with international carbon markets. The roadmap provides information on Fiji’s context, our objectives and priorities, and provides the basis for developing the necessary regulatory environment to support interested parties to collaborate, to support our efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Fiji faces unique challenges related to climate change, such as the rising sea levels and climate change excavated natural disasters. Keeping global emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius is critical for our future and there are opportunities to attract investment to help us meet our emissions reduction targets in ways that support our local economy and our resilience. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications’ Ministerial Statement this morning elaborated on such efforts to reduce our emissions and contribute to global warming. Mr. Speaker, 55 percent of our energy supply is currently from non-fossil fuel - 50 percent from hydropower and 5 percent from biomass and wind generators. We are well on our way in our contributions to reducing carbon emissions. Fiji’s National Carbon Market Strategy Roadmap provides an initial framework to help the nation leverage international carbon markets in alignment with our ambitious climate goal. The roadmap offers pathways and options that can help a range of stakeholders to use carbon market instruments to scale resilience and unlock sustainable development opportunities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Carbon Market Strategy Roadmap outlines specific actions needed to ensure that carbon market engagement supports Fiji’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and advanced high integrity carbon projects that uphold environmental integrity and social safeguards. This Roadmap is centred on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and I assume everyone knows that, and the focus is on the use of co-operative approaches between parties and stakeholders to address climate change through market and non-market approaches that enable Fiji to engage both, market based and non-market-based carbon mitigation mechanisms, emphasising high integrity practices, equitable benefit sharing and sustainable development. This initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, leverages international carbon markets to mobilise investments for decarbonisation and resilience building projects, while safeguarding the interests of local communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Roadmap identified five pillars of actions which have been sequenced across short, medium and long term categories to facilitate a staged approach to the implementation of the Roadmap Action Plan in Fiji. They include: (1) Pillar 1 Enhancing market readiness through strategic actions. (2) Pillar 2 Strengthening legal frameworks and governance structures. (3) Pillar 3 Safeguarding community benefits and landowner rights. A lot of our landowners are coming up with their own suggestions in that area. (4) Pillar 4 Increasing public awareness, participation and ownership and capacity. (5) Pillar 5 Developing effective partnerships and scaling finance.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>2242</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s vulnerability to climate change, compounded by limited resources and competing development priorities, underscores the importance of innovative financial solutions. The reality is that, through carbon markets, we can attract additional financial flows, in exchange with partial share in the emissions reduction we facilitate with those investments. There is significant international interest to provide funding to Fiji in ways that support both, our adaptation and resilience building objectives, as well as our effort to reduce emissions. This Roadmap is important both, for domestic stakeholders, as well as for international parties interested to engage with us. An example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has signed an initial agreement with the Government of Singapore which, in the future, could enable companies in Singapore to invest in low carbon technology in Fiji, whether it be transport infrastructure or renewable energy systems. This would help to offset the cost of these new types of technology in exchange for a share in emissions reduction outcomes. International actors are in a position to invest in countries, like Fiji, with the cost of reducing emissions potentially cheaper than it would be in their domestic setting. The benefit for us is that those investments can help give us access to infrastructure and technology that we would not otherwise have been able to afford. The Roadmap, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provides details of our priorities and actions which we will take to ensure these tools are brought about in an effective way. Mr. Speaker, the Roadmap was co-designed through an 18-month process that included multi- stakeholder engagement through workshops and webinars that involved representatives from 14 key government ministries, community groups, private sector participants and international experts. This collaborative process has, overall, created awareness on carbon markets through the dissemination of information and generally facilitated ownership of the process and outcome. The roadmap is not a final strategy or policy, but a guide to how progress further efforts and consultations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, technical support for his work was funded by the Australian Government, as I had mentioned, and delivered through the Carbon Market Institute. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Carbon Market Strategy Roadmap that I had shown this august House was endorsed in Cabinet on 13 th November, 2024, and was also launched at the margins of COP 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, by the honourable Attorney-General. The Government of Singapore and Conservation International have expressed interest in supporting the Government of Fiji’s implementation efforts. A range of bilateral and multilateral engagements are actively being pursued to ensure comprehensive support for project development and market engagement in response to the launch of this key document. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to provide legal institutional support for the implementation, the regulations under Part 10 of the Climate Change Act 2021 will be expedited to operationalise our ability to regulate and engage with the carbon market mechanisms. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to welcome you to our Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in terms of carbon capture, sequestration and the Strategic Roadmap as mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister. Honourable Prime Minister, there is an issue at hand on our ground where excessive vehicle emission in terms of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide particulate matter, volatile organic matter, is getting quite high. What we get to see honourable</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2243 Prime Minister is that vehicles that are not serviced or should not be on the roads are on our roads and polluting the air with excessive carbon and all these gases. So, what is the line Ministry doing to reduce this carbon footprint in going forward? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure there are regulations, and the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport is aware that during the renewal of licences, there are systems to check the emission from each vehicle before the licences are renewed. There are no spot checks on the road at the moment, but they can be re-introduced. Thank you. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Prime Minister, this may or may not have international trade implications in terms of our exports and I am not sure if it applies to imports, but will this strategy properly address those issues that may arise? I understand that Europe may put on a carbon levy, so some of the stuff that we actually export out to them may be subject to carbon levy. Is that going to be addressed by us in terms of our own economy? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. All these are contained in this Carbon Market Strategy. It is a strategy. There are various actions that we have to carry out - those that reduce our own emissions and those that encourage investors to contribute to those industries that will further contribute to the global effort to maintain the global warming target of 1.5 degrees Celsius by the target date. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question; are we still on the roadmap to 2050 to have Fiji as a zero emitter of carbon in the globe? Secondly, does this framework actually provide any kind of imitative to all those landowners who already have their stock, to upgrade their stock to do carbon trading? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the simple answer to that is yes. We are encouraging landowners and forest owners to continue to put forward their suggestions for the inclusion of their forest areas under this Roadmap. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues to congratulate you for taking the post of the Speaker of the House. Honourable Prime Minister, strategies and roadmaps are beautiful documents with good intentions. My question to you is on capacity building. Are there any plans to build the capacity so that this Roadmap can be delivered effectively? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question. Yes, they are all part of it and all we have to do is collectively contribute to our strategies and policies that we have here, to contribute towards our national effort, in contributing to the world effort towards our fight against climate change. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this point, we will break for lunch. Therefore, this proceeding is suspended. The Parliament will resume proceedings at 2.30 this afternoon. The Parliament adjourned at 12.29 p.m.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2244 The Parliament resumed at 2.41 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming a group of Australian sponsored students currently enrolled in the Institute of Indigenous Studies Fiji for iTaukei Conversational Language and their leader is Ms. Rosy Lagi. You are most welcome. Plans to Reinstate Rotuma, Rabi and Kioa Island Councils (Question No. 261/2024) HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Oral Question, I would like to congratulate you on your calling. I pray that God will continue to guide you in your leadership role. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is as follows: Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises Information, Immigration and Fiji Police Force update Parliament on plans to reinstate the Rotuma, Rabi and Kioa Island Councils?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.</p><p>With regards to the plan in reinstating the Rotuma Island Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rotuma is administratively incorporated into Fiji as dependency with some measures of autonomy given to Local Government in the current Rotuma Act where the Rotuma Island Council can make regulations for the island. In line with the Government’s obligation under the ILO Convention No. 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples and United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), I have an office under my portfolio that is responsible for looking after Rotuman affairs. The UNDRIP ILO No. 169, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises that indigenous peoples have the right to free, prior and inform consent, or nothing about us without us. This means that their consent must be sought and freely given to changes that affect their institutions, their resources and their traditional decision-making processes, for example, the appointment of their chiefs. The Coalition Government is adamant that the people of Rotuma should decide for themselves their future and to be governed by law and systems that are in line with their culture and traditions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to delve into history. The 1970 Constitution recognised the Council of Rotuma as a local authority. The Great Council of Chiefs would permit the Rotuma Island Council delegates to make decisions on all issues pertaining to Rotumans, which the Chief would then support. The cession of Rotuma in 1879 was also acknowledged in the 1997 Constitution and according to that Constitution, the iTaukei and Rotuma indigenous people have the right to governance through their separate administrative systems and the rights of all individuals, communities and groups are respected. The Rotuma Lands Act, the Rotuma Act, the Native Land Trust Act, the Native Lands Act, the Fijian Affairs Act and the Banaban Act were all included and protected under Section 185 of the 1997 Constitution. Those provisions, unfortunately, were not included in the 2013 Constitution. So, the laws relating to Fiji’s indigenous peoples may be amended by the Government with the simple</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2245 majority in the House. Now, that the Great Council of Chiefs has been reinstated, I urge the Chiefs and residents of Rotuma to participate in the determination of matters pertaining to their functions, including the revision of legislations, that include meaningful consultations and dialogues through free prior and informed consensus. Chapter 122 of the Rotuma Act created the Council of Rotuma, a statutory authority. The seven elected representatives from each of the seven districts and the seven district leaders, make up that Council. As stated, each of Rotuma’s seven districts elects one representative of the Council and the traditional chief of each district is also a Council member. The seven Chiefs are chosen according to traditional custom; the election is usually for life. The seven elected representatives are elected for three-year terms by resident Rotuma islanders, aged 21 years and over. Candidacy is restricted to persons who are eligible to vote. The full members of the Council elect a chairman from among themselves. For the honourable Members information, the Rotuma Island Council was not dissolved but the subvention fund was suspended for two consecutive financial years due to non-compliance to financial regulations by the Council. The matter has now been rectified by the Council and the annual subvention funds have been released. On elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rotuma Island Council held its election on 24 th August, 2023, where the current chairman was re-elected for another three year term. It is critical to note that elections are held every three years and the current electoral procedure, as outlined in the current Rotuma Act, is still being followed. This is another critical area of interest that will be subject for consultation and thorough discussion once the review of the Act commences. The Council now looks after the overall development on the island. The Council is now allocated budgetary grant and the Rotuma’s Subvention Fund that is administered by the Office to support its daily operational needs and to provide development assistance to communities in Rotuma. Just because I plan to intend to reinstate the Rabi Island Council, I would like to read our relative inquiry, Kam na Mauri. The Rabi Island Council of Leaders was established under the Banaban Settlement Act 1970, Cap 123. The last election of the Council members was held in 2011. As the Prime Minister and Minister in charge of Rabi Island matters, I have appointed an administrator for the Rabi Island Council of Leaders to oversee the Council’s operations and restore the annual Rabi Subvention Fund as one of the Coalition Government’s top priorities for the people of Rabi, who had been left behind in social and economic advancements over the years when the subvention fund was withheld by the Office. The Council was dissolved in 2013 due to the mismanagement of funds and pending court cases for some of its members. Legal advice was sought, noting that the dissolution was due to the failure to meet financial standards and requirements within specified timeframes. General elections for the Council were first held in November 1996 in accordance with Regulation 1951(2)(1) of the Banaban Settlement Act. Elections are scheduled to take place in January of the following four years - 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. Therefore, the next General Election should have been held in January 2024, in accordance with Article 2(1). In order to improve governance, oversee island development and prepare for the next election,</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>2246</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 the Office is currently consulting with and reviewing portions of the Banaban Settlement Act in collaboration with the interim Rabi Administrator. This will ensure that the Act takes into account current and emerging development trends. A major change to be expected from the review was for the election process to be aligned to that of the Fijian Elections Office in terms of voting age and the criteria for those wishing to contest the elections and selection process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Banaban Settlement Act’s existing voting age is 21, that must also be changed to 18 in order to comply with the Fijian Elections Regulations. The Kioa Island and Melanasian Vasu iTaukei, Talofa, welcome and bula vinaka. Apart from that legislative role, the office also coordinates and facilitates the disbursement of development grants of Melanesian Vasu iTaukei and Kioa Island based on community priorities.</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- Are there any supplementary questions?</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> I thank the honourable Prime Minister for a very detailed response on Rotuma, but my question is related to Rabi Island. I understand the Faith Candidate of The People’s Alliance Party (PAP), Mr. Jacob Korotake, was appointed as the Administrator, and he had come up with a policy that anyone who is a non-Banaban who wants to enter Rabi Island, it has been reported in the media, that one has to get police clearance to enter Rabi Island. Is the honourable Prime Minister aware of it? And if, yes, has any action been taken against this member? HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of that and I will follow it up with the police. Status of Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme (Question No. 262/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my question, I would like to also join the other honourable Members of Parliament who have spoken before me to congratulate you and thank you for being appointed as the Speaker of this august Parliament. Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the current status of the Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to join my colleagues in congratulating you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment to be our Speaker. I know that we are in good hands and there will be many wonderful years ahead with your leadership. Also, to the favourite son of Kabara, Osea Kolinisau, who brought so much joy to our nation early this morning - the victory in Dubai. I am sure, like most of you, the quarter final with the French, that last try, I am not a good loser, I left and went to my room, and my family was still cheering and apparently, someone from Nadroga picked up the ball and went to score that try. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vocea for his question. I know that this is a programme that not only the honourable Members in this Parliament hold dear, but our people across the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of those listening online, in June last year, the World Bank approved financing of US$200 million or FJ$447 million for a ten-year multi-phase programmatic</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2247 approach to tourism development in Vanua Levu. This is on a highly concessional terms through the International Development Association. As I have shared in this august Parliament, the US$100 million dollars, while earmarked for the tourism programme, will greatly benefit other sectors. The crux of this programme is to mobilise investments in resilient infrastructure and essential services, create a more enabling business environment and to enhance institutional coordination. It is known as Na Vualiku Project, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are in phase one of Na Vualiku Project valued at US$61.5 million, it runs from year one to year six. This phase will set the foundations for sustainable tourism in Vanua Levu and is where we are starting. In September of this year, the honourable Prime Minister officially launched the Na Vualiku Project in Savusavu and he also officially opened our office there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2024-2025 financial year, the project has been allocated an estimated $13.6 million. Of this, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation has provided $7.69 million, Fiji Roads Authority - $2.4 million and Fiji Airports - $3.4 million. From the Ministry’s side, considerable work has begun. We are first undertaking a Strategic Environmental Social Assessment (SESA) to look at all the environmental and social risks and impacts that could be expected with the implementation of the integrated tourism master plan, a firm has been engaged. In parallel with SESA, we are now in the process of preparing an integrated tourism master plan which will be an important framework that will give us a 25-year forecast for tourism growth to Vanua Levu and Taveuni. It will also include baseline, and a scenario forecast that can tell us the investments and finances needed to cater for future demand. This work will commence by April 2025. By January 2025, we will commence working on a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) pilot programme. Here we will map out tourism MSMEs, community-based tourism and women cultural enterprises, understand their specific needs, then design a pilot programme. Together with the National Trust of Fiji, we are progressing work on the design of the Waisali Forest Reserve Visitor Centre and Tracks, et cetera. We are working with our partners on the design and feasibility study of the solar panel installations. The Savusavu Town Council have identified a few locations where the panels could be installed. There are, of course, a number of large infrastructural activities that will require more coordination, for example, solid waste management. We have established a waste management committee to support the project in terms of land identification and acquisition. The Fiji Roads Authority have also commenced work on the design phase of the Labasa – Savusavu Link Scenic Road before civil works begin. With respect to airports for Vanua Levu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to start landing ATR 72 to make a difference in carrying the passengers to Vanua Levu. Right now, only Labasa can take the ATR 72, and the plan is to extend Matei to also cater for ATR 72. There is a site that I visited on Friday, very much in the news in Vunilagi which can take ATR 72 and possibly smaller jets. Vunilagi is very well situated and is located about 40 minutes’ drive from Savusavu, very picturesque, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>2248</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 The Na Vualiku Project is progressing very well and I might just add, I was there on Thursday and Friday, in Labasa and Savusavu, the boom in those two economies is very evident and I think there are great years ahead for Vanua Levu. And for this programme to work, we need the buy-in, not just from other government ministries but other government organisations, civil society, private sector, development partners and communities. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I join honourable Members in welcoming and also congratulating you on your election, and I hope you will be very lenient with the Opposition MPs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the project and looking after our Vanua Levu people. As much as we promote the Northern Development Programme or the Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme, one of the major issues is our hospital. Are there funds allocated or priority allocations for our hospital in Savusavu? There will be more tourists, there will be more developments going on in infrastructure, but our hospital is in a bad state. Will you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, look into improving our hospital in Savusavu? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- I understand the question is on the hospital, I missed that one. It is very much in the plan with the honourable Minster for Health, but let me assure the learned gentlemen, Savusavu today is booming in a manner that I have not seen for many years and thank the Coalition Government. It is all set to…. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- There are many wonderful years ahead for Savusavu, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Can we have the question from honourable Bala? HON. P. K. BALA.- May I also take this time to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of this august Parliament. Can the honourable Minister clarify whether the construction of the Labasa Airport is part of the Tourism Development Programme? If yes, when is the completion time? On what basis was the contractor awarded the contract? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, work on Labasa has started. The terminal building is being enlarged right now. It is a matter of acquiring the land necessary for that, Mr. Speaker Sir. The process is in place, and we are in the hands of very professional people, people from the World Bank who are managing this and based in Savusavu, as I have indicated. So, you can be assured that the quality of the work is going to be of the highest standard, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also join my colleagues in congratulating you for your appointment as Speaker of the House. We are indeed proud of the achievements of Kabara. May I also say that for that reason, we from Verata are very elated as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you have been talking about development of airport facilities, but my question is related to seaports. The honourable Tikoduadua would be aware that few years back he visited with the team concerning the development of seaports in Vanua Levu, particularly in Savusavu, the move to get the roll-on, roll-off facility from where it is now to Balaga so that tourism can be facilitated in the current port facility where dolphins and</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2249 others are installed. So, my question to the honourable Minister is, are there considerations as well for the development of port facilities in Savusavu particularly? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to comment, what the Opposition side enjoy now was something that we were denied over the last eight years. You have been very kind to them, there are more than three questions per question. It is something that we welcome in this House. There is dialogue on that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need that has been articulated for a seaport. What we have here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, $200 million is in three phases. Its first phase will be the learning phase. What we learned from this one will determine the second phase and third phase. We want to do it carefully and properly. It is very much in the dialogue, honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. J. USAMATE.- I am glad to see that the Government is picking up on all the action work that was done by the government before it; put that land in place, the Look North Policy. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. J. USAMATE.- I am glad to see that you did not chuck everything out the door, in particular, I am interested in the cross-island road linking Labasa to Savusavu. We have the Lomolomo Slip up there. I noticed that you said that you wanted to make it more scenic. I do know what it is that is going to make it more scenic than the way it is right now. How, in particular, are you going to make this road more scenic especially the Lomolomo Slip that keeps dropping? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drive from Labasa to Savusavu these days is about one and half hours or more to two hours. We are trying to shorten the drive to make it easier for tourists to arrive through Labasa. For the reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that only Labasa Acan take the bigger aircraft – ATR 72. Savusavu cannot even accept the full load of the Badeirante and the other smaller aircrafts. So, Labasa is the entry point right now and by developing the road, you are going to make it quicker to commute between Labasa and Savusavu. On a scenic basis, there will be rest points along the way. We are aiming to make it pleasant for our tourists driving between Labasa and Savusavu, given that some of them would have travelled quite some distance to come into Nadi and then Nadi into Labasa and then Labasa to Savusavu. So, the aim is to make the drive pleasant. MR. SPEAKER.- We now move on to the next Oral Question. I am made aware that the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry is not present with us today. In such cases, the former Speaker and my predecessor, would rule that the Question be deferred to a later date when the honourable Minister is present. I will abide by that precedent and, therefore, honourable Members, Oral Question 263/2024 is deferred to a later sitting date. (Question No. 263/2024 deferred to a later date) Fiji’s Developments &amp; Plans - International Solar Alliance (Question No. 264/2024) HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, congratulations on your ascending the Office of Speaker in this august House.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>2250</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on some of the developments and plans related to Fiji’s membership on the International Solar Alliance? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members, I rise to take this opportunity to speak today about the significant role of the International Solar Alliance (ISA). I join my colleagues in congratulating you, Sir, in your appointment as the Speaker of the House. The ISA has been vigorously working with Fiji to leverage solar energy as a critical pathway for energy transformation and sustainable development, recognising the significant potential of solar power to diversify energy generation, improve energy access and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fiji formally joined the ISA by ratifying the framework agreement on 25 th October, 2017. The Ministry, as the focal Ministry for ISA, has been making substantial strides in solar energy implementation and capacity development in the last few years. One of the notable achievements has been the successful commissioning of solar projects in the healthcare sector. The ISA provided technical and financial support to develop demonstration solar projects resulting in the solarisation of health centres, each equipped with eight KWP solar installations. This initiative not only demonstrates the practical application of solar technology but also highlights the potential for improving energy infrastructure in critical public services such as health. Capacity building has also been a cornerstone for ISA’s engagement with Fiji. Through comprehensive training programmes, the ISA supported human resource development across various domains. To-date, the country has benefitted from targeted training initiatives including participants in Masters level training, Degree and also training in solar rooftop technology and solar SMEs banker’s training. These programmes are designed to build local expertise and create a sustainable ecosystem for solar and energy development and deployment. The current engagement between ISA and Fiji’s multi-faceted and forward looking, a significant progress has been a letter of co-operation between ISA and the Ministry, focusing on scaling solar rooftop projects in various facilities including schools, health centres as well as developing solar mini grid projects for rural communities. Sir, the country has also expressed keen interest in expanding solar applications particularly in agriculture, with the proposal for 27 solar pumps under the Scaling Solar Application for Agriculture Use (SSAAU) Programme and in the Water-Energy Nexus to ensure that all Fijians including those residing in the rural and maritime areas have access to clean and safe drinking water. There are numerous diesel-powered pumps and boreholes around the country, and we are working with ISA to solarise this. Sir, several promising initiatives, as I had already mentioned, including potential sites for solar mini grids, rooftop projects, floating solar projects, solar powered ferries or boats. Discussions are ongoing for implementing a solar grid at the Public Rental Board (PRB) with a tripartite agreement already shared for signing. The ISA is also providing policy and regulatory support to create an enabling environment for the private sector investment for solar energy development and deployment. Looking ahead, the ISA is planning to support Fiji in implementing innovative solar solutions including solar cold storage facilities for the solarisation of health centres under ISA and Ministry of</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2251 External Affairs (MEA) Quad Climate Initiatives. We are currently discussing feasibility of hybrid boats with solar power and expanding solarised streetlights for our roads and community areas. These efforts align with Fiji’s broad goals of improving energy security, reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable development. All key areas were discussed at the recent COP. Sir, as Fiji continues to embrace solar energy, the partnership with ISA represents a promising pathway to address energy challenges, support economic resilience and contribute to global climate action. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would just like to ask the honourable Minister, there has been continuous resistance from EFL in the private sector to contribute in the provision of solar power to their grid. In your own experience, Sir, do you feel that the resistance is hampering the provision of solar energy to provide power into the main grid? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- That is a very good question which fundamentally is the problem in Fiji relating to energy. In relation to ISA, we are not collaborating in terms of the current diagnostic study, but it is with International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). So, the study is currently in progress in terms of analysing or assessing what would be the best fit in terms of the generation, transmission and distribution of power which is currently being handled by EFL in addition to the regulatory functions. Basically, it boils down to the current regulatory and legislative setup which we have now. As you may note from the last Government Minister’s note which could be hindering the progress towards renewable energy, which is why that study is being conducted. From that, further discussions are being held with all stakeholders, we would determine what would be the right legislative and regulatory framework and structure to, not only enable renewable energy but to enhance or provide the impetus to move it forward. That study should be concluded towards the end of this year and further discussions with stakeholders in how we could move that forward as a Government, especially in the legislative and regulatory part to enhance or increase investments in renewable energy to achieve our target of 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Honourable Minister, in terms of the capacity building, I understand that ISA will have some capacity building, but it is actually tailored. Are we talking about capacity building from a Government’s perspective or is it Government, EFL and private sector in terms of capacity building? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- At the moment, that covers ISA and Government but with the initiative to establish a Solar Training Centre in Fiji, which is currently in discussion, that will also cover the non-government including small businesses that might come into the maintenance of solar equipment, et cetera, especially if it is located out in the villages and communities. Those need to be localised in terms of the capacity to repair their own, in the village setting, for example. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the commitment remains to have a carbon neutral environment in the Pacific region, the question to the honourable Minister is, what is the current percentage of renewable energy or clean energy produced by EFL? Is there or will there be a measure of carbon footprint in terms of mining the materials for solar projects and its disposal? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you wish to answer? It is rather hypothetical, in my view.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2252</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Definitely, we are moving towards the target which is 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. It sounds ambitious but it can be achieved because right now, renewable energy is around 60 percent. If we include those renewable energy proposals (there are quite a few of them here) then we could lessen the carbon footprint. Safety of Troops – UNIFIL &amp; Other Peacekeeping Missions (Question No. 265/2024) HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: With rising tensions in the Middle East, particularly Israel’s recent attack on Lebanon, can the honourable Minister for Defence and Veteran Affairs inform Parliament on what measures are being taken to ensure the safety of our troops serving in UNIFIL and other Peacekeeping Missions? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Koroilavesau for raising this critical issue concerning the safety of our troops serving in the Middle East amidst the ongoing tensions in the region. However, before I continue with the answer to that question, Sir, first of all, I join my colleagues to congratulate you on your ascend to the Speaker’s Chair of this august House. May I wish you success during your term as Speaker of the Fijian Parliament. On the same token, I would also like to congratulate coach Kolinisau, captain and the boys of the Fiji Team for delivering a sweet victory to Fiji this morning. I am sure it made all of us happy. To continue answering the honourable Koroilavesau’s question, I would just like to clarify that at the moment there is only one Fijian Officer deployed to UNIFIL, Lebanon and additionally, under the Fijian Service with United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO). Our contingents in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), they all remain unaffected by the recent escalations in the region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensuring the safety and the wellbeing of our peacekeepers is a top priority for the Coalition Government. The situation in the Middle East presents significant risks and we are closely monitoring the developments. Our troops are well prepared, they are safe, strictly adhere to Standard Operating Procedures and are supported by robust contingency plans for potential evacuation. The Ministry is in regular contact with their headquarters of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. The joint taskforce commander at Blackrock looks after our peacekeeping troops that are deployed out in the Middle East and throughout the world. Also, with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations in New York (DPKO) to ensure effective coordination and support for our peacekeepers at this time. We are also consulting with some governments including the United Arab Emirates on temporarily stationing RFMF troops and equipment in their territory which would enhance our readiness. Additionally, we are working with development partners to explore options for strategic air support, if needed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government remains committed to safeguarding our peacekeepers and Fijians residing in the Middle East. We are receiving situation reports daily and we keep our stakeholders informed. We are prepared to respond swiftly to any emerging challenges. I would just like to also inform, Mr. Speaker, that the honourable Prime Minister recently had given directions to Government that the Fijian Government will work with the United Nations in as</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2253 far as the safety of our troops is concerned. So, we align ourselves to the UN and then we work with them in looking after the safety of our troops. As part of this commitment also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are expecting Government delegations to visit the Middle East in the early 2025, and this will allow us to assess their conditions, reinforcement, contingency measures and personally convey the appreciation in support of the Fijian people for the work that they are doing for us. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question for the honourable Minister. When it comes to safety, are you satisfied with the equipment that the troops are issued with, particularly, protection vehicles? We know that the bushmaster is aging, so are there plans to get in additional protection vehicles as well, because this is so important for the safety or our troops? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition is absolutely right. I would like to assure you, again, and this august House and the Fijian people, that the safety of our troops remains our top priority. Every soldier or officer whom we deploy in the Middle East or any part of the world, we would like to see them come back. So, post protection measures are an important and integral part of the RFMF, and the Government would like to do that. In addition to that, last year, the honourable Prime Minister took receipt of 14 bushmasters that are now in Nadi. We are working on plans to send, at least, seven of those to the mission area, to UNDOF in particular. However, we are hindered at the moment because there is only a limited number of vehicles that the UN will allow, a number that is allowable by both, the Syrian side and Israeli side in the demarcated area. So, that is something we are working on. Ultimately, at the end of the day, that is the ideal thing to do. I know we had bushmasters because we were trying to get hold of the Force Mobile Reserve for UNDOF. Unfortunately, that has slipped through, so these bushmasters are primarily there for the protection of our troops, and for supporting our Fijian troops within the locations that they are deployed. Hopefully, at some point, we will be able to have all of our troops on peacekeeping out there, or the numbered personal carriers or some kind of armoured protection. Building Permit Applications System (Question No. 266/2024) HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the work undertaken by the Ministry on the Building Permit Application System and how it will contribute to order and efficiency of the building development process in Fiji? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to response to the question raised by the honourable Member and I thank him for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I table my response this afternoon, I also would like to join you to also congratulate our winnings Sevens Team that won in Dubai this morning. I also stand proud in this august Parliament to share that the first player who scored the try hails from my Province of Namosi and is also named as player of the final. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the building and construction sector serves as a vital pillar of our economy, reflecting the level of investments, job creation and economic activity. The vibrant and dynamic</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>2254</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 construction industry is a clear indicator of our nation’s path of growth and development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from January 2023 to November 2024, the Ministry has received a total of 2,186 building permit applications valued collectively at $1.16 billion. Notably, 25 percent of these applications are for commercial, industrial and tourism-related projects. These are sectors that play a transformative role in Fiji’s economic diversification and resilience. This upward trajectory is a testament to the growing accommodation in Fiji’s economy. Also underscored is the need for the Government to deliver efficient and effective services to ensure that these investments translate into real outcomes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Coalition Government recognises that innovation terminology are key to meeting the evolving needs of our citizens and investors. By leveraging modern systems and streamlining our processes, we aim to create a building permit application system that is not only more efficient but also fosters greater transparency and accountability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that the Ministry of Local Government, in line with the Government’s digital transformation agenda, is working very closely with the Ministry of Trade, Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications through the consultations to develop the Building Permit Approval System (BPAS). This system is a crucial component of the project business now in Fiji, aligning with its goal of streamlining business processes and fostering economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the BPAS’s portal aims to revolutionize the building permit approvals process in Fiji. By digitising the entire workflow, we aim to reduce bureaucratic delays associated with manual processing, increase transparency and compliance and, most of all, enhance efficiency in our service delivery by significantly reducing turnaround processing times. Mr. Speaker, Sir, significant progress has been made in the development of the BPAS portal. From requirements approval and referral agencies to work on the process of harmonising all requirements of key agencies into one checklist. Currently, the Ministry is piloting a very important component of the BPAS portal whereby all building applications that had been lodged at all Municipal Councils are being tracked electronically with real time updates being shared between the Municipal Councils and the Department of Town and Country Planning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, effective from 1 st September, 2024, all Municipal Councils adopted a unified tracking system, accompanied by an Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for assessing and processing building applications. Additionally, a standardised checklist for receiving applications was implemented across all Councils to ensure consistency and transparency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process for building permit applications follows a structured approach. Applications are first vetted by all Municipal Councils to ensure compliance with local zonings and other planning regulations. Once overall requirements are met, applications are then forwarded to the Department of Town &amp; Country Planning for compliance search with National Planning Standards and Building Codes. The two applications are then returned to Councils which then release the building applications back to the applicants. Through this tracking system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Town &amp; Country Planning and Municipal Councils can now provide regular updates to consultants and applicants on the status of their building applications, enhancing communication and accountability.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2255 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear timelines for processing building permit applications. As of now, with the normal processes, Councils must process applications within 14 days and submit to the Department of Town &amp; Country Planning, where the Department of Town &amp; Country Planning then processes applications within 20 working days from the date of lodgement and, that is, provided all requirements are met. Rezoning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, takes 45 working days to complete processing of applications, whereas a subdivision takes approximately 30 working days. This timeline reflects significant improvements in efficiency given by the streamlining of processes and introduction of the standardised procedure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the thorough checks conducted at both levels, that is, the Council as well as Department of Town &amp; Country Planning, are very important to ensure that proposed developments comply with legal and technical standards. This includes, as alluded earlier, on the checking of zoning, plot boundary setbacks and alignment with municipal regulations by the Municipal Councils, while the notification of compliance with national planning frameworks, compliance with the Town Planning Act and general provisions, and environmental consideration is done by the Town &amp; Country Planning Team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of a digitised tracking system, along with the SOPs and standardisation, has resulted in measurable improvements in application processing times. For instance, the building and development control applications are now processed within one month. The proportion of subdivision applications processed within one month has increased from 22 percent in 2022 to 31.4 percent in 2024. Collectively, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 67.3 percent of subdivision applications were processed within three months in 2024, compared to 62.7 percent in 2023, and rezoning applications processed within one month also increased from 63.4 percent in 2023 to 64.4 percent in 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these incremental improvements in the manual processes lay a strong foundation for even greater efficiency and transformative change once the online system is fully operationalised. We also anticipate the timeline between Councils and Town &amp; Country Planning to reduce to 21 days. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a need to amend the legislative requirements, the amendments of the Town &amp; Country Planning Act to align with the evolving landscape of digital technology and streamline processes required under this new system. The Ministry is also going to review some of the schedules, as well as to ensure that when the system comes into effect, it is going to work for both, Municipal as well as the Town &amp; Country Planning Team. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry remains steadfast in its commitment to modernise the building permit approval process. The development of the new system will aim to streamline procedures, reduce delays in the processing of the applications and enhance transparency. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, through you, honourable Minister, I understand this will go online shortly. In terms of the necessary infrastructure with all the Councils that require this to fulfil what you are actually trying to do in terms of digitisation, is the Ministry itself digitised enough and together with the authorities that are tied into it, will they be fully digitised by the time this actually goes online?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.</p><p>It is a very important question because with any new system that we are going to use, we must make</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>2256</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 sure that we have the necessary infrastructure to support the system. It is something we are also working with the Ministry of Trade, through their consultants, to assist us in identifying some of the key areas, especially when there is a need to review and amend the infrastructure that are required to support the system. That is something that we are also going to take into account and that will also be discussed at all levels, that is, the Municipal levels, as well as within the Ministry itself or the Government itself, to ensure that when the system is taken on board, it is going to work for the purpose that it is being created for. HON. F. S. KOYA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, just quickly, honourable Minister, in terms of the legality of it, will you also be required to change some of the regulations and laws to facilitate all of these and how fast will that be done, or is that already with the Office of the Attorney-General? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have also mentioned in my response that some legislations and other aspects of the legislative requirements for the Town Planning Act needs to be amended and that is something that the team is closely working on right now. We should review to ensure that before we actually have the system on board, the legislation is there to support this new system. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- A quick question to the honourable Minister and this is based on observations as former Minister for Disaster. We have very good systems and processes, but there are still those that do work behind the regulations that are set, and this is particularly concerning municipalities outside Suva. There were a lot of projects undertaken without meeting the minimum standards. You have talked about thorough checking and monitoring. How is capacity in the smaller Councils and what is the Ministry going to do to address such issues, particularly in the absence of monitoring such projects, whether its Clerk of Works, because this is an issue, honourable Minister, and I wish to bring it to your attention. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition is really a very good one because it is something that is also experienced at the municipal level in terms of monitoring some of the developments and some of the projects that are happening at the local government level. For some of the Councils, they have also Town Planners and Engineers that do go around and monitor the projects that they have at the local government level. We are also going to improve our monitoring system whereby we are also going to have officers stationed in places and assist the various municipalities in some of the projects that they monitor. Projects are also being monitored at our level as well as those that are at the municipality level. MR. SPEAKER.- Now, we are at the situation whereby for the purpose of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p></body>
