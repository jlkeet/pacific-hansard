<body><h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3><h4>POINT OF ORDER</h4><p>Misconduct â€“ Hon. C. J. Singh HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, a Point of Order under Standing Order 7, whereby a Member takes an oath, but Mr. Speaker allow me, before I talk on the Point of Order, I would like to welcome you Sir to this august House and congratulate you on your appointment as the Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this honourable Member concerned, took an oath that he would be faithful and would bear true allegiance to the Republic of Fiji. He also promised that he will defend the rights of the people and will act with integrity, and diligently carry out his responsibility. Mr. Speaker, honourable Charan Jeath Singh has shown in this august House that he is not practising the oath he has taken. He has also shown that he is not worthy at national level and his recent actions and Facebook post has brought great humiliation to the nation and towards our hardworking civil servants. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, while our civil servants were working tirelessly without adequate sleep, honourable Charan Jeath Singh might have been in a drunk state posting rubbish on his Facebook page from his luxury hotel room because we were reliably informed Mr. Speaker that 99 percent of the time, he was missing from meeting venues. The highest level of hypocrisy was when honourable Charan J. Singh himself was missing from most of the meeting and blaming others on his Facebook page. I urge the honourable Prime Minister to suspend him from all future overseas travel because he is not only bringing shame to himself, but to the nation at large. His integrity is in question, he is not working diligently and removing his Facebook posts testifies that his action was wrong and unwarranted. Therefore, we demand honourable Charan Jeath Singh to seek both verbal and written public apology in this august House to all hardworking civil servants and the nation. Mr. Speaker, we should also consider stripping him from his ministerial portfolio. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to respond to the Point of Order that is being raised by the honourable Member. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Member being discussed is not in the House today and the honourable Member should know better so that he can have an opportunity to respond. I ask the honourable Member to withdraw his Point of Order so that honourable Charan Jeath Singh is present in the House to be able to respond and that would be fair. The honourable Member should know better. Mr. Speaker, he has also made allegations that are offensive and that is against Standing Order 62(4). He has made allegations that have not been substantiated and without the opportunity of the honourable Member to respond in the House. I ask him to work with his Whip and Caucus to ensure that the honourable Member is in the House to be able to respond.</p><h4>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents</h4><p>2 nd December, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Natural justice demands that the honourable Member who has been identified is here to respond to the allegations and accusations that have been made. He is not present in here and I will rule that this question or Point of Order is out of order, until such time as the honourable Member is here, you may then raise the issue that you have raised this morning.</p></body>
