<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 2023 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 2023 ANNUAL REPORT HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit Annual Report for 2023, which was tabled on 2nd October 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I know this is the last report that we debating on this afternoon, but this is the most recent up to-date report. This is the 2023 Report from the Fiji Financial</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2297 Intelligence Unit (FIU) and we thank them for being very timely with their annual report. The FIU was established under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004. In 2005, the responsibility of the line Minister, then the line Minister was the Minister for Justice, was delegated to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. The Unit is fully funded by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) and it is also co-located with the RBF. The Unit has a total permanent staff of nine hardworking staff, and they basically perform two roles: (1) An intelligence role, where FIU is required to refer financial intelligence to its law enforcement partners for investigation and prosecution of serious financial crimes and this includes proactive dissemination as well as dissemination based on requests from law enforcement partners. (2) Regulatory Role, where they ensure that the financial institutions in Fiji have strong internal systems and controls to mitigate the risks of their services and products being misused by criminals and their associates for money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious financial crimes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two recommendations that we have in the Report that I hope the line Ministry and the RBF will look into: (1) That the delegated responsibility from the Minister of Justice then, I think now he is under the Attorney-General, but that responsibility was delegated way back in 2005, to the Governor of the RBF. The Unit is fully funded by the RBF and our recommendation is for the line Ministry to look at the delegated authority and to assure themselves that it still works, perhaps bring it up and do it where it is now current instead of, it is so many years old since 2005. (2) The recommendation for the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004 to be reviewed. In our discussions with the staff at FIU, they mentioned that when the Act was written in 2004, it was really shaped and flavoured by the best international practices then when it comes to anti-money laundering. They mentioned that there is a lot of progress in that area now, a lot of development and there is a need for the Act to be reviewed so that we can factor in the new best practices when it comes to anti-money laundering that happens. Those are some things that we found out when we were scheming through the Act. Section 23(2), I think, it says that the remuneration for the Director is set by the Minister responsible for Finance. This was an amendment made in 2016, and I think it is worth looking at also whether that is okay, whether it is ensures transparency and accountability, if you like, the independence of this unit, it needs to be independent and perhaps in the review of the Act, that issue also can be looked at. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I would just like to congratulate our sevens team for their victory and I have also been following the Autumn Nations Series for our 15s team. Their match with Ireland was controversial and questionable with the calls from the referee, but the Fiji team is only getting better and better in winning the World Cup in time to come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once found in isolation due to geographical barriers, miles away from its Exclusive Economic Zone, the Pacific nations are now subject to exploitation with the growing influence of transnational crimes that transcends borders, cultures and social structure, imposing substantial health and economic costs, especially for our younger generation.</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>2298 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2 nd December, 2024 The FIU works closely with various financial institutions including banks, insurance companies, money remitters, real estate agents in compliance with the Financial Transactions Reporting Act. The implications of illicit financial flow are severe from small to low income nations. The FIU is a member of the Egmont Group, with a network of 177 other FIUs and they securely exchange expertise and financial intelligence to combat money laundering and tourist financing. As at 2023, FIU had 30 million financial transaction reports and the key recipients are the Fiji Police Force, FRCS and FICAC. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the related crimes associated with money laundering are cybercrimes, funding terrorism, exploitation of children, child pornography and human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us break down these crimes and let us focus on them one by one. I will not be able to cover all of them but a few that are worth listening to. Sir, 1,700 cases were reported by citizens being impacted by deceptive pyramid scheme known as the eBAY Shop Online Recruitment. The Fiji Police M-PAiSA Taskforce has been on the go and people are being charged and a caution to the general public, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not to share their OTP code, passwords and PINs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently there were consignments containing apparatuses that were seized that could be used for possible Palestine laboratories, which is the manufacturer of illicit drugs, but as stated in the Illicit Drugs Control Act 2004, Schedule 3(2) and I quote: “Controlled equipment such as encapsulating machines, rotary evaporators, laboratory equipment with capacity for large production are all controlled items.” Speaking of medications, Mr. Speaker, Sir, cases of pseudoephedrine, needles and syringe abuse has been reported. I would just like to remind the honourable Minister for Finance that the hospitals are running short of medications. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji faces a silent drug epidemic tobacco, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine, cannabis has penetrated into the DNA of our society. This is further exacerbated by limited access to mental health services, expertise, resources and facilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently I was one of the panellists at the Speaker’s Debate and a question came by, “Oh, nothing was done in the last 16 years.” I never had the chance to respond to this particular person but to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, large quantities of cannabis and cocaine were seized in 2018 and large quantities of methamphetamine in 2020. But as for 2023 and 2024, the number of drug related cases has tripled - 132 arrests, 4.8 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized. A few more recent data, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Substance Abuse Advisory Council noted that there were over 3,000-plus drug related cases involving our school children and we question the trainings, counselling and protection programmes, if they were effective by this Council. Recently, just yesterday in the news, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a 14-year-old girl was found walking along the road in school uniform with visible needle marks and when officers questioned her, she revealed that she went to a party, ended up in a place where some boys sexually abused her and injected her with methamphetamine. Sir, 39 percent of 90,000 students dropped out between years 8 and 12 and the school dropouts have reached over 5,000. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to remind the honourable Minister for Finance when he spoke about the education aspect, yes teacher resignation is high, delay in disbursement of grants to schools and schools focusing on fundraising, the Ministry is not providing teacher replacements, RSL drivers are not paid and bus services are not provided in certain areas like Vuda, Saweni.</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2299 Mr. Speaker, Sir, certain businesses and investments needs to be invested who exploit the loopholes in our laws, legislations and policies and meet millions of black money and converted into white. A multifaceted approach, co-operation, awareness and capacity building needs to be adopted in society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn my attention to the Exclusive Economic Zones that we have. As a reason, we need to foster international co-operation with ongoing monitoring and adaptation strategies across the region. Treaty participation among Pacific Island nations will strengthen our approach to combat drugs, drug trafficking, money laundering in our Exclusive Economic Zones and areas beyond our national jurisdiction. I would like to mention that the BBNJ Treaty and the goal is to sustainably managed 100 percent of our Exclusive Economic Zone by 2030 and our protected areas. Then we have the Budapest Convention as well. It shows Fiji’s commitment to ensure that people and communities are safe online and that our law enforcement and prosecution authorities have the necessary tools and networks to rapidly investigate and successfully prosecute cyber criminals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also need to look at data protection and safe browsing. We need to monitor, restrict networks and ban some of the applications, and people giving threats to each over social media need to be taken in and charged. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to strengthen governance and rule of law, implementation of effective legal frameworks, and harsh sentencing for anyone who gets into these matters. We need to equip our law enforcement, healthcare and rehabilitation centres with resources and necessary expertise. We need to conduct trainings with the authorities who are dealing with such matters, and police safety remains paramount. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, I support the findings of the Standing Committee. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Naupoto for the motion and the points he raised. It makes a lot of sense and If I can go straight onto that, the delegated responsibility from the Minister for Justice to the Governor of the RBF which has been in place since 2005, in my view should be reassessed and honourable Naupoto made a point which is entirely correct. The Financial Transactions Reporting (FTR) Act should be reviewed also and updated to ensure that it is aligned with the current international standards of Anti-Money Laundering. All entities Mr. Speaker, Sir, must co-operate with FIU and provide feedback in a timely manner and appointment of a substantive Director of FIU in a timely manner will be important. Just to look at some of the 2023 highlights, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The FIU received a total of $5,242,280 financial transactions and other reports which were used to develop intelligence products. They analysed 367 suspicious transactions reports. For a small country like ours, these numbers are big, they issued about 429 intelligence reports to law enforcement agencies and conducted credibility checks on 141 individuals and 70 entities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is still on the EU blacklist, we are working very hard on that. We are also part of a regional project on correspondence banking relationship and Fiji has contributed towards that project. It is the first regional project funded by the World Bank which was approved within a year and is now being implemented by the Forum Secretariat. Part of the consensus with respect to correspondence banking relationship is also with respect to putting in processes and</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>2300 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2 nd December, 2024 mechanisms to deal with AML issues and I know that FIU engaged with 180 AML compliance offices of financial institutions. They are also providing training and awareness to 31 employees of financial institutions and FIU also manages a database containing around 30 million financial transactions, but, as honourable Naupoto stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very clearly, there is a need to review the Act and look at how we can work with different agencies to improve and combat some of those undesirable transactions and money laundering that happens. We are also going to announce very soon steps taken by FRCS in terms of how we can work with different agencies, and we will be announcing certain steps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of FRCS activities and mechanisms that they will put in place and work with different agencies to also support, not only tax compliance but also provide a linkage with different institutions. Sometimes, they may be looking at $3 million or $4 million transactions but what is the value of looking at all those, how is it analysed, in what sort of timeline is it done, what is the communication processes, and how effective the use of that data can be made in real time to deal with some of these issues. I think this is an important institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FIU has an intelligent function and also a regulatory function, so it goes together. The important part is the intelligence, but linked to it is also the regulatory part and when both work together or when both are efficient, both are communicated, both those functions are talking to each other, as well as talking to other institutions, then we will be able to deal with some of the, at the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we think that looking at the Act or looking at the mechanisms, and how it can also work with other institutions is something that is important and we will do that. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all let me just thank the Chairperson and the Standing Committee members for this particular Report. I think it is actually quite an important one, although it is the last one in the day that we are actually doing, but within the recommendation I think pretty much everything has been covered by the earlier speakers. But there is one particular one that stands out most of all, it is something that is really the crux of the whole of FIU and that is the Financial Transaction Reporting Act which the report says, needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure that it aligns with current international standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Act came into force in 2004, so we are looking at some 20 years ago. The digital landscape around the world has actually changed, so I would urge the honourable Attorney-General to look at this post haste Sir, and make sure that we align ourselves properly and there are many things that are attached to institutions like FIU and FICAC, et cetera, agreements that we have signed and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Prasad actually just mentioned something about Europe and us being blacklisted, that is something that we have been fighting for, for the last twelve years to get off that black list. One of the reasons why they do it is because they consider us a non-compliant tax jurisdiction amongst all these other things. It is something that Fiji has to fight for and what it does, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it affects our trade with these particular regions, it affects our investment from that particular region. I will give you a classic example, if we were to tender out somebody to do our roads and a French company wanted to do it, they would not come because we are considered a non-compliant tax jurisdiction, and these are things that need to be right. As you would know better than anyone else, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the law is the machinery that actually will allow the FIU to be at the top of its game. I am not saying they have done a bad job, I know there are tremendous amounts of transactions that they actually go through, they store about 50 million bits of information, and if you look at it, there are only nine staff there. Now, that also</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2301 needs to be looked at to say, “do we have enough sufficient staff within FIU to be able to deal with all that they do?” Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the main crux of what the Report actually said. But we also need to be mindful that we are compliant, and I think it is really good that Fiji is actually a member of Egmont Group of FIUs where we get guidance from this and it is a network of about 177 FIUs and actually provides a platform for secure information sharing with respect to financial intelligence. These are the tools that are needed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. I know from the details given in the Report, that 30 million financial reports are actually held by FIU, and they receive about five million reports as they say from its reporting entities. If you look at the reporting entities you got a whole host of entities that report back to FIU, but there is one glaring omission and a last one on it, it said “iTLTB is one of the agency that the MOU is actually signed here” but of the iTLTB is there why is the Ministry of Lands there not there? They are also a custodian of land. These are things that we need to look at quickly to find out where they are glaring omissions, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Again, we also need to be mindful that this Act came about in 2004 and then we have the Constitution and within the Constitution, Section 24, with rights to privacy and rights to confidential information being sharing, so it would be as a matter of urgency that the honourable Attorney-General would need to look at the review of this. I know that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has been actively working on this digital space et cetera. This is an Act that needs to be aligned with what he is doing at the moment. If we are getting into the right digital space, we must make sure we have the right laws, it also helps the Courts in dealing with what may end up as crime. We must remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that financial crimes do not have borders, if we do not have the right material for these institutions to be able to prosecute or do what it is they have to do, we are failing badly, and we will be looked at because of our commitments made with agreements et cetera that we signed overseas in a different fashion. So, in order to be up there with the best, the only thing I can say, I commend the Standing Committee for the Report. I will be very short, Sir, and I urge the honourable Attorney-General to look at the Act and see if it can be done, swiftly so that we are online with the rest of the world. I know that Australia and you would know this also, Sir, that Australia has just recently repealed its financial transactions reporting and come up with the new one. So, there are development partners that could assist with all of these. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all I have to contribute, I know it is late in the day, but I commend the Standing Committee for the Report and I acknowledge all the work that they have done, and I hope that the honourable Attorney-General is actually listening too, so that something can be done about it. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit Annual Report 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I commend the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for the very comprehensive Report. I acknowledge that FIU has voluntary submitted the Annual Report which is highly encouraging. I would also like to commend the FIU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the work carried out during the year 2023 and as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics had indicated that five</p><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>2302 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2 nd December, 2024 million reports were received from each reporting entities. So, in fact, we can see the work, we can see the result and we can see how important the work that FIU has carried out in our financial institutions. They have been supporting a number of agencies, government agencies. They have been supporting banks. They have been supporting individual consumers whenever they have faced these kinds of problems, and it is this agency who is able to come forward with the Report and facilitate the action that needs to be undertaken. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they also work hand in hand with the Anti-Money Laundering Unit Council which consists of the Solicitor General, the Office of the DPP, FICAC and also, FRCS. Therefore, I would encourage that this particular institution to be given very important recognition in terms of the findings and the recommendations made by the Standing Committee particularly on the need that has already been elaborated by honourable Koya and honourable Deputy Prime Minister Professor Prasad, there is a need to review a particular law which is the Financial Transactions Reporting Act and I would encourage the Government to seriously look into this recommendation for the review of this particular Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Financial Transaction Reporting Act a number of institutions, organisations and professions actually got caught under that. So, things like real estate agents, lawyers, accountants and various other professionals actually had to have their accounts audited and indeed submit an account to ensure that they comply with the law. That is really a genius of that and it propelled in fact and enter segment within their financial system to ensure or trace the money that comes into the country and indeed went out of our country. Also to ensure collaboration between the different countries to stop terrorism financing and of course the net enlarge also to stop things like cleaning of money, or what we called money laundering. I understand that all of us have known the importance of what I have stated this evening. It is also a warning to the members of the public, not forgetting the Members of Parliament as well, the importance of reporting our financial transactions to the relevant stakeholders if it is a need to be reported, Sir, otherwise it will be an unexplained wealth, and we are all accountable for that. So, what has actually happened over the past number of years in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen that the type of intelligence too have changed. These people who are dealing with this kind of offenders are getting smarter day by day. Even online and other sectors of our economy, people are trapped in this kind of crimes and there is really a need for the laws to be changed to suit the circumstances that we are in. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I commend the work of the Committee, and I support the Bill before Parliament. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to contribute very briefly to the Report on the FIU for the year 2023. At the risk of repeating a lot of what has been said before, I will just keep my comments very brief. But essentially the FIU as we all know is a fundamental agency when it comes to the credibility and integrity of our financial system. A dysfunctional or under resourced FIU, places a lot of risk on the economy’s integrity. One of the first things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I looked at the Report, was for 5 million transactions there is only 18 eyeballs looking at those transactions which seems quite woefully inadequate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members in this Chamber who contributed in this Report, we support the need to perhaps relook at the resourcing and ensure that the FIU is adequately resourced to do its functions.</p><div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2303 The other thing, Sir, that struck me was, there was a question posed by the Committee to the FIU saying whether there was a correlation between detected illegal activity and the drug fines. The answer was no. I find that a bit hard to actually believe, because it just does not gel. Given the substantial level of drugs that we are aware of that is happening in the country, you would have thought that that would have been picked up in some of the unusual reports. Perhaps just something to think about and when the Act is being reviewed that we look at supporting this very important Unit. As I mentioned, the whole credibility of our financial system hangs on how this agency performs. The final comments, I just thought I would like to make is, one, the honourable Rinesh Sharma mentioned the advent of scams and how that is impacting a lot of them. I can say proudly that the Government has been actively involved in trying to address the scams and manage it better. One of the first things that we all realised was, virtually all the legislations of all the agencies are outdated, whether it be the Online Service Commission, whether it be all the agencies. Secondly, a lot of the legislation really do not have teeth. To give you an example, when a scam is identified, no agency can do anything until someone goes and reports it to the police. At the moment, as part of the taskforce on scams, there is an active process going on now to review all the relevant legislations and try and amend all of them to fall in line with the international best practice so that going forward, the legislation can have teeth and we can be more punitive in terms of how we deal with scams and even money laundering, if required. I do also support the revision of the Act because it is very important, as I said, one of the most important agencies of Government in terms of holding us together in terms of financial integrity, it is important that we bring the Act up to-date and ensure that it does follow best practice as mentioned by all contributors to this debate. Finally, in terms of the Ministry of Trade, we have been working closely as well with the FIU under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), in terms of trying to prevent money laundering, improving transparency and promoting cooperation amongst the IPEF partners. We view that it is important that we try and engage with FIU because it ensures that the economy maintains a high level of integrity and we try and encourage and foster a corrupt-free environment that benefits all sectors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few comments, I again congratulate the Committee on the Report and fully support the findings that have been made. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just add two points. First, during the reporting period, the first Director, Mr. Razim Buksh, retired. He held that position since its inception in 2006, retired in 2023 and we thank him for his services and dedication in helping shape the Unit as it is today, and we wish him well in his retirement. Despite the need for the review as we mentioned, the FIU has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the phase of evolving financial crime trends and increased demands for financial intelligence and we thank them for that. They are continuing to enhance their capabilities in ensuring a robust monitoring and reporting and as mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, yes, they certainly are ensuring the integrity of the financial system, and we wish them well in their work. With those words Sir, I commend this motion to the House. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will vote to note the content of the Report. Question put.</p><div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div><p>2304 Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report 2 nd December, 2024 Motion agreed to. Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of today’s sitting. It has been a long day for me as an alien in this environment. Today was baptism by fire. Before we adjourn for the day, I wish to convey to all the honourable Members my deepest sincere appreciation of your congratulations and well wishes on my assumption of this office. As I have said in my speech on 12 th November and reminded by honourable Koya this morning, the position is laden with deep responsibilities, but at the end, it ensures that this Parliament will remain or be a model for democracy in action. I am encouraged by the assurances of everyone that you will work with me in ensuring that this Parliament remains a bastion for order, justice, civility and need I remind you, decorum during the term of my Speaker of this Parliament. I thank you all for your contributions, rest well tonight. Parliament stands adjourned until Tuesday, 3 rd December, 2024 at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 8.13 p.m.</p><div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div><p>i.</p></body>
