<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF WOMEN,CHILDREN AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION 2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF WOMEN, CHILDREN AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION 2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 1 st October, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation is a Government Ministry in Fiji responsible for overseeing the well-being of women, children, elderly and the disabled in Fiji. For the period under review, the Ministry encountered significant challenges confronted by the COVID-19 pandemic and it maintained the services provided to older people and those vulnerable were met during the pandemic. The Committee, in its deliberations, identified other important matters: (1) (2) (3) the increasing number of street kids and the Ministry’s challenges in combating the issue due to budget constraints and lack of rehabilitation centres; some existing policies were outdated and required updates to meet the changing needs of recipients; and the REACH Programme was found to be valuable as multi-stakeholders can take their services to the underprivileged in most remote and maritime areas. In conclusion, Sir, the Committee recommends that the Ministry, in its effort, during the pandemic ensured that the vulnerable were well cared for. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list that had been agreed to by the Whips and reminding that each speaker is accorded with 10 minutes only in their intervention. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of issues have been raised in this Report and I commend the Committee for coming up with some very realistic recommendations. Sir, one such issue is the increasing number of street kids and the challenges faced by the Ministry in combating this. In 2023, data on child neglect, physical and sexual abuse was released last month. According to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection,50 percent of child neglect, physical and sexual abuses were immediate family members and 73 percent of the perpetrators of child neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse in 2023 were known to the child victims. This is very shocking. Our young generation must be provided with a safe and secure environment for the well-being and healthy growth.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>2278 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 In all these, education is very important and must be pursued with vigour. Family values, systems to be enhanced through spirituality and religious classes in schools and counselling services to be re-introduced in all schools for pronged action. We have huge challenges ahead of us and our concerted effort is needed, if we are to save our children from the unfolding chaos. Mr. Speaker, Sir, more Fijian children are being caught in criminal activities. In the past five years, Police recorded an alarming 503 cases where juveniles were sexual offenders and out of the 503 cases, 206 were rapes. The Fiji Police Force is concerned over the shifting of age criminal responsibility from 10 to 14 years. While the shift in criminal age group has been happening internationally, it has implications on the Fiji Police Force and the safety of the people of Fiji. While advocates also shift to the need for a more human approach to juvenile justice, it colludes the potential and adverse effect on policy, on operation and investigation of prosecutions, community safety and juvenile accountability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there would an increased risk of serious offences, resulting in a lack of accountability for children from the ages of 10 years to 13 years, allowing them to engage in serious offences without facing immediate legal consequences, allowing them to be more fearless. In terms of public safety, a constructive deterrent is essential to prevent ongoing criminality among young Fijian offenders. By raising the age of criminal responsibility, we risk disempowering families and communities that play vital roles in rearing children towards fair choices and fostering positive behaviour. Collaboration between families, the vanua, Government and stakeholders is needed to safeguard Fijian children. Any change must have accountability and rehabilitation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue raised in the Report is the relocation of the Lautoka Golden Age Home due to structural concerns, with a new site identified for the residents while their current home is being rebuilt. The Committee noted that the site identified is not suitable for the relocation of our elderly citizens as it is too close to the road. I request the Ministry to take this recommendation seriously and consider the relocation of senior citizens from Natabua Golden Age Home as a matter of urgency, to ensure the residents are in a safer and more conducive environment. With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that these Annual Reports are about five years to six years old, from 2019 to 2021, so in going through the recommendations by the Committee, I will briefly address what the Ministry is doing. There are two recommendations that relate to street kids that have been raised by honourable Virendra Lal. One is to do with working with stakeholders to help assist our street kids, as well as setting up of rehabilitation centres for street kids. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question to respond to on Wednesday on the very same issue, so I will elaborate more there. But just for today, suffice to say that in working with Civil Society Organisations in groups that are interested in rehabilitating street children, we have Inspire Pacific that is working with the Ministry and have just completed a four-week camp with 15 street boys. They are currently undergoing assessment in terms of where to be placed next. There are 13 year olds and 14 year olds, who appropriately would return to school and because some fear of returning home, they are exploring boarding schools instead. For those who are older, they have income generating courses available to them, like TVET as well as Polytech. We work with Inspire Pacific as well as the Salvation Army.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2279 I want to commend the Salvation Army for opening up a centre for street children in Samabula. They are working with the Ministry in terms of providing support, as well as the technical support and advice from UNICEF in terms of ensuring that these children receive holistic care so they can be reintegrated back, not just into schools, as well as their own families. So, the families have been attending these camps as well. I am talking about fathers, mothers and caregivers, who have an opportunity to reconcile with these boys. There have been very emotional moments as father and son reunite after the child has left home for various reasons. Parents are actually also given necessary support to be better parents, and to be able to bring their child who has left the home for some time to return home. Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly on the Child Justice Bill 2024 and Child Care Protection Bill 2024 which was recommended to be expedited and tabled in Parliament, yes, it has been 12 years in the making. Sir, 12 years is too long, so I have been given the assurance by the Standing Committee on Justice Law and Human Rights that these Bills will be tabled this week for debate and, hopefully, passed. There was unanimous support in the House for these Bills, and we appreciate your support on that. Honourable Lal has brought up the issue about raising the age of criminal responsibility. This is in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child but really, the sole or main purpose of it is to divert our children away from the criminal justice system and to be rehabilitated because statistics prove that children who enter the system as juveniles in the criminal justice system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they return as repeat offenders. So, in order to avoid that, we need to intervene when they are younger and know between the ages of 10 years and 13 years, it does not mean that they are excused of the crime, this means that there is a better way to process these children or to handle these children away from the criminal justice system. You will still have some element of retribution, as well as deterrence to other children, so it is not completely absolving them of responsibility, it is just the programme that will help them to understand their choices as well as to rehabilitate not to reoffend in the future. On the issue about budgetary allocation for the Ministry to be increased for Social Protection Programmes, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance will address that, so I will leave that to him. Lastly, on the relocation of the senior citizens to Golden Age Home in Lautoka and I know this has been an issue raised over and over again in Parliament. As I had mentioned earlier about the falling out or the fact that the agreement with the Methodist Church of Fiji have been reneged on because they would like to use it for other purposes. So, we have identified Matanakilagi House with Ba Provincial Holdings. Now, we have had a scoping done by Divisional Engineer Western at an estimated cost of $350,000 and that was allocated in the current budget. However, they have come back to us after the scoping, Mr. Speaker, and have stated that increased salaries as well as rise in goods and services, that this will increase exponentially by 70 percent by really a big amount. So, it is closer to $580,000 which is not budgeted for. So, we went back to the drawing board and negotiated with Ba Provincial Holdings, who have come back to us and are willing to do the renovations themselves at the cost of $254,000 which is within our budget. At the moment, we have just submitted our waiver to the Ministry of Finance in terms of the application of those funds. So, hopefully, we will get that approval so we can commence the work from January next year.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>2280 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have signed a rental agreement with Ba Holdings from May and they have also agreed to waive the rental from May till we are able to move in. Once we move in, then they will start charging the rent. So, I want to thank Ba Holdings for their assistance in prioritising our aged citizens. On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to end in terms of the REACH Project. As you know, it was funded by UNDP for the first three years, so UNDP has ended their funding. So, it is upon Government to fund this project as you know it is the REACH project that usually involves Ministries. So, Ministries would send out their teams under the REACH Project to reach the unreachable and take out government services and information on it. Because we are a bit tight on funds within the Ministry, we cannot be funding the entire REACH project, so we are just kindly asking our Ministries who wish to participate, our staff would do the logistics and arrangements but if Ministries could, please, fund your own staff who joined us on the REACH projects so you can take your services out too, to this very effective project that has reached out to many, many parts of Fiji that are unreachable. On that note, Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the Report of the Committee, and I thank them for their hard work. HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I am congratulating you on your appointment as the Speaker of this august Chambers. May Lord continue to guide your intellect in presiding over the legislative matters of the State. Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, I rise to elaborate on the Review Report of Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation for the years 2019–2020 and 2020–2021. This review was undertaken by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs into the efforts and challenges of the Ministry during those years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it unpresented challenges that largely impacted the operations of this Ministry. In spite of these challenges, the Ministry proved to be resilient in its own operations by adapting its services to assist people in lockdown areas. This adaptability is testimony to the Ministry’s commitment towards the service of our most vulnerable citizens. Among the gripping concerns which have been reported is the issue about street children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increasing number of street children is alarming. The Ministry has tried to reintegrate these children into their families, but most of them resist going back home because they are not loved and supported at home. This situation calls for a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of homelessness amongst children. We must explore strategies that provide these children with the necessary care and support. Budgetary constraints have, over the years, been a major challenge to the Ministry in the provision of essential services and rehabilitation centres. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation by the Committee to increase the budgetary allocation to Social Protection is quite important. With more money, the Ministry can do more in rehabilitation and care for the vulnerable group. The Report also highlights the under-utilisation of grant-in-aid allocation to institutions and NGOs dealing with the disabilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this calls for deeper understanding as to why the resources are not being fully utilised and developing ways on how these grants are allocated and used effectively. Our Social Protection Programmes depend greatly on effective utilisation of such grants.</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2281 Mr. Speaker, Sir, another critical issue is the shifting of the Lautoka Golden Age Home for structural reasons. The safety of the proposed new site for the elderly has been questioned because of its proximity to the road. Again, careful planning and community consultation provide the key to identifying suitable sites for such facilities. How can we ensure our facility planning is designed to first protect our elderly citizens? The Ministry’s partnership with stakeholders, such as the Methodist Church and the Salvation Army, in providing centre for street children is very commendable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, collaboration with various stakeholders is necessary to pull resources and expertise in the quest to address social issues. In fact, our stakeholders have been very instrumental in the successful implementation of our social programmes. The REACH Programme which is involved in the delivery of services to rural and urban communities, has been quite a success. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee strongly recommends the continuation of this programme, that is, because sustainability is one of the key areas where such programs assure the same service provision to people for a long period of time. On what basis can we be sure of the success of the REACH Programme for further replication? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s effort to address discrepancies in the Social Protection Programme and improved financial management are steps in the right direction. The engagement with DFAT to update existing policies and SOPs will further enhance the Ministry’s capacity to serve our communities effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there are many areas that need to be addressed, I believe this report is a step in the right direction. The recommendations provided by the community, part of which is now being implemented, will significantly improve the Ministry’s ability to support vulnerable co- operations and address pressing issues. With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Report. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to acknowledge the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Mr. Chairman and his Team, for the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today with a deep sense of concern and urgency regarding a matter that should weigh heavily on all of us, our children. The 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual Reports from the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation paint a troubling picture of the increasing number of children living in dire circumstances, particularly those living on the streets of our capital city - Suva. This is a crisis that we cannot ignore, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Children as we all know are the future of this nation, but they are also its most vulnerable members. As a society, we are entrusted with this protection and well-being, and the fact that so many children are now living on the streets, exposed to harsh elements and are vulnerable to exploitation, is a clear indicator of our failure to uphold that responsibility. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some have suggested that these children choose to live on the streets. This claim, however, is not only over simplified but dangerously dismissive of the true nature of the circumstances. How can we, as a nation, justify such a careless view? Children, some as young as 10 years old, do not have the maturity or urgency to make the decision to live in such extreme conditions. Reality is that these children are on the streets because they have no other option. They are there because the system designed to protect them or Child Welfare Programme, our social safety nets are failing.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>2282 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 Let us be clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, no child willingly choose a life of hardship and suffering. These children are there because they are escaping neglect, abuse or the overwhelming poverty of their homes. They are seeking survival not freedom. The question we must ask ourselves is not whether these children have chosen this life but why are they in this position at all? Why are so many children in our country forced to live on the streets? Is it poverty? Is it family breakdown? Is it abuse or neglect? Perhaps, it is all these factors combined. Whatever the reasons, the truth is that these children should have never been allowed to fall through the cracks in the first place. This is a collective failure, one that demands for an immediate action. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not enough to merely acknowledge this crisis. We must take action, and we must ask ourselves, what can we do to support these children and restore them a sense of safety, dignity and hope for a better future? In my view, the system is reactive not proactive. While the Ministry is working hard to address these issues, there is a lack of coordinated, comprehensive efforts to address the root cause of why children are ending up on the streets in the first place. We must move beyond temporary fixtures and build long-term solutions. The question that we must now ask is not just what are we doing for these children but what more can we do? Have we explored all the possible avenues to protect and support these children? Are there alternative systems, structures and programmes we can create to intervene before these children are forced to flee their homes and take to the streets? Can we strengthen our child protection mechanism to ensure that no child is left behind, regardless of their family circumstances? Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are not just theoretical questions, they are a call to action. We must do more, we must do it now. Some may say that the solution is simple, that we should focus on reuniting these children with their families. However, you must acknowledge that this is not always a viable or safe solution. Many of these children are escaping environments, where they face violence, neglect or abuse. For some, returning to their families would put them at a greater risk. Therefore, we must explore alternatives options such as: (1) Safe home or shelters where children can receive care, education and emotional support while we work to reunite them with their families when it is safe and possible. (2) The Mental Health Services and Counselling. These children often dealing with deep trauma, anxiety and depression. (3) The Vocational Training Programmes and mentorship that offer children a sense of purpose and direction, helping them to build a future beyond the streets. Additionally, we need to strengthen our partnership with local communities, civil society organisations and international partners. This is not just a government issue, it is a societal issue. It requires collective effort of all sectors to address and resolve. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look at the rising number of children living on the streets, we cannot afford to close our eyes to their suffering. We cannot simply blame them for their circumstances. We must act now to restore their sense of belonging and purpose. These children deserve more than survival, they deserve the opportunity to thrive. Until we explore every avenue, solution, option, we carry a dark stain on our national concerns. These children are the adults of tomorrow, and the question we must ask ourselves is, what kind of future do you want to build for them? Do we want to continue allowing them to suffer or do we want to ensure that they grow into healthy, educated and productive members of society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the time to act is now. We must come together as a nation to protect our children and we must show them that they matter, they are not forgotten and that we will do everything in our power to ensure they have the opportunity to live a life free from suffering. It is my</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2283 prayer that all Members of this august Parliament, as legislators will work together with Government to find solutions to these street dwelling problems involving our children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I was doing some research on this subject and I found out there are nations who have successfully addressed these children street problem through their early detection policies. Perhaps, we can seek assistance and learn from their experience. Fiji’s situation, we have a small population. We have good founding structures, the vanua, lotu, matavuvale, veiwekani and Government in tacking these street dwelling issues for our children should not be difficult. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all those being said, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members, for their contribution and I also thank the Ministry for Women, Children and Social Protection for providing details on the programmes that the Ministry is undertaking. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we did immediately when we came into Government was to recognise that in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 coming out of the COVID crises, that people were still making the transition, that there were losses in income, welfare and many things happened during COVID, movement of people and in some cases things changed permanently for families, those who were part of those families. So, the Government recognised, in the first budget, we actually increased the Department of Social Welfare’s budget by about 24 percent. We also recognised that families, particularly those who were falling through the cracks, those who were vulnerable, we increased the social welfare allowances by 15 to 25 percent across the board, 25 percent particularly for those over 70 years. We recognised that this support was needed, and we have obviously kept that allocation and a little bit more in the current budget. I must commend the Department of Social Welfare because there was also a lot of haphazard applications of some of the good polices, therefore, the effectiveness of some of those programmes were not as good as they ought to have been. So, rationalisation of some of those programmes, particularly social welfare programmes and making sure that people who get out of the trap and are actually moved into more employment. So, the Government has used multi-pronged approach, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that families do not fall through those cracks. Apart from increasing direct support in terms of social welfare, as we said, we included income support in the education sector, in the agriculture sector, and subsidies to farmers beyond the sugar cane. All these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two years and in the last two budgets was designed to improve the income position for the families, particularly those who were vulnerable. In terms of the recommendations and the observations made, particularly number four, we had allocated in the 2024-2025 Budget, a budget of about $569,900, of which $344,900 caters for the renovation of the temporary Lautoka Age Care Home to ensure that it is suitable to relocate. I know the honourable Minister has already talked about the difficulties that were there. On number five, retention policy for staff and all vacant positions to be filled as soon as possible, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2024-2025 Budget, there is a costed operational plan. The target to fill 50 substantive vacant positions in the current 2024-2025 financial year. I know the Ministry has put in place a recruitment plan and that obviously will go a long way to help. A sum of $9.1 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been allocated in the 2024-2025 Budget to cater for the salaries and wages of the approved 303 established staff and 132 GWE officers. Mr. Speaker,</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>2284 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2 nd December, 2024 Sir, in terms of strengthening the Ministry’s capacity and the ability to deliver on some of the good programmes that have been undertaken, we have obviously provided additional funding. In terms of support for women NGOs and opening up assistance to other women’s groups and institutions, we have done that. In the 2023-2024 Budget, $500,000 was allocated as a grant to women’s institutions. A total of four institutions were the recipients of the grant amounting to about $100,000 per recipient. Again, we have allocated funding for 2024-2025 as well, under stakeholders to build rehabilitation. I know honourable Naisa was absolutely correct when he was talking about our kids and the children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know the honourable Minister has talked about this in the past, for the first time we have a Department of Children now established within the Ministry. That, I think is going to go a long way in terms of providing a focus with the budget to deal with the issue of our street kids and some of the difficulties that we have. On the issue of working with the stakeholders to build a rehabilitation centre for street kids, again, in the 2024-2025 Budget, the Ministry has been allocated funding of $230,000 that is to cater for the renovation of the Vunirewa facility to establish the rehabilitation centre, and this centre will allow children and youth who are living on the streets into an institution where they will be given the opportunity to re-socialise and undergo rehabilitation processes. In the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the importance of drug rehabilitation centres, we have included an incentive package which includes tax holidays, duty concessions and 100 percent tax deductions for donations to rehabilitation centres. That we hope, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will obviously look at the success or otherwise of that incentive, and whether that has helped build more rehabilitation centres, we will obviously be considering budgetary provisions for that particular and specific purpose. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has recognised, and as I have said quite clearly, the transition that happened after COVID and the difficulty that we realised existed. We have not only focussed on the Social Welfare Ministry but there are many other Ministries, many other allocations which also support different activities, you know, whether it has to do with small to medium enterprises, grants from the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, whether it is to increase the minimum wage which we have now done to $4.50 and it will be $5.00 from 1 st April. Those are significant steps, Sir, to support and build income for families and of course, you know, children included as part of those families. So, once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Standing Committee for recognising and putting out these recommendations and also the Ministry for Women, Children and Social Protection for undertaking some of the policy interventions as provided for in the budget. MR. SPEAKER.- With that intervention, we have now exhausted our list of speakers and I will now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to thank all honourable Members for the constructive deliberations on these Reports. As from the Standing Committee, upon deliberation on the review of the Reports, the Standing Committee recommends the following: (1) The Ministry to continue to work with relevant stakeholders in addressing the issues of street kids. The Child Justice and Child Care Protection Bill process to be expedited and</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>2 nd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 2285 tabled in Parliament. The budgetary allocation for the Ministry to be increased to ensure various social protection programmes are well resourced. (2) The Ministry to consider the relocation of senior citizens from Natabua Golden Age Home as a matter of urgency and ensure that residents are in a more conducive environment. (3) The Ministry to have a retention policy for staff and all vacant posts are to be filled as soon as possible. (4) The Ministry to conduct an impact analysis on the grants provided to Women NGO’s and to open up a system to other women institutions. (5) The Ministry to work closely with stakeholders to build a rehabilitation centre for street kids. (6) The Standing Committee strongly recommends that the Ministry continue with the bridge programme to serve those in need in remote areas. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
