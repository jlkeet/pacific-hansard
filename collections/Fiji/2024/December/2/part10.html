<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on the television and on the internet. Thank you for your continuing interest in the work of our Parliament. Congratulations - Fiji Sevens Team I think it would be remiss of me, on behalf of this august Assembly, not to congratulate our great Fiji Sevens Men’s Rugby Team on their victory in Dubai earlier this morning. (Acclamation)</p><p>2 nd December, 2024 Point of Order 2219 To Mr. Osea Kolinisau and your team we, the honourable Members of Parliament and its staff congratulate you warmly for a win that has been long time coming. We, from the small island of Kabara in Southern Lau, are extremely proud of Osea, an outstanding son of Kabara, for his successes both, as Sevens Captain and a player, and now a winning Coach. May this be the beginning of another memorable chapter in the nation’s sevens rugby history.</p></body>
