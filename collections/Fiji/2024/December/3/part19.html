<body><h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT -ACCIDENT COMPENSATION COMMISSION FIJI 2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - ACCIDENT COMPENSATION COMMISSION FIJI 2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports, which was tabled on 3rd October 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) was established by the Fijian Government through the introduction of the Accident Compensation Act 2017, to pay no fault compensation to Fijians as of 1 st January, 2018, who suffer personal injury or death as a result of the accidents in Fiji from 1 st January 2019. The ACCF has been providing compensation for injuries and deaths as a result of accidents, in the course of employment, as well in school premises during school hours. The Act provides for the scheme which the victims of accidents can be compensated without having to prove fault or negligence subject to meeting the Act’s requirements. Coverage of the no fault scheme is broader than the previous law, as it extends beyond third parties. The Committee, upon being referred with the ACCF 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports, received submission from ACCF to gather information on its operational dynamics as part of the Committee’s scrutiny process. When the Committee scrutinised the Reports, it identified pertinent issues of concern such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were not included, making it difficult to thoroughly assess the performance of ACCF. Secondly, the ACCF did not report on the mandatory SDGs. Thirdly, expenses exceeded revenue for both 2020 and 2021. Lastly, engaging of Veritas Pte Ltd to produce and process applications for schools and employment accidents duplicated the role of the Ministry of Labour, resulting in resource wastage. Furthermore, the Review Report articulated six findings with recommendations. The Committee noted that there are some good initiatives being undertaken relating to no fault compensation and public awareness. However, Committee has identified several key areas to further improve its performance, in particular, duplication of roles or processing of applications for schools and employment accidents that require an urgent review. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, is now open for the debate on the motion. I have a list of speakers, as follows: (a) Honourable S. Nand; (b) Honourable F. S. Koya; (c) Honourable N. T. Tuinaceva;</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2367 (d) Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Workplace Relations; and (e) Honourable Minister for Justice.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, there a few statistics that I would like to start off.</p><p>The Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) has paid over $42 million since its inception - $29.2 million is for motor vehicle accidents, $12.5 million is for employment related accidents and close to $1 million is for school premises. My concern here is school premises. Are our schools safe for our students? A payment of $1 million as compensation for school accidents is high. I believe there should be nothing. It is evident from the Annual Report that ACCF is not performing to its optimum level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it continues to be inadequately funded and in 2020 and 2021, the expenses were more than the revenue it received. Insufficient budgetary allocation impacts its ability to provide a service to the community. Limited public awareness, there is lack of general awareness amongst the public on ACCF’s service and its compensation processes. Many Fijians, especially in the rural areas, are unaware of their eligibility for compensation or how to file claims. Mr. Speaker, Sir, lack of communication affects the strategies and the outreach programme. Their Facebook page, which is supposed to a very modern tool, was last updated in September 2024. For an organisation as such, it should frequently update their Facebook page. The outsourcing of processing to Veritas Pte Ltd is a concern. This organisation, Sir, is set up to look at processing compensation, however, processing should be done in-house, it should not be outsourced. There is delays in compensation payouts and in some instances, victims had to wait over 18 months to receive compensation. This is outrageous. Why is there such a delay in getting this compensation out to the people? One of the concerns is that we are paying a lot in terms of compensation but the number of road accidents in Fiji is ever increasing. What are we doing about it? Are our roads so unsafe that we get people injured or killed now and then? This should be a concern and should be jointly addressed by all parties concerned, not only ACCF. In terms of an organisation, the concept is that if you can measure it, you can manage it. In ACCF’s case, there is a clear absence of performance matrix. So, are we measuring their performance? If we are not measuring it, how are we managing their performance? On timelines of claim processing, what is the average time taken to process compensation claims? These are not evident in their Reports. What are the satisfaction rates of its customers? Were they serviced within the timeframe? How satisfied were they with their performance? It is not there. On the claims resolution rate, how effectively were the claims resolved? It is not there. We do not have any information where there were any fraudulent claims lodged. All this information is missing. On financial efficiency, at what ratio were they able to pay the compensation? Without these types of performance in matrix, we will have very little insight on how the institution is doing.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2368 The ACCF’s Annual Reports, for instance, could provide stakeholders with an overview of the Commission’s operational efficiency and its ability to respond to public needs. It could, but it did not. These measurable data was missing, and it becomes impossible to hold the Commission accountable for delays in claim processing, its inefficiencies or under performance in any aspect of their work because we are unable to measure it. Absence of these data also makes it difficult to identify areas for improvement. Therefore, the composition of the Annual Reports must be enhanced to include all these relevant information. Lack of Key Performance Indicators in ACCF’s Annual Reports is a significant shortfall that limits it ability to measure and demonstrate performance. Without this, they will never be able to improve their performance or improve their service delivery or identify their shortfalls. Without clear measurable indicators, it becomes very difficult to assess the Commission’s operational efficiency or make them accountable or responsible to the needs of the accident victims. The Annual Report falls short of stating what the real operational aspects of the Commission was, and this is a concern. The Commission is entrusted with a very important responsibility and their work should demonstrate how they are managing this responsibility and how they are providing these services to our consumers. I hope all these areas that have been identified is taken into consideration and we hope to see the Annual Reports, and not only the Annual Reports, the performance uplifted and our citizens provided with a better and efficient services and compensation paid to our people on time. Thank you. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I could not agree more with honourable Sachida Nand on the concerns that he has raised and we also had similar concerns and that is why we had reviewed the whole thing and let me present to you my response, likewise. Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the 2019-2021 Annual Report for the ACCF. The role of the ACCF was expanded to cover for employment and school accident compensations, effective from 1 st January, 2019. Prior to that, it was a ‘fault-based arrangement’ whereby employers themselves had to get insurance against any accident or fatality, which should then be claimed through that process. And that could be challenged by the insurance company or the employer and it would take quite long for the victim to finally get justice. Once it become the ‘no fault-based arrangement’, thereby the ACCF can proceed, as long as the evidence is there, that yes it was based on the accident or was workplace-related or the fatality was workplace-related or the death was related to work, it would be paid. Madam Deputy Speaker, my Ministry was used as the enforcement arm of the ACCF and also assisted ACCF with the investigations of employment accidents, occupational diseases, cases, as well as process payment of the two-third weekly wages of injured workers while they were on leave. So, Madam Deputy Speaker, most of this work was done by the Ministry. Madam Deputy Speaker, on 31 st March, 2024, the honourable Minister for Justice, in consultation with the Honourable Prime Minister, appointed an interim ACCF Board, chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Employment. The composition of the Board had Permanent Secretaries and representatives from within the responsible Ministries. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Board was tasked to: (1) conduct an independent review of the ACCF in consultation with the major stakeholders; and</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2369 (2) to assist in the assessment of the current and pending applications for payment of accident compensation. Madam Deputy Speaker, the interim ACCF Board had its first meeting on 19 th April, 2024, and made the following decisions: (1) non-renewal of the contract of the CEO of the ACCF; (2) non-renewal of the agreement between ACCF and Veritas Pte Ltd., which was outsourced (3) (4) to process or do the administration, part of the compensations; and transfer of employment and school accident compensation cases from Veritas Pte Ltd to the Ministry of Employment from 1 st June, 2024; the Permanent Secretary for Employment to manage the processing of pending accident compensation cases; and (5) ACCF Accountant to act as the officer in charge and administrator of the operations of ACCF in the interim. Madam Deputy Speaker, in June 2024, the Ministry inherited some 1,101 cases ACCF. The Ministry has settled 421 cases comprising of 372 employment cases and 49 school accidents. The pending cases to date are 680, comprising of 648 employment cases and 32 school accidents. Madam Deputy Speaker, the total cases paid out to date is 204, that is 177 employment accidents and 27 school accident cases. And the total amount that has been paid out is $2.77 million, which is 46 percent of the total annual budget allocation of $6 million in the 2024-2025 Budget. Madam Deputy Speaker, you should note that out of the 421,204 cases where actually paid and the rest depending on the reports from the doctors, would have been assessed as those that do not deserve payment. The Ministry also inherited, Madam Deputy Speaker, on 21 st June, 2024, from a ACCF, a total of 12,000 accident cases from the period 2019 to 2024. These cases are currently being sorted and also being prioritised for processing. Madam Deputy Speaker, ACCF from 2019 to 2021, that is three years, settled 253 employment and school accident cases. That is in the Annual Report, Madam Deputy Speaker. While the Ministry settled 242 cases in four months, the ACCF from 2019 to 2021, that is 36 months, paid out $3.5 million compared to the $3.3 million paid by the Ministry in a span of four months. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Veritas Ltd was engaged as a claims agent for ACCF from 2019 and charging an annual fee of $900,000 per year to carry out administrative work. A total of $4.5 million was paid out to Veritas Ltd by ACCF from 2019 to 2023. So, and the savings also will include the salary and benefits that was paid to the CEO and mind you, it was a handsome sum. Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of financial implications, my Ministry has restructured the Worker's Compensation Unit and 16 staff are currently engaged to process employment and school accident cases effectively. The Ministry is processing cases expeditiously, efficiently and cost effectively. Madam Deputy Speaker, we are saving over $1.3 million annually, by now, processing all these claims through our Ministry and taking over the whole. Madam Deputy Speaker, a Cabinet Paper will soon be presented to the Cabinet whereby we will propose that we have a tripartite board that is going to oversee the work of the ACCF, and the Ministry will continue to work out the process and expedite all the pending cases. There is a big backlog, Madam Deputy Speaker, we really want</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2370 to expedite all those, so that those victims who have been denied all these long are actually paid what is justifiably due to them. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will be as brief as possible, just to correct something Madam Deputy Speaker, I think my friend honourable Sachida Nand was referring to the current status of the ACCF, that is 2024. This particular Report is relative to 2019, 2020 and 2021, I do not think any part of his speech he was actually referring to this particular Report. So, there are issues that he raised that is referenced to the ACCF of today. Madam Deputy Speaker, I think the current Report before us, and I want to thank the Standing Committee for the Report. The current Report before us is fairly innocuous and there are several recommendations, administrative things that needs to be done. Nothing unto word has actually come out of that particular Report with respect to ACCF. I want to just correct some issues that has been raised by the honourable Minister just now. First of all, let me just point out Madam Deputy Speaker, the Commission can delegate its powers to its officers, employees, agents or consultants but it does not have the power to transfer the Ministry responsible for ACCF which is the Ministry of Justice. That requires some legislative change, so the current processing by the Ministry of Employment could be considered unlawful, something that the Ministry, Attorney-General’s Chambers and Ministry of Justice would have to look at. I understand what he is talking about in terms of a Cabinet paper coming through and processing applications, so until that Cabinet paper comes through the processing of any applications, without Cabinet approval would make for some fairly questionable things that the Auditor-General may find in this Bill. This would be a matter of some serious housekeeping that would need to be done. As he pointed out rightfully, there is a Cabinet paper proposing the transfer to the Ministry of Employment and Land Transport Authority (LTA) whether there is independence on all of these, I am not sure and from what I am informed of, and I am aware of Madam Deputy Speaker, is saying that most of the work the Ministry is doing, three quarters of the work for ACCF, is absolutely incorrect. Previously there was no processing under the No Fault Scheme and that would be a case of misleading Parliament, and for a fact, he has raised the issue of it being an enforcement arm of the ACCF. There is no enforcement provision under the Accident Compensation Act, so how can you be an enforcement arm? So, these are the things that are important when we come here and stand and raise issues, we must make sure that we say it correctly. If his Ministry is still settling cases from 2018 when I was there, what has actually been happening for all this time, nobody knows. The ACCF was actually established in some 2019, and the Act was passed in 2017, and the scheme actually came into effect in January 2018. The workers are quite happy with the scheme and those that are recipients are quite happy with the scheme. Of course, yes, there are some teething problems but now we are starting to face some problems in 2014. But as I have said, this particular Report is relative to the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. It is a fairly innocuous Report. I think some of the things that are pointed out are administrative matters that needs to be looked at and can be fixed. I think the duplication of roles, et cetera, the review of processes relating to specificity of locations and comparison of compensations for similar losses, very administrative in its nature, Madam Deputy Speaker, and, of course, including SDGs in its every</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2371 Report. That is a line that I think is used in most of the reports that we actually see before the Parliament. However, I thank the Standing Committee for the Report and the recommendations that have been put in there. If the issues that have been spoken about, especially by the honourable Minister exist, they ought to have and they should have been, and they would have been picked up by the Standing Committee that has put the Report before us. It has not, as I said, it is a very innocuous Report. Madam Deputy Speaker, and I commend the Standing Committee for coming up with these particular findings and the issues that need to be resolved. But just as a matter of correction, all of those things that I pointed out are factually correct. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, yes, confirming with honourable Koya, it falls under the Ministry of Justice. Just before I dwell on that, let me just enlighten Parliament that a sum of $2.2 million was allocated to ACCF in this year’s budget to fund motor vehicle claims and other operational costs. From 2017-2018 to 2024-2025 financial years, Government has brought a total grant of $16.7 million to ACCF to carry out its operations. In the 2024-2025 financial year ACCF has four staff to handle the Motor Vehicle Accidental Claims and other operational cost. One of the issues raised by the honourable Sanjay is the issue of delay, is also the issue of less staff. One of the problems I found out last year is that the only office that processes the application is only in Valelevu. No, that does not make sense. There has been some discussion from last year, Cabinet has been informed, paper in terms of the reform has been held back, it has gone through the Cabinet Sub-Committee on legislation. What is going on now in the next two or three months they will socialise these issues, the reforms, the way forward with the respective ministries before they come back to Government. The members of the Interim Committees, the Chairman is the Permanent Secretary for Ministry of Employment is Mr. Maritino Nemani, why he is the Chairman because the Ministry deals with those line of work. The other member is the CEO of LTA because they deal with vehicle accidents. The Deputy Chairman is George Tavo from the Ministry of Transport. Ms. Vitilia Chand, Principal Officer in the Office of the Prime Minister and Dr. Darcy. Their skill sets empowers the Interim Committee to work. The Interim Committee their term will expire in March of next year. We hope that before March, Parliament will see a Bill on how this should move forward. I endorse the complaints and the other issues that has been raised regarding the expenses. One of the issues that was very clear to the Coalition Government when they came in, it has to go away with the ACCF. First, the issue of paying other agencies and also the issue of wages of the CEO. There are certain CEOs which the Coalition Government found objectionable to take a chance with, and it did. Madam Deputy Speaker, I believe there is a sum of $400,000 which was paid to the CEO. Now, the Permanent Secretary for Labour is doing it on pro-bono basis. That is a huge saving for the Government, and it has been witnessed through evidence in terms of processing that it is now much faster and efficient with the Ministry then it was with ACCF. It had only four staff. They have this history of knowing the industry and the work and they are better equipped. Yes, when it was initially discussed, from the very beginning there was some questions raised from within Government, whether the Ministry of Labour was suitable and I think over the passage of time, now it is pretty clear that is the way it is going to go forward with the Ministry of Labour taking a key role.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2372 The ACCF and the Ministry of Employment previously shared responsibilities for investigating persistent workplace and school accident claims. Under the new Interim Chairman as I have said, the Minister’s enhance its procedures by implementing strict standard operating procedures, only investigating seven claims. Yes, any legislation over time in this case, obviously it needs reform. Yesterday we were talking about FIU, ACCF, it is time to change and that is what we intend to do. Doing so through consultation, through the other agencies, particularly now, or in the next three months or so. I applaud the previous Government for bringing the No Fault Scheme. I thank the previous Administrators of ACCF for their contribution, but I want to share this, that now the immense risk and danger that faces the Ministry of Labour when they do not prepare well in terms of action claims and here the beneficiaries lose out. I witnessed this in previous cases, that problem has been taken out. What we want to do is try to simplify and separate it so that all the stakeholders are satisfied. I note the work that the Standing Committee has done and also note the findings and the recommendations. The Coalition Government is committed to ensure that SDG 5 and 8 is complied with and it is not only with ACCF, but it also goes for other agencies. Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the Adoption Accrual Report of the ACCF 2019 and 2021. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, on Item 2.6 of the Report, the Standing Committee acknowledged the work done to raise awareness and education on road accidents. Madam Deputy Speaker, there has been an alarming spike in road accidents over the last six months. That part of the Report, I mentioned about, confirms what many of us have feared, our roads once a symbol of development, have tragically become a killing field. Madam Deputy Speaker, the devastating incident on the Tacirua Road in Suva, where a father held his 13-year-old son, as the child died in his arms as the runaway vehicle struck them two weeks ago, is a stark reminder of the human cost behind these statistics. Just this past Thursday, another eight-year-old child died whilst crossing the road with her father. Yesterday, a man in his 20s died in a horrific accident in Sigatoka. These heartbreaking images, some viral on social media is not just a tragedy, it is call for action! Madam Deputy Speaker, no amount of compensation can bring back that young life or undo the trauma suffered by families. The true challenges lie in preventing such accidents from happening in the first place. We must move beyond compensation and begin addressing the root causes of this epidemic. The question before us is not just how we help victims, but how can we prevent for the victims? Madam Deputy Speaker, we do not deny that the compensation provided to victims of road accidents serves as an important safety net. The work of the Accident Compensation Committee is valuable, and it has provided much needed support for families in the wake of these accidents. However, it is clear that compensation is not the solution to this crisis. The current system, as we can say is failing us and we must acknowledge that accidents caused by speeding are not accidents in the true sense of the word. They are instances of intentional negligence. Madam Deputy Speaker, when a driver chooses to speed recklessly, ignoring speed limits and endangering the lives of others, they are consciously putting lives at risk. These are not accidents waiting to happen. They are disasters in the making. The young 21-year-old driver speeding on our roads at 100 kilometres per hour in a 50 kilometre per hour zone, is simply not making a mistake.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2373 They are making a deliberate choice to disregard the law, and their choice has deadly consequences. Madam Deputy Speaker, we must ask ourselves, what kind of society are we, if we allow this to continue? A society that tolerates reckless driving where lives are treated as expendable? It is a society that has lost its moral compass. The figures we are seeing are deeply concerning and most of the accidents involve young drivers, public services vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles speeding without a doubt is the leading cause of this crisis. This is no longer just a matter of driver error, it is a systematic failure to respect human life and uphold the law. We are failing to teach young drivers the value of life, the responsibility they bear behind the wheels, and the consequences of their actions. We cannot continue to allow this disregard for life fester in our society. Madam Deputy Speaker, the solution to this crisis is not just about imposing harsher penalties for reckless driving. Though that is certainly part of it, the solution lies in a broader shift in our approach to driver education and road safety. I propose we move beyond simply teaching people how to operate a vehicle and begin educating them on value-based driving. If I may repeat that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I propose that we move beyond simply teaching young people on how to operate and drive a vehicle and begin teaching them on value-based driving. It is not enough for drivers to know the rules of the road. They must understand the importance of those rules. They must understand that speeding is not just an infraction, it is an act of irresponsibility that can cost lives. Every time a driver chooses to speed, they are choosing to endanger others. Madam Deputy Speaker, we must emphasise responsibility, respect and sanctity of life in our driving education programmes. These principles must be taught from the earlier stages of driver training. We need to ensure that all drivers, especially young drivers understand the profound impact in their actions. A driver who speeds through a residential area or tailgates another vehicle is not just violating the law, they are disrespecting the lives of others. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is time for us to scale up our prevention effort. Speeding kills. This is not a theory, it is a reality that we must confront, act and we must act now. Government has taken steps in the right direction by regulating the licensing and defensive driving, but the truth is, we are not doing enough. We need stricter enforcement of road safety laws. We must send a clear message that reckless driving will not be tolerated and those who endanger lives must face severe consequences. The penalties for dangerous driving, especially excessive speeding must commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. Fines, suspensions and even jail time should be on the table for those who put others at risk. We cannot afford to treat reckless driving as a mere inconvenience. It is a criminal act, and we must treat it as such. Madam Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, in addition to stronger penalties, we must ensure that drivers of Public Service Vehicles and commercial vehicles undergo additional training. The behaviour of these drivers often reflects the lack of responsibility and safety awareness. We must ensure that they understand, not only how to operate the vehicles, but also the ethical responsibility they bear towards their passengers and the general public. Let us be clear, we are not simply talking about compensation for the families of the dead and injured, we are talking about the right to life. Every 13-year old, every six-year old and every child and adult using our roads has the right to feel safe and protected. No amount of compensation can replace the life lost. Our focus must be on prevention or taking the steps necessary to keep our roads safe and protect the lives before accidents happen.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 2374 Madam Deputy Speaker, this is not a challenge we can afford to ignore. We cannot allow the pain and the suffering we see on our screens and the face of grieving families to become our legacy. Let us rise to the occasion, let us prevent further deaths, and let us make our roads safer for all. With that being said, I support the motion before the House. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments. I would like to thank honourable Tuinaceva for what he has just raised. I think it is very important and very pertinent to the issue that we are discussing today. The more we create education and awareness and try not to move away from compensation and looking at the values that we want to inculcate in the lives of drivers of this country. On the other issues raised by honourable Koya on the legality of the transfer, that is not for this Committee to look at. We had the report for 2019, 2020 and 2021, so we just looked at the issues described in the report and during that time. We ask you not to ask the Committee to do that. Maybe when we are looking at the 2024 Report, then we can look at the transfer, the legal of it being done and perhaps some recommendations on that. Honourable Sachida Nand had raised some very important issues with regards to communications, and of course, that is a very important part of this. Communication to our people there, as you are aware, when we are trying to communicate, there are a lot of mediums, but how effective are they in trying not to change human behaviour? That is one of the challenges that we face when we are coming in and trying to push legislation, trying to push projects. The people are just the same out there. They are just there, there is no impact on them. So, we have to come up with more innovative ideas in trying to change the behavioural pattern of the people. I think the honourable Leader of Opposition always discusses this issue with me about how he wants to change people, plant more when he was at agriculture, how he wants to do certain things to change behavioural patterns. It is not a very easy thing. We need to be coming up with more innovative ways of trying to address this problem. Honourable Sachida Nand has raised an important issue on performance indicators. That is what we had told ACCF, the lack of performance indicators. How can we gauge when you do not have any performance indicators? I think that is all from my side, Madam Deputy Speaker and I would like to thank all those who had contributed. I do support the motion. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the contents of the Report made by the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs. Question put. Motion agreed to. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Almost there, honourable Members. I now call upon the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to move his motion.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2375</p></body>
