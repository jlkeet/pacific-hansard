KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; good morning to the people of Fiji who may be listening in today.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2321 Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to share some insights on the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive 2024, that was conducted along the West Coast of the United States from 6 th October, 2024 to 12 th October, 2024. The US Fiji Investments Savings Drive, a first of its kind, was organised by the Ministry’s Trade Commission in North America as a direct outcome of the Fiji-North America Business Mission to Canada and the United States in May 2024, which I had the honour of leading. The drive was focussed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on bridging the gap between Fiji and the Fiji diaspora by providing crucial investment and savings opportunities. This initiative is a clear testament of the Coalition Government’s commitment to inclusivity, ensuring Fijians across the globe to remain integral to the national growth story of our country. It reflects our understanding that while the borders of our nation may be physical, the spirit of Fiji transcends geography. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s diaspora community plays a pivotal role in the development of our economy. The numbers speak volumes or speak for themselves. Between 2019 and 2023, Fiji has received a staggering $4.5 billion in remittances alone. Remittances from the United States are the second highest at 24 percent, Australia being the highest at 44 percent. Personal remittances increased by 23.2 percent to $1.1723 billion in the 2022 to 2023 period. These figures have been increasing on an average of about 17 percent since 2019. To put this into perspective, it is almost 10 percent of the GDP, directly supporting countless households and businesses across the country. Many of our diaspora members, particularly in countries like the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, are eager to do more. They want to invest in Fiji, plan for retirement and actively participate in the country's development. What they often lack is information, access and support, and the right policies, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to turn these aspirations into reality. This is where the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive comes in, to bridge these gaps and provide our diaspora with the right tools and support they need to contribute meaningfully to our economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 70 agencies and financial institutions, namely the Fiji National Provident Fund, Fijian Holdings Unit Trust, Fijian Holdings Stock Broking Limited, Solar FinTech, iTaukei Land Trust Board, the Ministry of Lands and the Fiji Embassy in Washington DC, participated in the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive, coordinated by the Fiji Trade Commission in North America, and ably led by Mr. Alika. These agencies provided a range of services including: • • • • • investment advice to empower diaspora members to diversify their contributions; savings promotion to support financial security and retirement planning; land and lease conditions, ensuring transparent and accessible pathways to owning or leasing land in Fiji; passport services to simplify logistical challenges for our diaspora; and linking services where diaspora members were linked to Fiji agencies and partners. Honourable Members, these services were made available in four key cities, namely, Seattle, San Francisco, Sacramento and Santa Rosa. The response from our diaspora, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was overwhelmingly positive. Over 1,000 members were served and new diaspora investments exceeding $1 million was recorded over those six days. These numbers to net accounts for the long-term impact of the relationships and the accounts established during this drive. This is a true reflection of what we can achieve when we listen</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2322 to our people and work together for the betterment of Fijians, especially for our people overseas. Beyond the numbers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the human stories are what truly highlight that full impact of this drive. Among the many stories shared, one that stands out was the story of a Fijian woman who had lived in the United States for decades unaware that she had substantial funds in her FNPF account. Misinformation had led her to believe that she had nothing in her account. Learning otherwise was an emotional moment for her. Tears of joy and gratitude were expressed and are a powerful reminder of why these engagements are so critical. We also heard from diaspora members who plan to retire in Fiji and look for the opportunity to open investment accounts in Fiji. These are powerful reminders of the latent potential within our diaspora and their eagerness to maintain strong connections with their homeland. These stories, Mr. Speaker, Sir, highlight the deep desire of our diaspora to stay connected to our homeland and contribute in tangible ways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the success of this drive is undeniable, it also has shone a light on the challenges faced by our diaspora. One major issue is the difficulty of opening bank accounts in Fiji remotely. Many diaspora members, particularly those who are unable to travel to Fiji, are excluded from accessing banking services due to stringent in-person verification processes. To address this, our very own local bank, HFC, in partnership with the Fiji Trade Commission, is looking at a way to allowing diaspora members to open bank accounts remotely. The teams have registered a few new bank accounts as part of this, and a formal announcement will be made as soon as everything is worked out logistically. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will mean that we will witness an increase in deposits and investments from our diaspora community. I would like to also acknowledge the Board Chairman and Management of HFC Bank, who have been working actively with the Trade Commissioner of North America. This initiative, Mr. Speaker, is the first of its kind in our country and a testament to the combined dedication to overcoming barriers with our diaspora. Honourable Members, let me take a moment to reflect on why supporting our diaspora is so crucial. (1) Diaspora investments and savings directly contribute to Fiji’s GDP. The funds raised through initiatives like this drive support for businesses, create jobs and fuel infrastructure development. (2) Facilitating investments such as this, in areas such as land and housing, will encourage long-term participation in our economy, ensuring a stable future for our nation. (3) Engaging with our diaspora fosters a sense of belonging and loyalty to Fiji, encouraging them to return home, retire and even start businesses here. I am pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, that there are already quite a few doing that as we speak.</p><h4>(4) Beyond financial contributions, our diaspora represents a wealth of knowledge, skills and</h4><p>networks that can be harnessed to drive innovation and development in Fiji. The two gentlemen, Sir, that we saw in Canada are quite well-heeled gentlemen who have made names for themselves in Canada, and they are here as an outcome from the North American Mission that we also conducted in May this year.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Both from Ba:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, this drive was a trial, but we can see, and it is</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2323 now being hailed certainly as a success. As we look to the future, Mr. Speaker, our goals are very clear: (1) Annual engagement - we plan to make the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive an annual event, aligning it to Fiji Day celebrations to maximise participation. (2) On top of that, we will be looking at rolling this out to other countries in the diaspora, so that we deepen our penetration with the diaspora. The next step of course is to look at Canada and a few other countries in going forward. (3) Tailored solutions - through key partnerships, we will continue to identify barriers and work on innovative solutions such as the partnership with the HFC Bank. (4) Diaspora empowerment - our aim is to create an environment to every Fijian, regardless of where they live, can contribute to our nation’s success, without any unnecessary huddles. Our vision, Mr. Speaker, is to expand to other countries, as I have mentioned, and ensure that going forward, our diaspora, our family, become a central cornerstone in the economic development of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, I wish to highlight in this House some other developments that are in train. Of course, changes to the rules of immigration that were introduced by the Coalition Government have been warmly received by our diaspora. The new exemption categories is based on membership in the Vola ni Kawa Bula and also your birthright in Fiji, sends a powerful message to all our diaspora, in terms of their ability to come home and work at home and strengthen bonds between Fiji and where they reside. While there are existing investment incentives as well, Mr. Speaker, we will tailor some of these incentives to the diaspora. The Ministry of Trade is currently designing some policies which will be tabled in Cabinet, targeting the diaspora specifically. This is expected to attract more investment, wealth creation and improve the wellbeing of our people. Mr. Speaker, by creating a consistent and structured approach, we can ensure that every Fijian abroad has the opportunity to invest, save and stay connected to their homeland. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish also to acknowledge at this stage, the local stakeholders in the United States, whose collaboration made this event possible. This includes the venue organisers, the Fiji Day Santa Rosa Event Coordinators, community and church leaders, who supported this drive. Their contributions in facilitating logistics, rallying the community and providing an inclusive platform for engagement, were invaluable. I would also like to acknowledge the Fiji Embassy in Washington, His Excellency Ambassador Ratu Ilisoni Vuidreketi, and his team, for their support in providing passport enrolment services to the diaspora in California during this drive. Of course, I also would like to thank the Fiji Trade Commission in North America and their leader, Mr. Cooper, for their tireless efforts in coordinating the drive, providing immense support to the agencies. Perhaps, now, a note for the Government, the desire for passport processing to be brought closer to the community is something which came up quite significantly in America and, perhaps, with the permission of the honourable Prime Minister, we are looking at setting up something on the West Coast to deal with those of our people on the West Coast, where the bulk of the population is. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, the success of the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive 2024, is a shining example of what can be achieved when we engage our diaspora. This</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2324 initiative will not only strengthen our economy, but also reinforces the invaluable connection between Fiji and our people abroad. To our stakeholders and every Fijian who participated in this drive, vinaka saka vakalevu. Your efforts and enthusiasm are what make such initiatives possible. Together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are building bridges between Fiji and its diaspora, bridges that will not only carry investments, but also the hope, pride and the shared vision of prosperity for generations to come. Let us continue to build a Fiji that every Fijian at home or abroad, is proud to call their own. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to deliver this Ministerial Statement. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and his brief on the US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive, which was conducted along the West Coast of the United States. I think he somewhat touched on Canada also. Of course, yes, Mr. Speaker, this initiative was aimed to strengthen our economic ties and attract investment and encourage more of our Fijian diaspora to participate in Fiji's economic growth. But let me just correct him, Mr. Speaker, this is not the first, it was done before in North America, and proof of the pudding is a very large investment that came out of the States. This is in Wailoaloa, in a hotel that has currently just finished. That was done under the FijiFirst Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said all of that, I take my hat off to the honourable Minister for having taken the initiative to do this. It is a great place for us to try and tap into the diaspora because there are many success stories that come out of North America that we can tap into. The last time, I think, we did all of these, COVID had put back to a lot of things, therefore, it stood still. As mentioned by the honourable Minister, we have a huge diaspora and that relates to remittances that come into the country. That is actually a pittance in terms of the capability that exists within North America in terms of investment into Fiji. We have many success stories of former Fijians who have done extremely well in the US and Canada and are willing to come and invest in Fiji. One such case, as I have said, is the Crown Plaza that is being built in Wailoaloa and it is a massive success story, and this is a gentleman called J. Singh, who is a former Fiji citizen. He has done extremely well in the United States, and he has now decided to invest in Fiji. That is just one example. The other example is sitting in the room today. As mentioned by the honourable Minister, a very well-heeled gentleman, Mr. Jeff Lal, who is also a very successful businessman, who also wants to come and invest in Fiji. But it just so happens, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Lal, even yesterday, pointed out some things that probably need to be looked at. This is not pouring scorn on anything but just something that we need to look at. This is, again, a Ba-born Canadian businessman. He talks about the investment landscape and there are issues with respect to scrutiny that they actually look at. The investor’s concerns come out of stability, of Government policies and overall investment climate. So, I think, maybe the honourable Minister needs to just take heed of the kind of stuff that actually comes out in the press and address these issues. Also, in terms of investments and incentives and policy stability and the different sectors that they are looking at that need to be looked at, the key issue that he raised, I think, was land lease</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2325 issues, et cetera, and whether different sorts of land was affordable. Investors were questioning whether Government would provide incentives. So, I think these are questions that need to be answered. But this is not a question that singularly comes from Mr. Lal, it actually comes from the entire diaspora. As I have said, they look at the potential long-term risks if they are going to invest. And we must remember, Mr. Speaker, that these are large investments that they intend to undertake. The honourable Minister for Tourism will understand that the Crown Plaza is now a jewel in the crown with respect to tourism. These are the kinds of investments that we can attract, regardless of who is in Government, so we can attract. We just need to get it right. So, when an investor or someone who is about to invest is raising these issues, I think they need to be spoken to and we need to also ensure that we look at it in terms of when Budget time comes and the investments that can be done. Mr. Speaker, one of the other things also is that we have a young population who actually exists in these parts of the world who are not born here, but they are children of Fijian citizens who have also done well. And there is a large interest in them taking up Fijian citizenship and wanting to come here and work. So, there is a skill that they now possess that we can actually tap into. So, these are areas that we most definitely need to expand on and look at. As I have said, there are challenges that exist, but like anything, there is going to be challenges and I think these challenges will be addressed by the Minister because he is, obviously, got a team working on it. Investment Fiji, the main arm of all of these, also needs to be beefed up, Sir. They are an investment promotion agency and when Budget time comes, I think the honourable Minister will need to ask the honourable Minister for Finance for more money so that we can actually tap into these places, like we should, so that we can get more investment into the country. I thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of G:</span> 9 Bloc, or his designate.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in response to the Ministerial Statement given by the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Trade, Co-operative, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, I commend the initiative aimed at the strengthening of economic ties between Fiji and the United States, as well as the encouragement of the Fijian diaspora to engage in building our economy and the economy of their home country. The US Fiji Investment and Savings Drive 2024 is a commendable initiative, Mr. Speaker, not just in the impact it promises for the economic growth of Fiji, but in its potential to create a global platform for local MSMEs. Such a drive could enhance the capacity of these businesses, fostering innovation, competitiveness and economic diversification. By targeting the Fijian diaspora in North America, the initiative recognises the significant contribution of our fellow citizens abroad, what they could bring in terms of investment, their skills and knowledge, and the potential boost for economic and social development in Fiji. This strategy, Mr. Speaker, aligns with our global trend, leveraging diaspora for development and foster a sense of belonging which could, undoubtedly, be transformative. I also acknowledge the Government's effort in adopting the long-term prosperity and collaboration, but also would encourage and strengthen the strategy for all members of our society, including our youth and our women.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2326 Building a prosperous nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires the active involvement of all citizens, both at home and abroad. That being said, it is fundamental that such initiatives come with robust mechanism to manage and monitor the execution and impacts of this investment. Transparency and accountability should not be compromised, and Government deliverables must result in tangible and meaningful progress for all Fijians. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the effort and the direction, and I urge the Government to ensure that this initiative does not only attract financial investment, but also translate to real socio-economic development, job creation and, ultimately, a better standard of living for our people. It is also important to ensure that the interests of local communities and their environment are protected in any development strategies, and to be in line with Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I thank you for the opportunity to respond to the</p><h4>Ministerial Statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Thank you, honourable Ravunawa. I was going to add the fact of the presence of the business individuals in our midst this morning, Mr. Sam Basra and Mr. Jeff Lal, who are hugely successful businessmen in Canada. I understand that the honourable Prime Minister had met them in one of his trips there, but I am beaten to it by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Koya. If I only would like to add my own personal experience, is one of my most enjoyable line of work as Vice Consular in New York in the late 1970s was to visit our Fijian communities, the diaspora all around America and Canada. What I noted then and it was untapped then, was the huge enthusiasm to assist our country and the contact that they have maintained. I am only adding that as an observation to the statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister this morning. There is a bit of bad news. Honourable Members, our Secretariat has been advised by the UNDP Fiji Parliament Support Project that the workshop that was planned for next week at the Coral Coast has been cancelled. But maybe this is a blessing in disguise. I think after this morning’s intervention by the various Members, I would like to encourage, in the light of the cancellation, the respective Standing Committees to continue with their Committee meetings until prorogation. Our Secretariat stands ready to facilitate these meetings, if required. Thank you, honourable Members. Pilot Tourism MSME Grant Fund HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this august House, members of the public, members of the media, ladies and gentlemen; that retreat was actually going to be held in my neighbourhood. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the day I took on the tourism portfolio till today, I receive requests from Fijians wanting to grow and to diverse their businesses in tourism. There was a gentleman who got a space by a big resort to set up a stable to operate horse riding, but he was not able to purchase the needed equipment. There was a lady who owns an art business, who wants to supply to more hotels, but needed help. But these businesses for whatever reason, could not tap into any of our established finance programmes. It was either that the programme had closed, they were ineligible, or the programme was focussed on other sectors, so we saw a gap. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a critical</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2327 role in our nation's economy. They represent the vast majority of businesses, contribute significantly to job creation and drive innovation at the grassroots level. The same is true for the tourism sector, not just in Fiji but globally. Some of today's greatest companies began as ideas. Some data suggest up to 80 percent of the sector comprises SMEs. These businesses are the lifeblood of our local economies, yet they often face challenges in accessing the resources needed to grow and thrive. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recognising this gap, in the 2024-2025 financial year, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation has been allocated $400,000 to implement the Pilot Tourism, Micro and Small Enterprises Fund. The Fund, an initiative of the Coalition Government, is the first of its kind for the tourism sector. It is designed to directly empower micro and small enterprises within the tourism sector by providing financial assistance in the form of a grant. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative reflects our Government's belief that the growth of our MSMEs is central to building a resilient and inclusive economy. We recognise that these small businesses form the backbone of our tourism sector. From friendly-run guesthouses and eco-lodges to local tour operators and handcraft producers, MSMEs embody the essence of Fijian hospitality and culture. Through the grants, we are creating a platform for these enterprises to rebuild, innovate and contribute to the larger vision of sustainable economic growth. These grants are not just for accommodation providers, it is to grow more experiences and activities. Globally, we see that today's traveller is not choosing a destination solely based on the hotel brand. There used to be the belief that tourism in Fiji or sun, sand and sea, it is much broader than they are today. They want more immersive experiences where they leave their hotels and take part in community and cultural activities. This is an area that the Ministry wishes to focus on, because as investments takes shape in hotels and new markets come into Fiji, we need to be able to cater for their different needs. I wanted to share that the programme is being overseen by a public private panel. Besides government agencies, we have partners like the Fiji Hotel and Tourism Association, Fiji Development Bank and Business Assistance Fiji. Through these grants, we want to support small businesses who want to enhance their product and experiences. It could be a village who has a waterfall and wants to build a small trail, it could be a new hiking route that wants to improve signage. To be eligible, you must be a Fijian citizen of 18 years of age and above, be a registered business in operation for two years, majority Fijian-owned or, at least, 51 percent engaged in tourism, with majority of revenue comes from the tourism sector; and ability to meet the one-third project cost. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative is more than just financial assistance. It is a demonstration of our Coalition Government’s dedication to creating opportunities for all Fijians. Tourism remains a cornerstone of our economy, and we are determined to provide it with the right type of support - support that empower small businesses to succeed and innovate, ensuring their long-term sustainability. This programme is not an isolated effort, it is part of a larger integrated vision to ensure Fiji’s tourism sector remains resilient, inclusive and globally competitive. From the Na Vualiku Tourism Development Programme to the Farm to Fork Initiative, we are creating a network of support that empowers entrepreneurs, sustains communities and drives innovation. This Government has shown time and again that we are committed to the principles of inclusivity and shared progress. The Fund is yet another example of our resolve to bring impactful, transformative change to the lives of our people.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2328 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now have the honour of informing this august House and the public that the pilot programme will be live and available effective tomorrow, Wednesday, 4 th December, 2024. The application is available on our website: www.mpca.gov.fj and we will be reaching out to the various divisional offices of government to make these forms available. To our partners and stakeholders, we invite you to join us in supporting this initiative and ensuring a success. Together, we can create an ecosystem where every business, regardless of its size, has the tools to succeed, and to all Fijians, this is our journey. The Coalition Government remains committed to working with you every step of the way, ensuring that no one is left behind, as we build a brighter and more prosperous Fiji. With determination, vision and unity, we will ensure that tourism continues to be a source of strength and pride for our nation, empowering entrepreneurs and enriching lives. Vinaka vakalevu Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial speech this morning and just to support him, Sir, also to say that this is a very, very good initiative that is actually being started tomorrow in terms of the tourism MSME Grant Fund. One of the things that we must remember is that this is not the only programme that MSMEs can actually tap into, so to his neighbour sitting next to him, there is the Trade Enhancement Programme (TEP) under his Ministry that the tourism operators can tap into as well. These are great things for our MSMEs sector. Just to put it into perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, pre-COVID, I think the MSME sector actually contributed about 18 percent to Fiji's GDP and 60 percent of it was also to the national workforce. Now, following the impact of COVID, a lot of people also who lost their jobs went into the MSME sector and so a lot had to be done to encourage them and, again, the tourism industry has actually benefited from it. A lot of them supported themselves through these small livelihoods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the grant has some success. There are previous grants that we have done for tourism and through Tourism Fiji, similar ones, and two of them stand out as having done extremely well and these kinds of grants are also being supported by Tourism Fiji. I think everyone in Fiji and worldwide knows about our Sabeto Horseraces. Aviva Farms was actually a recipient of that particular tourism grant, and it is a massive success story of this particular initiative or this kind of initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know from having been at that particular races at that time that it is not just a Fiji phenomenon, it is a worldwide phenomenon now. Everyone looks forward to it. It is a great day out and, of course, it is the weather in the West where everything is the best, obviously, Sir. But these are the initiatives that actually work for our tourism sector. I also know that Zipline Fiji was also one of the recipients for the earlier initiative. So, this particular initiative given by the Ministry of Finance in terms of about $400,000 to support our small tourism businesses is welcomed and much look forward to, as an add on, to whatever else is being done at the Ministry of Trade. I think the TEP actually allows it also. So, we have a wonderful opportunity for our MSMEs to grow and in order to increase our cultural and community experiences in the tourism industry, it aligns with the modern traveller demand. Most people are looking for authenticity nowadays and these are areas that we can actually tap into.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2329 Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a small way, this also contributes towards our economy in terms of diversification and reliance on very little things, but these things actually manage to make us grow. We saw that in times of need, people started doing many small businesses that still exists nowadays through these initiatives. The MSME sector is the engine for growth for our economy and I take my hat off to the honourable Minister for starting this particular initiative on the back of all the other small initiatives for our MSMEs that actually exist around the country. At the end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said regarding the TEP, I hope the honourable Minister for Trade is actually forcefully trying to encourage more and more people to get on to this Programme. I also understand which is commendable, Sir, it is not just about the handing out of the money, there are training programmes, et cetera, that exist which is also very commendable because this is an industry that we can actually grow more and more. I thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the Leader of the G9-Bloc or his designate for his response. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, honourable Gavoka, on the statement that he has been delivered on the Pilot Tourism MSME Grant Fund. We thank the Coalition Government for launching this particular programme in the 2024- 2025 Budget. There is also $400,000 that is allocated for this particular support to support small tourism businesses especially in our communities. It will offer about a sum of $15,000 for applicants who can apply, given the applications will be available tomorrow online and also the requirement that is there that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has already announced, plus the one-third that they also have to contribute. But thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister for addressing the gap, and that gap has been there for a very long time. This particular funding will address the financial access that many of those, for the last 8 years to 16 years, have been denied, especially when we go down to Inter- Continental, those operators are always at the borders of the hotel. They do horse riding, catering, plus other handicrafts. This will assist them in providing better facilities for them, given the demands of travellers are now changing, not only do they want the sun, sand and sea, they probably also want our heritage, spiritual tourism plus other things that they have more interest to them, sigidrigi, mekes that are available elsewhere, those kind of knowledge will assist all given another Bill that the Ministry of iTaukei are also consulting on cultural expression and traditional knowledge that will also capture this new form of tourism that marketing our culture and the taste of the tourist and travellers coming in. That will generate more income to our community especially in villages. More activities they can do to improve their facilities, footpath, community halls and other things the ladies can also improve and empower them through business. It can also create employment. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and that is my response, and again thank you for addressing that gap that has been there for long. I hope it continues and this particular programme that more awareness and consultation will be done so that the staff from the Ministry can go out there and explain to those applicants where the application forms are and what are the requirements that needs to be done. On another note, also to assist our landowners. If the Ministry of iTaukei and TLTB can look into other services that can provide to our landowners in terms of making business plans. These are also costly to them, and it can be effected as part of this, so that it can help in the registration of businesses before they are eligible to the requirement of this MSME. Those are few words that I</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2330 would like to contribute, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank you for allowing me and giving me the opportunity to respond. MR. SPEAKER.- I have two more Ministerial Statements to be made. In the light of the hour that we have reached at this point, honourable Members, we will suspend the proceedings for lunch. Parliament will resume proceedings at 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.20 p.m.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2331 The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. 21 st Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Meeting HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and all those tuning in live on Parliament’s Facebook channel; ni sa yadra vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a Statement on Fiji’s hosting of the 21 st Commission for the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC), which was held in Suva from Thursday, 28 th November till today, Tuesday, 3 rd December, and catered for 470 participants. I would like to show my Ministry and the Commission’s sincere gratitude in thanking the honourable Prime Minister of Fiji for his gracious leadership and support in accepting our invitation to be chief guest at the official opening of the meeting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission for the Conservation of Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean is one of the five global tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), and is, perhaps, the largest regional fisheries management organisation, catering to over 50 percent of the world’s tuna catches. The WCPFC convention area caters to approximately 20 percent of the earth’s surface with the Western boundary to the East Asian seaboard, excluding the South China Sea and the Eastern boundary, to the overlap area of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission - one of the five RFMOs the southern boundary to the 60 degrees South and the northern boundary to Alaska and Bering Sea. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the WCPFC Convention was established to conserve and manage tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks across the Western Central Ocean and was established on 19 th June, 2004, with its Secretariat based out at Pohnpei in the Northern Pacific Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the WCPFC is made up of 26 co-operating members, seven co-operating members from participating territories and seven co-operating non-members. It should be noted that whilst all three categories take on the Conservation Management Measures (CMMs) developed under this RFMO, only the initial two categories may take part in the decision-making process. Observers are also welcomed to the meeting, and they are categorised with an observer status. There are 24 inter-governmental organisations and 38 non-governmental organisations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission is built on the United Nation’s Fish Stocks Agreement principles to address the Western Central Pacific Ocean’s unique political, socio-economic, geographical and environmental characteristics. The Commission progresses much of its work through its four subsidiary bodies on an annual basis and deliberates on their outcomes towards a decision-making process, like the WCPFC. The four such bodies of the Commission are the: (1) Scientific Committee which ensures that the Commission utilises the best available scientific information to develop appropriate CMMs in order to allow for a long-term sustainability of the highly migratory fish stocks in the convention area. (2) Technical Compliance Committee (TCC) is the enforcement committee which reviews members adherence to the Commission’s decisions and compliance to the CMMs that are developed therein. This is often done in closed sessions with members only in the</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2332 deliberations. (3) Northern Committee which provides recommendations to the Commission on species found 20 degrees North of the convention area. It should also be noted that not all members of the Commission are represented at the Northern Committee. (4) Finance and Administrative Committee is the Committee that deliberates and advises the Commission on matters related to its budget, finances and administration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission’s decision-making processes are usually made by consensus. Where voting will be needed, the Convention also provides a two chambered voting mechanism, with member countries of the Pacific Islands Foreign Fisheries Agency (FFA) forming one chamber and the non-FFA membership countries forming the second chamber. Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to this, Fiji has access to three funding mechanisms under the Commission, allowing it and other developing States and participating Territories to meet their obligation under the Commission, and they are the: (1) Special Requirements Fund; (2) (3) Chinese Taipei Trust Fund. Japanese Trust Fund; and As a Commission member, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji ensures that it consistently meets its obligations under treaties and other legally binding arrangements regarding the harvesting and managing of highly migratory fish stocks in the Commission’s convention area. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to highlight that under Article 30 of the Convention text, there is recognition of the special requirements of developing States, an element that Fiji sees to in the development of the Commission’s conservation management measures. Moreso, Fiji remains vigilant on the application of these elements, so as not to affect Fiji’s sovereignty and sovereign rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is the only longline fishing industry in the Pacific Island Countries with a fully domesticated longline fleet. To ensure the protection, sustainable management and development of our domestic longline fishery, the Ministry prioritises the needs of our domestic fishing industry, to ensure its long-term viability as a thriving sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has obligations under the Convention and includes but is not limited to the implementation of the zone-based management, the adoption of the target reference points, maintaining rights in fish stocks, developing robust harvest strategies and addressing climate change impacts on tuna fisheries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to the above and to maintain and protect our interests, and reinforce our support to the region, Fiji takes a proactive stance in chairmanship to the following technical working groups in the Commission and they are the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Intersessional Working Group on South Pacific Albacore Tuna. The Southern Albacore Tuna species primarily dominates Fiji’s tuna catch within our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Hence, the need for a scientifically based, regionally acceptable catch rate and an adoption of a target reference point that provides the best vulnerable biomass outcome for the long-term viability and sustainability of the species.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2333 On the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Port State Measures Technical Working Group, Fiji is combating illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing within our EEZ and the high seas, much like the Commission’s membership and as such, it is leading the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) discussions in the region to address this phenomena. Mr. Speaker, Sir, because tuna fisheries is important to the Pacific Island countries as it provides economic benefits and food security, the 21 st WCPFC Meeting was attended by Fisheries Ministers from Palau, Niue, the Kingdom of Tonga and Marshall Islands. Also included in the participation of the Meeting was the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, which clearly demonstrates, Sir, the importance of the tuna fishery in their respective island countries. As the tuna stock are highly migratory, we have a shared responsibility to manage it sustainably. Meeting with fellow Fisheries Ministers underscores our leadership roles in managing and conserving the tuna fish stocks in our Pacific Ocean. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji, along with the FFA membership in the WCPFC, reinforces the concept of a special requirement of developing States and Territories under Article 30 of the Convention, the: • membership’s commitment to developing robust harvest strategies that will build resilience in the light of ecosystem changes by climate change; • membership's commitment to the South Pacific Albacore Fishery via the provision of a functional management framework; • development of a conservation management measure on labour standards for fishing crews; • development of an electronic monitoring longline minimum data requirements; and • review of the regional transshipment measure that is poised to strengthen the regulation of this activity in the high seas. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the subject arising out of the WCPFC meeting agenda, Fiji continues to seize this and other like opportunities to foster and strengthen our relations with other Pacific Island countries, fishing nations and fishing stakeholders to collaborate and share knowledge, resources and best practices to address critical issues such as the impacts of overfishing, the IUU phenomena and climate change. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji will continue to support the region in ensuring that sustainable management of these highly migratory resources and their associated management decisions are based on the best scientific information available and the utilisation of the precautionary approach where this has been developed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji will also continue to ensure that the elements of Article 30 of the Convention is reinforced in allowing developing States and Territories and even platform on developing and implementing the conservation management measures, whilst maintaining our sovereignty and sovereign rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I would like to reiterate our sincere appreciation to Cabinet support and decision to ensure the facilitation of hosting the 21 st Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Meeting here in Fiji, and look forward to providing an outcome document once the meeting processes have concluded. Vinaka vakalevu and thank you for your attention. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate for their response.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2334 HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for the detailed brief that she has given on Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and its role. I do not want to reiterate the detailed explanation that she has already made, which basically covers the responsibility of WCPFC and the technical areas that they are responsible for. I would just like to make some general observations on the importance of WCPFC within the Pacific region, and Fiji has always been considered as the powerhouse as it leads the South Pacific in its negotiations with big island nations in this meeting. The last meeting was held at Sheraton in 2015 and then in Manilla after that, and this is the third one that I have come across. But I thank the Government, and I thank the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, for having been able to accommodate and host such a huge concentration of people from all over the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of members who do not understand the content or the constitution of the WCPFC, it is the Pacific Islands that control the biggest tuna stock, which constitutes about 50 percent, and the honourable Minister has alluded to that. It is our responsibility as big ocean States to make sure the stock stays above normal and the resources are used for the benefit of the Pacific Islands. The WCPFC and the Pacific Islands have a role that they understand very well. As the honourable Minister alluded to, every decision has to be on consensus, and this is the only time that the small island States in the Pacific can check off the big countries of Asia and Europe. In their effort to take the resources within the Pacific region, it is the consensus by the Pacific Islands that checks them and as it is by consensus, normally the Pacific Islands led by Fiji, would not agree to any conditions that will badly affect the resource owners in the Pacific, in other words, that will not benefit the Pacific Islands. In two instances, I have found that the Ministers that were present can force the bigger islands, especially South-East Asia, like Japan and the other islands in South-East Asia and Europe, to listen to them because any walkout by the Pacific Islands will basically mean that the decision will be nullified. I must state here an example, Mr. Speaker, Sir. At one time, the Japanese did not agree to the repatriation of the sick on board fishing vessels to be the responsibility of countries that are fishing in the Pacific. Basically, the Pacific Islands stood their ground and said, “If you do not take that responsibility, we will not allow you to fish in the Pacific.” That stand influenced the Japanese to reach back to their capital and ask them to agree to the Pacific and that was what happened in Manila, Philippines. Again, I thank the honourable Minister for highlighting the aspects that she has raised, and I thank you for your time, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate for their response. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for her Statement this afternoon and certainly align with the sentiments she expressed with regards to Fiji’s relationship under Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the obligations that we have, and the important role that WCPFC plays in our part of the world as far as the management of the migratory species of tuna and looking after our tuna fishery. If I may just speak very quickly on the hosting of the event here in Fiji, I think Fiji is showcasing its ability to host big events in Fiji. I thank the Government for allowing and giving the opportunity for that hosting to be happening in Fiji and I am happy to see that this one is happening</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2335 in Suva, pulling it all the way back here to Suva. We had a lot of events happening on the other side of the island, but I think Suva is also developing its capacity to hold and host these types of events. It is an aspect of the nation that is now beginning to be well known as that we are able to host and manage these big events very well. I hope that that will continue into the future. I thank the Ministry of Fisheries for the work that they do in trying to manage this tuna fishery, a very unique one for albacore that we have in Fiji and I am sure, as we have heard from the honourable Minister, WCPFC helps a lot in that regard. MR. SPEAKER.- Out of interest, honourable Koroilavesau, I think one of my top students at the Marine Studies in my days of teaching there was your son. So, I think I know where knowledge and wisdom comes from. Thank you. 2024 World Vocational and Technical Educational Development Conference HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I rise to provide a brief to this august House on my recent Ministerial engagement in the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference in Tianjin, China. During the above visit, Fiji had been engaged in multilateral meetings with the Education Ministers from more than 100 countries around the world. As part of the visit, the Fijian delegation visited Luban Workshop Research and Promotion Centre to observe the technical and vocational programmes carried out at the Centre, as a follow up to the honourable Prime Minister's earlier visit to China. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People's Republic of China’s honourable Minister for Education had extended an invitation for Fiji to be part of the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference which was held from 20 th November, 2024 to 22 nd November, 2024. The entire cost of the visit was borne by the Chinese Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of Parliament, the Conference is held every two years, the last being in 2022, whilst the next Conference will be held in 2026 where each participating country will be required to present on the achievements relating to their TVET systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian delegation had the opportunity to have a bilateral meeting with the Minister for Education, honourable Huai Jinpeng, to discuss the possibility of developing a communal-based programme for capacity building which is to be piloted in the Rewa Province. The programme will feature the utilisation of the Luban Model, which would be further explored through bilateral meetings with the Ambassador to China, Mr. Robert Lee, and the Minister for Education for the People's Republic of China. The discussions focussed on the student and teacher exchange programme, cultural exchanges, TVET teaching training, sharing of resources and the review and development of TVET programmes to include entrepreneurial skills for primary and secondary schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Fiji's High Commission in China, the Fijian Ministerial Delegation was privileged to visit the Luban Workshop and Promotion Centre and were met with senior staff led by Vice Dean of Luban Light Industry Vocational Technical College, Professor Li Yunmei.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2336 The Centre is an international cooperative project that focuses in cultivating technical skills and engineering practice in a modern apprentice’s workplace, making it a distinguished representation of Chinese Vocational Education. The teaching model in Luban is based on Engineering, Practice Innovation and Project (EPIP) that had shaped the vocational education system in China through students and teacher training and has expanded its partnership to more than 30 countries through vocational and higher education training. Some of the key outcomes of the discussions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, held in Luban were: • • • • • • fostering and enhancing of bilateral relations between the two countries through vocational training in areas of need to Fiji. the possibility of exploring scholarships for Fijian students who wish to further their education through high quality vocational training at the Tianjin Luban Workshop. both the parties agreed to consider engaging on teachers upskilling training programme currently employed at the Luban Workshop and introduce the advanced teaching models and high-quality equipment to our vocational training. options for online training for both teachers and students have been explored with the possibility of utilising the Ministry of Education's digital and e-learning platform. the possibility for craftsmen’s skills training at village level was also explored. The concept would provide villagers with entrepreneurial skills that could be tailor-made into the Fijian village enterprising context. It is an approach to develop communities and provide a mean to eradicate poverty through economic empowerment at village level. through the scholarship awards, both ethnic groups will be encouraged to understand each other's culture through the cultural exchange programme. The exchange scheme will help break down stereotypes and helps in building bridges of friendship and respect for other cultures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to inform Parliament that the Luban Workshop have expanded outside of China to more than 33 countries, providing internationally certified training, and Fiji would be the 34 th partnering country, and the first partnering country, and the first in the Pacific to partner with, through the development of technical and vocational training. Mr. Speaker, Sir, meetings between the participating Education Ministers agreed that each participating country conduct a SWOT analysis of its TVET system. On this note, the Ministry of Education through the Technical Vocational Education Training Unit submitted a proposal to China outlining the specific support, areas needed and how both countries can work in collaboration to enhance Fiji's TVET system before the next 2026 Conference. The exercise would include visits to our national TVET training providers and industries to assess the strengths, weaknesses and plans which will assist in the development of a clear pathway, review and curricula mapping and prioritising of Fiji's TVET needs. Sir, the TVET report would encompass recommendations, an implementation, plan and a monitoring and evaluation mechanism which focuses on the National TVET Policy. Fiji will assist the People's Republic of China’s development of an implementation plan and monitoring mechanism for TVET Systems in participating countries as part of the Tianjin Consensus before the next World Conference. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key takeaways on Curriculum Review from the 2024 Tianjin TVET Conference include the:</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2337 (1) (2) Integration of Entrepreneurial Skills Training at Primary Level A team consisting of Officials from the Ministry of Education’s TVET and Curriculum Unit will develop a plan to pilot and implement the revised Integrated Entrepreneurial Education Curriculum for Primary Education by 2025. By incorporating creativity, problem-solving, basic financial literacy, collaboration and social responsibility into the classroom, the children can begin to develop skills at the early age that will benefit them in many areas of life. These entrepreneurial skills are not just for future business owners, they are also valuable for personal development, leadership and understanding the world around them. Introduction of TVET Programmes at ECE and Primary Level The team will explore the integration of TVET programmes into the Early Childhood Education (ECE) and primary curricula in 2025. Integrating TVET programmes into ECE and primary education requires a holistic approach that balances practical vocational skills with academic learning. It also focuses on enhancing capability of both, educators and students, through professional development, curriculum integration and community involvement. (3) Review of Education Act and National Curriculum Framework (NCF) A team consisting of senior officers from the Ministry of Education will develop a proposal to be considered during the review of the Education Act and the National Curriculum Framework. The review will include the integration of Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) goals and principles. (4) International Visits for TVET and Education System Improvement The Ministry of Education will identify relevant officers to study the TVET and education systems in countries like South Korea, Japan, Singapore, China, Finland, New Zealand and Australia, between the period 2025 and 2026. Upon their return, these officers will develop discussion papers with recommendations for improving Fiji's TVET and education systems through pilot programmes starting in 2027. Their findings will inform the revision of proposals and discussion papers for implementation by 2028. The Ministry of Education’s Training Unit will develop a proposal detailing the visits, their findings and suggestions for adopting best practices from these countries and will coordinate with the hosting countries on the purpose of their visit. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for his response. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement on the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference in Tianjin, China, which obviously is addressing this problem which is a global one. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister talked about various things that he has learnt, then he talked about the need for a SWOT. I will give my short analysis of what the weaknesses and the threats are of the system that we have in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our system in Fiji, coupled with a massive migration of skills that we have, means we have severe skills shortage that have been exacerbated over the past two years to three years. It has been severely exacerbated, which is going to have a strong impact on our country. The fundamental problem is because we do not have a national skills development plan. In</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2338 this country, if you look at all the assessments, they are all talking about supply. This institute is supplying that, this institute is supplying that, but there is no good data on demand. If you want to be able to produce people for the sector, you will need to understand what the sector wants. This is the big problem about this TVET. There is that lack of information demand and this is not easy to do, I admit. It is not easy to get a firm grip on demand, on what is needed, because sometimes, demand is not very easy to be able to get. Now, we have a good system that is established in Fiji. We have established a National Qualifications Framework. We have the Higher Education Commission, under that, they are supposed to establish national qualifications based on the industrial demands of each particular sector. But the link between this setup (infrastructure), there is a setup here and getting the demand data has been lacking. This is the big problem that we have. How do we know that this is happening? We know that 70 percent of the workers that we need in this country are TVET workers, but more than 70 percent to 80 percent of our funding goes to non-TVET workers. This is a huge imbalance. So, there is an imbalance - what we know the problem to be and where we are putting money, that is a major imbalance. That is something that needs to be addressed. In order to meet the demand, you will need to understand the demand. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the setup in place, but it is not working well. Without that plan, without getting the demand, we will be just talking about supply and conceiving of things that need to be done, and you do not follow it through. This is the problem that you find throughout this particular system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TVET is different from education. The purpose of education is to increase someone’s ability to understand something. Sir, TVET is about jobs. Jobs means it must be directly related to what the people who are going to employ them need. This is where the biggest weakness we have. Doing this sort of labour market analysis is not cheap. It is something that we have to invest in, systems and structures are going to take time, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance will know. It is not easy to be able to do that, but it is something that we need to do. The other thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, demand is frequent because it changes. Around the world now, there is a focus on digitalisation industry. In all these things, everything is digital, everything is to be changing fast. One of the problems that we have now, we identify demand, we design a programme, we put in the output for that programme, and by the time people graduate, it is too late, things have already changed. So, the way in which we structure courses has to change, it has to be short courses, it has to be continual learning or sometimes delay the specialisation in training and do the specialisation just before people are about to enter the job market so that the specialisation meets the exact need in the market at that point in time. I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go and learn, if we have gone on about all the things that are happening around the world, if you do not address this fundamental challenge of understanding demand, and then tailor-make the programmes that even if the demands change and they evolve, the product that you get will meet the requirement of the market at that particular point in time. I have made two suggestions - lifelong learning, short courses, modular types of packages, micro qualifications, all these things coupled together. I think it is already happening to some degree. Polytech, whoever it is, is immaterial, Fiji National University, anyone that can deliver the job because one of the fundamental problems that we have, one of the mistakes that the honourable Minister for Education said, the staff from the Ministry of Education are going to look at TVET. Wrong approach! You need to have the right people with the right lens.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>2339 People from the Ministry of Education look at it from an education lens. That is how they have been trained. Academics look at things from an academic lens. That is how they have been trained. People need to look at these things from a TVET lens. People that have gone through these ways of thinking and training, their ways of looking at things are very different. You need to use the right sort of person. I talk about this passionately because it is something close to my heart. And the things that I am talking about here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are not easy to address, and I agree. However, I believe we have the structure that is there. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Usamate, you have exhausted your time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Thank you, honourable Usamate. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, for their response. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to respond to the Ministerial Statement made by the honourable Minister for Education, updating this august House on his recent Ministerial Engagement at the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference in Tianjin, China. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I thank the honourable Minister for briefing this august House on what had transpired during the conference which is a major event for vocational education, characterised by high standards, significant exchange and fruitful outcomes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Minister, the theme of the 2024 World Vocational and Technical Education Development Conference was, “Innovation Empowers the Future, Skills Shapes Lives,” which aimed at advancing vocational education as a driver of innovation and sustainable development worldwide. The event was meant as a catalyst for change, marked by openness and inclusivity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to move with times, and with such conferences, it would enhance and benefit our education sector, and I concurred with honourable Huai Jinpeng, China’s Minister for Education, when he stated that vocational education should align with the trends of the times, uphold the essence of education and preserve its unique characteristics. It should anchor its innovative development goals amid evolving opportunities and challenges, striving for breakthroughs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) was established in Fiji in 2017 through the Higher Education Act and it is acknowledged as a cornerstone of educational reform and supporting sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is a type of education and training that focusses on providing students with practical skills and knowledge for a specific trade or vocation. It is often considered an alternative to traditional academic routes, such as university or college, and is designed to prepare students for a specific career or occupation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I commend the Ministry of Youth and Sports for the work that they do with regards to youth development and providing second chance programmes throughout its five training centres in the four Divisions, targeted at disadvantaged youths, who cannot continue in the formal education system.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>2340</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also commend the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs plans and intentions to improve the standard of living for the iTaukei communities by lowering dropout rates and unemployment through prioritising TVET, so that it can help develop iTaukei students to be resilient and excel academically. Mr. Speaker, Sir, vocational and technical education should not only be regarded as providing second chances to our youth who cannot continue in the formal education system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, stated by Ellen G. White, all youth need to be taught that life means earnest work, responsibility and caretaking. They need a training that will make them practical men and women who can cope with emergencies. They should be taught the discipline of systematic, well- regulated labour is essential, not only as a safeguard against the vicissitudes of life, but as an aid to all-around development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, she further stated that schools should be established, that in addition to the highest mental and moral culture, shall provide the best possible facilities for physical development and industrial training. Instructions should be given in agriculture, manufactures, covering as many as possible of the most useful trade, also in household economy, healthy cookery, sewing, hygienic dressmaking, the treatment of the sick and kindred lines, gardens, workshops and treatment rooms should be provided, and the work in every line should be under the direction of skilled instructors. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, TVET is important as it will provide students with skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen career, and to help address any skills gaps in the job market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this type of education and training can be an excellent choice for individuals who are looking for a more hands-on practical approach to learning, and who want to get started in a specific career as quickly as possible.</p></body>
