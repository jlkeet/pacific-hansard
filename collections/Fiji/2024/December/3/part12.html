<body><h3>2025 PARLIAMENT SITTINGS CALENDAR</h3><h4>2025 PARLIAMENT SITTINGS CALENDAR</h4><p>March Monday 3rd – Friday 7 th Monday 10 th – Friday 14 th April June 28 th April to 2 nd May 2 nd June to 6 th June 27 th June 7 th July to 11 th July 4 th August to 8 th August July August September/October 29 th September to 3 rd October 3 rd November to 7 th November November Address Response to His Excellency the and President’s Parliament Sitting will be for two weeks. This had been discussed in the Business Committee where Government also brought up the issue of time for more debate and not only the Government, but also the Opposition side in terms of the Government’s legislative programme and the Bills which were due. Parliament Sitting Parliament Sitting Budget Announcement Budget Debate Parliament Sitting Parliament Sitting Parliament Sitting As is now customary, Sir, the days for the Budget Address and the ensuing Budget debate has been set for July rather than done in earlier years.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 2025 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 2307 The Sitting Calendar, Sir, will enable all six Standing Committees to continue working on Annual Reports that are pending with the Committees and any Bills that may be brought before this House. This is also the suggested Sitting Calendar which needs the cooperation of all honourable Members, as far as those two matters are concerned. Committees are crucial channels for Parliament to communicate with the public, and their service is crucial for accountability and scrutiny tools. It is critical to give them time in order for them to complete their tasks. Sir, this is a new Government and we are working to improve our services to the people of the nation. This will also enable us to carry out our plans, policies and programmes, while the Standing Committees must continue to carry out and fulfil their role, as stipulated in the Standing Orders. I request all honourable Members to support the Sitting Calendar before the House as it will</p><h4>enable Parliament to continue its legislative representative and oversight duties.</h4><p>I should add that 2025 is a very important year, as far as Government is concerned, in terms of its legislative programme. Cabinet has approved the setting up of a Cabinet Sub-Committee on legislation which will facilitate Government’s legislative programme, and this Parliament C alendar will assist in enabling and facilitating that. In light of those important points, Sir, I commend this resolution to Parliament and ask honourable Members to support the proposed Sitting Calendar for 2025. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now open the floor for debate on the motion. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for presenting the Sitting Calendar. There are two issues that I would like to raise, the first one is, the month of July. We are assigned only one week for the Budget debate. We all know that Budget is a national event. It has a huge impact on businesses, people and, of course, on other agencies. During that period, it is very important that Members are given enough time to debate the Budget documents. We noticed in the last Sitting, that is, just last July, our speaking time was reduced and that is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, simply because it is a national event. It is an important event. Why was the speaking time reduced? Now, even the Budget debate is reduced by one week. Previously, we were given two weeks.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Budget Debate is one week:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> Previously, go and check! The other point that I would like to raise is on productivity. As Members of Parliament, we expect everyone else to be very productive, including civil servants. They must deliver. Are we delivering? Look at the time that the Parliament will not sit. Almost three months, we will not be sitting, and I do not understand why Parliament should be opening on 24 th February and not earlier than that. Last year, we were given the reason that some renovation work was going on in Parliament, therefore, we could not open Parliament on time but now, everything is in order. Why can we not open the Parliament earlier? We have to set the example for the rest of the country, and I do not understand why we are opening Parliament so late. So, those are my two points.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 2025 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 2308 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Tuisawau, do you wish to respond? HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the calendar as well, I have just checked very quickly and I see that we are going to be prorogued for nearly two months. I, as a Member of two Committees, including Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, knowing how much work we have, I know, Sir, that in the past, we have been allowed to sit during prorogation. I have just checked very quickly, so I am just asking all the Chairpersons to, please, write to your good office and your good self, Sir, to ask for permission to sit during prorogation. As honourable Kumar has pointed out, there is a lot of work to do. There are Bills and Annual Reports and Committee Reports that we need to table as quickly as possible. So, just begging your indulgence and just reminding the honourable Chairpersons of all the Standing Committees to do the right thing and write to Mr. Speaker’s Office, as has been accepted in the past. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was part of the Business Committee that had agreed to this Sitting Calendar, so I will not talk about the calendar per se, since I was a party to that decision. But, let me say that one of the things that we have seen ever since this Government came into being, there has been a decline in the number of days that we have in Parliament. We have witnessed the ineptitude of Government. They would set a calendar and all of a sudden, they do not know in advance the dates on which they are supposed to have important gatherings, such as the United Nations General Assembly, the COP, et cetera. Because of this ineptitude and incompetence on their part, the inability on themselves and their staff to make sure that they know when major events are taking place around the world that they need to attend, they have not taken that into account. Now, I understand that they have learned, two years in a row, sitting days have been taken out. We have endorsed this Calendar and it is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is no further change. If there is any further change to this Sitting Calendar, it will demonstrate the incompetence and the ineptitude of those who are in Government. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to recall the comments by the honourable Deputy Speaker as well. Itis not two months, it is going to be three months. We were allowed to actually sit next week, but because of the retreat, we will not be able to sit as well. So, it is November, December and whole of February. Then looking at March, we are going to sit for two weeks. When there is no Committee meeting, what are we actually going to discuss in Parliament, because it is the Committee reports that are basically debated? All I am actually requesting Government is to reconsider the Calendar, and if we can actually have Parliament prorogued for one month and, at least, Standing Committees to be given time. Looking at the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, we have more than 200 financial reports to be audited, because we have, at least, three years or four years of whole of Government reports to be scrutinised and it takes time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Because of all the delays:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Oh come on man! Talk some sense. We are talking about the calendar, and you are talking nonsense here. You are not part of the Committee so, please, do not comment.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 2025 Calendar of Parliament Sittings 2309 With that in mind, I will request if Parliament can be prorogued for one month and Committees to be allowed to sit from January so that we can complete our work. As the Standing Orders say that although we can actually come to the Speaker, but it is not part of the Standing Order. Standing Orders say that when Parliament is prorogued, all the Committee work comes to a halt. Considering that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my request is if the prorogation period can be reduced from three months to one month. MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps, if it will help in our arriving at a solution, as requested by honourable Qereqeretabua, we are all in this together, including this Chair. For my part, I will certainly entertain and request for sittings after prorogation if it is allowed under our Standing Orders. If there are precedents, we will consider that as well. So, that will probably help ease the burden which has been referred to by honourable Qereqeretabua and honourable Maharaj. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to quickly respond to some of the comments made by the other side on the Calendar, as honourable Usamate has quite rightly said, this has been agreed by the Business Committee. But on what honourable Kumar said, I find that hypocrisy from her never ends. We never had two weeks of Budget debate during your eight years in government and you people were sitting there. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the timetable that we have agreed to in the Business Committee makes a lot of sense. One week of Budget debate is fine and I can tell….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, honourable Maharaj. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has just stated that there were no two weeks of sitting… MR. SPEAKER.- One moment, honourable Maharaj. Let me makes this very clear. When you raise a point of order, it specifically refers to a Standing Order? So, before I allow you to continue, you cite me or you quote me the Standing Order you are referring to. before I will let you proceed. Now, which Standing Order are you referring to?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Standing Order 70, relevance, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance just stated that there were no two weeks of sitting for the Budget:</span> He was a part of Parliament and during the 2014 National Budget and 2015 National Budget, we were actually sitting for two weeks. (Honourable Prof. B. C. Prasad interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> No, you said for the last eight years.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order! HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to correct that in this Parliament, that there were two Budget Sittings that were for two weeks. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Maharaj.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>2310 Point of Order 3 rd December, 2024 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know honourable Maharaj is trying to justify this based on one or two sittings, but the fact is, in the last Parliament, we had one week’s Budget Debate. After the 2015 Budget, we had one week, and I can assure them that the next Budget will be a good budget. One week debate will be good enough for them. So, this Calendar, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we have agreed in the Business Committee, it makes sense, and it will provide enough time. A lot of the work that is being done is done in the Committees and I want to thank you for making that suggestion that you will look at whether it is allowable. If that is allowable, we will support that the Committees can meet before we sit in March. In fact, it was the Government side that suggested an additional week in March, so we have a two- week sitting in March, where we are going to look at a lot of the Bills that we are going to debate as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.-Honourable Members, I think enough has been said on the issue of the Calendar which had been agreed to by the Business Committee of which all of the Members are represented through your various delegates. So, I now call on the Leader of Government in Parliament to speak in reply. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you alluded to, it has been approved by the Business Committee, so the Business Committee is represented by Government, the G-16 Bloc and G-9 Bloc. Generally, it was a very cordial discussion, compared to what happened today. There was understanding by all Members, and we have also taken into account, even though honourable Usamate mentioned two words, “incompetence” and “ineptitude”, in terms of our management of the calendar, but let me stress that one or two of the changes which happened was in the national interest. So, you really cannot equate incompetence or ineptitude to national interest. National interest is something that we really need to consider, especially if it involves meetings related to the Heads of Governments, of key powers in the world and with the honourable Prime Minister, which is very strategic for our country. We have also taken into account the UNGA, COP, the CHOGRM, et cetera, and after consultation with all Ministries, and I thank the Members of the Business Committee for endorsing the Calendar. MR. SPEAKER.-We will now proceed to vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER- Thank you, we will now move on to the next item.</p></body>
