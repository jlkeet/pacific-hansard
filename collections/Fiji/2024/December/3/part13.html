<body><h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3><h4>POINT OF ORDER</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise on a Point of Order, Standing Order 74. I am raising this issue in relation to something that was quite unprecedented to my memory, something that happened yesterday, when a Member of the Opposition, the honourable Alvick Maharaj, raised a Point of Order. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 74(1), it says, and I quote: “Any member may only raise a Point of Order if –</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Point of Order 2311 (a) (b) there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament; the member specifies…” The normal practice has always been, when a Member stands up on a Point of Order and quotes the Standing Order and talks about that issue, that issue is then addressed by the Speaker. That is the way that it has always been handled. When a Point of Order is made, the matter is then addressed by the Speaker. Yesterday, for the first time ever, without the Speaker ruling on that Standing Order, we had a Member of Parliament stand up. In this particular case, a Cabinet Minister, standing up and talking about that issue without giving the courtesy to the Speaker to address the issue. This is something that has never happened before. Always, when Point of Orders are made, they are addressed by the Speaker. So, we believe this is a serious breach of the whole process by which Point of Orders are made. A Point of Order is made by a Member of Parliament, it is the Speaker who makes the ruling. But in this particular case, a Cabinet Member, stands up and starts commenting on it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are worried that this might change. It has never happened before. It is always the Speaker who makes the decision. Now, if we are going to allow this to happen, every time a Member of the Opposition stands up to raise a Point of Order, a Cabinet Minister will then stand up to defend against it, without allowing the Speaker to make a decision on that Point of Order. And we see this, Sir as something that is very serious, and that needs to be stopped. When a Point of Order is raised, it is the Speaker, it is the position of Speaker that needs to make that ruling and not for anyone else or Member of Parliament to talk on this. So, we will beg your indulgence, Sir, to make a ruling on this, so that it does not happen again, because there could come a time whereby every time you make a Point of Order from this side, a Cabinet Minister stands up all of a sudden, without giving the courtesy to the Speaker to make that ruling and start talking on the issue at hand. So, that is the purpose of my raising this, and I hope you can see fit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make a ruling on this matter so we do not persist with it, because it has never happened in the past. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Usamate. I take your point to the extent that I understand that the practice, as far as the Standing Orders are concerned, when there is a Point of Order raised, it is specifically addressed to the Speaker and the Speaker decides on the Standing Order before any other Member indulges in that. I understand all that. Also, if you are referring specifically to Standing Order 74, it not only says that the matter is raised under Standing Order 74, but that it relates to another Standing Order which is breached. So, you are not only raising the issue under Standing Order 74, as far as honourable Maharaj is concerned, but he should have gone on and raised what specific Standing Order within Standing Orders are being breached. That we had not gone or indulged in. It just went as far as him raising the Standing Orders, and I did ask after my indulgence or my considering the issue, I had then asked honourable Tabuya to make a comment. After that, then I made a ruling on the point that was raised by him. So, I agree with you that there are certain rules that are to be followed as far as the Speaker is concerned, in so far as Standing Orders are concerned, and the Point of Order raised as a result through that under the provisions of Standing Order 74. Thank you. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when honourable Maharaj rose yesterday, he stood on Standing Order 7, and that was the issue. I am standing here to clarify to my viewpoint that Standing Order 74, what happened yesterday was not in accordance with what we have in Standing</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2312 Order 74. That is my point, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Usamate. I will take your comment on that. We will proceed to the next item. Honourable Members, there will be seven Committee Reports for tabling this morning.</p></body>
