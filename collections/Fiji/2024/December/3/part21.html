<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF WATERWAYS 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF WATERWAYS 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Ministry of Waterways 2017- 2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 3 rd October, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. NAND.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion in regards to the Committee’s Review Report on the Ministry of Waterways Annual Report 2017-2018 which was tabled in Parliament on 3 rd October, 2024. I acknowledge the effort of the Ministry of Waterways in safeguarding our environment and enhancing flood resilience through its key initiatives. The Ministry's work is fundamental to the safety and well-being of our communities, particularly in context of Fiji’s vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. Water is the fundamental resource of life. With the efficient management of waterways is integral to sustain development. The Ministry of Waterways under its</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>mandate has been at the forefront of ensuring that the country’s water system are resilient, equitable and productive. Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the obvious successes of the Ministry’s 2017-2018 initiative was the significant investment in the flood control infrastructure. Projects such as river dredging and construction of flood walls that have reduced the devastating impact of flood on our communities, particularly in the most flood prone areas of the country. These initiatives are key to protecting lives, property and ensuring that our infrastructure remains functional during prolonged extreme weather events. Despite these achievements Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has faced significant challenges particularly with the growing impact of climate change on our waterways and flood control systems. While the Ministry has made commendable progress, more work is needed to ensure that all waterways especially in coastal areas are resilient to the effect climate change. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is crucial that the Ministry revises its plan for adaptation of climate change and explores more innovative climate resilient infrastructure solutions. Another issue that the Ministry faced during the review period was the limitation of resources both in terms of financial support and manpower. The scale of flood mitigation and waterways restoration required to safeguard all vulnerable communities cannot be achieved with current resources. Madam Deputy Speaker, as we look at the future of the Ministry of Waterways remains steadfast in its mission to protect the management of our waterways in a sustainable and resilient manner. Together we continue to create a safer, more prosperous Fiji for generations to come. I urge the honourable Members of this august House to acknowledge the hard work done by the Ministry while continuing to offer support for the necessary investment and policy adjustments required to address the challenges ahead. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list with me, and I want to thank you in advance for sticking under your 10-minute time limit, as I am sure many of you just want to go home right now, maybe have a nice dinner and spend some time with your family. This is my list: (1) Honourable Leader of the Opposition; (2) Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; (3) Honourable Sachida Nand (4) Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport (5) Honourable P. K. Ravunawa; and (6) Honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Waterways (Right of Reply) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will try my best to be very brief as I will speak on probably four issues from the Committee deliberations and analysis, findings and recommendations, but before doing so, let me acknowledge the Committee for the good work and the Ministry as well. I know that the Ministry was established in 2017, had teething issues to go through and there were unfortunate incidences that was beyond our control - previous disasters and TC Josie and TC Keni in 2017 and there were some re-deployments. Of course, I know the issues in terms of capacities and capabilities as well. Very quickly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will just speak on are few things from the Report. One is on their Committee’s findings, I just want to speak on the issue of the low utilisation of the</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>2385 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 budget funds. This is not only in Waterways, but also a recurring issue and a common one in most government departments. I would urge the Government, Madam Deputy Speaker, perhaps it is time for us to review Government’s Financial Management Systems and the procurement processes as well. I say this because during my term, Madam Deputy Speaker, as Commissioner, I was part of the, was just into the end of the previous system that used to exist, particularly with the key ministries. Previously, we used to have what we call “Agency Tender Boards”. The Agency Tender Boards are especially given to big Ministries with bit allocations, such as Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Works, Ministry of Health, and the list goes on. There is a certain limit given to them so that they can expedite the processes of tender and, of course, procurement processes as well. Then we have what we call the “Divisional Tender Boards”. Above the Agency Tender Boards, we have the Divisional Tender Boards. I am just giving some thoughts so that probably, because of the recurring issue, maybe something that needs to be reconsidered. I, for one always say that we are not all crooks, we are not all thieves. Government’s responsibility is to put the systems and processes in place and penalties for those that do contravene the process or act otherwise. Just because someone did this, it does not mean that we are all going to do it, Madam Deputy Speaker. I know in the last budget, I did raise this, and I walked across the floor as well, speaking to are few Ministers including the honourable Minister for Finance because it comes under his portfolio. The procurement process and the financial management system which lays out the process, particularly when it comes to tender boards as well, because when it comes to tender boards, there even some small issues, it can be just issues on missing information. But coming all the way from Labasa to Suva and then goes back takes time, delays, delays and then something comes up and then money is diverted, money is used elsewhere, this is a major contributing factor. Sometimes this is just acquittals because acquittals were not done in the previous quarter, this causes delay and then the correspondence and whatever, and most Ministries perhaps do not have follow up systems from the headquarters of the Ministry into the Ministry for Finance and back and forth. This is my suggestion, Madam Deputy Speaker, because this has been a problem for a long time, and I hope the Assistant Minister for Finance will perhaps bring it to the attention of his Minister or probably something that they are already considering. Madam Deputy Speaker, the other issue that I want to speak on is just on Recommendation 2 – the Ministry strengthens its information management system. The reason why I am raising this, there are a lot of requests, and some are just lost along the process. In my visit to the North two weeks ago, thankful to the honourable Speaker's Office, I raised this with the Commissioner Northen when I paid a courtesy visit to his office. Governments change but the priorities remain the same. The needs of the communities remain the same. It is your responsibility to ensure that, that continues. Bring it back into the process, bring it back to the attention of those that are in leadership because the communities need this and that is why the information system, the database is so important. Of course, it will be helpful as well when it comes to, we are going to submit our long-term strategy and nationally determined contributions next year when it comes to climate financing. When we have the information available, then we are in a better position to seek the funding because the resources that we have, unfortunately cannot meet all our requests.</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>2386 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 Lastly, Madam Deputy Speaker, on recommendation five on capacity, on human resources, I wish to comment on this. The honourable Minister knows very well that LAWRM was just transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture into the Ministry of Waterways. One thing, capacity in terms of human resources, the honourable Minister knows that previously, we had Burmese engineers, a lot of foreign engineers, but you know, they have aged and most of them have returned. Unfortunately, for those from the Ministry that went to China, when they came back, they left to other organisations, so it is that capacity that we need and, of course, capability. I know that they do not have a dredger. I read in the Report, that most that of the work is outsourced. Probably that is something that needs to be considered as well, given that Fiji has so many rivers and we have issues of flooding. I hope that, that capability can be looked into as well, because when the Ministry for Waterways was formed part of the capability from the Ministry of Rural Development was given to the Ministry for Waterways. But that was package that, Ministry of Rural Development requested through JICA as a contingency, as a strategic reserve for the Ministry of Rural Development when disasters do strike, particularly in the rural areas where there was no Public Works Department (PWD). So, the capability as well, because that is what is keeping the Ministry running now, the trucks, the bulldozers and the heavy plant machinery. I hope that the Government will seriously look into not only the human resources aspect but the capability as well. Thank you, Madam Speaker. HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Waterways for the Year 2017-2018 that was tabled in this august Parliament on the 3 rd of October 2024. Let me from the offset mention that the importance of the waterways to agriculture cannot be overemphasised and right now, there is an enormous amount of work that we need to do to fix; one, our infrastructure that has existed for almost three to four decades now and is falling to pieces. I had already stated this in Parliament, and I had already stated also that it will be quite a costly exercise. The latest forecasts that I have discussed with my waterways engineers runs into almost a F$1 billion. But we will see, how we can work around this figure. So, as to make it possible for us to fix waterways. When we say infrastructure in waterways, we are talking about the seawalls, flood gates and we are talking about the very structure that holds the flood gates together. So, these are the ones that are falling apart, the very foundation is starting to give up. Madam Deputy Speaker, although the Report is an old one, many of the challenges highlighted by the Standing Committee regarding the Ministry of Waterway’s administrations, structure, budgetary allocation, programmes, reporting activities are still relevant and the Ministry is actively striving to address these issues. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry acknowledges the findings presented in the Report that highlights the failure to identify the key physical targets of the Ministry for the review period, the inadequate utilisation of the allocated funds, the lack of comprehensive information provision and the ineffective succession planning regarding the retention of staff and assets within the Ministry. I fully agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition and what he has stated regarding the need to review the systems and processes in terms of the approval of funds so as to fasten big infrastructure projects, like the ones that are undertaken in the Ministry of Agriculture. I also agree that we need to up our manpower intake in terms of getting in our qualified agricultural engineers because they are the ones who know the type of job that is required because they are water engineers, as well as civil engineers.</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>2387 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, the six recommendations put forward by the Standing Committee are noted and will be used as a guide for the Ministry to align the development of its policies, and the implementation of programmes and activities. The Ministry assures this august Parliament that it actively engaged in enhancing its information management system to establish a comprehensive and standardised reporting process. This initiative aims to facilitate the dissemination of effective information and to provide accurate reports on programmes pertinent to the Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, the Ministry is also committed to following all Government systems and processes, particularly the financial and operational procedures, and ensuring that all annual reports are submitted on time. But of course, with due consideration to what has been stated, that we need a review of the systems and processes to fast track the approval of funds. Finally, the Ministry is committed to improving its Human Resource Development Plan, as this is vital for enhancing employee performance, attracting and retaining talent, ensuring legal compliance and fostering a positive organisational structure, all of which contribute to the overall success and growth of the organisation. Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to acknowledge the contribution of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources on the review of the 2017-2018 Annual Report of the Ministry of Waterways. On that note, I thank you for the opportunity and support the motion before the Parliament. HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker. I stand to speak on the Ministry of Waterways Report or the motion before the Parliament. The Ministry of Waterways was established to manage the waterways in Fiji. This is much more than simply drains. One of the recommendations in the report by the Standing Committee is for the Ministry to improve its human resources. I totally agree with this recommendation because, improving the human resources will enable the Ministry to deliver better services to the people. Not only in the human resources, it needs to invest in equipment and machinery, as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. Machineries and trained personnel will enable them to deliver better service to the people. Having said that, Madam Deputy Speaker, the issues in relation to drainage and waterways still remains current. Arable land has become waterlogged and cannot be cultivated. Saltwater intrusions has become far too common in arable land, especially cane land closer to the rivers or sea. Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Labasa Sector in Vanua Levu, acres of land cannot be cultivated due to saltwater intrusions. In Walu Sector in Labasa, farmers are being pushed back because of saltwater intrusions on their farms and yet, Madam Deputy Speaker, we dream about increasing our cane production and improving efficiency. Madam Deputy Speaker, in Rakiraki, the rivers and the drains are poorly managed. Rakiraki town and the surrounding areas get frequent floods. The floods have significant and far-reaching effects on the community. This cannot be simply classified as simple floods. In Rakiraki, flood waters damage roads and crossings making it inaccessible. First, isolating some communities from essential services. Recently, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources visited the Rakiraki Water supply, concerns were raised on the disruptions to water supply during floods. Water intake gets affected or gets clogged and thus affecting the quality of water drawn for treatment and supply.</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>2388 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 Madam Deputy Speaker, agriculture is the prime source of livelihood for people in Rakiraki. It is rather unfortunate that they do not have anything else to sustain their livelihoods. Even so much as the new sugar mill that was promised has failed to materialise. I just hope that the Minister for Sugar can look into the eyes of the people and say, I failed and I lied. Floods damage their crops, it washes away their livestock and erodes their fertile land, and this has been happening, and it is a current situation. Slowly, day by day, the livelihoods of the people are squeezed even further. Social impacts of the floods cannot be quantified. Floods in small towns like Rakiraki can have devastating long-term effects on the economy, infrastructure, public health and overall, quality of life. This is due to poorly maintained waterways, and I hope the Government will look into this. People expect better service from the Department or the Ministry of Waterways. Therefore, I request the Government to increase the financial resources and optimise budget uses to enhance service delivery. The Ministry needs to develop a skilled workforce that is capable of delivering the service. It needs to attract talent, and it needs to retain that talent. As the previous speakers have said that people do move, but you should have mechanisms to retain those talents and equip your team with modern technology and tools to enable them to deliver proper service. The Ministry also needs to strengthen its inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination. The Ministry must improve collaborations with other relevant Government bodies including Ministry of Environment, local Government and iTaukei Affairs. They need improve accountability and transparency in order to deliver efficient services, empowering their officers and decentralising decision making is important. In order to deliver better service, the Ministry needs to integrate its work with climate change adaption work. It should ensure that infrastructure and the people are prepared for the disaster. It should strengthen early warning systems and flood protocols and take its work and deliverables to the Green Climate Fund, so they are better funded and equipped to deliver the services. This will ensure that they are able to upgrade their aging infrastructure and ensure that whatever infrastructure is in place is well-planned for long-term usage. It is important, not only the Ministry staff, they need to have public awareness and engage the community on their responsibilities to help in the maintenance of waterways. Proper cultivation methods is important, therefore, it is the Ministry of Agriculture and other institutions that need to work with the team. To round it off, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Waterways in Fiji must adopt to modern and holistic technologies. It should have an integrated approach to the management of waterways, this involves securing adequate funding, strengthening its governance and coordination, improving its human resources, leveraging on modern technologies and being future driven to provide better and efficient services to the people. This will enable the Ministry to perform and deliver what the people of Fiji expect from them. With that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before the Parliament. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a short contribution on the Report before us on Waterways. I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture, one of the main initiatives or changes that has been re-establishment of the Drainage Board from the practical point of view it has included members of the community on that board. So, the appointment basically includes those with local knowledge of the waterways.</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><p>2389 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 I am speaking as one of the inhabitants of the delta areas. One of the issues in the past have been the lack of local knowledge input into the work which has been done. So, some of the contractors came and just did it without close supervision which resulted in some of the work not being done properly or made the situation worse by the saltwater intrusion. I believe that is a positive development and some of the inputs which has been made regarding the waterways, I do support, I really support that and the way forward. But as mentioned by the honourable Leader of the Opposition with his experience, that is definitely the way to go moving forward, in terms of the revival of the whole functional areas of the waterways, and how best we can deal with this particular subject. Waterways is really affecting a huge portion of our population, not only the population but also their livelihoods. The other issue was regarding the cooperation and coordination with our development partners, so that is ongoing too and close collaboration with our Ministry which deals with infrastructure. For example, waterways and also roads, so, we are closely collaborating on that and that was also one of the main subjects we discussed when we went to COP. So, with our COP participants here, I know that there were various areas discussed but this was also one of the key areas discussed. I suppose the challenge is how to cascade that discussion at that level down to the practical projects. So, within the Ministry for example, how do we resource the Ministry to enable access or facility access. We as a Government are working within our individual Ministries to ensure that the right people are there, in terms of project initiation and project management and not only that, but also climate financing. What are the modalities which are there? What is available? So, there is close coordination between the various Ministries and Ministry for Climate Change on that with the Permanent Secretary. So, we are looking forward to not only actual planning and budgeting from here, but also with the close collaboration with our development partners because this is closely related to climate change. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We now have the final contributor before I hand over the floor to the Chair of the Standing Committee, and the final contributor is the honourable Penioni Ravunawa. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, a lot has been said about the Report presented by the Standing Committee of Natural Resources and in my 20 months in Parliament, I have been hearing the same story; late submission of report, unclear direction without KPI’s, non- utilisation of funds, alignment to SDG’s and the lack of transparency, and we thank the Government for the re-establishment of the Ministry of Waterways of the establishment of the Drainage Board to look after the drains and rivers that we have because it will help the agriculture sector. It will help the communities that are living in the low-lying areas as well, and if I may share, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Public Accounts Standing Committee, the last couple of days we were discussing about the Audit Bill to give independence to the Office of the Auditor-General. The honourable Leader of the Opposition mentioned about the delays in the reports and how can we deal with the issues to penalise chief accounting officers, responsible CEOs of ministries and departments. So, this Audit Bill, we are looking at it, and as I was sharing my experience, the last 20 months, it was the common issues in all ministries and departments, and I believe it is time that we put some teeth in the Bills that we present in Parliament and hopefully we can close the loop properly in allocation of funds, grants given by Government and also those that look after the projects and initiatives can be held responsible at the end of the day.</p><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>2390 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 I thank the Standing Committee for the Report. I believe all the speakers have talked very well on all the areas that need improvement, and I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to speak in Reply. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to thank the honourable Members for their contributions to the debate and I take note of their interests on the functions, operations and management of the Ministry of Waterways, which is now been transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and how waterways could be improved, and I support the motion before the Parliament. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. Question put. Motion agreed. Honourable Members, this brings us to the end of the sitting today, and I thank you all for your contributions and your patience, and we will adjourn now, and I will come back and see you tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. Thank you and good night and enjoy your dinner.
