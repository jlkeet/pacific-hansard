Sporting Leave, Inpatient Leave and Leave without Pay are other leaves taken by teachers. The above data includes total number of</p><p>ii. leaves taken by teachers under each category. For example, one teacher may take multiple sick leaves in a given year. (b) 1.0 Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms 1.1 Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS) is a means of monitoring and flagging teacher's chronic absenteeism. Staff attendance register is kept by all schools. All schools update and send in their Monthly Absence Return for staff. 1.2 Teacher's attendance is monitored at school, district and Headquarters and unauthorised leave is flagged to MOE. 1.3 HOSS conduct close monitoring of teachers for Performance Assessment. Continuous absence for seven consecutive days is considered deemed resignation. 1.4 Exercise Book Verification assists in monitoring the work coverage by teachers. 2.0 Policies and Legislations 2.1 2011 General Orders; PSC Code of Conduct. 2.2 Standard Operating Procedures for appointment of relieving teachers. 3.0 School-based Reorganisation, Teaching and Supervision of classes 3.1 Reorganisation of classes for students and teachers are in place. Apart from sick leaves all other leaves are applied prior to taking leaves and student activities are prepared. The teacher supervising the students ensures that the activities are provided to the students to complete. 3.2 Absent Teacher's Recovery Work Plan - To complete work coverage afternoon classes and Saturday classes are conducted. 3.3 Supervision of students 3.3.1 Supervision roster is prepared and teachers on supervision are duly informed and asked to either teach or supervise the activities set by the teacher. 3.4 Team teaching in some schools are timetabled, hence, if a teacher is absent the other teacher takes the classes. 3.5 Heads of Schools are on lower loads and step in to supervise. In Primary Medium and Large schools HOSS do not have a full-time class allocated to them. However, they are required to teach certain hours per week, hence, they step in when teachers are absent. 3.6 Encouraging teachers to be slightly ahead of the Learning and Teaching Programme (LTP) to buffer the impact of lost teaching hours. 3.7 Use of ICT to teach students like sharing notes and activities through online platforms such as Moodle. 3.8 Continuous monitoring of the LTP by the HOS, VP, HOD and assistant Head Teacher on the LTP coverage. 4.0 Teacher Incentives Teacher Recognition Awards or Certificates for attendance at School level, District level and National level. 5.0 Monthly Absence Returns (MAR) are verified on monthly basis. 6.0 Habitual absenteeism cases are also referred to Performance and Discipline Unit (PDU) for guidance and support to Heads of School in dealing with such cases in line with relevant guidelines. Note: â€¢ Leave entitlement for teachers is as per the 2011 General Orders.</p><p>iii.</p></body>
