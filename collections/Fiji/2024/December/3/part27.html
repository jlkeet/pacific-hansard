<body><h3>FOID1</h3><h4>FOID 1</h4><p>1 2 3 2 1 11 1 2 2 6 SUMMARY Total Gender Female 3 3 (1 postpartum depression and 2 cases of postpartum psychosis) 1 (this only case in 2023 was postpartum depression) 3 (1 case of postpartum depression and rest psychosis) 5 (all postpartum psychosis) 4 (all postpartum psychosis) 1 (all postpartum psychosis) 17 1 3 5 4 1 17 Data from St Giles Hospital in the table above show that a total of 17 women were diagnosed to have Postpartum Depression from 2019-2024. Eleven of these women were of iTaukei descent while six were Fijians of Indian descent.</p><p>iv. (c) Women after childbirth exhibiting symptoms whilst admitted in the post-natal wards are referred to mental health specialists for further assessment and care together with counselling support and services within the respective medical divisions. Counselling services provided by the NGO Empower Pacific assist those who are referred through the current referral processes for women dealing with postpartum depression. Given that postpartum depression can develop at anytime within the twelve months after childbirth, Maternal Child Health (MCH) services for mothers and babies at the Primary Care level provide the access to mothers for further health assessment. The Ministry is also currently reviewing its MCH Policy and SOPs where mental health screening component by trained health practitioners will be included for postpartum women with an appropriate referral and care pathway established for those requiring further care.</p><p>v.</p></body>
