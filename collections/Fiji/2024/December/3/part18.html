<body><h3>AQUACULTURE BILL 2024</h3><h4>AQUACULTURE BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Aquaculture Bill 2024 (Bill No. 21/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5 th December, 2024, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen. I rise to table the proposed Aquaculture 2 Editor’s Note: Reply to Written Question No. 282/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical 3 Services under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure II. Reply to Written Question No. 283/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Justice under Standing Order 45(3) is appended as Annexure III.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>2360 Aquaculture Bill 2024 3 rd December, 2024 Bill 2024. On 25 th April, 2023, Cabinet approved the review of the fisheries legislation through Cabinet Decision No. 171 of 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Bill 2024 is the continued work from Bill No. 9 of 2016, tabled in Parliament on 9 th February, 2016 for its first reading under Standing Order 84(2). It was then tabled for second reading on 26 th April, 2016 and referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for deliberation and consultation. The Bill lapsed when Parliament prorogued in 2018 and was not returned to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tabling of the Aquaculture Bill 2024 is based on the need to account for new and emerging issues that the current fisheries laws are inadequate to address. Also, there is a need to develop a fit to purpose legislation to support growth in the fisheries sector, ensure food security and livelihoods, protect biodiversity and resource sustainability that benefits current and future generations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, aquaculture was introduced to Fiji in 1940 with the culturing and introduction of freshwater species. Recently, the Ministry of Fisheries launched its 5-Year Aquaculture Development Plan that looks at transforming the industry. This Aquaculture Bill seeks to bring about the legal framework. Since its drafting, the Aquaculture Bill has been consulted with all aquaculture and fishery stakeholders, and the general public, including relevant Government agencies and CSOs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Bill 2024 provides a structured framework for sustainable aquaculture, ensuring resource conservation, managing aquaculture zones, regulating trade in aquaculture products and imposing licensing requirements. The aim of the Bill is to enhance food security, economic growth and employment in accordance with national and international environmental obligations. MR. SPEAKER.- I now open the floor for debate on the motion. At the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this Bill is a very important one, as has been expressed by the honourable Minister. It was raised in 2016 and then it lapsed. There has been a considerable amount of time from 2016 till to-date, I think about eight years, and I think the Bill has been refined in that particular point in time. But this is a completely new Bill; a complete Bill on its own. The honourable Minister said that they have had consultations, she actually said the Bill was consulted, I do not know what that actually means. There had been consultations by the technical staff in the Ministry with stakeholders all around the country. That is good. That is the role of the Ministry before it brings the Bill to the House to make sure that the consultations take place, consult the stakeholders to make sure that when they put the Bill together, everything is coherent, everything is congruent, everything meets the intent for which the Bill was supposed to. But then, when you have a completely new Bill, to then rush it to Standing Order 51, without giving the opportunities of the representatives of the people in this House to do that, why? (Honourable Member interjects) HON. J. USAMATE.- This has not gone to the Committees! What Committee is the honourable Deputy Prime Minister talking about? Is he, once again, trying to mislead this House? Is he, once again, trying to mislead the people of this country? He needs to be able to check before he makes such a statement.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2361 Cabinet is not the Legislature; it is an arm of the Executive. This is the Legislature; this is the People’s House! The Committees that are established by this House, they represent the voters of this country. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you as members of the Executive, you are subject to the dictates of this House and it is important that when a substantive Bill of this nature is brought to be passed in Parliament, that the representatives of the people as seen in the Committees of this House should have the opportunity to make their own consultations, to make sure that any Bill passed is, as the Minister has said, fit and proper. I agree with the importance of this Bill and everything that is being said here about aquaculture. We know it is very important, and we need to be able to do it. These aquaculture activities, programmes and strategies are being done, as we speak today, but I do not see what the urgency is to rush it immediately through Standing Order 51. Is there a fire behind this that we are trying to escape from? No such thing! (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not agree that this should be debated upon this week, just to pass this Bill. It is a substantive Bill, it needs to go through the full process to ensure scrutiny, to make sure that we, the representatives of the voters of this country, the democratic House of this country, have the opportunity to screen it to our satisfaction, make the changes and bring it back to the House. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Is there any other intervention on the Bill? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my simple question is, what is the urgency? I will refer to a particular Bill before us that we are meant to debate. That is the Fiji World Heritage Bill. This is another Bill that this Government tried to push through Standing Order 51 and have it debated in a single sitting. We sent this particular Bill to Committees and just see the number of changes almost on every page. When we informed the former Attorney-General that the Bill could not be presented in that manner, he was adamant to bring it under Standing Order 51. If the Bill is given to Committees, how many changes will be brought to the Bill itself? What is the urgency to have it debated in two days? It is a substantive Bill. There is no urgency to do it under one single sitting. We need to send this particular Bill to Committees. We know what is happening in the Office of the Attorney-General - there are no legal drafters, no senior legal drafters. For the Audit Bill, we had to change the table of contents. It is a shame on the Office of the Attorney-General. We do not have the drafters. We are trying to push this Bill, we have the Fiji World Heritage Bill, we already have changed on the first page. Why are we doing this? A common example, send this Bill to Committees so that it can scrutinise, make specific changes, bring it back to Parliament and then debate it. We have pushed the experienced and senior legal drafters out of the workforce, and this is the result we get, the Fiji World Heritage Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request the Government to send it to Committees so that it can be scrutinised.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2362 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the floor. This is a contribution from Bloc Nine. If you look at Standing Order 51, it does not have any requirement on urgency. This has been raised in two previous terms of Parliament, but the Standing Order allows and permits that the mover of the motion, whoever is moving the Bill to expedite the Bill through the shortcut provision, not following Standing Order 84(2). It was unfortunate when this Bill came up in 2016, it was listed for first reading and second reading and did not make it up to third reading given that it lapsed. That showed the lack of political will maybe at that particular time, but again, as the honourable Minister has rightly said that there are growing issues now in the aquaculture sector that needs this Bill and the urgency of this Bill to go through Standing Order 51. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just take you through some statistics. Back in 2016, there were a total of 53 Bills introduced in the House; 15 Bills were Consequential Bills through budget, there were only two Bills out of the 53 that was referred to the Committee. So, 16 went through a single sitting of Parliament. During that time, Standing Order 51 was overused (not abused) but it was used. It shows the prerogative, and discretion remains with the Government. If policies needs to be implemented, a certain framework that has been part of the Minister's justification for tabling these Bills through Standing Order 51 that needs implementation, then Standing Order 51 is the procedure that is there. I will take you to another year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2022, there were 49 Bills that were introduced and tabled in Parliament, 11 were Consequential Bills, only one went through the scrutiny of Committees, 11 went through a single sitting of Parliament, like the ones this week, that is, tabled today and debated on Thursday. Let me come to 2023 to give a comparison. In 2023, there were 29 Bills tabled in Parliament, 12 were Consequential Bills, four went through a single sitting of Parliament like what we doing now and one went to Committees. In 2024, there were 19 Bills, this will be the 20th Bill and nine were Consequential Bills, three are going through a single sitting of Parliament, that will be the Bills to amend the Presidential Act 2024 and the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Bill 2024 that was tabled yesterday and the Aquaculture Bill 2024 that is being tabled now. However, there are five that were referred to Committees in 2024, two have been tabled back in Parliament, that is, Anti-Doping Bill 2024 and National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 which are now being enacted into Acts. Three will be debated on Thursday, that will be the Child Justice Bill 2024, Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 and Heritage Bill 2023, and then they will be enacted after that. If you see the statistics, comparing to previous terms of Parliament, I think now, it will be fair to say that Standing Order 51 should be the right procedure that the Aquaculture Bill should come through and be given tonight and tomorrow to study the Bill till Thursday. There is ample time to go through Standing Order 51. Mr. Speaker, I can see the urgency and we should all support this motion. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that the Bill went through second reading in 2016, but who were in the Committee? The Members here, probably were not there, even I was not in Parliament at that time and there may be more Members sitting here who were not in Parliament at that time. This is a substantial Bill, I heard honourable Bulitavu, he is in Opposition but we know he should be given a Ministerial post so that he can speak openly from the other side.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2363 He is occupying a seat on this side, but he should be sitting on the other side. I remember what the honourable Minister for Tourism used to say, “please give him a ticket”, so I understand that. Two points that I would like to make here is, first, this is the Government that kept on saying, “we will not use Standing Order 51”. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! HON. P. D. KUMAR.- We will only use it sparingly for minor changes. This is not a minor change, this is a substantial Bill. Sir, just to point out mistakes. I just glanced through the pages, page 10, it says here and I quote: “The Minister, Permanent Secretary, Director or any Fisheries Officer must to the “extend” possible, it should be extent - simple error. That is why the Bill should be referred to the Standing Committee, it will make the Government look good, it will help the magistrates, judges and the lawyers to do their work, if that is what we want. It cannot be just rushed through for the sake of it. I will ask the honourable Prime Minister to intervene because he made the right decision when it came to the Heritage Bill. That is why the Heritage Bill has been scrutinised by the Committee and we can see that the Bill is in a form that can be agreed to in this Parliament. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Bulitavu for putting out very clearly the statistics but that should give them some food for thought, reflect on their own past and see what was happening. Let me just come back to the subject matter and the points that honourable Maharaj, honourable Kumar and honourable Usamate made. The Standing Order is very clear. The requirement is up to the Government, up to the Executive to use Standing Order 51 whenever it deems necessary …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Elections promise:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … and we are doing it. Honourable Kumar is always very irritating, Mr. Speaker. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- His a gentleman:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> When the debate happens, what they are doing now is actually talking about the Bill. As you said, Mr. Speaker, the other day, we are talking about whether the Bill should be debated under Standing Order 51 or not. They are going and saying, “this subject matter, this error”; they will have an opportunity on Thursday to move an amendment, to propose a change, that is part of the Parliamentary process.</p><h4>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ten minutes.</h4><h4>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can do that in 10 minutes, you can do that in five minutes,</h4><p>you have two or three days to read through this. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- As honourable Bulitavu said very clearly with statistics, this Government is open and transparent.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2364 (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This Bill was there in 2016, it went through Committees, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, I sat in the Opposition for eight years and the rate at which they were using Standing Order 51 to run legislation... (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-... and sometimes corrupt legislation and they were doing this using Standing Order 51. There might be a typing error somewhere that she pointed out, but the fact is that the Government has the right under Standing Order 51 to bring a Bill to Parliament. We are not doing this, we are not doing this willy-nilly, we are doing this because the Minister who is the person who gets the advice from the relevant Ministry that this Bill is now urgent, it needs to be passed now and therefore the circumstances leading to this Bill coming into this Parliament under Standing Order 51 makes sense. As they admit, this Bill was supposed to be done in 2016, 2017 and they did not do it. We have been in Government for less than two years and we are bringing this Bill and making sure that it gets through, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With those remarks, this is the right thing to do, and I support the honourable Minister and her motion. MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Kumar had requested the honourable Prime Minister to speak, if he so wishes. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I pushed this Bill back to Cabinet. I wanted them to assure me that consultation had been done. That came back to our Legislation Committee after further consultation, and I am satisfied that it can come forward at this time. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Sir, the debate this evening seems to hinge on Standing Order 51, it is not really. I thank the honourable Minister in bringing this legislation through. We have gone through consultation within the Ministry of Fisheries as this was a stumbling block to the development of aquaculture in Fiji. It had created a lot of discussions under the various Ministries that deal with aquaculture. As you understand, Sir, aquaculture is the development of fisheries within the inshore and on land. There were issues that interact with other Ministries and other agencies, and that was the main cause of the delay in bringing it to Parliament. Now, it is coming under Standing Order 51, if it is correct and right that being a substantive Bill and it is in order, then it is alright. But if it is not in order, then I would ask the intervention that it be relooked at so that it is, in totality, fit to be passed as a Bill and it will cover the regulations with the various development of aquaculture. This Bill is necessary, this Bill is urgent and it is needed but whatever is required to make it work and be able support the aquaculture industry in Fiji, that should be done. MR. SPEAKER.- That concludes the debate on this item. I now call on the Minister of Fisheries to speak in reply. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all honourable Members who had contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament. I also thank the former Minister, honourable Koroilavesau, for all your insights and your wisdom.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Aquaculture Bill 2024 2365 Mr. Speaker, like I had mentioned earlier, the Aquaculture Bill of 2024 is the continued work from Bill No. 9 of 2016 that was tabled in Parliament for first reading, second reading and was referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. The urgency of this Bill is to seek the prevention of disease outbreak, the prevention of the importation of exotic species into Fiji and the need to account for new and emerging issues that the current fisheries laws are inadequate to address. Mr. Speaker, I trust my staff at the Ministry, and I thank them for doing the necessary groundwork of bringing this Bill back into Parliament. I thank them for the consultations and the work that they have done till today. Mr. Speaker, in that regard, I commend the Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes Cast: Ayes Nayes - 34 - 15 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members. At this juncture, we will suspend the</p><h4>proceedings for a short break and Parliament will resume in 15 minutes.</h4><p>The Parliament adjourned at 5.45 p.m.</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>2366 Consolidated Review Report - ACCF 2019-2021 Annual Reports 3 rd December, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 5.59 p.m. (Deputy Speaker assumes the Chair)</p></body>
