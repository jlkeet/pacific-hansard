LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we have five Oral Questions, three Written Questions and also the three motions in Schedule 2 related to the debate on the annual reports.

LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- I have no further comments, 2350 any. Sir. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will suspend the proceedings for a break. Parliament will resume in half-an-hour. The Parliament adjourned at 4.00 p.m.</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2351 The Parliament resumed at 4.35 p.m. New Town Developments in Nabouwalu and Keiyasi (Question No. 276/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the status of the work undertaken by the Ministry on the new town developments in Nabouwalu and Keiyasi? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question asked by the honourable Member this afternoon, that is, to provide an update on the work that currently is being undertaken in those two centres - one at Nabouwalu and the other at Keiyasi in Navosa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the development of the two project sites is part of the Ministry’s as well as this Government's plan - Urban Action Plan to identify some of the growth centres around the country. The Ministry’s objective is to come up with a Pro-active Plan and also develop some of these centres into fully developed and fully fledged townships in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nabouwalu New Town is a landmark project for the Province of Bua. I am certain that the people of Cakaunitabua in the Province of Bua as well as neighbouring areas are looking forward for the completion of this development. It is specifically designed to transform Nabouwalu into a vibrant, sustainable and inclusive growth centre that will serve as a hub for economic growth and activity innovation. Mr. Speaker, this Government recognises the importance of developing these new townships in rural areas to diversify the economy and improve the standard of living for residents. These initiatives aim to uplift these regions by creating employment opportunities and stimulating economic growth in these satellite towns, thereby enhancing and improving the quality of life for its residents. And central to this is the development of the Nabouwalu Passenger Terminal which is a critical facility that will enhance connectivity and also boost trade and create more comfortable experience for the public that commute through the Nabouwalu Terminal. Currently 50 percent of the terminal construction is completed, and we are on track to deliver this facility by March 2025. This facility will provide very basic amenities, including 150 seating spaces for passengers, some kiosks, operational offices for agencies and recreation spaces ensuring convenience and comfort for all users. The total project is around $2 million of which $915,000 has been paid out. Mr. Speaker, there will also be offices established in the Nabouwalu Passenger Terminal for essential services, including Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF), Maritime Safety Authority, ticketing booths for boats operating companies and upgrading of both companies, kiosks, as well as coffee shops. There will also be parking spaces for cars and buses embarking from the boat to avoid waiting at the jetty and also some playing spaces for children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, also to maintain law and order in the town centre, there will also be a police post for the Fiji Police Force within the building. We are also in the process of advertising and obtaining a foreshore lease. Preparation with the Ministry of Lands to secure that area from storm surges with coastal protection structures with an allocated budget of $500,000 for the 2024-2025 financial year.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>2352</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>3 rd December, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in parallel to this development, the town subdivision development of approximately 5.5 hectares is progressing with 23 commercial lots, four civic lots and four industrial lots planned to support businesses and essential services. The project cost is around $8.9 million, out of which $3.2 million has been paid up. Phase 1 focuses on establishing several commercial lots along the Nabouwalu Highway, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. To facilitate this development, the Ministry has allocated $500,000 in its annual programme for the current fiscal year to continue essential civil works on the site. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that Nabouwalu becomes a model for sustainability, we are mandating the use of solar panels and water harvesting systems and other green infrastructure in the new development. Only some challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, such as land leases and creating diversions that are yet to be finalised. They are actively engaging with stakeholders, including the Ministry of Lands, iTaukei Land Trust Board, and consultants to resolve them swiftly and ensure steady progress. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Keiyasi new town development in the Sigatoka Valley is another transformative project covering 9.4 hectares. This development will provide essential services and infrastructure for the people of Keiyasi and the province of Navosa, as well as all the surrounding communities. Estimated civil works for the project is $10.8 million. The project includes 27 commercial lots, three open spaces, reserves, a market, bus station, service station and a space for National Fire Authority, as well as industrial sites, to meet and support the needed services and residents alike. Construction of civil works, Mr. Speaker, Sir, began earlier this year, and we aim to complete this by 2026, focussing on six commercial sites, open spaces and a service station. To support the town, improvements to the town, improvements to Valley Road, including road widening, footpaths are underway, ensuring safe and efficient access for residents and visitors. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are collaborating with Water Authority of Fiji to upgrade the water supply system, meeting the needs of this growing community. One of the very interesting feature about the development of Keiyasi, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this place is becoming an economic centre for people around the area and every Thursday, we have been told that we have been reliably advised that there is a sop in Keiyasi at the moment where people always converge and do their trading on that particular day and we see the potential of growing that and also developing Keiyasi to become a growth centre and later will become a satellite town where we will be able to stimulate economic activities within the area. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project demonstrates our Coalition Government’s vision to bring growth and development to all regions in Fiji. Not only are these two sites, but the team also identified some other possible sites within the country to ensure that we are able to produce these growth centres into a fully fully-fledged township in the future. With careful planning and sustainable practices. We are not just building towns, it is building hope, opportunity and pride for future generations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Insured Boxers - Boxing Commission of Fiji (Question No. 277/2024) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice:</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2353 Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports inform Parliament whether the Boxing Commission of Fiji failed to ensure that boxers were insured for the bouts held at King Charles Park on 26 th October, 2024? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his question. The question, Sir, is related to the terrible incident that happened at Nadi’s King Charles Park concerning the late Mr. Heida. I wish to update Parliament that the Board of Inquiry have not completed their investigations. They are still left with interviews to be done with people from overseas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the investigation is completed, the report will be tabled for the public. Further to that, I will also be making a ministerial statement at the appropriate time. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am asking that the oral question be ruled out of order for the time being. HON. H. CHAND.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; Fiji has just lost a young talented professional boxer, Heida, also known as Nathan Singh. He was a champion boxer in Fiji, regarded as Fiji’s most promising boxers. Nathan Singh could have been alive today if the boxing event on 26 th October at King Charles Park was sanctioned properly. One of the most important requirements for any boxing event is the availability of an ambulance and a qualified doctor at the venue. The Boxing Commission of Fiji should have ensured that all necessary… (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER. – Order, order! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on a Point of Order, Standing Order 74(1) which states, and I quote: “Any member may only raise a point of order if – (a) there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.” MR. SPEAKER. – Yes, one moment, honourable Members. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA. – The practice is when you stand up to raise a question, you stand up to raise that question, you do not go into a lengthy diatribe and take political advantage of what the honourable Minister is doing. The honourable Minister has just mentioned that there is a Board of Inquiry, and he is asking for us to wait for the Board of Inquiry. Stop making a political statement! Wait for the Board of Inquiry. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! Thank you, honourable Minister. Honourable Chand, can you specifically ask the question directed to the Minister in respect of its a follow up question to your question that is being tabled?</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2354 HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, Boxing Commission of Fiji should have ensured that all necessary requirements were met by the promoter before giving approval for the boxing event. MR. SPEAKER.-Honourable Member, please, follow what I have just directed you to do and that is ask the question and not make a statement. They are totally different. HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you, Sir. What necessary steps will the Ministry take so that thorough investigation is carried out and those responsible are taken to task? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already mentioned that the Board of Inquiry is still doing their investigation and we should be respecting the investigation to continue and the report will be tabled publicly. At the same time, since he has mentioned it, I attended the farewell service for the deceased. I do not know whether you attended, honourable Member, but I was there. In respect of what this young lad has done to boxing in Fiji and we should respect what is being done at the moment until we get to the bottom of the problems that happened that night. Until then, I am not in a position to divulge any information right now. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Minister is mistaken, thinking that if something is under investigation, according to the Standing Order, it should not be answered. That is wrong. It is only if something is before the courts. My question is, can the honourable Minister confirm, if true, that this particular promoter that promoted this fight was actually stopped from promoting or had his licence withdrawn under the Chairmanship of the former Chairperson, Mr. Subhas Apna, and whether this has now returned… MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! Honourable Usamate, let me clear your issue and that is, you are asking questions that will invariably be dealt with by the Board of Inquiry. The Commission, may I remind you is, in fact, a couch in a legal frame that, in fact, would stop any questions being asked of Parliament from the proceedings until it is completed.</p><h4>I think we have exhausted the supplementary questions in respect of honourable Chand’s</h4><p>question. We will now move on the next question for today. Review of the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014 (Question No. 278/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the status of the review of the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question regarding the review of the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by stating that there have been unprecedented changes made to the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014 since 2023, and the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service Act 2014 has been progressively amended over the last two years through the Parliamentary process with the aim to:</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2355 strengthen this legislation and governance structure; (a) (b) provide clarity and additional powers to administer scholarship investments and (c) the implementation of these legislative amendments was made possible through direct leadership of the Board and Management of the TSLS. Perhaps, I will take this time to share a few of some of the amendments that was made. First, is the write-off of students’ loan amounting to $650 million. That cancellation of the loan repayment of student debts has led to the relief of about 53,725 students that were indebted with this loan debt. Second, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Hardship Assistance Scheme for students who were studying privately and are eligible to be sponsored, so they are now studying under TSLS and currently, there are about 348 students in their respective cadre or studies. Third, is the Micro Qualification Scheme Assistance that is paid to students regarding those who are studying TVET courses. The areas that are mostly covered during the review is the: delegation to CEO and instruments of delegation; functions of the Service; (a) (b) powers of the Service; (c) (d) meeting process; (e) (f) (g) (h) disclosure of interest; student's employment record for scholarship information; report on ‘at risk’ students; and additional criteria on new programmes for funding. Mr. Speaker, Sir, provisions in the Act are serving the purpose of the Government’s ambitions, then review needs to be reconsidered. There are provisions which need to be reviewed for amendments, and the same shall be carried out through the usual legislative process. The current Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, stipulates the powers of the Minister for Education and also the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance is responsible for the appointment of the Board, while the overseeing of the regulations of all scholarship schemes, study loans and grants, and appointment of CEO through the Board are vested with the Minister for Education. Some of the amendments also to the Service this year. The Coalition Government has allowed the repeaters on merit-based local scheme for degrees and vocational studies, the MBBS and pilot programmes. However, to be fair for the second attempt, the students need to meet higher cut off marks than the first attempt test. For example, the cut off marks for MBBS for first attempters is 350 out of 400 and for repeaters is 365. For pilot, it is 335 for repeaters and 310 out of 400 in Year 13 for first attempt, and compulsory pass in Fiji Airways psychometric and aptitude assessments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, supplementary question on the academic achievements for students in rural areas and those in urban areas. Usually, those in urban areas are high achievers academically than those in rural areas. Will the review take into consideration the range of marks or give some preference to students in rural areas so that they can also come up with the same privilege as those in the urban areas? That is my supplementary question. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, honourable Member, for the very important question. Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken note of the concerns that have been raised regarding marked</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2356 differences in the rural and maritime areas, and this is something that we will discuss also with the Ministry of Finance, considering the financial implications to expand the criteria for entry into the TSLS scholarship to also take into account those in the rural areas. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister, we know that the TELS under the previous Government had its conditions as well. One of the problems that most of our youths are facing now is, when they intend to travel abroad, they are held back at Immigration in Nadi. What is the process that they need to go through and what is your advice to most of them, as they may be listening as well, because this is a common issue that they keep referring to us Members of Parliament? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendments that were undertaken during the Budget session that needed the operations of the student employment record and travel clearance and bond that used to be with Fiji Revenue &amp; Custom Services (FRCS) have now been transferred to TSLS and they have an office in Nadi where they can have a process to clear their names before they travel abroad. Projections and Expectations for Global Tourism (Question No. 279/2024) HON. T. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the Ministry’s projection and expectations for Global Tourism as articulated by the World Travel and Tourism Council? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tunabuna for the question. As we all know, the Travel and Tourism Sector is growing. It is growing everyday, every year and every decade. The recent World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the Global Leaders Dialogue, held in Perth in September, provided a crucial platform for global leaders to engage in strategic discussions on the future of tourism. The WTTC’s Annual Global Summit is one of the most influential international events. The 2024 Summit brought over 800 participants from over 25 countries representing both public and private sector, including Heads of States, government ministers, Chairs, chief executives and global media. It was headlined by the 68 th United States Secretary of State, John Kerry, and Environmentalist, Robert Irwin. It was quite a high-profile Summit. Some of the top profile speakers came from TripAdvisor, Trip.com, American Express and Intrepid Travel, who shared reliable ideas in the Summit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, projections for WTTC estimates that the travel industry will account for $1 out of every $10 spent globally in 2024. Of course, they are using the US currency here. The sector's contribution to global GDP will increase to 12.1 percent on year to a record US$11.1 trillion in 2024. This means travel is responsible for 10 percent of global GDP, a 7.5 percent increase from 2019. Looking ahead, 10 years from now by 2034, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sector will supercharge the global economy with a staggering $16 trillion, making up 11.4 percent of the entire economic landscape. It will provide 449 million jobs, nearly 12.2 percent of the workforce. More than three quarters of countries analysed are expected to exceed the high point of 2019, in terms of GDP contribution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a report unlocking opportunities for travel and tourism in Ocean shows that</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2357 in 2019, the sector contributed about $192 billion to Oceania’s GDP, supporting over 2.2 million jobs. If we invest in infrastructure, the labour market quality and sustainability and improved visa facilitation, there are projections over $29 billion increase in contribution to GDP by 2034. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Oceania’s travel and tourism sector could inject an additional $112 billion to the region by 2034, bringing the total contribution to a record-breaking US$336 billion. This boost could also support an extra 1.1 million jobs, raising the total employment in the global region, supported by travel and tourism, to 3.5 million by 2024. Now, all these, Sir, what does it mean for Fiji? Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the Fijian tourism sector, from January to October 2024, we have received a record of 822,253 visitors. That is 6.5 percent higher than the same period last year. With 180,000 more visitors over November and December this year, we will be at 1 million visitors. Sir, these numbers are not always organic. Destinations around the world are investing heavily in their tourism sector. Connectivity is increasing, destinations are emerging, and visitor demographics are evolving, so we cannot take for granted Fiji’s position in the global market. Mr. Speaker, Sir, aligned with these priorities, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation remains committed to leveraging the principles outlined in Fiji's National Sustainable Tourism Framework. This Framework, as we all know, underscores our dedication to fostering sustainable practices, advancing infrastructure development and strengthening our air connectivity. Through such initiatives, we aim to amplify Fiji’s appeal as a destination and paradise environmental stewardship while delivering exceptional visitor experiences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this approach is not only vital for ensuring long term economic growth, but also maintaining Fiji’s position as a leader in sustainable tourism in the Pacific. The Coalition Government is resolute in its vision to make tourism a cornerstone of our national development agenda, creating opportunities that benefit all Fijians. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Nothing thorny, honourable Minister, do not worry.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, I know that WTTC reports are actually important, but if you align it with the reports that come out of the World Bank, have we fallen behind Samoa and the Solomon Islands in terms of our growth in that particular sector? I think the World Bank Report might differ with respect to the figures that we may be getting, and I am actually talking about the percentage growth in estimated aviation passenger arrivals. So, it would seem that we are slightly below even Samoa at the moment, subject to you telling me that I am wrong. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, honourable Koya. The growth from our neighbouring countries are showing higher percentages, but they are from a low base. In terms of the whole Pacific, 50 percent of arrivals are from Fiji and the other 50 percent comes from the other countries. They may be showing those numbers, but from a low base. Commensurate Salary for Teachers with Upgraded Qualification (Question No. 280/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on why teachers who have upgraded their qualifications have not received their commensurate salaries? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2358 question. In the last financial year, the Ministry of Education has processed salary upgrades of around 250 teachers, the total potential financial implications of around $4.1 million. Along with this, there were two critical policy-based exercise completed with the Civil Service. Firstly, was the policy direction of the Coalition Government for the regularisation and step up of eligible office in the Civil Service in February 2024. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; the honourable Minister is trying to duck the question. The question is rather clear. The thing is that the teachers have not been paid. They graduated last year, and they have not been paid because there was no budget allocated for this payment. Can the honourable Minister confirm whether budgetary allocation was made for this or not? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- I have replied to the question on the payment of the salary upgrade, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I had said 250 teachers with the financial implication of $4.1 million. Are you talking about this year? HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I just wanted to clarify, if you look at the 2024-2025 Budget, there is no allocation for salary upgrade when you compare it with 2023-2024 Budget where there was an allocation for which you have made the payment, and I agree. But this one here, there is no allocation at all. So, those teachers who graduated in December and they are still working now, no payment has been made to them. They have sent the questions to us, so that we can ask you. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for acknowledging that we have made the payments for this financial year. We have identified 395 teachers who are eligible for qualification upgrade and salary realignment, which will cost an additional $4.1 million, and we are currently in discussion in making submissions to make this payment sometimes next year.</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Statistics on Teacher Absenteeism (Question No. 281/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the following: (a) yearly data on teacher absenteeism in schools from 2022 to 2024 including a breakdown by urban, peri-urban, rural and outer Islands as well as the total number of teachers in each category; and explain what measures the Ministry has implemented to address teacher absenteeism and ensure minimal disruption to student learning.
