<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report – Legal Aid Commission 2018-2023 Annual Reports HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Legal Aid Commission 2018-2023 Annual Reports. The Legal Aid Commission is a statutory body established under the Legal Aid Act 1996 and the Legal Aid Amendment Decree 2009. The primary purpose of the Commission is to assist eligible individuals who may not be able to afford the services of a private law practitioner, to be able to still gain access to quality legal services and ultimately access to justice. The Commission provides free legal services to members of the public by giving advice, providing legal representation in court, and providing services in all areas of family and criminal law. Assistance is also provided in civil law matters but is restricted to certain areas of practice. Some of the services require fulfilment of eligibility criteria, which is often waived if there are extenuating circumstances, especially for vulnerable clients. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report captures the trends in the various activities reported in the reporting period. This Report contains six recommendations for consideration. Just for information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had called for an oral public submission from the Legal Aid Commission on 5th November, 2024. During this consultation, there was a technical fault with the audio on the broadcast system within Parliament, which did not allow the hearing to be aired publicly, as a requirement under the Standing Orders. However, the members of the media attended the meeting in person. I thank the Commission for the completion and submission of its 2018-2023 Annual Reports. Now, they are up to date with their Annual Report. I thank the members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Secretariat for the work towards the completion of this bipartisan Report. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Orders 121(5), I hereby move: A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2313</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

Consolidated Review Report – Office of the Attorney-General 2006-2023 Annual Reports HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on the Office of the Attorney- General’s Annual Reports from 2006 to 2023. This is a period of 17 years and upfront, I would like to thank the Office of the Attorney-General for providing these Reports from 2006 to 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the Committee did was, we grouped the Reports into three lots for ease of scrutiny. So, we had three separate Reports that can be read separately or the three read together. The first one is from 2006 to 2013, this is the period when there was no Parliament. The second lot is from 2014 to 2022 and the third is the 2022 to 2023 Annual Reports, to be fair, and that is when the new Government was in place. The structure of the Reports were all the same, that it was quite easy for the Committee to look at the Reports and look at the trends of activities of the Office of the Attorney-General. We thank the Office of the Attorney-General for keeping that data that they used from way back in 2006 right up to 2023. As an example, it stood out as one of the issues - that when it comes to litigation, the biggest number of litigation that the Office of the Attorney-General does is on accidents of government vehicles, and it is the same right throughout the period. So, when you read the Reports, it shows those trends, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for the work and the Secretariat on the work done to compile these three Reports to cover the period from 2006 to 2023. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit these three Reports to Parliament. (Reports handed to the Secretary-General) HON. V.

VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Standing Committee on Social Affairs Consolidated Review Report on the Suva City Council 2016 to 2018 Annual Reports. As mandated under Standing Order 109(2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2314 health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media. The Committee reviewed the Annual Reports and identified important issues which were then brought to the attention of the Suva City Council for their necessary actions. Apart from its primary function of collecting rates and providing services to ratepayers, the Suva City Council now faces many other challenges. This include the drug situation, the city’s security situation and dealing with street dwellers. The Committee is of the view that given the current situation, the Municipal Council must review its functions and operational procedures as a matter of urgency to address the serious social issues within the Municipality. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government will need to provide guidance and oversight to the Suva City Council for its operations’ compliance, operational efficiency and effectiveness. I would like to sincerely thank the Chairman and Special Administrator for the Suva City Council and his team, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Local Government and her Officials, for their valuable contributions to this review process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I would like to thank the Members of the Stading Committee on Social Affairs - honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Iowane Naivalurua and honourable Viam Pillay, for their valuable input and support. I would also like to thank honourable Joseph Nand and honourable Alipate Tuicolo for the assistance they had rendered on several occasions as Alternate Members. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Report to Parliament and request that all Members of this august Parliament take note of the Report. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. I. S.

The Parliament adjourned at 10.33 a.m.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2315 The Parliament resumed at 11.13 a.m. Review Report - Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance 2023 Annual Report HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence hereby submits to Parliament the Review Report on the Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance 2023 Annual Report. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF), under the Insurance Act 1998 and the Insurance Regulations 1998is responsible for the regulation and supervision of the insurance industry in Fiji. The RBF aims to achieve the underlying objective of safeguarding policyholders’ interest by overseeing the soundness and stability of the insurance industry. The RBF executes this role by issuing licences to market participants and supervision policies to govern the conduct of insurance business in Fiji. It is a requirement under the Act that all insurance companies and intermediaries conducting insurance business in Fiji to be licensed by RBF. Supplemented by the requirements of the Regulations, the RBF has the responsibility to ensure that people seeking to undertake insurance business are fit and proper, and in compliance with regulatory requirements at all times. The Committee would like to report that the insurance sector, during the reporting period, fared well and contributed positively to the Fijian economy. This Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, contains two recommendations for consideration, one is to the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services. I hope that when this is made available by Parliament, they will look into it quickly. This has to do with parametric insurance, and I hope that the Ministry can take up an action on it very quickly. The Committee had called for an oral public submission from the RBF on 13 th November, 2024. Again, this session was not aired live due to technical issues. I raised this point twice about the technical problems that we have here in Parliament because there is a requirement under Standing Orders that we conduct public hearings. But in this instance, it was later aired on the Walesi Parliament Television Channel, but it was not live when we were having the meeting. I wish to thank and commend the RBF for being up to date with their Insurance Annual Report. I also thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Secretariat, for compiling this bipartisan Report. On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2316</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Review Report on the Heritage Bill 2023 HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I table my Report, let me join the House in also congratulating you on your appointment as the honourable Speaker of this august House. Mr. Speaker, on 21 st November, 1990, Fiji became a party to the Convention concerning the protection of the World Cultural and National Heritage, which was adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Conference in 1972 (World Heritage Convention). Fiji, as a State party to the World Heritage Convention, is required under the World Heritage Convention to adopt legislative and administrative provisions to give effect to the World Heritage Convention. Therefore, the Heritage Bill 2023 provides for the domestic application of the World Heritage Convention in Fiji. The Heritage Bill 2023 (Bill No. 25 of 2023) was introduced to recognise and manage places in Fiji with potential and actual world heritage values. The Bill aims to align Fiji's domestic laws with the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, ensuring the protection of Fiji's unique natural and cultural heritage. Mr. Speaker, while there are existing national laws that cover the designation and protection of cultural and natural heritage sites, monuments and places, there is no law that specifically covers for sites that are recognised internationally, pursuant to the 1972 World Heritage Convention, which Fiji is a party to. Simply put, there are no protection mechanisms for sites (as per current Bill) that are declared as: (a) Potential World Heritage sites (National Level; (b) Tentative World Heritage sites (International Level); and (c) World Heritage sites (International Level). Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same, there are gaps in our current laws that resulted in the proposition of the following attributes which have been reflected in the current Bill: (a) Sustainable management or potential places, sites and monuments that meet the requirements of outstanding universal values of UNESCO. (b) Establishment of a trust fund for each nationally and internationally designated sites, places and monuments, to ensure that it can sustainably manage itself. (c) Establishment of management organisations on site to spearhead the operations of the site. (d) Establishment of a Fiji Heritage Council at national level to ensure coordination and designation of sites that meet international criteria. (e) Establishment of a Fiji Register that will ensure sites designated are systematically organised for reference purposes and other measures necessary for the administration of the nominated sites. At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee conducted public consultations in various</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2317 communities and invited the public to provide submissions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of those who participated in the public consultations supported and commended the introduction of the Bill. However, mixed feelings were expressed by landowners where their land are within the buffer zones. There was support due to the potential for increased tourism and preservation of cultural heritage, but concerns were raised about restrictions on land use and development. The Committee deliberated at length on concerns raised by submittees and is confident that all issues raised have now been addressed through the amendments made to the initial Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the current Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights - honourable Iliesa Vanawalu, honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua, honourable Jone Usamate and honourable Mosese Bulitavu. I would also like to thank the previous Members of the Committee, namely, honourable Faiyaz Koya, honourable Ratu Josaia Niudamu, honourable Viliame Naupoto and honourable Taito Matasawalevu, including honourable Sashi Kiran, who are Alternate Members on certain occasions. A big vinaka vakalevu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the drafters who have made amendments to the Bill that is tabled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends the Heritage Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolutions of Parliament on Friday, 15 th September, 2023 and Friday 15 th March, 2024, and the Communication from the Chair on 24 th November, 2023, the Standing Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly and the Bill will be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5 th December, 2024. Review Report on the Child Justice Bill 2024 HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I stand as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. The Committee has entrusted me to table this Report on behalf of the honourable Members of the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by giving a brief background of the Bill. The Child Justice Bill 2024 aims to establish a comprehensive specialised criminal justice system for children and for related matters. At the commencement of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee made preliminary deliberations on the Clauses of the Bill and noted that the Child Justice Bill 2024 seeks to repeal the provision of the Juveniles Act 1973, that deals with children in conflict with the law, formally known as juveniles. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides a more comprehensive framework for the special treatment of children at all stages of the child justice process, from the point of their initial contact with the Police through to trial, rehabilitation and reintegration into the community and into their families. Mr. Speaker, Sir, amongst the key changes to the Bill, are the new provisions which specifies the following: (1) The Bill replaces the term “juvenile” with “child in conflict with the law”, as the stigma</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2318 attached to the term “juvenile” is detrimental to the rehabilitation of an offender who is a child. (2) The Bill introduces new objectives and guiding principles that require a balanced approach, ensuring that the children in conflict with the law are held accountable for their actions, as well as supporting their rehabilitation and re-integration into society. (3) The Bill also raises the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 years to 14 years, and clarifies that special juvenile justice procedures apply to all children under the age of 18 at the time the offence was committed. (4) The Bill provides a detailed statement of the role of the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection’s Department of Children and new specialised Child Justice Officers (formerly known as Probation Officers) in developing rehabilitation and re-integration services for children, in partnership with other Government agencies, NGOs, faith-based organisations and traditional and community leaders. (5) The Bill provides new provisions on police conduct towards children, incorporating the Fiji Police Force Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for children in contact with the law. (6) The new provisions on diversion in the Bill, allowing the police or prosecutor to deal with non-serious offences committed by children through cautions, a diversion plan, or referral to a restorative justice process, commonly known as community conference, without sending the child to court. (7) New sections on bail for children in the Bill, in line with the Bail Act, but with special considerations for children to reduce the use of remand. (8) New option for Child Justice Officers to step in earlier and start assisting children at the arrest stage, not just when they get to court. (9) The Juvenile Court has been renamed the Child Justice Court, and more detailed guidance is provided on child-friendly court procedures. (10) New section requiring Child Justice Officers to prepare social inquiry reports about the child’s background and circumstances, a more detailed guidance on the contents of those reports and deadlines for submitting them. As part of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee conducted public consultations in various communities and invitation to the public to provide written submissions. Majority of the public that had participated in the public submissions supported and commended the introduction of the Bill. However, there were some suggestions on how to make further improvements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee acknowledges the concerns raised by the submittees and has deliberated at length on concerns raised. The Committee is confident that all issues raised have been addressed and that the Bill is sufficient as it is with some minor amendments. The Committee also felt that a few recommendations need to be considered in order to fully implement this Bill, and these are also provided in the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this stage, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the Committee and also the previous members of the Committee on the compilation of this report for the Child Justice Bill 2024.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>2319 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends the Child Justice Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolutions of Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024 and Communications from the Chair on 5 th August, 2024, the Standing Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly and the Bill will be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5 th December, 2024. Review Report – Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by giving a brief background of the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill replaces the child protection sections of the Juveniles Act (Cap 56). It outlines what the country will do to promote the wellbeing of children and to protect them from all forms of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. The Juveniles Act provision on children in conflict with the law has been incorporated into a separate Child Justice Bill. The aim of the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 is to provide a more comprehensive framework for child welfare services, and to better guide the work of the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection in preventing and responding to child abuse. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 introduces significant reforms to strengthening child welfare and protection. It establishes a new guiding framework for child protection, emphasising the responsibility of parents and families for the children's care and wellbeing. The Bill creates a new Department of Children under the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, with a clear mandate to provide social welfare services in collaboration with various stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the focus shifts from merely responding to abuse to preventing it through early intervention. It streamlines the process for reporting and responding to child protection cases, integrating existing procedures into a clearer system now overseen by the Director for Children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill also defines specific actions to safeguard children, either through family agreements or court orders. Responsibility for child protection orders shifts to the Family Division of the Magistrate's Court, with more child-friendly procedures. It also introduces new forms of alternative care (kinship, foster and residential care) with a priority on family-based care and includes new offences to address emerging issues, like online exploitation and child grooming. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the review, the Committee conducted public consultations in various communities and invited the public to provide written submissions. The Committee received support and recommendation on the introduction of the Bill from most of the public that had participated in the public consultations. However, like most activities that impact the lives of the people of a country, they will also be other suggestions that are based on the premise of making improvements. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill addresses gaps in outdated laws, like the Juveniles Act, and establishes a comprehensive responsive child protection system focussed on prevention, early intervention and family preservation. Moreover, it emphasises a community-based approach</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>2320</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>3 rd December, 2024 involving families, government agencies, NGOs and traditional leaders in safeguarding children. Key provisions include clearer mechanisms for reporting and responding to abuse, promoting family- based care and strengthening the role of the Department of Children. At the conclusion of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee acknowledges that a few concerns were raised by submitters, highlighting issues such as the need for better parenting support, stronger laws on child sexual abuse and improved digital safety for children. The Committee extensively deliberated on these concerns and concluded that by balancing legal reforms with cultural sensitivity and community involvement, the Bill represents a positive shift in Fiji's approach to child welfare. It aims to create a society in which every child is safe, valued and able to thrive. The Committee believes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Bill is sufficient as it stands, with only minor amendments needed. Additionally, the Committee recommends a few measures for the effective implementation of the proposed law, which have been put forth for Parliament's consideration, which are detailed in this Report. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Justice Law and Human Rights for their deliberations and input. The Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament. (Report handed to the Secretary-General) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024 and the Communication from the Chair on 5 th August, 2024, the Standing Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly, and the Bill will be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5 th December, 2024.</p></body>
