<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Proactive Measures to Discourage Children Becoming Homeless (Question No. 273/2024) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform Parliament on the proactive measures or preventative strategy that is currently being used by the Ministry to discourage children from moving over to towns and cities and becoming homeless? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer the question, I wish Fiji a Happy International Day for Persons with Disabilities, currently being celebrated around the country and this is spearheaded by organisations for people living with disabilities and the National Council of Persons with Disabilities. Right now, our children living with disabilities are celebrating at Lawaqa Park in Sigatoka as the main event, especially there is a night programme as well planned for them. I want to thank the Disability District Committees in Sigatoka, Nadi and Lautoka, and also the parents and guardians and children for putting together the programme, as well as our donor partners who have come forward to celebrate with them.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2341 Mr. Speaker, the core responsibility for any child is the parent. We live in a society where our people are embedded in our religious teachings, despite what their faith is or ethnicity or gender of the child. It is still the core institution in protecting the child and that is the family. So, when this crucial structure fails, then it is for the community or the village or the mataqali, the yavusa, wherever we live, has to step in and take care of the child. Mr. Speaker, as alluded to in the question, when children leave their home and come into towns and cities and become homeless, this is of great concern and community members continue to flag this with the Ministry and in the media and in the Government in terms of what we do with these children. Mr. Speaker, we as a Ministry are working on all levels and this is not anything new for the Ministry or this Government, it has been done by previous Governments. There is an inter-agency for children, as well as line Ministries that are working together, especially coming together for child protection because when a child is homeless, of course, their protection and safety is first and foremost. Given the complexity surrounding this where there is a tussle between what Government can do, what our Child Protection Officers can do verses the primary responsibility and duty with the family or with the parents, we have had to bring in, of course, the assistance of the community in terms of where we draw the line, how we take care of our children, while their parents or guardians are still alive or still around. It is very different, of course, as you know, for children who are orphaned and are not taken care of because they become wards of the State and we can place them in homes where they can be taken care of so often, we see this tussle. When we take children in and we place them in homes, family members will come and take them away or family members feel embarrassed that their children are at the homes and come and take them away, but not necessarily providing the care that they need. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an actual taskforce set up for street dwellers, especially our children, working with UNICEF in the last year and identifying reasons for why they have moved to the streets and choose to live on the streets. I think I have mentioned that a few times now in terms of the associated issues with children living on the streets, whether it is abuse, whether it is drug use, whether it is just the lack of interest in education or being at home, or neglect. Our Ministry has seen higher cases reporting on child neglect, rather than child abuse so children are being left unsupervised. They find friends and comfort living on the streets rather than living at home. Mr. Speaker, Sir, no matter how much of awareness programmes we run as Ministries, no matter which Ministry, it still comes back to the setting of the home and what is lacking in terms of what children need. I thank the support of our CSOs, who are working with us - Empower Pacific, Medical Services Pacific, Save the Children, ARUKA Fiji and, of course, Inspire Pacific and the Salvation Army, who are providing support and assistance for these children, and many churches and communities as well, taking in these children to take care of them. But it is obviously not long term or in a process that is complete to see their rehabilitation and reintegration back into their families. A few things that we have done in the last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think this may answer Question No. 285/2024 as well on Wednesday, asked by the same honourable Member. As I have mentioned yesterday, Salvation Army has opened a shelter, working with street dwellers, street kids that they have taken in, so we thank the Salvation Army for that.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2342 As you know in the current budget year, there was a commitment in terms of starting a child wellbeing centre in Vunirewa, Serua, and there was a commitment of about $230,000. That is, obviously, taking a longer process because if we are to include a clinical component in this child wellbeing centre, for children to be rehabilitated from drugs, it needs to go through a thorough process, calling for proposals from private sector or clinics that have done this. It is, obviously, overseas because we have never done this in Fiji for children. So, it takes time in terms of calling for proposals. These Centres that have been set up by the Salvation Army, as well as Inspire Pacific, hopefully, the Ministry will be able to see if we can repurpose that funding that is there to invest in current centres that have been set up and these centres, obviously, need the expertise, like child psychologists, child psychiatrists, which we lack in Fiji. When we are taking our street children and they need assistance in terms of rehabilitation, whether it is drugs or other issues, there are no professionals to attend to them. So, unfortunately, children get turned away from the Stress Management Ward at the CWM Hospital. They only deal with adults, as well as St. Giles hospital. So, this is a huge gap that needs to be filled to have our professionals working with children. That is taking some time so, hopefully, we will be able to do that in this budget year so that we do not waste that money. If we are to invest in current centres like, the Salvation Army Centre, Inspire Pacific, and we thank Inspire Pacific, we have just completed that five-week camp that I talked about yesterday. I thank the government of China for funding that to begin, but of course, we as government have a responsibility. There is very little money that is usually committed to children and the need to look after our children. So, this needs to change. And that is something that as we put these programmes together, working with our partners, that we hopefully see a bigger budget commitment. We have begun with our Department of Children. As the programmes roll out and we submit that in our budget submissions, hopefully, in the coming year, we will be able to see more committed to our Department of Children. However, I want to thank UNICEF, who has come on board for technical support and have ensured to help our CSOs that are doing this, that the centres are safe for children, they meet certain minimum standards working with the Department of Children, so thank you to UNICEF. The taskforce dealing with street kids are now looking at a wider range of issues, like children living with HIV, children living with drugs and other social issues that they are facing. So, we invite relevant partners and others that want to partner with the Ministry and these organisations. “Please, come on board and work with us.” We are hoping to then set up also in the Western Division and Northern Division for the same kinds of programmes. I want to thank our Churches as well - the Fiji Council of Churches. They continue to give a space and facilities to use for our programmes. I want to thank also our line Ministry, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Fiji Police Force, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Housing, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Local Government, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Education and, of course, Ministry of Employment. Thank you for your continued support as we work together. It will take line Ministries to come together to get this done, but they are usually tapping into their operational budget to assist us. So, hopefully, we see more of that in the next coming Budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we needed to build capacity, moving forward, it is really to help our children to be able to reintegrate back into families that they feel they are cared for. It is not necessarily their parents or their immediate family, they may choose another family member to be</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2343 with and that is what we are working with them, so we do really listen to our children. Again, I thank the honourable Member for the question. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, I do agree with the honourable Minister that the loitering around of kids, especially in towns and in their school uniforms is an issue to address. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to ask the honourable Minister, she is talking about a safety net for these street girls, but at the same time, she makes a comment in media that there needs to be a children’s curfew. If a child does not have anywhere to go, they get caught by the authorities, it is more issues for the children and even the authorities themselves. So, where are we going with this honourable Minister? One side, you want to protect them, the other side there is a curfew. It is more issues, where are we going? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. It is not a Government policy, at the moment, it is certainly something that is floated and not approved yet. It has been done in other jurisdictions, in other countries around the world, so it is nothing new. But if you look at it, honourable Sharma and honourable Members, they are actually consistent because if you do introduce a curfew, you are not penalising the child. It is going to be the parents and carers that are held responsible to ensure that our children are safe. It has been practised right now in Fiji in the Vanua o Sabeto, they have imposed the children's curfew in their villages in the Vanua o Betoraurau. So, it is already happening here in Fiji, in the villages so a child must be at home during certain hours, cannot be loitering and it is the responsibility of the parent or guardian, so it is consistent with child protection. MR. SPEAKER.- Do you wish to have a follow up question, honourable Sharma, or are you satisfied with the answer?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the update that she has given. I think this is a very serious problem. All of us are concerned about it, when we walk into town, and we see the children. One of the things that struck me in particular, is the fact that the honourable Minister stated that they found that the cases of neglect was much higher than abuse. That is very interesting, that people are actually leaving because of neglect. I was thinking along these lines, if neglect is a problem more than abuse, then there would be parents of these children that are recipients of assistance from the Ministry. Would that be something that you would look at to try and address, to link up the fact that those who are neglecting their children, are still getting assistance through the Ministry? Would there be a possibility of timely structure so that you can use the assistance provided by the Ministry to parents who are neglecting their children as a possible way to get them to change their views on the way that they do things? It just struck me that neglect is hiding the abuse, because most of the time we think abuse is a big problem. Thank you. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, certainly that is a good question. Again, it is not up to the Ministry when it comes to parental rights and parental responsibilities, the Ministry cannot hold parents to ransom. I mean, it certainly is a suggestion to link it to social protection, but not all of the parents or the children that have been reported have their parents in social protection. The reasons are varied and there may be times when it is really not the parents’ fault. There</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2344 are parents who are working parents that do not have the ability to pay for a caregiver, so the reasons are varied, but it leaves the child helpless. So that certainly needs to be a responsibility not just of the Government, but I think the community can come in as well. There are less and less interest from family members in taking children, do you believe it? But we are moving into the 21 st Century. I think as families become more or less extended families and more into nuclear families, we are even struggling to place children in kin care, in their family care, because it would not be the lack of interest, but just inability to take on more children to care for. So, if we are able to help parents and caregivers to be trained, to be better parents, so to speak, and it does not just take Government, it also takes our churches, our faith-based organisations, traditional leaders and communities, to help parents be better parents and provide the support when they need it. I think we will see less cases of neglect of our children, but, like I said, the reasons are varied, but we still need to be able to take care of the child when they are presented to us. Thank you. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament, is there any policy or direction of taking the street kids to established homes? It may sound funny, but this is the reality in Ba. Some street kids are taken into established homes in Ba. So, those 10 to 15 boys who were taken to that home spoiled the existing boys and some of them had to leave that home. I know there are some Ministers who are good at making headlines when saying this and that, but this is the reality on the ground. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Bala, it is a very valid question. In the established Department of Children, the he Department is the regulatory authority to ensure that any homes that are established for children must meet certain standards. You certainly cannot place children at risk, together with children who may be in conflict with the law. So, that is part of the regulatory standards that we need to enforce. Let me continue, to monitor Homes, that is part of our job, but I think it is upon those who start up these homes to ensure that these children are not put together. I know that there are examples of children in the West, like the Tabitha Home. They ensure that the children who come are kept separate from the other children. So, what we are really missing is the need for more psychosocial support for these homes, where the child psychologist can deal with the children, to counsel them. I think this is the general message when we are dealing with children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we often focus a lot on the victims but we need to look at the perpetrators, the child perpetrators as well, whether they are bullies, whether they are committing a crime, those children need help as well. So, we need to be able to provide that psychosocial support to counsel those who are also hurting children. They need that as well. So, we need to encourage our homes to be able to have that kind of psychological services so that they counsel children and the issues that they present with. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Status of the IHRDP (Question No. 274/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the status of the Integrated Human Resources Development Programme in its efforts to create employment and support livelihoods in the rural and peri-urban areas? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to thank honourable Vanawalu for</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2345 his question. Before I answer the question, may I just be allowed to respond to the comments made by honourable Usamate regarding the need for a plan and even the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, said that in 2009, he had produced a Labour Plan for Fiji and it was given to the Government. They totally flipped it on its head and cancelled all the TVET institutions. So, I think he is contradicting himself in his contribution. Anyway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief, given that there are a lot of things to go through, but this Integrated Human Resource Development Programme (IHRDP) was a construct of the previous Government and I have to say, actually before that, from the year 2000. But the previous Government continued with it, and it is probably one of the more successful programmes that the Ministry has. We will certainly continue to push it because as we all agree, we need to really drive economic activity in our rural areas and stimulate the rural economy. And what we are finding, is through the IHRDP we are accessing a lot of these rural communities and starting to see significant movement and positive change. But what we also did, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was we increased the grant threshold to $250,000 and that has allowed us to do more in terms of the assistance. Just by way of context, in 2023 and 2024, the Ministry observed that we had received over 39 applications with $2.7 million requests. But despite the budget of only $1 million we managed to cover 21 applications valued at about $1.5 million which clearly shows that there is appetite for the IHRDP and hopefully we will continue to grow the funds going forward to sort of assist the rural economy. What we have also discovered, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is a potential to do more within peri-urban and also the urban economy, and we now have started recalibrating the grant a bit because you know in the urban economy there are pockets of areas particularly the housing areas, that do not have much economic activity, so we are placing some focus on there, as well as encouraging co- operative type of ventures and then trying to see how we can assist them as well. I toured Western Division recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is wonderful to see some of the developments that are happening in the Division. One particular company called Mick’s Fiji Tours &amp; Transfers, a young man from Nadroga is doing a tour business. He actually came to Fiji after the change of the Government and set up his business in Fiji. He is now running with about 50 employees across the Coral Coast and into Nadi, and servicing customers, doing tours. We assisted him with a new boat just recently, on a one-third, two-third basis, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Another interesting co-operative, I just thought I would share to the Parliament, just to sort of motivate us, so that the money that we are giving is actually going to some really good projects. I talk about Matababani Co-operative, deep in the middle of Viti Levu in the village of Nakaro in Navosa. They are based about two hours to three hours out of Sigatoka. In the previous Government, they were given a solar farm. Through the advice from the Ministry, they decided to turn that into a co-operative business. Because of what they saw and how that co-operative venture was working, and because it was working well and because they are big planters of kava, they decided to form a co-operative for kava and invest in a packing house for their kava, together with the pounding machine and implements, it was about $20,000 plus on the investment. If you go up to the middle of Viti Levu now, they are pounding their own kava and bringing it down to the market for purchase. Their ambition is to eventually move into export, and we will try and assist them in that. So, these are the types of transformative things that are happening around the country.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2346 I am sure the honourable Minister for Agriculture can relate a few more. I would also like to just talk about Wailevu Cane Farmers’ Co-operative, which I met in the North just recently. Through the co-operative movement, they purchased, and they are cane farmers. This side of the Parliament is looking for a solution for cane, and we hope to bring some clarity to that issue soon. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the farmers already know what the solution is. For the Wailevu Co-operative farmers, they have invested in a rice harvesting machine, so the farmers are already diversifying on the ground. They are saying that they are getting good money from the rice in the North, and they use that machine. I think it was about $150,000 that was the total contribution from our side. But for the rice harvester, it will improve their yields and production, and, of course, increase their returns. Then in the North also is the Tavoro Forest Park Cooperative, which was supported through IHRDP. This is in Bouma Village and my prediction with this co-operative is that they will eventually become a hotel property owner from Bouma. The reason for that is because it is such a special location, and it is an opportunity to see all the waterfalls around that area. You can actually go up and see Tagimoucia from that area. It is such a special opportunity, and they have managed to generate a good business from all the tourism in that area. We are now talking about some plans to scale up with them, and that is what is happening in Bouma, at the moment, in the Tavoro Co- operatives. I guess, in a nutshell, the short answer is that IHRDP funding is doing well. The Government will continue to support this programme. From the benefits of that programme, we have now moved to a cooperative grant as well under the same sort of structure. So, this is the keenness to continue to stimulate the rural economy and I am pretty confident that we will resolve some of the challenges that we have in the rural economy through this particular grant and the other grants that the Ministry of Agriculture and some of the other Ministries are delving in as well. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. Currently, Fiji is facing a shortage of kava, there are farmers who are not interested. So, based on this particular programme - IHRDP, is there any assistance or uptake to go and develop this particular sector, a little bit more at an enhanced level? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Kumar for that question. The short answer is ‘yes’, we are very keen to try and drive the kava assistance through IHRDP and also the cooperative grant. We find that the actual cooperative model is quite suited for a lot of our farming areas. We have been assisting quite a few farmers of late, there is one that I did not mention here, but there is a young man called Sowane, up in Lovoni, in Levuka. A couple of hundred farmers come through him and there are some good opportunities there. He has his own solar plant and doing the same thing as the people in Navosa are doing. So, yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some great opportunities to mobilise the cooperative movement, and I will make a statement later on my visit to India. However, just as a prelude, India’s success in terms of agriculture was built off co-operatives and there is a big message in there for Fiji. One of their most successful brands – Amul, which produces dairy milk, is a 100 percent co-operative. It is now earning revenue, not in the millions but in the billions, so the point raised by honourable Premila Kumar is quite valid. There is a massive opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to unlock our rural economy using cooperatives and you will find, on this side of the House, a great enthusiasm and commitment towards</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2347 encouraging the co-operative movement and trying to use it to boost our agricultural sector. As a final note, credit to the co-operative movement. One of the co-operatives that we assisted from Natadola, the leader of the co-operative said to me, “I should have gotten into co-operatives a lot faster,” because through co-operatives you can share capital expenditure, and the commitment for one farmer becomes less of a burden when you share the capital expenditure across a couple of farmers. In the case of Natadola co-operative, you got 10 of them. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that answers honourable Premila Kumar’s question. HON. F. S. KOYA.- I have a supplementary question, honourable Minister, in terms of IHRDP. Has the Ministry looked at targeted assistance, especially in light of the fact that you spoke about diversification in areas, for example, organic farming, where that can benefit co-operatives or small groups? Are we looking at or getting the data for targeted assistance so we can actually grow these areas? HON. M. S. N KAMIKAMICA.- To be honest, at the moment, we allow everyone to apply, for example, at the moment, the honourable Minister for Agriculture and I are basically working in sync on the Kava Bill because that will then create a good opportunity for us to really tap into the opportunities in kava and because of that, then of course, the assistance going to kava co-operatives will have to be elevated as well. That is probably one of the areas that we would be looking at a lot closer. By default, I think quite are few of those type of co-operatives are coming. It is certainly something that once as some of the regulatory frameworks that we need before we push support in a certain area come into play, then we can really go hard on the targeted project. So once the Kava Bill is out, there are few other things that will come with it. The push to really maximise on kava will be harder, I will take that on board as something that I can talk to the Ministry of Finance and also the Ministry of Agriculture about in terms of just pushing certain things that the Government wants to do. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, unfortunately not every project in the past succeeded for obvious reasons, some mismanagement, some capacity. There are two parts to my question, if you can, please, respond to it. One is, any consideration for follow-ups to those that failed because we have spent money on these projects? Secondly, the monitoring and hand-holding process and this is probably why the Northern Development Programme was so successful because of the programme. So, under the IHRDP projects because I know they come under an ILO Framework, what are the plans in the Ministry to address such issues? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I had ran out of time, I fail to sort of share some of the statistics regarding monitoring. I will just perhaps share them to answer to the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s question. Based on the recent visitations, there is about a 90 percent success rate in terms of recorded for IHRDP. Monitoring and evaluation tells us that for every MSME we support through IHRDP, it has created about nine jobs and the effective benefit is about 36 livelihoods. That is the assessment and on average, one recipient can earn up to about $200,000 annually dependent on sectors and particularly in the agricultural sector. One of the probably most impressive things that happened recently with the co-operatives is the development of more green technology opportunities. For example, because of the lack of access</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>2348 to electricity, some of the co-operatives are now moving to solar-powered solutions and that is something that we started to see a lot more of, for example, the Lovu Co-operative in Gau which hopefully will be visiting early next year. They had got solar-powered equipment like freezers and dryers for their enterprise. There is a monitoring arm of the cooperative division and also the MSMEs, and they do track the success of the projects, if there are issues, try and help with the remediation and those kinds of things. You are correct that there has been a lot of governance issues in the past with co-operatives, particularly. What we try and challenge or encourage our farmers, particularly to look at the co- operative model using good examples where there has been success. We do monitor, we do training as well. One of the things that we also try and do is, training is very important before a co-operative is set up, so everyone understands the governance framework. Hopefully, that is probably a way we can educate and inculcate the disciplines around, not only managing a business but the whole process around running businesses and those kind of things which are very important once the grant is provided. Salary Differences – Radiologists and Sonographers (Question No. 275/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on the salary differences between Radiologists, Sonographers and those performing doppler scans in the public health sector? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Ravunawa for his question. Just for the purpose of clarification on the different cadres of health care workers referred to in this question, radiologists are medical officers who have gained their Degrees in Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery have gone through internship programme, gone through rural appointment before joining the Radiology Department as part of their request for joining a specialised field. They are responsible for the interpretation of radiological imaging such as x-ray, CT, ultrasound, MRI reports and they do the reporting. They are pegged at, starting on Band H, Step 5. As for sonographers or medical imaging technologist who perform doppler scans like ultrasound modalities, they have completed their Bachelor Degree in Medical Imaging Technology and have joined the workforce as Medical Imaging Technologist (MIT). Through in-house trainings, MIT gain additional skills to perform the procedures for specialised tests such as ultrasound, computerised tomography or CT scan or MRI scanning and ultra-sonography as well. Salaries for MIT start at Step 2 on Band F and MIT perform general radiography are paid at the same level as those performing ultrasound scans, CT scans, mammography and MRI scans in both hospital settings and the subdivision hospitals. In April this year, Mr. Speaker, I had stated in this august House that in the last decade, Fiji has also seen a share of radiological imaging development, with the introduction of high-quality ultrasound technology, CT scan, MRI testing and other advanced testing technologies. These developments have meant the need to increase the workforce and enhance their capabilities to operate these new advanced technologies for a better disease diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, this did not happen concurrently with the introduction of new and advanced technologies over the years. Sir, this is an exercise that the Ministry is currently undertaking with the support of our partners to</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>2349 address the workforce needs now and, in the future, including the appropriate remuneration for our staff and the Ministry is committed to complete this task. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform the House, is there any qualified sonographer in the country? The reason I am asking this, Sir, because no university in Fiji is offering courses in this field. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- In general, they graduate with a Medical Imaging Technology Degree, and as I had mentioned, once they come on Board the workforce, then they are trained in the various other parts of medical imaging modalities that are available. At the moment, as part of the review, we are trying to ensure that training to be accredited is also included in the review. As it is, they are just learning on the job and some of the local accreditation from various hospital settings overseas, they have been seconded too to work there, learn and then come back and perform the duties that they do perform. But at the moment, the ones that we have, they are locally trained, and they are doing the work as it is. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. There are specialised fields in this particular scope of work, especially if we are looking at CT scans and MRI. We have radiologists reading the scans and doing the report, who are paid close to around $143,000, et cetera. Now, we have technicians who are carrying out this work and are only paid around $22,000 to $23,000. Why this huge disparity in salaries because within the images, the radiologist will not be able to read the reports. Even the honourable Minister explained in his answer previously that these people are trained, but they are not accredited. This is just a band-aid solution to train our technicians to work in Fiji, but if they go abroad, it is not recognised. What is the honourable Minister doing in terms of bridging the gap of the salary difference? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess my colleague was not listening, I have just mentioned in my reply that as part of the review of their workforce, that we will include accredited training to be part of, especially the MITs, together with that then we can also remunerate them accordingly based on the skills that they have attained. That is included in our review and that will happen. It did not happen in the last four, eight or 16 years ago. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- We will now move the suspension motion for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times.</p></body>
