<body><h3>2025 CALENDAR OF PARLIAMENT SITTINGS</h3><h4>2025 CALENDAR OF PARLIAMENT SITTINGS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament adopts the Sitting Calendar for the year 2025.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as all honourable Members are aware, under Standing Order 22(1), the Business Committee is required to recommend to Parliament a schedule of sitting times for each session of Parliament or each 12-month sitting period of Parliament, whichever comes first. Furthermore, Clause 2 stipulates that the suggested agenda must be submitted to Parliament by the third sitting day of the session, at the latest. In light of that, Sir, the Business Committee met and began deliberating over a suggested 2025 Sitting Calendar which is in front of you. In terms of the appropriate dates, I can certify that the 2025 Sitting Calendar which has been distributed to our honourable Members this morning, was accepted and authorised by the Business Committee. While the Business Committee had accepted and approved the Sitting Calendar, it also agreed that in the event that some of the sittings needed to be readjusted immediately, that would be brought before Parliament for further consideration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main reason for this is to allow for some flexibility in Parliament. The following sitting times are listed in the approved Sitting Calendar for the benefit of all our honourable Members and the broader public. As most honourable Members may be aware, this has been the accepted practice in the last two terms of Parliament, of course, including the former Government. February Monday 24 th Official Opening of Parliament</p></body>
