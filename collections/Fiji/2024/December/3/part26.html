<body><h3>ANNEXURE II</h3><h4>ANNEXURE II</h4><p>Reply to Written Question No. 282/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services (Ref. Page 2359) MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES (Hon. Dr. Ratu A. R. Lalabalavu) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reply to Question No. 282/2024 is as follows: (a) Postpartum Depression is a significant mood disorder affecting one in seven women following childbirth. The postpartum phase has been defined broadly as within 12 months after childbirth, but the World Health Organisation (WHO) specifies that postpartum period to be within six weeks after childbirth. According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), onset of postpartum major depression can occur prior to or after childbirth. The DSM-5 specifier “with peripartum onset” is used when onset of major depression occurs either during pregnancy or in the four weeks following delivery. Postpartum depression can range from a mild depression which is usually self limiting, to a severe syndrome which when untreated can lead to serious consequences to the mother and her baby. Unfortunately, local data on postpartum depression is limited. Globally, the prevalence is estimated to be about 14 percent, however the country’s economy status is a factor in its prevalence, where rates are higher in developing countries compared to developed countries. Primary risk factors show previous depression prior to or during pregnancy to be the largest effect and mainly associated with postpartum depression while secondary risk factors such as stressful life events (intimate partner violence is one of them) and poor financial and social support during the post pregnancy period are contributors to postpartum depression. (b) Women who are most likely to develop postpartum depression are those in lower economic status, minimum education, unmarried and in the young and older spectrum of age. Given the limited data in Fiji, the statistics from other country and clinical settings reveal the aforementioned socio- economic issues as main contributors to postpartum depression in most country settings.
