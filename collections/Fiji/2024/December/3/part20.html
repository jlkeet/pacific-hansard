<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – SUGAR CANE GROWERS FUND 2021 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – SUGAR CANE GROWERS FUND 2021 ANNUAL REPORT HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report which was tabled on 3rd October, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.:</span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund (SCGF) is a statutory body providing affordable loans to sugar cane growers in Fiji, with the aim to increase the production of sugar cane, improve efficiency in planting, growing, harvesting and transportation of sugar cane, rehabilitate farms, buildings and other installations damaged, destroyed or affected by floods, cyclones and natural disasters and the establishment of sugar cane farms and other installations on the farms. Our Committee upon being referred to with the SCGF 2021 Annual Report received public hearing for the Fund to gather information on its operational dynamics as part of the Committee’s scrutiny process. At the end of the review, the Committee made recommendations based on the discussions with SCGF and the Annual Report’s content. While the Committee scrutinised the Report, it identified pertinent issues such as the: • • • • • absence of key performance indicators. lack of established targets. rate of returns were very poor during the review period. audit did not focus on issues pertinent to the reporting year instead emphasising elements from the previous years. The largest group of borrowers produced less than 100 tonnes accounting for 47 percent while the majority, 90 percent of the borrowers are those producing under 400 tonnes. issues with FSC’s long term debt to South Pacific Fertilizers Limited were highlighted. The Annual Report lacked details on how loans are monitored once issued to the groups and was also deficient in information on loan portfolios. There was insufficient information regarding the new farmers assistance programme which was launched in 2018. Furthermore, the Committee in its review report articulated 20 findings with recommendations. The Committee is looking forward to Ministry implementing the recommendations put forward by the Standing Committee and hoping to see changes in the Sugar Cane Growers Fund’s future annual reports. However, we note that there are areas that can be improved through more enhanced coordination, commitment and accountability of all sugar stakeholders. HON. P. K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report. I also would like to extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for their comprehensive report. Madam Deputy Speaker, under the Chairman's Foreword, it is noted that the Committee identified several challenges faced by the SCGF such as the uncertainty of lease renewal. For many farmers, Madam Deputy Speaker, their leases are on the verge of expiry. For instance, there are numerous farmers who receive their 30-year lease in 2000 which are set to expire in 2030. The current policy of the Fund does not allow the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to provide loans to those in that category because the policy states that five years before the lease expires, the loan</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>2376 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 3 rd December, 2024 must be paid off. This raises a critical question and I ask, how will these growers increase their production of sugar cane under such constraints? Madam Deputy Speaker, they are also not aware whether the leases will be renewed or not. In addition, farmers have been complaining about the delay in delivery of fertilizers. These delays will definitely affect farmers and their ability to increase production. This is very simple that less fertilizer will definitely reduce productivity. Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of recommendations, I support Recommendation 3.1 which calls for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to review the outdated Act of 1984. This review is important to enhance the structure of the Fund in line with the current business standards. For example, the existing policy does not allow the Fund to support Small and Medium Enterprises. This limitation is a significant problem to the growth and innovation within the sugar industry. Updating the Act to include provision for supporting MSMEs will enable the Fund to serve the needs of our growers better and contribute to the overall development of the industry. As far as the industry goes, in recent weeks, we have heard the Chairman of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) making a statement that FSC will not bill the Rakiraki Mill. Madam Deputy Speaker, the people of Rakiraki and the entire sugar industry have been let down by the Government. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- It all connects:</span></p><p>Considering all these difficulties and challenges, Madam Deputy Speaker, I had submitted a motion regarding the sugar industry which was refused by the Tables Office. However, let me say this, the sector is in crisis. HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! HON. P. K. BALA.- With thousands of livelihoods dependent on it, the Ministry of Sugar's current approach has failed to address the escalating challenges. The sugar industry is vital to our economy and the welfare of the countless Fijians, thus Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee must work urgently to develop recommendations that will address the industry’s current issues and secure its future. Madam Deputy Speaker, while I support the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report and commend the efforts of the Committee, it is clear that more needs to be done. HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! HON. P. K. BALA.- The challenges faced by our cane farmers are significant and require immediate action by addressing the issues of lease renewal, fertiliser delivery and the review of the SCGF Act. We can create a more supportive and effective framework for our cane farmers. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the Standing Committee for Economic Affairs’ Report on the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report. I thank the Chairman and the Members of the Economic Affairs Committee for the Report and findings.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2377 The recommendation on the Annual Report structure in the contents such as the Key Performance Indicators and the Sustainable Development Goals’ matrix are noted. The Sugar Cane Growth Fund will have it incorporated in the Annual Report of 2023. The Sugar Cane Growers Fund (in short, the Fund), and the Ministry of Sugar Industry acknowledge and agrees to the challenges of the Sugar Industry as highlighted in the Report. The Government in 2023 - 2024 Financial Year approved $2 million for the new farmer and lease renewal programme, whereas 30 percent of the cost or a maximum amount of $7,500 was paid. In 2023 - 2024, the Government, with the support of the Fund, as project implementing agency assisted 325 growers with a sum of $1.65 million. About 70 applications from the last financial year are being assessed now and the decision is expected to be made within this month. The Fund has been in the forefront of this, with key stakeholders like, iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB), the Sugar Industry Tribunal. The Fund has signed an MOU with iTLTB for the administration of the process of lease renewal and both CEOs are working closely for the betterment of the industry and landowners. In the current budget, the Government has allocated $1 million as well. Application forms are now available at all the Sugar Cane Growers Fund offices and can also be downloaded on the website - scgf.com.fj. The Ministry is encouraging applications to be submitted to the Ministry before the closing date of 30 th April, 2025. The aging farmers are no exception to the sugar industry and are common across the agriculture sector. However, mechanisation and commercial farming are the way forward. The Government, in this year's Budget, has allocated a total of $7 million under the Sugarcane Development Assistance Programme for the cane planting, which is $0.5 million and is for the farm mechanisation, which is $3 million. For manual labour programmes and support to cover part of the labour cost, the farmers are encouraged to access this grant as well. On the fertiliser and weedicide cost, we agree that the price was high during the reporting period of this Annual Report of 2021. However, there was minimal impact on the growers since the Government subsidised the cost, growers are still paying $20 a bag for 50 kilogrammes of fertiliser. In 2020-2021, the total price of 50 kilogramme fertiliser was $80.90. Well, you see it now, it is declined to $65.25 per bag. The reduced price is beneficial especially for Government, whereby it is now required to only pay $45.25 as subsidy as compared to $60.90 per bag last year. In the 2024- 2025 Budget, a total of $20 million is allocated for the fertiliser subsidy program and $1 million for weedicide have been allocated. I must commend the Board, Management and the staff on the transformation journey of the Fund. Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to also highlight some activities taken by the Fund during this year. Introduction of a new cane farmer lone package with an interest of 2.99 percent per annum for 12 months or 6 percent per annum after that. Policy changes is that the reduce farm purchase equity from 33 percent to 20 percent, reduce the farm machinery purchase equity from 10 percent to 5 percent and increase on medical expenses loan cap from $10,000 to $20,000. Introduce banking and rehabilitation package for the growers who normally lose cane during off season burnings. Farmers will get repayment holidays and an interest rate reduction from 6 percent per annum to 3.1 percent per annum for the next 12 months. Introduce green cane incentives. Under this incentive Madam Deputy Speaker, farmers harvesting over 75 percent or more green cane can receive 2 percent reduction in the interest rates and 6 percent per annum to 4 percent per annum respectively. Based on 2024 harvest data, 791 accounts with a loan value of $7.46 billion will get a 2 percent interest reduction. This reduction is</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2378 paid to $0.149 million for 12 months from January to December 2025. Under this environmental, social and governance framework and SDG and its Sugarcane Growers Fund is all without any donor funding, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Fund devised a house repair termite loan product to complement the Government funding to the cane growers. This loan is expected to be launched this month and has an interest rate of 2.99 percent per annum and 6 percent thereafter, with a maximum loan limit of $50,000. Furthermore, there is an early Christmas for the growers, as the Fund is introducing the SCGF Growers Wealthy Programme. The Fund has gone out to some service providers like hardware merchants, pharmacies and dealers for the farms, tractors or machines and negotiated discount for growers. Every product grower for a start whether they have an account or not, the SCGF Wealthy Card will enable them to get a discount with participating merchants. This is expected to be launched before Christmas, and I must once again commend the great work and innovation by the Fund. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fund continues to reposition itself both within and outside the sugar industry. It is evident in the Fiji Human Resources Institute (FHRI) Awards in September of this year. The fund is also intending to diversify its balance sheet to absorb unexpected shocks, such as natural disasters and to generate returns for the benefit of the sugar sector is noted and encouraged. On this, the Fund is looking at its investment portfolio including the performance of its subsidiary, South Pacific Fertiliser Limited which is 90 percent owned by the Fund. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fund does not have legislatives challenges in extending credit services to both the sugar and non-sugar sectors. It is the strategic intent to diversify and expand its functions for greater sustainability is commendable. In this context, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was engaged to conduct a gap analysis. The ADB has developed a roadmap for the Fund to potentially become a licensed financial institution. However, this requires review of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Act. The Ministry is also waiting for the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Report on the sugar sector study which is expected to be received in the next three weeks. Along with this sector analysis, this study also looked at the institutions operations. The report shall be helpful in designing the strategic path for all institutions. I want to put on record, my sincere appreciation to honourable Sakiusa Tubuna for facilitating our request with FAO to conduct this at no cost to the Government. The sugar industry has been and will continue to be significant contributor to economic growth and nation building. The Fund and South Pacific Fertiliser, both have significant roles within and beyond the industry as economic drivers, especially with the ongoing reforms of the Fund. Once again, I extend my gratitude to the Committee Members for their contribution and deliberation. Based on these remarks, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion. HON. V. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to address the Review Report of the Sugarcane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report with a full sense of responsibility. I am well aware of the various problems faced and overcome by our cane farmers. I, therefore, have no other choice than to air their grievances and aspirations through this august Parliament. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund has been a pillar of support to our farmers since its inception in 1984. The fund has been mandated to provide loans for increasing sugar cane production, improving efficiency and aiding farmers in times of distress is commendable. But the Report brings to light several critical issues that need immediate attention. The most critical now is the uncertainty of lease renewals and the ageing farmers.</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2379 Honourable Bala has spoken about this, and you can see the number of sugar cane farmers have strictly reduced and there are many other reasons apart from lack of labourers and in the case of Rakiraki, the closing down of the sugar mill. But the lease renewals is a major issue. Why are a lot of farmers moving away from sugarcane farming? This morning, we heard from the Deputy Prime Minister that some cane farmers in the North are now turning to rice farming. Madam Deputy Speaker, yet our farmers remain very much as the backbone of the industry. They face the bleak prospect of an insecure future, rising fertiliser prices and destruction of farm infrastructure by various forces of nature add to the challenges of rural urban drift. How does the Government hope to help address these issues that stand in the way of a sustainable cane farming industry? The Report also highlights that there are no established key performance indicators and targets for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. Without such goals it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the Fund and make appropriate recommendations. What steps will the Government take to ensure that the SCGF sets and meets its specific measurable target to enhance its performance? Furthermore, the archaic Act of 1984 urgently needs revision. The agricultural landscape has changed a great deal over the past decade and our policies are required to reflect the emerging reality. What is the timeline by the Government to review and update this very important piece of legislation? The Report also highlights the impact of external factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war on fertiliser prices and the devastating effects of tropical cyclones. These events have severely affected our farmer’s livelihoods. What measures are being implemented to provide immediate and long- term relief to those impacted by such crisis? Madam Deputy Speaker, however, the fund has been resilient and adaptable to these challenges, more so in adopting modern technology. The mySCGF App, the online portal and the SMS alert services have been a step in the right direction. At the same time, we will ensure that such tools are accessible to the majority of farmers, even those in remote areas. The Report also indicates that smaller growers, those producing under 300 tonnes, are borrowing more than larger growers. What this does is, the point to the fact, that our smaller farmers are in a greater need of financial support. How does the Government plan to provide targeted assistance to these smaller growers to ensure they can thrive and contribute to the industry? The Standing Committee also noted that the largest category of borrowers produce less than 100 tonnes and they make up to 47 percent of the total borrowers. It is thus important that their support is assured. What specific programmes or initiatives are being developed to support the farmers and help them become more productive? Second, the most important focus of this audit report seems to be more on the past problems than the current year. That is of utmost importance. So our audits will give a precise representation of the present. How does Government make the auditing exercise more relevant and focussed towards present challenges and opportunities in future? The lack of detailed information on how loans are monitored once issued to growers, is also troubling. Effective loan monitoring is essential to ensure that funds are used appropriately and that growers can repay their loans. What measures will be put in place to improve loan monitoring and ensure transparency and accountability?</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2380 Madam Deputy Speaker, this financial result, evidenced by the net surplus of $3.06 million during 2021, pays homage to our farmers and a reflection of hard work and the management of the Fund. Local term deposits fell from $15 million to $14 million during this period. A drop due to general economic circumstances and outcomes linked with COVID-19. How does the Government plan to support the SCGF in maintaining its financial stability to be able to continue this vital support to our farmers? The recommendations are very clear and well entrenched in the Standing Committee's recommendations: (1) A review of the organisational structure of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund; (2) Comprehensive information to be included in future reports; and (3) Establishment of KPIs to justify budgetary allocations. These recommendations are key to making the Fund more effective and able to meet the needs of our farmers. The Report also stresses the importance of the activities of the Fund in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This alignment should demonstrate our commitment to the achievement of international goals as well as sustainability and inclusivity in agriculture. How does the Government intend to support the Fund in aligning its operations and reporting on the SDGs? Madam Deputy Speaker, while I support the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021, I call on the Government for decisive action in addressing the concerns of our cane farmers. By doing so, we can secure the future of our sugarcane industry and the livelihood of hardworking farmers who sustain it. Thank you. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will make a short contribution on this particular debate, the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, 2021. They were in the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs when I was in the Opposition, and one of the organisations which was under that Committee is the SCGF. When we went there, we were very impressed with the organisation. How it was organised, the structure and also the services. I was wondering whether this could be replicated, I suppose with other farmers. For example, yaqona and dalo farmers. It would probably be a good analysis, but I think some of the responses from the Opposition is misleading because this is the only Government which is taking a serious look at the Sugar industry. So, when the honourable Minister explained what we were doing with the uncertainty in lease renewals, and Government had allocated in 2023- 2024, $2 million and as already stated, $1.1 million in the 2024-2025 Budget. So, honourable Praveen Bala, this alleviates your concerns. The other thing was the close liaison between the honourable Minister of Sugar and Minister of iTaukei Affairs, in terms of the renewal of leases, which has been progressing really well. The other issue that was mentioned on the fertilisers and weedicides, again the Minister has clearly mentioned the reduction in the price, so clearly contradicting what you are saying. The last point, to the honourable Vijendra Lal, regarding the organisation itself and what it needs to do to be reformed or move forward, to respond to the farmers. This has been clearly articulated by the honourable Minister, and as a caring Government, we are addressing all those. The honourable Minister mentioned eight initiatives; new loan packages, policy changes, green cane initiative, house termite repair loan, grow a loyalty programme to obviously create sustainability with the ADB, and the current Report which is upcoming from the FAO regarding the analysis on the sugar industry to charter a way forward.</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2381 So, all in all, the Coalition Government is taking the right steps, the strategic steps which will take our sugar industry forward in terms of what needs to be done, whether it is to diversify, sustain or increase sugar production et cetera. I support the Report and thank the Standing Committee. HON. RATU. J. B. NIUDAMU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise today with a deep sense of duty and commitment as I address the reviewed Report of the Sugarcane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report. Being from Ra Province, one of the provinces that benefited mostly from the sugarcane industry for many years, I am deeply connected to our cane farmers and their enduring legacy. The sugar industry has been the life blood of our communities in the Ra province and has provided not only economic sustenance but also a sense of purpose and pride for generations of farmers. The Sugar Cane Growers Fund which was established in 1984, has been instrumental in supporting our farmers through loans for increased production, efficiency and during times of distress. However, the challenges highlighted in this Report reminds us that we need to do more to ensure the sustainability and prosperity of this vital industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, our cane farmers are facing numerous challenges that threaten their livelihoods and the future of the sugar industry. The uncertainty of lease renewals, the aging farmer population and the rising cost of fertilisers are just a few of the issues that need urgent attention. I thank the honourable Minister for Sugar, that he had indicated about the sugar fertiliser subsidy. I believe I am going through this 2021 Annual Report, and I will continue with my submission. Natural disasters, like TC Winston, have caused huge damage to farm infrastructure. These are big challenges that call for equally big solutions. It is time that we make sure that these are solved properly so that our farmers can survive. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report also points out the lack of established Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and targets for the Sugarcane Growers Fund. Without clear goals, it is difficult to measure the effectiveness of the fund and make informed decisions. I urge the Government to work closely with the Sugarcane Growers Fund and set specific measurable targets that will enhance its performance and provide better support to our farmers. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugarcane Growers Act of 1984 has become outdated, and it needs revision to meet present realities in the agricultural sector. We must have our policies changed with the time to answer the needs of our farmers and the industry in general. Madam Deputy Speaker, I call on the Government to make the review and updating of this important law a priority with the aim of aligning it with contemporary standards and best practices in business. External factors such as the Russian and Ukraine War which increased fertilizer prices and economic consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic, has stretched our farmers to the breaking point. These events have pointed out the ills of our agricultural sector. We need to develop strategies that reduce the risk and give our farmers the ability to withstand such storms. Madam Deputy Speaker, despite these challenges, I am heartened by the level of resilience and adaptability shown by the Sugar Cane Growers Fund and our farmers. For instance, the introduction of the MySCGF app online portal and SMS alert services and SMS instance. For instance, Madam Deputy Speaker, the introduction of the MySCGF app online portal and SMS alert services is commendable in modernising the Fund’s operations and increasing farmers’ access to the Fund services. We must ensure, however, that these digital tools are user friendly and accessible to all farmers especially those farmers in the rural areas.</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report – SCGF 2021 Annual Report 2382 Madam Deputy Speaker, it emerges from this report that small growers with less than 300 tonnes are borrowing more than large growers. In other words, the report show us that small scale farmers have bigger financial needs compared to their large-scale counterparts. Basically, it becomes important that we offer better support to these small growers. Programmes and initiatives specifically designed to support small scale farmers need to be created with a focus on helping these farmers improve their production. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sugar Cane Growers Fund’s financial performance of 2021 with a net surplus of $3.6million is a testimony to the hard work and commitment by our farmers and management of the Fund. The Report also highlighted that the local term deposits decreased from $15 million to $14 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic that negatively affected economies around the world. It is for this reason, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we need to support the Sugar Cane Growers Fund in maintaining its financial stability so that it can continue to provide the much-needed support to our farmers. Madam Deputy Speaker, the recommendations made by the Committee are quite clear and actionable. This ranges from a review of the organisational structure of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, to the inclusion of comprehensive information in future reports, establishment of the key performance indicators with the view to justify budgetary allocations. Such recommendations will go a long way in ensuring that the Sugar Cane Growers fund is efficient and able to respond to the need of our farmers. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report also emphasized the importance of aligning the Sugar Cane Growers Fund activities with the SDGs. This alignment is essential for demonstrating our commitment to international goals and ensuring that our agricultural practices are sustainable and inclusive. I urge the Government to support the Sugar Cane Growers Fund in integrating the SDGs into its operation and reporting. Some of the urgent support that are coming from the farmers which I would like to bring to the attention of this House are firstly, if the Government should consider providing interest subsidy to the Sugarcane Growers Fund so that they can reduce interest rate from 6 percent to around 3.99 percent like the Fiji Development Bank. There is a special package, Madam Deputy Speaker, given to resource owners with complete interest subsidy through Merchant Finance and FDB. I request if this can also be given to the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. I also request if the climate finance programme should be channelled also to the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. Lastly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I recommend as alluded to by the honourable Minister for Sugar, for the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to come up with a green cane interest rate reduction for those that harvested 25 percent green cane with the interest rate reduced from 6 percent to 4 percent. Madam Deputy Speaker, while I support the Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund Annual Report, I call all of us as Members of Parliament to take drastic measures and not politicize the sugar industry. We have to take drastic measures to try and curb this issue faced by our cane farmers. By doing so, we can ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for our sugarcane industry and the hardworking farmers who sustain it. Let us work together to revive the sugar industry and help our farmers thrive once again. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, of course, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments. All the comments that have been raised, we have partly included that into the Report but I think one of the major issues affecting the Sugar Cane Growers Council is part</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>3 rd December, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 2383 of the huge problem that is affecting the whole industry. I totally agree with what honourable Bala has just raised – it is all interconnected. All the issues are connected but what we need to do is to look at the big picture, what is the right structure that the industry has to have to meet a certain market that we need to supply to? Of course, I would like to thank the honourable Minister, there is a current study undertaken by FAO, the Report will be delivered to him in a few days’ time. I think that will be the Report that will show what needs to be done in the industry. The issue of land leases as being alluded to by some of the honourable Members, when we went around in our public consultations with the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, we noted the substantial amount of land vacant all over the place. Honourable Koroilavesau and I went to Lomawai, Nadroga - a big area of land. People are saying that the problem is with land leases, but I think people have just abandoned the land and moved on to other areas. The issue here, we are subsidising an industry which is no longer efficient, and we need to find the solution because we are forfeiting other industries that needs support. Why we are supporting sugar cane farmers with subsidised fertilizer, because we are forfeiting the Government resources that can go into other economical commodities. I think all the issues that have been raised, of course, short term but I think we need to look at the long-term strategic solution to address the future of the industry. Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before the House. DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put Motion agreed to DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you for your forbearance, honourable Members. Now, we have our final motion for debate tonight. I call upon the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources to move his motion.</p></body>
