<body><h3>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3><h4>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the: (a) Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 02/2024) be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other committee of Parliament; (d) Bill must be debated, voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Corrections Service Act 2006 provides for the establishment of the Fiji Corrections Service (FCS), the administration of prisons in Fiji, the treatment of the prisoners including the remission of their sentences, early release schemes and the discharge of prisoners. The Act was enacted in 2006 and commenced on 27 th June, 2008. The Corrections Service has since identified areas in the Act which necessitates the need for the amendment to the Act. Therefore, the Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 seeks to amend the Act to – (a) (b) extend the list of international standards and instruments that the Corrections Service may be guided by regarding the treatment of prisoners; allow the Commissioner of the Corrections Service to appoint medical officers to the Corrections Service for the care of prisoners; (c) provide for the mandatory medical examination of prisoners upon their admission and discharge; introduce the provisions to establish a Central Allocation Classification Board within the Corrections Service; and correct inconsistency terminology throughout the Act. (d) (e) Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is urgent for the Government as it incorporates changes to align with the current practice of the Corrections Service, which will improve the administration of the Corrections Service. There has been wider consultation with the Office of the Solicitor-General and with the Fiji Corrections Service. There may be questions asked by the Opposition as to why the need for Standing Order 51. The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just to put some clarity into some of the gaps from the Act in 2004. Later on, there will be a holistic review of the Act, so this is necessary.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 649 Clause 1 of the Bill which provides for the short title and commencement. If passed by Parliament, the amending legislation will come into force on a date appointed by the Minister that is set. Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act to provide for the definitions of terms used in the Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 3 to extend the list of international standards that the Corrections Service must be guided by. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 5 of the Act to allow the Commissioner, for the purpose of an investigation, to direct any officer of the Corrections Service to answer questions under oath or affirmation and produce a record or item in the officer’s possession. The amendment also limits the delegation of the Commissioner’s powers to a senior officer only, so it is basically to address the abuse of power. Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 8 of the Act by deleting any reference to certain terms for clarification purposes. Clause 6 of the Bill amends section 10 of the Act to provide that any officer of the Corrections Service who is absent without leave for more than seven days will be deemed to have resigned from the Corrections Service. This is one of the problems that is faced by the Fiji Corrections Service where people go over seven days and in some case 10 or even 21 and there is no definite solution as to in terms of the HR how we deal with these problems. Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 15 of the Act to allow the Commissioner to appoint medical officers to the Corrections Service. Under the Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of medical officers are done by the Permanent Secretary, now the power is vested with the Commissioner. Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 18 of the Act to include a Judge as the visiting justice. Under the Act, the visiting justice refers to a senior magistrate. Now we enlarge the provision to also include judges. Clause 9 of the Bill amends section 26 of the Act by mandating that upon admission and immediately before discharge, a prisoner must be medically examined. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the issues raised constantly over time and time again is the issue of violence against prisoners or the allegations so it is apparent that there must be a medical report upon admission and also before discharge. Clause 11 of the Bill amends section 33(3) of the Act so that Assistant Commissioner of Operations and the Commissioner are informed about the medical condition of any prisoner. Clause 12 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a new section 36A which establish the Central Allocation and Classification Board. These boards are basically to tabulate the records of those who come in as inmates as to the date of their release of other rehabilitation services which should be afforded to them during their period catered for by Fiji Corrections Service. Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 41(1) of the Act so that arms may only be issued to Correction Officers upon the order of the Commissioner. I think this is straightforward. Clause 14 of the Bill amends section 43(3) of the Act by deleting reference to “fair wages”</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>650 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 20 th May, 2024 and substituting “income” for consistency purposes. This is the income from activities performed by inmates so upon release, they will be paid that income. Clause 15 of the Bill amends section 46(2) of the Act by inserting an additional eligibility requirement that would allow prisoners to be released under the Early Release Programme. Clause 16 of the Bill amends section 51(3) of the Act by substituting “firearm” with “arms” for consistency purposes. Arms and ammunitions are defined as “arms”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that Parliament considers the Bill without delay to give clarity in terms of administration enforcement that will be debated on Thursday. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and at the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to start off by saying at the outset that this Government has never brought a Bill to Parliament that is not using Standing Order 51. The honourable Attorney-General needs to know that because the gentleman sitting on his right, gentleman sitting on his left and those two who are sitting behind him, and a few others in this Parliament have always been against Standing Order 51. So, I will say it again, when you say something and you do that exact opposite, you are a hypocrite; that is what it is. This Bill needs to be taken to Committees. I give you one example of very poor drafting that I, a non-lawyer, have already seen. Clause 2.9 states and I quote: “Clause 10 of the Bill amends section 26 of the Act by mandating upon admission and immediately before discharge, a person must be medically examined.” What does that mean? It means nothing. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- The other one that I am talking about is clause 2.14 is the removal of words “fair wages” to talk about income. What does that mean? That we want to treat prisoners differently from other people that are employed? I think with some of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these types of Bills must be taken to Committees so it can be scrutinised in detail so that we, the Members of Parliament, the representatives of the voters of this country, have an opportunity to look at it in detail. On that ground, I do not support the motion that it be taken through Standing Order 51. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with my fellow Opposition Member of Parliament’s comments, but I just have a question with respect to the Board that the honourable Minister spoke about and this is contained in Clause 12 of the Bill. This is section 36A which actually establishes the Central Allocation and Classification Board. My question is with respect to this classification. I am not sure of the explanation that was given by the honourable Attorney-General, but the purpose of this Board is to make recommendations to the Commissioner in relation to the classification and allocation of prisoners to suitable Corrections Centres. When doing this, we are talking about Corrections Centres all around Fiji, Sir, and prisoners request for early release or short- term release. I see the composition of the Board as being the Deputy Commissioner of Corrections Service as the Chairperson, the Assistant Commissioner Operations, the Director Rehabilitation, Supervisor</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 651 of Central/Eastern Division (fair enough), Supervisor of Southern Division (fair enough) and a Senior Operations Officer. What about the other Corrections Centres? Where is the Supervisor for the Western Division? Because there are prisoners who are all around Fiji, should it not be that we include the Western Division also - Supervisor for the Western Division? Why are we Suva-centric or why are we Central/Eastern Division-centric and leaving out probably a very important category that ought to be in there? That would be something that the honourable Attorney-General might want to look at. Is there a particular purpose? I am not sure, I do not know the reasoning behind it but most certainly, Sir, I think that would help in terms of getting the classification done for prisoners. If there are reoffenders, et cetera, you would have had someone in the Western Division who is known to the Supervisor in the Western Division, et cetera. My suggestion is that the honourable Attorney- General amend it to include Western Division supervisory officers. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to give the data back to honourable Usamate, there were 318 Bills and out of those, 290 Bills came under Standing Order 51. That is your record, 93.7 percent. It is only the first Bill. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already explained that the Bill is necessary so that this implementation can be caried forward. There will be a holistic review later on. (Hon. J. Usamate interjects) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- The honourable Member mentioned 2.9, that is the Explanatory Note, which is not part of the Bill. In any case for any drafting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is a spelling error, that can be corrected later on. I endorse the Bill. Question put. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being opposition, Parliament will now vote on the motion. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is the first time, so Members made a mistake between minus and x, so instead of putting in minus, we placed x as exchange. MR. SPEAKER.- For the sake of transparency, we will do that. Please, let us reopen the vote once more. The problem is this, you want to vote, and you also want to do the talking. (Laughter) Votes Cast Ayes - 28 - 23 Noes Motion agreed to.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>652 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 20 th May, 2024</p></body>
