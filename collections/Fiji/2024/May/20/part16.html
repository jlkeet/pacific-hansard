RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the review of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption 1 st August, 2017 to 31 st July, 2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 16 th April, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; as the Member moving this motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Review Report of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Annual Report 1 st August, 2017 to 31 st July, 2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in February 2023, and I wish to proceed directly into reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in this Report. To begin with, Sir, there are few pertinent issues identified which the Committee had noted, the: rationale of filing nolle prosequi on the matter of certain disposed cases. 1. 2. Ministry of Health officials involved in corruption related offences. 3. selection of communities by FICAC to conduct training sessions on corruption prevention. 4. effectiveness of awareness training programme undertaken by FICAC on selected communities. 5. education level of the National Anti-Corruption curriculum taught in schools. 6. monitoring and reporting mechanisms of FICAC in achieving the targets set out in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 7. unclear terms derived on certain expenditures by the Commission as listed under the financial statement of the FICAC Annual Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these issues were addressed and clarified by FICAC and any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report. In doing so, Sir, I will dive straight into the recommendation as put forth by the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends that the Commission provides timely submission of its Annual Reports to Parliament, and this has always been an issue with a lot of entities that are late with their Annual Reports. The Committee also recommends that the Commission ensures that there is formal SDG compliant component in all future reports. Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommended that the Annual Peer Review Report be also in the schedule of all future reports that are compiled by the Commission. The Committee further recommends that communities such as Rotuma, Rabi, Kioa and Melanesian communities be also visited annually to conduct such trainings. These communities are confined recipients of project development funds from the Office of the Prime Minister. The Committee also recommends that training information be translated into vernacular languages in Fiji and not limited to any. Lastly, Sir, the Committee recommends that the anti- corruption education be emphasised at all education levels for primary to tertiary and be part of the</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>657</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 compulsory curriculum. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I urge honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the content of the Committee’s Report and show support for the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Before, I offer the floor, the honourable Whips both for Government and the Opposition, have provided me with a list of speakers, as follows: 1. Honourable F. S. Koya; 2.
