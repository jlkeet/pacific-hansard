B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji National Sports Commission Annual Report 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 which was tabled on 16 th April, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, and honourable Members of Parliament; the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) was established under the Fiji National Sports Commission Act 2013, with the aim to enrich and empower the lives and health of all Fijians through physical activity and sports at all levels. The years under review are 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. These reporting years were faced by the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its ongoing impacts on sports and recreational activities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this did not affect the works of the FNSC, as it had to rely on its available resources to mitigate the ever-recurring challenges of the pandemic. The FNSC continues to work closely with the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the Ministry of Health and Medical Services in safeguarding the safety of all stakeholders in the sporting and recreational activities sector, which has resulted in the establishment of safe sport protocols of the highest standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had identified seven recommendations and hopes that the Commission takes these recommendations into account. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, I urge honourable Members to take note of the recommendations, and I support the motion before Parliament. Vinaka saka. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Similar to the last two Motions, I also have a list of speakers with me, and the batting is as follows: 1. Hon. V. Pillay; 2. Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; 3. Hon. V. Naupoto; and 4. Honourable Assistant Minister for Education. HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the Fiji National Sports Commission Annual Report 2020 to 2021 and 2021 to 2022. The Committee commends the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) on its achievements during those challenging times marked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these hurdles, the</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports 675 FNSC displayed continued commitment to promoting sports participation and healthy lifestyles across Fiji. Initiatives such as,kits in community sports and wellness, deserve recognition for their positive impacts. Additionally, the increased funding allocated to disability sports programmes reflects FNSC’s dedication to inclusivity. However, the Committee also identified areas for improvement. We recognise the need to further strengthen the FNSC’s operations. We encourage the continuing efforts to improve national sporting organisations, capacity for grant applications through workshops and capacity building programmes. The Committee strongly supports the finalisation of the safety in sports policy and the drug free sports and urges collaboration with relevant stakeholders to achieve these goals. Furthermore, we believe fostering strong partnerships is crucial. The Committee applauds FNSC’s commitment to working alongside the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education to address Physical Education Teacher shortages and integrate sports effectively into the national curriculum. The Committee also commends FNSC’s interest in aligning its programme with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We believe incorporating all the 17 SDGs into the reporting framework, is a valuable step. The Committee encourages FNSC to explore ways to integrate these goals into programme design, monitoring and evaluation, maximising sports and positive impacts on areas, such as health and wellbeing, and gender equality. The FNSC plays a pivotal role in enriching Fijians lives and empowering the communities through sports. The Committee is confident that by addressing the identified challenges, fostering strong partnerships and aligning efforts with the SDGs, the FNSC can make even greater contribution to Fiji’s social and economic development. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chairperson and the Committee for deliberating on the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji National Sports Commission Annual Report 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. My response will be very short, Sir. In response to the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) 2020-2021 and 2021-2022, we acknowledge and support the recommendations of the Standing Committee’ and wishes to express the need for additional funding to meet our recommendations and for the sustainability to continue sports for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the request for grants in the past five years against grants given, a total of $88,409,444 was requested and the grant given was $35,925,424 million with a shortfall of $52 million that could have gone to support many programmes and grants for national sporting organisations. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the aspiration of leaving no one behind and maximising the contribution of sports, it has made Fiji’s economy for a better Fiji. Sports will continue to advance development as a powerful enabler in areas of recommendations for the United Nations SDGs. Recommendation 4.1 - Capacity building exercises for national sporting organisations and</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>676 Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports 20 th May, 2024 clubs to improve their level of compliance for grants. We need more programmes and having a closer relationship with national sporting organisations. Recommendation 4.2 – increase in grants given to disability sports programme. This, again, is dependant on grant funding. Recommendation 4.3 - review current sponsorship for sports equipment and corporate sponsorship. We have concerns from smaller sponsorship based as to if the Commission receives this sponsorship, it will mean less for smaller NSOs. Recommendation 4.4 - when working with sporting organisations on their recruitment of best available coaches to maximise performance of athletes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all NSOs have the opportunity to apply for grants for international qualified coaches. The Sports Commission cannot be seen to be nominating coaches but can only facilitate funding. Recommendation 4.5 - addressing the shortage of Physical Education teachers, consulting through the Ministry of Youth and Sports with the Ministry of Education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is being actively pursued. Recommendation 4.6 - working with the sports facilities for ease of payment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is ongoing but the cost of maintaining facilities is getting higher. Owners require a return on investment. Recommendation 4.7 - all our reporting has been made against relevant SDGs as identified sports and in line with the recommendation given, we endeavour to include all SDGs in our future reporting. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, we thank the Committee for their due diligence and a good report that has been forwarded to the Government and I wish them well in the future. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, let me thank the Committee for the Report that they have presented today and I would also like to register my appreciation to the Board and staff of the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) for the work that they do. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission has been in operation now for a little over a decade, I think they are going into their eleventh year now. Before the Commission was set up, the Government funded two sporting federations, mainly channeled through the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Now, it is channeled through the FNSC and I think in the process, a lot more funding is made available there for our sporting organisations, sporting bodies and sporting federations. One of the benefits of having the Sports Commission is to buffer Government from being blamed on interfering with sporting federations. This is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third principle of the overall Olympic movement and the third working principle is autonomy and good governance. Sometimes, there is this contentious issue of Government interfering with sporting bodies that violate this working principle. So, now we have the Sports Commission in between to do that job. The Commission has bore fruit, in my view. One of the initiatives that was started off by the last Government and is continuing now is the provision of that funding that allows Fiji to recruit international expatriate coaches, if we do not have local coaches, and that has resulted in our first gold medal in 2016. I think the second one in 2020, again, through that funding and getting those coaches.</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports 677 It has even progressed well into paying our local coaches for our national teams. I know that when I was Chairman of the Rugby League, we applied, and the Sports Commission paid for our local coach when we went to the World Cup a few years ago. I know that the coach for the Women’s Sevens Team, a local, was also paid for from there and they also got a bronze medal in 2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just add on to what the honourable Minister had said on recommendation 4.5, which is this recommendation to get more PE teachers for our schools, I hope that the Ministries that are mentioned in the recommendation take heed of this by the Committee but I think equally important is not only getting PE teachers but also to resource them properly with the right training equipment that they will need to make sure that our PE teachers cater for the different levels of students in primary school and secondary school. Not only a whistle and a ball, but they get to be resourced well so that PE becomes fun for our children. Fun is the point that tickles their mind into a lot more physical activity and as we know, it is also a ‘big weapon’, if I may use those words, to tackle NCDs also. That Mr. Speaker, Sir, is my contribution to the debate and I support the motion that is before Parliament. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Chairperson and Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for their Report. We note the issues and recommendations highlighted in the Review Report, hence I would like to make some comments. The Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) was established in Fiji under the National Sports Commission Act 2013. The primary goal of the Commission is to improve the lives and health of all Fijians through the promotion of physical activity and sports at all levels. The Sports Commission is responsible for guiding and enhancing the delivery of sports outreach programme across Fiji through a coordinated approach in partnership with stakeholders, such as the Government, statutory bodies and community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also has a major role to play in establishing a high standard of excellence in all phases of sports delivery and in physical activities throughout the nation. The Government supports the Commission through an annual budgetary provision. This includes funding as allocated to assist the Commission to actively advance the development of freedom sports at all levels, from the beginner to elite level, by supporting national supporting bodies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period 2014 to 2023, the 2024 fiscal years, Government had provided a total annual grant of over $9.9 million to the Commission to carry out its core activities in the field of sports. The actual utilisation of this budget was $9.4 million, and the rate of utilisation was 96 percent. As a statutory body, the Commission is granted full discretion under the Financial Management Act to exercise its power to spend its annual grant effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Financial Management Budget (Amendment) Act 2017 governs the financial operation of the Commission and in ensuring the effective, efficient and economic management of its finance, and the maintenance of effective systems to internal control of money and its prerogative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission has made a significant stride in promoting sports participation across all demographic areas from grassroot to elite levels, which includes community</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>678 Consolidated Review Report – FNSC 2020-2022 Annual Reports 20 th May, 2024 engagement, successful implementing the programme that endanger the community and engage all, particularly in the rural and underserved areas. On talent development, to identify and nurturing young talent, preparing them for national and international competition. The international achievements supporting athletes’ participation in global events which has brought pride and recognition to Fiji in the challenges and future direction for all our athletes across Fiji. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic has disturbed the sports activities, affecting schedules and revenue. The Commission has taken adaptive measures but continued support is essential for its recovery. Strategic planning for new and improved facility is vital for maintaining high standards and hosting international events. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Fiji National Sports Commission has shown commendable efforts and achievements, despite facing challenges. The Government continues to support strategic investments and collaborative approach that will be essential to build on the successes and ensuring the growth and sustainable of sports in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity and I fully support the motion. HON. A. V. B. C.

I would also like to thank Mr. Mazey and his team at the Fiji National Sports Commission for all the work that they did during these reporting years.
