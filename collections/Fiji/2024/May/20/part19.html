<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – AUDITS OF MUNICIPAL COUNCILS 2021-2022</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – AUDITS OF MUNICIPAL COUNCILS 2021-2022 HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Audits of Municipal Councils for the year ended 2021–2022 which was tabled on 16th April, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I as Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts move a motion, and I take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the Report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Audits of the Municipal Councils for the year ended 2021- 2022. Sir, the Report covers the audit of 13 Financial Statements for the 10 Municipalities. Those were as follows: Municipal Council Financial Year 1. Nadi 2. Sigatoka 3. Tavua 4. Rakiraki 5. Levuka 6. Labasa 7. Lami 8. Nausori 9. Savusavu 10. Nasinu 2017 2020 2016 2020-2021 2014-2015 2018 2015 2015 2011 2011-2012</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 665 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, during its review, had also cross-checked with the previous Public Accounts Committee Reports to gauge the Municipal Councils and the Ministry of Local Government’s response on the audit issues that were raised over the years. Sir, it is sad to say that the Public Accounts Committee’s recommendations that were tabled in Parliament in the past were not seriously taken by these Municipalities under the past Administrators and Management, as well as the Ministry of Local Government under its Director, Permanent Secretary and past Ministers. With this new Committee, under this new Government, we are not going to accept that, Sir, we are going to improve the situation for the betterment of the Municipalities and for the country. Sir, section 57(1) and (3) of the Local Government Act 1972 establishes the financial accountability and legislative timeframe for Municipal Councils to produce and publish its audited financial statements. It is sad to say that most of them failed to meet their legislative requirements. At the outset, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will highlight some of the common findings that were prevalent in those Municipalities. The delays and backlog, there was lack of compliance with the Financial Reporting Framework, lack of compliance with the International Accounting Standards, lack of compliance with the Local Government Act and the limitation of scope or quality of the audit due to insufficient supporting documents. Mr. Speaker, this lack of compliance is reflected in the audit opinion issued by the Office of the Auditor-General in the report who issued Modified (Qualified) audit opinions on six financial statements that were audited while seven financial statements were issued with modified, which is with a Disclaimer of Opinion. Sir, the Committee identified a number of common issues across municipalities and necessary action is required to address the following and I am happy that the Minister and the current Permanent Secretary are working hand in hand to try and address those issues. I wish to advise that currently there is a good level of management cohorts as well as Administrators in most of the Councils as well as the current Permanent Secretary and Minister and would like to acknowledge the hard work they are doing to clean their books and put in place internal control processes and update the account for timelines and quality. Minister, PS, Management and Administrators of Rakiraki, Tavua, Nadi, Levuka, Nausori, Labasa, Savusavu, Lami, Nasinu and Sigatoka, please continue the hard work to meet our 2025 target. Mr. Speaker Sir, we are targeting with the assistance of the Office of the Auditor-General to update all accounts in the 2025 Financial Year. Some are outsourcing, some are putting in place systems apart from recruiting the right personnel. I will not go into all the recommendations, Sir, but I will just highlight one which we discussed with all the municipalities. We have given them July 2024 to submit an Action Plan to the Committee as well as to Parliament an update of the financial accounts and clearance of all unsubstantiated balances and identifying and resolving all audit issues raised from 2013-2018. The Action Plan should include recommendations and implementations of verifications and finally any write-offs. We have given them another six months (January 2025), all those actions to be implemented with the assistance of the Ministry of Finance for possible write-off. Sir, given the issues identified, the Committee strongly recommends that immediate action is required by the respective municipalities and working closely with the Ministry of Local Government to improve financial accountability. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Committee will continue to highlight issues in this august Parliament until these municipalities improve their audit status and strengthen their systems and processes for public funds accountability purposes. With those few words, Mr. Speaker Sir, I as the Member</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>666 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 20 th May, 2024 moving the motion thank you for this opportunity. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I concur with the Committee’s recommendations. The Report is very comprehensive with very good recommendations. The Committee has also come up with many good findings. I will be deliberating on the findings, recommendations of the Committee and the current issues faced by the ratepayers. I have noted from the Report that audits of some Councils’ accounts are on hold and this is due to some vacancies of senior staff in the Finance Department of the Councils. I hope this will be addressed by the authorities at the earliest and these positions will be filled, following due process. Firstly, on the monitoring functions of the Councils, I am from Lautoka and I always drive past Nadi Airport and noticed overgrown bougainvillea. This issue was also brought to my attention by ratepayers. On one side, we have a beautiful International Airport, thanks to the FijiFirst Government, which is rated highly, and just a few metres away from the Airport, the people including tourists are met by overgrown bougainvillea. Sometimes I wonder if this is the latest decorative design or failure of the custodians. The idea of planting bougainvillea is very good, but regular maintenance and trimming is important. Another recommendation by the Committee was on planning and action plan. One of the key functions of the Council is to provide quality service to the ratepayers. Recently, some residents of Nasinu have raised concerns about poor service provided by the Nasinu Town Council, as many have faced drainage and issues of solid waste collection and nothing has been done. It has been a health issue to many and a breeding site for mosquitoes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue raised was on uncollected garbage across Nasinu that has become an eye sore and has caused blocked drains for the residents of Tovata, Nepani, Makoi, Narere, Nadera, Valelevu, Caubati, Kinoya and Nadawa. This reflects poor planning. The lack of services from the Council can lead to the spread of serious diseases, such as dengue and leptospirosis. During our visit to Labasa, it was mentioned that more investments need to be done in Labasa for a resilient economy. While on one side a lot of talks are done in Parliament about development in the North, there are certain people interfering with the Council, even if it does not fall under their portfolio to stop investment. I had been informed by a concerned ratepayer that one such investment is Hotel Development, whereby, the land was transferred to the iTLTB in 2003, and then iTLTB gave proper lease to the developer in 2011, after 60 percent consent was obtained from the landowning unit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been informed by the ratepayer that the landowning unit are partners in this $10 million development. In Parliament, we speak about empowering the landowners and here we are, just because some people have vested interest, objecting the empowerment on the ground. That is a sad reality at the moment in this case. My question is, why is Labasa Town Council not approving the development? The second question, is there someone who has vested interest and trying to block the $10 million development? I urge the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Attorney-General to intervene. The Government should honour the ruling of the courts and let the $10 million development to flourish. The Government has been preaching about development in the North before and after the election. Now, it is time for action, time to support development in the North, not to block development. I support the motion before Parliament. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the motion before</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 667 Parliament, firstly, I would like to express my very best wishes to the Vanua o Nabukebuke, Levuka on behalf of the Vanua o Nabukebuke, Namosi, on the installation of the Tui Levuka tomorrow. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, before I share some insights into some of the recommendations and findings by the Committee, I would like to respond to some of the issues that were highlighted by honourable Chand. I was waiting for him to, at least, share some of those issues with me before discussing it openly in Parliament but I thank him for that. First is on the overgrown bougainvillea hedge at Namaka Road near Nadi Town. I think he failed to understand that there is a working process in place where the Councils, as well as Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) do their work according to the work schedule. We have to understand that there is a lot of rain in the West. It has also caused overgrown vegetation, as well as some of the overgrown areas in some of the spots. He only mentioned that spot but there are some spots and places that have been looked after by the Nadi Town Council. We must also appreciate the work done by the Nadi Town Council. On the solid waste around Nasinu, we should be thankful to the newly appointed Special Administrator for Nasinu Town Council for coming forward with some new strategies and policies to manage some of the illegal dumping of rubbish around the Nasinu area. Nasinu is one of the biggest municipalities in Fiji in terms of population. The challenge right now is to how best the Council can address the issue of illegal dumping of rubbish. I was sharing this with honourable Pillay, he was also complaining about the same thing. The issue right now in most Municipalities is that the garbage truck come and collect rubbish and as soon as they turn away from those sectors, the very next second, people come and dump their rubbish on the road. These are some of the areas that I have also instructed the new Special Administrators to focus on. These are some of the basic services that we are trying to improve right now. So, in most of the Municipalities, these are some of the challenges that we are trying to address. On the Labasa Town development, I want to reassure him that none of these newly appointed Special Administrators were appointed to hinder any type of progress in any of the municipalities. They are there to support the projects but if there are any issues regarding the projects, they have the right to investigate and find out the issues relating to some of these projects. That is the issue with the Labasa project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now try and respond to the motion before Parliament. First, I thank the Standing Committee and its Chairperson for doing a great job in conducting a detailed and thorough review, as well as coming up with very constructive recommendations. I think there are about 15 of them. Going forward, it is a good lesson that the Ministry of Local Government has taken. We have been working with them to try and improve on some of these areas which are recurring issues. There is a need for us to take this on board and come up with new ways and strategies on how we can improve on some of the recurring issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Local Government Act 1972 has provisions for the manning of the Councils and how they must conduct themselves. However, in 2009, an intervention by the then Government led to disarray in the manner in which the Councils was supposed to conduct themselves.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>668 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 20 th May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above situations led to complacency, lack of accountability and transparency. Most of the issues that have been highlighted by the Committee are legacy issues and common in all the Municipalities. As the Minister responsible for the Council or the 13 Municipalities in Fiji, I have, since taking office, ensured that there will be clear guidance, advice and monitoring of the Councils. Our focus is on proactive solutions and positive transformation for the Municipalities, residents and ratepayers’ benefits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the team at the Ministry, specifically the Department of Local Government, have been working on various strategies, policies and plans to ensure that before the Local Government Elections, the Municipal Councils are able to get rid of the current recurring audit issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform this august Parliament that the Ministry has been actively undertaking the following to ensure that Municipal Council’s teams - from Special Administrators to the Chief Executive Officers and all the Finance Teams are fully aware of their roles and responsibilities. These are the things that we have undertaken: 1. 2. Revision of the Finance Manual in 2023; and Budget training - the Special Administrators, Chief Executive Officers and Finance Manager of the Councils have been undergoing training. Even though the Ministry does not have resources to train each and every member of the Finance Team of each Council, SMART strategies have been implemented and put in place to train the team leaders who are required to train their teams. These additional training include; Human Resource Training, Customer Service Training, Finance Training for CEOs, Finance Team in all the Municipalities, OMRS Training, as well as Project Management Training. For those who have also been working in consultation and collaboration with the Office of the Auditor-General, we have partnered with them and recently in March 2024, they have conducted training on the following - • • • • • • audit processes; financial reporting processes; internal control; reconciliations; accounting records and asset management; and effective policies and procedures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the team at the Office of the Auditor-General for the intensive yet very focused training. One of the vital issues highlighted in the Report is the need to standardize the accounting system that are to be used by all the Municipalities. As we speak, different Municipalities have different accounting systems. Lautoka City Council and Suva City Council have their own systems. Levuka Town Council are still doing things manually. So, these are some of the things the Ministry is trying to do, to ensure that we have a new system in place and the Council is now the driving force behind this. We are also trying to put in place a process to strengthen the compliance and monitoring of all Municipal Councils. I wish to also acknowledge that out of all the 13 Municipalities, only one Municipality, Rakiraki Town Council, has completed its audits and is up to date. I must thank the</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 669 CEO and the Special Administrator for organising the financials of the Council. Also very important, Mr. Speaker, is the issue of some of the monitoring within the Ministry. We will also be recruiting two officers that will be part of the audit team in the next financial year. We are also requesting the Ministry of Finance for us to hire more auditors so that we can have one audit pool within the Ministry, who will be able to go around and conduct auditing of all the Municipalities. Hopefully, when we do that, we are going to ensure that all the Municipalities are up to-date with their Financial Statements so that it can be audited by the Office of the Auditor-General before they present to Parliament for discussion. We are working very hard on that. There will be some additional issues in terms of improvements that have been done and implemented in all the 13 Municipalities in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity and I fully support the motion before Parliament. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute to the debate on the Audit Report on Municipal Councils. The Committee reviewed 10 Municipal Audits from 2021 to 2022 and the Committee has carefully examined all the available evidence, considered various perspectives and arrived at a set of recommendations that are practical and feasible. These recommendations are aimed at addressing the root causes of the problem and not just its symptoms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my appreciation to the Committee for their diligent work in conducting the review and for making these important recommendations. The recommendations made are crucial for the effective functioning of our municipalities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of recommendations has been made and I would like to speak on some of them. Sir, in one of the recommendations, the Committee is calling on the Ministry of Local Government to place priority in getting all the Municipalities’ accounts audited up to date. This will provide accurate and up to date financial information that is necessary for effective decision-making. It is important that the Ministry takes the necessary steps to ensure that this recommendation is implemented without delay. In another recommendation, Sir, the Committee is calling for the inclusion of special criteria in the Special Administrators and Chief Executive Officers terms of engagement contracts, such as bringing the audited accounts up to date during their tenure. According to the Ministry of Local Government policy, this is a commendable recommendation that will ensure that there is accountability for the financial management of the Municipalities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another recommendation is calling for all Municipalities to explore with the Ministry of Local Government on the use of a standard accounting software for uniformity purposes. This is a very important recommendation that will help to ensure that there is consistency in the accounting practices of all Municipalities. It will also make it easier for the Ministry to monitor the financial performance of the Municipalities. In another recommendation, Sir, it concurs with the Office of the Auditor-General’s recommendation and further recommends that Municipal Councils should utilise Government grants only for the intended purpose. This is an important recommendation that will ensure that the funds allocated for specific purposes are used for those purposes only. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another recommendation is calling for the Ministry of Local Government to conduct regular monitoring of qualification issues for all Municipalities so that discrepancies identified are addressed in a timely manner. This is a commendable recommendation that will help</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>670 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 20 th May, 2024 to ensure that Municipalities are staffed by qualified personnel, who are people who can effectively manage the financial resources of the Municipalities. We do recognise that some of the recommendations may require significant resources, time and effort to implement, however, we believe that they are necessary if we want to create a society just an equivocal for all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the recommendations made by the Committee and call upon the Ministry of Local Government to take the necessary steps to implement them. The effective implementation of these recommendations will help to improve the financial management capacity of our Municipalities and ensure that they are able to provide quality services to their ratepayers. I urge all honourable Members of this Parliament to carefully consider the recommendations presented in the Report and to support its recommendations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my colleague has raised some very important issues in regard to the garbage collection in Nasinu. Sir, Nasinu being the largest Municipality, garbage collection is an issue there. We have noted that the kitchen garbage which is supposed to be collected in the morning is collected late in the afternoon and the stray dogs scatter the rubbish all around. In the afternoon when you reach home, it is an eyesore. Also, the monthly green garbage, Sir, is supposed to be collected in my area in Valelevu every first Tuesday of the month. As alluded to by the honourable Minister, I have discussed this with him a number of times and even this morning, we spoke about it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our purpose here is not to criticise, but we would like to improve the services of all the Municipalities and the whole of Nasinu, as alluded to by my colleague. Yesterday, I went to pick my cousin from Ibo Place in Nadawa and right in front of his house is a huge pile of rubbish. Upon inquiry, he told me that the Council promised to collect the rubbish and everyone has dumped there but the Council did not turn up. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rubbish there is an obstruction to the vehicle, I had to wait for another car to go across. It is the whole of Nasinu which is suffering. I do not know, I just do not understand why this is happening because when FijiFirst was in Government, everything was done on time, and I have raised this with the honourable Minister. Everything was done on time. There were no rubbish issues. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand because during FijiFirst time, there was some agreement with the Suva City Council and Nasinu Town Council in terms of exchanging or using the rubbish collection trucks. This agreement was there but I do not know what has changed or I do not know if the policies have changed that this has happened. I have raised this with the honourable Minister that this is only happening since your Government has come into place. The reason why I am raising all these, Sir, is we want all these services to be provided at Nasinu being the largest municipality. The honourable Minister has just raised the issue of the town council elections. Sir, I know it has been said in this Parliament that the town council elections will take place but to date, we have not seen any legislation or policy to regulate the municipal council elections. Mr. Speaker, Sir, time is running and as we know, May has already gone. In June and July. we will be talking about the Budget and we are left with August. The honourable Minister has given</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 671 a timeframe saying that towards the end of this year, so end of this year could mean November or December but remember, Sir, there are certain processes which cannot be fast-tracked, so we need to follow the processes. I am urging the honourable Minister in consultation with the Elections Office, plus with the Office of the Attorney-General to bring in these legislations because we need to have the registrations done and there is also the objection period. We also would like to know if the political parties would be allowed to fill candidates. So, if that is to be done and we all know that a lot of preparation needs to be done in an election or any election for that matter, so in that case, we need time, and political parties need to prepare for all those things. For that reason, we have heard this, and we do not want things to be rushed so proper preparations could be done. For that reason also, we would like to see that the legislation comes up in time and we are all prepared towards it so that we have a successful election. With those words, I once again thank the Committee and I support the motion before the Parliament. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I speak on the Report, let me congratulate the new Auditor-General, Ms. Finau Nagera. She is very highly accomplished and a qualified professional, and a first woman ever to occupy the position of the Auditor-General of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite interesting to hear people like honourable Hem Chand and honourable Virendra Lal. I consider them to be Johnny-come-lately to FijiFirst Party and politics. Perhaps, they do not understand and they have no idea what this Government and this Minister has been landed with in terms of dealing with Municipal Councils and Cities. In the report of the Committee, the Auditor-General’s Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very clearly lays down the fundamental problem with respect to the management and delivery of services in towns and city councils in this country. And the blame for what is there today, squarely rest on the previous Government and some of them are sitting there and pontificating about governance, of how city councils should be managed and honourable Virendra Lal went all over the place about elections, without even acknowledging that for 15 years or so, they had suppressed democracy of the ratepayers in this country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at least, they should have a little bit of decency. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Practice what you preach! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is coming, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has announced that the election will be held. There is work already being done, there are reviews, the process is in place and they will know in good time when the election will be, because I know they want to go and lie very quickly about what is going on. Honourable Hem Chand, again, a Johnny-come-lately I would say, he talked about overgrown bougainvillea in Nadi.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- A Point of Order Sir:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Yes, honourable Koya. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order on 74(1) reads and let me read it to you</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>672 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 20 th May, 2024 for the 151 st time: “Any member may only raise a point of order if – (a) There is an alleged breach of the Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.” The breach, Sir, is this gentleman should, by now, after so many years, learned the language of Parliament. Do not be offensive! He is a Member of Parliament and whether it is six months or six years, Sir, be a little respectful. What is this Johnny-come-lately garbage, Sir. I think he ought to be sanctioned, he needs to stop insulting the young Members of Parliament who have just joined us. They have their opinion; you have your opinion but there is no reason for him to denigrate themselves. He should be experienced enough to know that. HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! MR. SPEAKER.- Please, continue, honourable Minister. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. All I was referring to in the context is that he is new in FijiFirst, new in Parliament and he has not looked at what had happened in the last 10 or 15 years in the city and town councils. He talked about the overgrown bougainvillea. Let me tell him – overpaid, long grown bougainvillea and the responsibility of that falls directly on the FijiFirst Government. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those bougainvillea and the way it was put in place, should have been investigated by FICAC long ago, the contract that they owe after the cost of doing that. That is the context I said that they do not know. Let me talk about the rubbish collection that they talked about. I was in Nasinu the other day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Nasinu Town Council Administrators at the launch of the new Nasinu Chamber of Commerce. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They do not like that because they talk about rubbish:</span></p><p>Basically, they said to me was that the Nasinu Town Council had their own trucks. Someone decided that those trucks would be transferred to Suva, a new contract would be given to people here and this is the problem why it is not working. The new Administrators have decided that as soon as the contract ends in the next month or this month, Nasinu Town Council will have its own trucks, its own processes and will have its own system of collecting rubbish and that will be done. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the honourable Members of Parliament from the Opposition come into this Parliament and pontificate about what is going wrong, they actually forget what has happened.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 673 Let me also add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that now we are grappling with the collection of rates. Town and City Councils are struggling to even put fans in the market. I went to Nausori Market one day and all the vendors were complaining about the heat and there were no fans. The vendors themselves were saying, “We do not mind paying stall fees, but we need fans”, because they built the market, they tried to be populist, they did not want to collect rates, they did not want to charge anyone and they left everything, including the services, undelivered. Suva City Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 11,400 ratepayers, is being owed $33 million in arrears. Nasinu Town Council - $14 million. Sir, what we are now saying is that we want to make sure that ratepayers pay that and Town and City Council Administrators appointed by this Government are now working on it. (Honourable Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You can talk about the legality and illegality my friend:</span></p><p>But let me say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be considering not only legislative changes for effective rate collecting mechanisms, we want to use other tools that is there, whether it is Garnishee Order on bank accounts, whether it is legal penalties and interest, whether it is revamping revenue collection systems, setting up convenient collection centres, public awareness campaigns or proper debt collection strategies. These are all the activities and strategies that need to be put in place, because if you do not collect rates, if town and city councils are not empowered to have this, Nasinu Town Council Administrators were left high and dry when they got in there, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They know, they understand the problem and the ratepayers also understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When you talk to them, they tell you quite directly what the problem is. But that is the point that the Opposition and those who raised those issues do not understand. They would do better. Honourable Virendra Lal would do better if he goes and tells the ratepayers. If he joins the Administrators and help them to collect rates, then the town and city councils can deliver their services. If you look at the statement by the Chairperson, honourable Assistant Minister and Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, he is absolutely right when he points out that there is a legacy, there is a system collapse of the past that we are now trying to revive and put in place so that there is a system that works on a regular basis, a system that allows the ratepayers to be part of it. When they abolished the elected councils, that was the end of it, Mr. Speaker, because in the previous systems, you had elected councilors, so if the rubbish was not collected in a ward, if there was a problem with the drain or overgrown grass, the councilors knew that. They knew that the council would do something, but when they took over, decisions were centralized, administrators were appointed, they had no interest in going to the ratepayers and making sure. This Government as soon as it came, we made that decision, the Cabinet has approved that, the processes are in place, then once you have that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these things will be in place and the ratepayers of this country can expect better services throughout the municipal boundaries of this country. HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all honourable Members who have contributed to the debate.
