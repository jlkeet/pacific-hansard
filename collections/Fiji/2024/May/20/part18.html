<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINSTCORRUPTION 1STAUGUST, 2017 TO 31STJULY, 2018 ANNUAL REPORT</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINST CORRUPTION 1 ST AUGUST, 2017 TO 31 ST JULY, 2018 ANNUAL REPORT HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr. Chairman for the presentation of the Report. I just wanted to add a few comments to what he has already suggested. Some of the issues that we raised in the recommendations, even in the Report were relatively, firstly, to SDGs. What we had deliberated upon and this is on the back of what you had suggested to us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many moons ago now, about ensuring that we were always SDG compliant. What we found also post, even actually writing the recommendations, as a matter of fact, and this is coming on at the back of UNDP Report that came out on SDGs is that we are way, way behind in terms of compliance and in terms of us being ready by 2030. As a matter of fact, the date that has been given by UNDP, we are nowhere near that and we will only be achieving our obligations in terms of the SDGs by 2065. Many of us may not be part of this Parliament then, but that is what the target is now for achieving the SDG goals. What we thought as a Committee was, “Alright, this is actually something good” and we included it in our recommendations and I hope Parliament will gladly and willingly accept this, is that for all Committees, not just this particular Committee, not just the report on FICAC, that the SDG component must be a part as a compulsion for all future reports so that we can keep a track, Parliament can keep a track of how much compliance there is in terms of all SDGs. One of the other things also we discussed, Sir, and this is something that concerns our smaller communities, the recommendations that also came, that we do ensure that communities such as Rotuma, Rabi, Kioa and the Melanesian communities also be visited annually to conduct trainings. This is one shortfall that we found that there were other communities that were not touched and the questions that were asked in this particular recommendation, I will address in a few minutes. The translation also with respect to the vernacular languages in Fiji but not limited to any, is also a must and necessary in light of today. One of the other things that is a compulsion and will require concerted effort on the part of many other Ministries was the education portion. Education on corruption is very important to us, but it has to be at all levels, not just the senior level, not just in the workforce, but also in terms of high school and primary schools, and we need to ensure that it is actually in the curriculum so that everyone is aware of how rotten an issue it is in terms of corruption. One of the things that I wanted to highlight, Sir, is the UNDP Report where it actually spoke about gender inequality, et cetera, which as way, way behind. So, we, in the Pacific, are not by any means, any close to where we should be in terms of making sure that there is compliance. As I have said, there should be some compulsion in terms of the reports that are being made to Parliament. One of the complaints that came out of it was the lack of equality in the law, inconsistent gaps in terms of many issues, gender-based violence, et cetera, and all of these issues were there and these things need to be addressed in our Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC is an institution that must now be looked at as one of our major institutions and it forms an integral part of our legal landscape. We must ensure that it is resourced very well and there is a reason why. It is a constitutional requirement, and it is also important in terms of the whole legal structure. But more importantly, we are signatories to many things that requires FICAC, basically a regular check on FICAC and see how we deal with corruption.</p><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 659 It does not just relate to the law, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications will know that he is about to sign off on Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). That also has a component in it with respect to corruption, and it comes out of them having a look at what our status is in terms of FICAC. So, it becomes an institution that is actively engaged in many things. In terms of reporting, when these institutions report back to Parliament to scrutinise, all of these things must be part of the Report and it is very important. As I have said, it forms an integral part of the whole legal framework. When we look at it, we must ensure that we resource FICAC very well and make sure that it is an independent institution, that it is not interfered with in any way whatsoever, and basically looked after so that we are making sure that all those things that we sign and become a party to, we are actually being compliant. One of the last things, Sir, that I wanted to talk about, there is a particular provision in our Standing Orders with respect to presentation of reports. Once a Standing Committee has actually done its report and I am referring to Standing Order 121(b) in relation to any other matter apart from Bills, once it is referred to or initiated by the Committee, as soon as it has completed its consideration and deliberations, it must table one or more interim reports. The tabling has been done. There is a provision there, Sir, which says that ‘once the motion is adopted’, so if this particular motion is adopted, then the report of the Standing Committee shall be delivered to the relevant Government Department by the Secretary-General within 14 days. So, today, once we adopt it, then it is being given to the relevant Government Department and that would be Attorney- General’s Chambers. Then the Minister responsible for the relevant Government Department must table a substantive response to the Standing Committee’s report within 21 days of receiving the report. Honourable Attorney-General, I know in your fervour to get this done, before it is even adopted, we have received a letter back from your office with respect to the recommendations that actually had been passed on. In those recommendations, it has been duly acknowledged, et cetera, and currently it is in its confidential status that was sent to us, we acknowledge that. But, please, remember this needs to be sent to us post the actual motion going through Parliament. There are certain things in terms of the issues that have been raised by FICAC, and as the Minister responsible, he has responded to it but just a quick check on that. In conclusion, the recommendations before Parliament were thoroughly deliberated on. The FICAC was very compliant in terms of making sure that they had answered all the questions. It is a very bipartisan report by the Committee and I think probably the most bipartisan Committee that sits in terms of getting these recommendations. I fully commend the motion to Parliament. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make my comments, allow me to formally acknowledge and pass my congratulations to the Turaga na Tui Levuka who will be installed tomorrow by the 12 Districts of Lomaiviti. I pray that God’s Blessings will be on his installation and his leadership of the Vanua of Levuka. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- The first recommendation deals with the timely submission of this Annual Report to Parliament. Section 17 of the Fiji Independent Against Corruption Act 2017 provides that the Commissioner of FICAC must submit an Annual Report to His Excellency the President and the responsible Minister must submit within three months of the end of the financial year.</p><p>660 Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report 20 th May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are dealing here with the Report of 2017 and 2018. It is really not a good reflection of the then Minister for Justice and Attorney-General. There has to be timely submission of the Annual Report whether it is important oversight and accountability mechanism to a normal Parliamentary process. As a democratic nation, the tabling of the Annual Report allows for scrutiny at the highest level for inspection of the statutory institution’s performance, financial management and in compliance with laws governing it. It also enforces public trust by highlighting dedication to responsible resource management and sound governance. It is useful for planning purpose. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no explanation as to why a report was not tabled all these years. Unfortunately, the former Commissioner has left. We have the Acting Deputy Commissioner who is currently out of the country and no one from FICAC can provide a feasible explanation to Parliament. However, I must commend the Acting Commissioner of FICAC who was appointed late last year, in her short stint, has devised a strategic plan for 2024 to 2029, including its Annual Corporate Plan for 2024 and 2025, which captures the very key indicator of submission to be timely, which is inclusive of Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I want to stress here is at the end of the day, it is the issue of leadership. Leadership from the Minister, leadership from whoever is in charge of FICAC, and then it strickles down to the Managers so that they comply with their statutory obligations. With the revised structure in place, the FICAC Management is aware of what is required of the institution under the laws and regulations, to provide timely submission of its Annual Reports, henceforth. More importantly, is Recommendation 2 in terms of compliance with the SDGs. I am proud to say that the FICAC observes the importance of incorporating formal sustainable development goals complied in FICAC’s Annual Report. It clearly outlines the organisation’s efforts and progress towards achieving sustainable development targets. The inclusion of a formal SDG compliance component in the Annual Report will not only enhance the credibility and relevance of reporting, but also drives positive changes towards a more sustainable and equitable future. The FICAC Anti-Corruption Plan and work is aligned with SDG 16 in relation to the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice for all and building an effective, accountable and inclusive institution at all levels. Since the submission of the FICAC Report, FICAC has expanded its work in its effort to reducing corruption, bribery, and strengthening the very institution in Fiji which is inclusive of the private sectors. Mr. Speaker, I wish to highlight that the FICAC of yesterday has gone. Under the leadership of the Coalition Government, it has the new image of FICAC where they are given full independence to operate. There is no political interference. Staff are encouraged to do due diligence in terms of their investigation. However, one troubling factor that came up recently, while in discussion with the Acting Director, was that some of the files from previous years were only found when the previous Commissioner left. Most recently, one of the senior officers who was part of the Administration from day one, when she was asked questions about a particular complaint, she could not provide any explanation. She was asked to go on leave only, so after she was sent on leave that they found another</p><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report 661 bundle of investigation files. This is the clean-up that the Coalition Government promised to do in this nation, and we will continue to do so. One of the recommendations is in terms of reaching out to members of the community, particularly reaching out to Rotuma, Rabi and Kioa. We observed the important role of FICAC of being at the forefront of Government’s anticorruption efforts. In combating corruption, section 12 sets out that FICAC must educate the public against the evil of corruption. It is a key component of FICAC’s Strategic Plan 2024-2029 and also for the 2024- 2025 Annual Corporate Plan. There is a Corruption Prevention Department at FICAC, and its main focus is to deliver anti- corruption programmes and training to interior areas. In one of the awareness that I have been to, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is heartening to listen to the officer advising the members of public that one can get into trouble if they do not manage the projects whether at the village level and district level in terms of being caught by FICAC. They are very comprehensive, very clear and at the end of the day, both sides of Parliament should support the work of FICAC. Our nation is at a crossroad where the very fabric of our society has been attacked. Drug has been the subject of last week’s discussion, but corruptions has always been there. Any responsible government like the Coalition Government will take it upon itself to ensure that any preventative measures in terms of awareness reach out to every community out there, whether it is in Vanua Levu, Lau or Kadavu and we must try to ensure that people are fully abreast with preventative measures and that they do not get into trouble. There are planned visits to the island of Rabi, Kioa, Rotuma, as well as Kadavu and the Lau Group at the end of the year. These visits will be conducted annually and will also be reflected in the Annual Reports. Today, there have been positive feedback from various sectors and communities. There is also notable rise in complaints received by FICAC, which indicates the effectiveness and succession of such trainings and workshops. Another area of the recommendation noted by the Committee is for training information to be translated into vernacular languages in Fiji and it is not to be limited to one. This is only very basic and to conduct a successful training, vernacular language is important, and staff are currently working on this project. Another recommendation is that the Committee recommends that anti-corruption education be emphasised at all education levels from primary to tertiary and need to be part of the curriculum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that there is a consultation with the Ministry of Education. Also, the teams go out to schools, so in future, we will see that most of these are reflected in the education curriculum. I am aware that there are curriculum reviews so we should be seeing some changes next year or the year after. A total of 16 primary schools and 60 secondary schools from the three major Divisions were recipients of the NACC during the piloting phase. It is imperative to note that the NACC is not a standalone one, rather it is an indicative approach based on selected subjects to be integrated into the current national education forum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully endorse the recommendations by the Committee.</p><p>662 Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report 20 th May, 2024 HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my short contribution to the motion that is before Parliament and it is on the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption 2018 Annual Report. Most of the issues that was recommended by the Committee has been addressed by the honourable Minister responsible for FICAC - the honourable Attorney-General, and the point that was raised by honourable Koya earlier in terms of Standing Order 121(6) where in this case we are fortunate that the reply to our recommendation has come before this particular debate. In most cases, once the Committee Report is adopted, then that 14 days that is in Standing Order 121(6) comes in where the Secretary-General will refer the recommendation of the Committee to the line Ministry before they are given 21 days to submit but, in this case, the honourable Minister responsible for FICAC has provided the response to the recommendation before this debate. I actually read the whole response that was tabled to the Committee last week and we thank him for that punctuality. We look forward to him being consistent every time with other reports that will be coming. Still on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he had referred to some cases and some bundle of files that were there when he came that he found those files. So, make sure that when you leave, your successor too does not find any files too around there, so we need to set the standard and if it is a promise, you have to keep that while moving forward. This particular organisation needs more funding in terms of training its investigators and we hope that the honourable Minister of Finance will give more funding to this independent institution established under the 2013 Constitution, so that they would be able to conduct further awareness and also advocacy. The honourable Attorney-General has alluded to the National Anti-Corruption Curriculum (NACC) which is also part of the Ministry of Education’s budgetary submission. Sir, FICAC is going to roll out this programme in the new financial year. We we hope that this curriculum will be adopted by all schools, that necessary funding will be approved for the Ministry of Education, which will help them implement this programme for students and that it will be compulsory to have this anti-corruption classes in the school curriculum. The other thing that was recommended by the Committee to FICAC which they did not respond to was the peer reporting under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). I think there was a two cycle periodic review - one was done in 2009 to 2015 and Fiji had complied to that. We are awaiting the second periodic cycle review that is due in June 2024, and we look forward, honourable Attorney-General and Minister responsible for FICAC, to our status on UNCAC and how this particular institution is complying with international standards. Also, now, that Fiji is combatting corruption, given that FICAC has been there since 2008 and before the establishment of the 2013 Constitution. Those are a few things that I would like to raise. I am also suggesting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that probably the Standing Orders Committee of which you are the Chair, could also take on board an amendment to the Standing Orders in terms of Standing Order 121. If there is an extra clause to be included so that when we give recommendation in a Committee’s Review Report, that a timeline probably in the Standing Orders, be given to those Ministries so that they can back on time and allow standing Committee to review those recommendations. That will give an opportunity for the Standing Committees to amend and respond to a recommendation during the debate. That is something I would like to put forward in Parliament. We can also include a clause to empower the Committee to also follow up a particular Ministry because some of the Ministries, after their report has been tabled and debated, they do not come back to the Committee, like the way the honourable Attorney-General has done when he came back to our Committee. There has to be a standard adopted by all the Ministries. Thank you.</p><p>20 th May, 2024 Review Report – FICAC 2017-2018 Annual Report 663 MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Bulitavu. We have taken note of your comments on the timeline to be set. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee who have gone through this Report, although it is an outdated Report. They have done their job. Some recommendations that have come up from the Committee Report is, I suppose, useful gauge for the onward operation of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC). This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been given some figures from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance from its inception in 2007 up until this year. The Fiji Government has supported the operations and capital expense of FICAC to the tune of $120 million in 17 years. That is how much public purse has gone to the operation and the capital expenses of FICAC. It goes towards what people’s expectation will be, because while spending the public purse so the confidence level that the people and this Parliament, obviously, will have to give to this organisation is going to be dependent on the level of independence that it is able to exude and show to the people of Fiji. We say that, Sir, because as has been noted by the honourable Attorney-General, the level of independence that this Government has now shown and given to FICAC to do, to provide the latitude and provide the environment for FICAC to do, especially for the FICAC Deputy Commissioner to do her job and do her job very well and not to be placed in a position where she feels that the role that she plays and the work that she does is going to face any form of repercussions if she decides on cases. That is entirely the work that is allocated to her, and we were assured by the honourable Attorney-General this morning that her work is going to be independently operated by her and her alone. We are grateful also to note from the Report, Mr. Speaker, that the guidelines that standardises the organisation derived out of the UN Convention Against Corruption which is, of course, the key treaty that Fiji had signed up to. Honourable Bulitavu had spoken about the review and, of course, we have been peer reviewed by Samoa in the last cycle and the next cycle, of course, is going to be due very shortly. Apart from the other observations that have been spoken about in this Parliament by the three previous speakers, perhaps I will pick up on the one that I feel is the most important. That is when cases are being “nollied” or when the process of investigation and prosecution gets to a point where the FICAC Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner or whoever the officer may be, makes a decision that it is no longer worthy to be prosecuted. I say that because I think it is very important that we understand that when cases ultimately gets “nollied”, behind it is a whole host of expenses being incurred. So there are expenses that are incurred out of public purse, of course, from investigation, from the laying of charges, right throughout the cases on mentions and up until when it is decided to go on trial and then ultimately, we get decisions that say, “Well, we no longer have witnesses available because they are no longer alive” or “that document has been misplaced or are no longer found”. Those decisions, and I am not talking about decisions where there is no evidence at all. I think those cases quite rightly should be nollied. But this is where cases exist and it really have been nollied because of time delay and the ones that have been highlighted in this Report, unfortunately, involves huge amount of money. Unfortunately, we have lost witnesses and documents can no longer be spoken to or about. It is important that we also understand that one of the measures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this Government has brought into force recently to ensure the cases do not take too long, is we have removed the specialised corruption courts which was introduced by the previous Government. Now, when cases are brought in from FICAC, it is equally shared amongst all of the Magistrates and all of</p><p>664 Review Report – Audits of Municipal Councils 2021-2022 20 th May, 2024 the Criminal Judges. So, there is no opportunity where cases just keep getting lagged on because Magistrates in specialised courts are taking too long to deal with one or two particular cases. I say that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I think it is time that when people are funding for these organisations, they also see that cases which are important and public life are brought to trial within a reasonable time. With reporting, Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging to note that now, with the Acting Deputy Commissioner being appointed to the role, she will see the importance of timely reporting back to Parliament. I have known the Acting Deputy Commissioner for a long time and I now that she is a very competent lawyer and she will be a very competent administrator in the role that she now plays. I am in support of the Report that has been placed in this Parliament by the Committee. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to thank all the speakers who have spoken on the motion before Parliament. On behalf of the Committee, I thank the honourable Attorney-General for taking note of the recommendations that was put forward by the Committee. On that note, I also echo the sentiments from the two honourable Committee Members on the other side on the amendment to the Standing Orders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, Sir, I have no further comments.</p><h4>Questions put.</h4><p class="procedural"><em>Motion agreed to.</em></p></body>
