<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p>Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40: 1. Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 2. Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts; 3. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 4. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; and 5. Honourable Minister for Education. We will be led off by the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs. The floor is yours, Sir. Elevated Vuvale Partnership HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and ladies and gentlemen; a very good morning to you all. Please, allow me</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>615 to also greet our citizens watching the proceedings in this august Parliament via television or live streaming or listening via radio or the Walesi app. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement on recent developments relating to the elevated and renewed Vuvale Partnership between Fiji and Australia. On 20 th October, 2023, the Prime Minister of Australia, honourable Anthony Albanese, and I, agreed and signed a renewed and elevated Vuvale Partnership, reflecting the growing maturity of the bilateral relationship. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to acknowledge the previous Government and my predecessor, for the Vuvale Partnership which was first signed in 2019. The latest development on that was the commissioning of the RFNS patrol boat/ship Puamau on Saturday. Before going to the commissioning, I asked the Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service if I could go and pay a courtesy visit to the former Prime Minister, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama, and I did tell him that I was doing the commissioning the following morning, acknowledging the great work that he had done in restoring and furthering this Vuvale Partnership during his time. For Vuvale, our longstanding relationship has not always been smooth sailing. It started in 1987 when there was a jolt, and we spent the following years repairing and trying to re-establish the relationships we had. In 2000 and 2006, there were further disturbances to our relationship. So what we are doing now is to just continue to improve on whatever we have had and also introduce new elements. In September 2023, a review of the Vuvale Partnership was carried out by senior officials of the two Governments. The objective of the review was to realign the approach, the contents and the desired outcomes of the Fiji and Australia relationship by reflecting on the vision, goals and priorities of the new Governments of both nations. “ Vuvale ”, we all know, means “family” in Vosa Vakaviti, so the partnership recognises our respect for each other. The Prime Minister of Australia, honourable Albanese, and I, then signed the renewed and updated Vuvale Partnership on 20 th October, 2023. On the day of signing the new Vuvale Partnership, Australia granted Fiji FJ$100 million in budget support. This is in addition to the earlier budget support of FJ$81 million for the 2023-2024 Fiji National Budget in June 2023. There is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an existing Fiji Programme Support Facility for 2016-2025 to the amount of $154.4 million, for supporting Australia’s delivery of education, health, governance and scholarship programmes in Fiji. The renewed Vuvale Partnership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, elevates our shared commitment to tackling climate change and strengthening our economic and trade partnership. These were the elements and the question would be asked today and probably be ruled out now because of this Ministerial Statement. It also has an increased focus on human development, First Nation’s people and culture, skills development and cyber security. The following five pillars provide the bedrock for our commitment to pass down to the next generation a partnership they will be proud to inherit. The five pillars are: • • • • strengthening our people-to-people links, which is what makes us Vuvale or family; deepening our economic relationship to achieve greater prosperity for our people; enhancing our security cooperation to meet common challenges and maintain a peaceful, prosperous and resilient region; building our cooperation on international and regional issues, as we safeguard our region as a zone of peace against a changing climate and geostrategic contest,</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>616</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 • representing the Pacific and its interests on the world stage; and partnering to enable sustainable human development in areas such as healthcare, education, gender equality, social inclusion and poverty reduction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, we are looking at the possibility of evacuating Fiji’s citizens from New Caledonia with the cooperation of Australia and New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vuvale Partnership Agreement is online for those who wish to read that in detail. Under each pillar, there are detailed priority areas of engagement. However, these are not exhaustive, and the partnership will continue to be responsive to emerging priorities and issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Pillar One - strengthening our people-to-people links, we have committed to frequent high-level consultations between our Government and Parliaments, as well as annual ministerial consultations between our Foreign and Defence Ministers and senior officials’ meetings. We are also committed to facilitating easier two-way travel through the Pacific Engagement Visa Program and to foster engagement between First Nations’ people, recognising the shared culture and kinship of the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Vuvale Partnership, ongoing sports diplomacy initiatives are continuing, including assistance to the Fijian Drua who, I once again, congratulate for their fantastic nail-biting win over the Queensland Reds in the weekend. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sports diplomacy assistance is truly fantastic, I have seen the gyms and facilities for men and women as they train there in Sydney. The Aus-Pacific Sports Programme is a boost not only for rugby, but also for netball, hockey and other sports. Under Pillar Two, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on deepening our economic relationship, the Partnership will expand opportunities for two-way investments and support for private sector growth. Further, the Labour Mobility Scheme continues to expand with the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Visa. Under the Partnership, the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) will continue to support financing for quality, sustainable and transformative infrastructure development. In addition, Sir, under Pillar Two, support for agriculture and fisheries sectors continues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Pillar Three on security cooperation, it reaffirms our joint commitment to closer defense, border security, policing, cybersecurity, maritime security, law and justice and intelligence cooperation. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our defense relationships had been enduring but in stops and starts. Training at Military Staff Colleges is a key and essential component for the RFMF Officers cadre, and the suspension of this and other defence assistance due to political disruptions has been a challenge for the RFMF. I have been glad to see the reopening of this opportunity in recent years and the recent appointment of a senior RFMF Officer to a command position in one of their Brigades was a big move. Unfortunately, that had to be revised. After we signed the elevated Vuvale Partnership in last October, Sir, I visited the 8 th /9 th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment (9/9 RAR) in Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. We were given a guided tour of the facility and had the opportunity to experience an operational demonstration in the field inside bushmasters. The Australian Government has donated 14 additional Protected Mobility Vehicles (Bushmasters) to support Fiji’s international peacekeeping operations.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>617 On Pillar Four, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to cooperate on regional and international issues. Both Fiji and Australia agree on the need to tackling the challenges facing the Blue Pacific Continent and commit to work together to ensure a zone of peace and to maximise the benefits of Pacific led solutions to Pacific issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, both countries commit to implement the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the Boe Declaration on regional security. We reaffirm our joint commitment to bilateral, regional and global action on climate change and building climate resilient societies in both, Australia and Fiji. Our partnership will see joint training, knowledge sharing and technical assistance, particularly in relation to energy transition, carbon markets, access to climate finance, sustainable agri-food systems and marine resources. Under the Partnership, we agree to support each other following significant disasters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also been committed to work together to uphold international law and principles. Last but not least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Pillar Five which is a joint commitment to sustainable human development. The first commitment in Pillar Five is to strengthen health systems. We have seen this recently with the signing of the agreement for direct funding of $14.7 million to fund a comprehensive infrastructure masterplan for the Colonial War Memorial Hospital. The master plan means Australia and Fiji will work in partnership to comprehensively chart the course towards Fiji’s new hospital. The master plan is the critical first step in planning out what a new hospital for Fiji will look like. While the new hospital will take time, much is being done to ensure the continuity of care at CWM Hospital. Under Pillar Five, Sir, we will strengthen cooperation between our education systems. In addition, to promote the participation of women in political, economic and social life, as well as implement national action plans to end violence against women and girls. Another important component of Pillar Five is strengthening our social protection programmes to improve the wellbeing of the most vulnerable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to now elaborate on the two MOUs recently signed under the elevated Vuvale Partnership. These are the MOU on Port Development and the MOU on Cyber Security Cooperation signed three weeks ago on 30 th April, 2024 in Lautoka. The MOU on Port Infrastructure and Services provides the framework for cooperation on future investments to support Fiji’s current and future maritime needs. As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our ports play an essential role in our economy, where 95 percent of Fiji’s trade is exchanged through the Ports of Suva and Lautoka. Bringing immediate effect to the MOU, a grant agreement was then signed with His Excellency Ewen McDonald, the Australian High Commissioner, for the development of a master plan for the Lautoka Port. This will upgrade Lautoka Port and enhance its international and domestic port operations, to meet ongoing and changing customer needs. Australia will also support Fiji’s ambitions to revitalize our shipbuilding and ship repair facilities through the MOU. There is even word that we may have the facility to be able to provide maintenance support for the new patrol boat programmes. This is in line with the “Ocean of Peace Concept” proposed as a vision for the Pacific region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to acknowledge the tremendous support provided by the AIFFP to help Fiji revitalize its shipbuilding industry. The assistance from the AIFFP will help us to realise the vision for Fiji to become the hub of the Pacific as a major port of entry and</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>618</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 transshipment, with the potential for increased job opportunities, specialised skillsets and ultimately stimulation of investment and economic activities. Additionally, the impact of Australia’s assistance will advance shipping services for Fiji as a major port of entry and, thereby, enhance overall regional shipping services. The MOU on Port Infrastructure and Services is valued at AU$380,000 (FJ$556,000), to initiate the preparatory work for the redevelopment of the Lautoka foreshore and AU$115,000 (FJ$167,000) to support the Lautoka Master Plan. The total amount is FJ$723,000 as at April 2024. Further, at the signing, Australia announced its agreement for the servicing and maintenance of all patrol boats under the Pacific Patrol Boat Programme and honourable Naupoto will be very happy with that to be carried out in Fiji. This is a welcome boost for our economy. This is not only to serve Fiji’s priorities but also our responsibility as the regional hub, a regional port of entry and trans-shipment centre for the region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second MOU signed between honourable Pat Conroy and I, relates to Cyber Security Cooperation. Fiji and Australia share a commitment to a rules-based cyberspace and strong cyber standards. These rules and standards provide stability for our countries to protect our sovereignty, whilst harnessing the economic benefits to be derived from the digital economy. Our increased connectedness and the introduction of critical technology present opportunities and challenges that require us to work more closely together than ever. Both countries have experienced a series of significant cyber incidents in recent times, which impact our Governments, our economies and our communities. The areas of cooperation identified in the MOU include: Support for Fiji’s computer emergency response team capability; Support for combatting cyber incidents; • • • Workforce upskilling; and • Strengthening governance arrangements. The MOU also affirms our joint commitment to promote international law and norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MOU establishes a critical framework of cooperation on existing cybersecurity and critical technologies. In addition, Sir, the MOU will facilitate the identification and protection of critical infrastructure and information infrastructure. It is a critical steppingstone for protecting Fiji’s information systems.</p><h4>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to deliver this Ministerial Statement on the Elevated</h4><p>Vuvale Partnership and recent developments. Vinaka saka vakalevu. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for the Ministerial Statement this morning on the Elevated Vuvale Partnership. We all know how important this agreement is, in as far as Fiji and Australia’s relations is concerned. Thank you, honourable Prime Minister, for acknowledging the previous Government, particularly the leadership of the former Prime Minister, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama, for the work undertaken previously that led to the signing in 2019, as you have correctly stated. The review is timely and, of course, we acknowledge the Government as well for the signing that took place in October 2023.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>619 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted from the honourable Prime Minister’s statement that in terms of the pillars, probably it is just the wording in Pillar 5 of the previous document was on fostering closer institutional linkages in support of strong and inclusive societies. I have noted and I look forward to the one that is available online, honourable Prime Minister, that Pillar 5 is now the joint commitment to sustainable human development, whether it is just the changing of the wordings, et cetera, but of course human development is so important. Thank you for the MOUs. They are both critical and I will talk a bit on the assistance under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) which was part of the recommendation on a joint economic and trade studies that was also undertaken previously. That was part of the recommendation in the economic partnership. I just wish to touch on a few issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister and given the limited time that I have in order to respond. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have listened to the statement by the honourable Prime Minister. I hope that security co-operation has not been dropped, particularly the provision of strategic lift by Australia to the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) when it goes to peace keeping missions. We all know the limitation when it comes to commercial airlines, honourable Prime Minister, and you are well aware of that in terms of the extra supplies that we can take. But we are thankful that under this Vuvale Partnership, Australia has also committed to providing strategic lifts for us as we go to the peace keeping missions. I hope that, that continues because that is very, very important for us. Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly, we are not new to three issues which is still important that I wish to raise again as part of the partnership, and we need to continue to raise this with the Australians, particularly when it comes to a few principles under the Vuvale Partnership, we will - • • • • • • engage with each other with trust, respect and understanding; share responsibility; listen and speak carefully to understand our respective points of view when differences arise; share our prosperity to improve economic and wellbeing; help each other to grow; and work on a considered and sustainable manner. The three issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I wish to, again, raise this morning to Government is, firstly, on the labour rights of our workers in Australia. We appreciate the labour scheme, I have provided a copy of a document that I have undertaken by an institution in Australia, honourable Prime Minister, Sir. I have passed it to the honourable Minister responsible. There are key issues highlighted in there, particularly in the agriculture sector, because it is not even attractive domestically in Australia and we hope that our workers will not be exploited, particularly on working conditions and equity. They need to be treated with respect, particularly with the labour laws, including medicare. We hope that our workers do not lose out. Secondly, on economic partnership, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, under Pillar 2, the deepening economic relationship on fisheries and forestry, I, again, raise the issue of our fresh ginger, that was raised by the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways in one of his first Ministerial Statements, and that is important for our farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>620</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 Thirdly, on climate change, it is very, very important. We know that Australia is a very big contributor to fossil fuel exports. That cannot be denied, but we are benefiting from the partnership with Australia, at the same time, as true friends, speaking not only on behalf of Fiji but for the Pacific. We need to tell them that they need to slow down on fossil fuel. That is key to our survival, and that is very, very important not only for Fiji, but for every Pacific Islander and, of course, in terms of our collective action towards the implementation and achievement of the Paris Agreement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge at this point the presence of Wani Cawaru from the Hidden Paradise of Savusavu in the gallery, a colleague of honourable Ketan Lal and honourable Naisa Tuinaceva. iTaukei Institutions Forum Trip to New Zealand HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this august Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, those here at the gallery and those listening from their homes, ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to provide a Ministerial Statement to this august Parliament today on the recent trip by the members of the iTaukei Institutions Forum to New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, au kerea meu tauca na noqu vakanuinui vinaka ki na Vanua Vakaturaga o Nabukebuke kei na kena veiwekani ena kena vakarautaki na nodra vagunuvi na turaga na Tui Levuka ena siga ni mataka. [Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to say a few words of commendation and respect to the Vanua of Nabukebuke and its kinship, in the organisation and preparation done towards the ceremony of traditional installation of the Tui Levuka yesterday] Mr. Speaker, I led a delegation from the iTaukei Institutions to New Zealand on 11 th February to 18 th February this year. The delegation comprised of the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, the CEO of the iTaukei Trust Fund, CEO for iTaukei Land Trust Board, Chairman of iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission, Director for Appropriate Technology and Development, DCEO for iTaukei Affairs Board and a VKB team from the iTaukei Land Commission ( Veitarogi Vanua) was also part of the visit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the travel expenses for the delegation members were sponsored by their respective institutions. The purpose for the visit was to explore the opportunities that would complement the work of the iTaukei Executive Forum as mandated by the GCC, particularly, on economic empowerment of the iTaukei. The visit was also an opportunity for the Veitarogi Vanua to raise awareness on the Immigration (Amendment) Act 2023 which allowed those registered in the VKB to enter Fiji without a visa or permit. The VKB Team also took the opportunity to register names of iTaukei living in those areas visited. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the delegation had a meeting with the Pacific Trade and Investment Board, Fiji’s Trade Commissioner and the New Zealand-Fiji Business Council. The purpose of the meeting was to identify market opportunities in New Zealand for the iTaukei entrepreneurs. We also conducted talanoa sessions with the Fijian communities in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. A range of diverse topics were discussed, mostly about land and VKB issues. The Heads of iTaukei Institutions provided clarification on issues under their respective mandates.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>621 The delegation met with the Maori King and had a constructive discussion about partnership for the mutual benefits of the Maori and iTaukei. The Maori King shared about successful commercial undertaking by Iwi Trusts. The Iwi Trusts prioritised investment over distributing monies to their members. The members only received benefits such as education scholarships, housing and health insurance. This model enabled their trust to grow. Their Trusts operate as a wealth fund with a major portion invested. Mr. Speaker, Sir, an outcome of the meeting was an agreement for the signing of an MOU between the GCC and King Tanga. The delegation also visited the Waikato Tainui Tribal Parliament. The delegation learned about the framework, strategies and business plans implemented by the Tainui for their tribes. The delegation then travelled to Rotorua and visited the Puke-Roa Oru-a-Wata Trust and was briefed on the history of the Trust and how they grew their commercial arm. Later, the delegation toured the properties owned by the Trust in Rotorua, which included their latest investment venture, the Wai-Ariki Spa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Chair of the Trust has been invited to visit Fiji later this year for the iTaukei Resource Owners Forum. The delegation also visited the Te Wananga-o-Aotearoa Institute which is one of the most successful training institutions for the indigenous of Aotearoa the Maori. The delegation visited the institution to learn more about course delivery that would be relevant for Nadave. The Institute operates a hybrid delivery model that could be useful for Nadave in the future. We also visited the Toi-Oho-Mai Institute of Technology, the delegation visited the institution to learn about its forestry programme. This was due to the increased interest of our resource owners in the forestry sector and their need for capacity building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei Land Trust Board, under is Wealth Fund Initiative will dedicate a certain percentage for scholarships for this purpose. The delegation also visited the Maori Arts and Crafts Centre to explore how it could help the Ministry in further developing the Fiji National Art Gallery, especially on how to generate its own funding through tourism revenue. Commitment to the numerous artists of Fiji, this year, for the first time, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs allocated a space, specifically for them within the newly opened National Art Gallery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the delegation also held a bilateral meeting with the Minister for Maori Development to discuss potential areas of collaboration, particularly in commerce. I had raised with my NZ counterpart the issue of visa for forestry workers. We had requested if their visa conditions could also include allowing them to further their education. Honourable Potaka has agreed to raise the request with the NZ Immigration Minister. We also held bilateral meetings with honourable Shane Jones, the Minister for Oceans and Fisheries. After being shared the purpose of our visit, Minister Jones stated that he would encourage Turner and Growers to visit Fiji with a view to connecting with some farmers on export. Minister Jones agreed with our request for collaboration in fish farming, particularly to help iTaukei fish farmers. He stated that he would advise the Under-Secretary for Fisheries to visit Fiji for iTaukei Resource Owners Forum and visit some potential fish farming spots. We had also met with Chief Judge Caren Fox and Judge Sarah Reeves of the Maori Land Court and members of the Waitangi Tribunal. The delegation learned about the legislative structure that supported and complemented the Land Courts. A Maori Framework for hearing has worked best for the Maori Land Courts and has been very successful and we will explore the possibility of adopting lesson learned onto Fiji’s context. The formal court system recognises the Maori Land Courts. We had also met with the Te Arawhiti-O-Aotearoa Office of the Maori Crown relations. The delegation learned about the Department’s crucial role as mediator between the Crown and</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>622</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 various Maori claimants. After the discussions, the Department is open to receiving officials from the Office of the Solicitor-General and the iTaukei Affairs institutions for attachments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, the delegation was impressed with the consistency in understanding laws and resources available by all related stakeholders that we met. These includes the Iwis, Iwi Trusts, accounting firms, government and subsidiaries. Education was the key component of the strategies implemented by the Iwi Trusts. Those who benefitted from scholarships went back to help their Iwis, the programme of work by most Trusts was guided by their own indigenous frameworks that incorporated their values and practices. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit was a success. On my return, I have directed the iTaukei institutions to follow-up on the undertaking in New Zealand and learnings from the visit. The institutions have taken significant steps in the commercial space since our return from New Zealand. Please allow me to express our deep appreciation to the New Zealand High Commission in Fiji, the Fiji High Commissioner in New Zealand, the NZ Government and the Maori institutions for their support in making the trip a success. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response to the honourable Minister for iTaukei, Turaga na i Talai ’s Ministerial Statement this morning. From the brief given to Parliament this morning, I think we have no issues because it was an educational trip and also a trip that was economic based where there were lessons learnt from the Maori institutions and how to implement it. There is one thing that I would like to respond to is the priority that is needed to make our iTaukei institutions be self-sufficient through funding. I think if you study those Maori institutions right from the Treaty of Waitangi plus the Maori Land Court, and we still have issues in Fiji where members of landowning units still have some claims, I think these are all that needs to be facilitated and we look forward for those facilities to come through. Given that there are two things that have been announced through the Coalition Government probably after that visit, one is the iTaukei Development Facility which gives us loan right up to $40,000 for any landowning unit or landowner. Honourable Minister, through the implementation, people in Vanua Levu especially in Labasa are still looking for those forms to apply for those assistance that could mirror the things that you have learnt from the trip to New Zealand. The other thing is the wealth fund that you have talked about and the need for certain percentage to cater for things that are of interest to the iTaukei. I think the biggest achievement that needs to be achieved in your term is how the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs plus the Great Council of Chiefs to have self-funding. It could be achieved through a certain percentage of lease money to be agreed from the various landowning units to help in building that Trust Fund or that Fund that will enable the development of iTaukei economically. The other thing too that I would like to raise, Mr. Speaker, is in terms of Climate Change and the need, probably it also started in New Zealand where the Maori Land Commission too has moved into carbon trading and buying carbon credits. We passed a Climate Change Act two years ago and we still have a registry that needs to be established that could also allow landowning units to own these carbon credits, for them to then do business with carbon traders that come overseas. I think in the last sitting the honourable Speaker talked about volitaki cagi and this is where it comes in and the need for the iTaukei Affairs Ministry to facilitate this so that landowning units can own those carbon credits and have that particular value of the amount of carbon that is in their forests and also on the shoreline. These are some of the things that we look forward to.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>623 From what we have seen, we all agree, sa dede na noda dravudravua na i Taukei, Turaga na Minisita. Sa da vinakati me da sa toso i liu, vakaukauwataki vakabisinisi kei na veivakatorocaketaki. Au kila ni sa kena matanisiga eda sa tiko kina ‘qo, eda sa vakanuinui tiko ni na rawa. We all support from this side on how we empower iTaukei in business and development and how we are going to move this forward. Again, there are some recommendations that have come out from their report, there are many things that can be explored to, to empower iTaukei people. We, from this side of Parliament also support the empowerment of iTaukei people in business so that we elevate them from poverty and also for them to raise money and funding in order to support their soli vakavanua, lotu and also the development in their villages. The other policy that you have announced, Sir, the village beautification. There are still some villages around still looking for assistance through halls and churches that needs to take that on board too. Just before I take my seat, the Permanent Secretary for iTaukei Affairs is very helpful. He has been very helpful through the communities in setting up the current co-operatives in Vanua Levu. I hope his contract is renewed moving forward given that he has got the vision for iTaukei and also developing Vanua Levu and the rest of the landowning members in Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, just a correction, it is not volitaki cagi, it is sau ni cagi. That is the translation that is down there in villages. Honourable Members, that final punch from honourable Bulitavu, I hope we will disregard that because it has nothing to do with our Parliamentary role, the renewing of contracts or something of a civil servant. Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.35 a.m.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>624</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 11.07 a.m. Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to make a Ministerial Statement on the Vanua Levu Tourism Development Programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for years we have spoken about diversifying and spreading the tourism dollar but in the past decade we have made very limited progress. If we look at visitation by area, Nadi, Denarau, Yasawa and Mamanuca right up to the Coral Coast accounts for about 80 percent of all visitors, a trend that was there pre-COVID-19 and is here today. That means, where the visitors go, the tourism dollar also goes and where the tourism dollar goes, the socio-economic benefits go. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in June last year, the World Bank approved financing of US$200 million or FJ$447 million for a 10-Year multi-face pragmatic approach to tourism development in Vanua Levu. This is on a highly concessional terms through the International Development Association or known as IDA. I am glad to share that this is the World Bank’s first multi-faced programmatic approach for the Pacific and the first ever for tourism. So, here we have an opportunity to carefully design and deliver this for the people of Vanua Levu. What is important to realise is that the US$200 million while earmarked for a tourism programme will greatly benefit other sectors. That is the power of tourism. The crux of the programme is to mobilise investments and resilient infrastructure in essential services, create a more enabling business environment and enhance institutional coordination. Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, we are looking at a total funding of US$200 million spread over 10 years, this broken down in three phases. Very briefly on the three phases. Phase 1 is valued at US$61.5million and runs from year 1 to year 6 to set the foundation for sustainable tourism in Vanua Levu. This is where we are starting, it will tackle major barriers to growth like insufficient transport infrastructure and essential services, uncoordinated plans and limited private sector and community engagement in the tourism sector. This phase involves activities such as tourism master planning, supporting MSMEs through a pilot programme, Waisali Reserve Upgrade, improving Savusavu and Labasa airports, upgrade on the road connect to Labasa and Savusavu, a landfill for Savusavu, cityscape enhancement, Locally Managed Marine Protected Area (LMMA), pilot wastewater treatment plan and renewable energy investment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, concerning the airports, there was a study carried out last year that highlighted that an international airport in Vanua Levu is not feasible in the immediate future. However, what this project will support to ensure sustainable tourism growth are various investments in both Savusavu and Labasa airports to improve current facilities, enhance passenger experience and meet ICAO safety and security regulations. At this juncture, let me just assure my colleagues from Taveuni that there is also a plan for them. Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Taveuni should see the ATR landing in Matei, that is important for the growth in Taveuni as it has some wonderful resorts and of course the beauty of …. (Laughter) We need to extend the runway at Matei. The concept design has been developed for the extension of Matei and land acquisition around the airport is required for this, and as I speak, dialogue is happening with the Fiji Airports Limited and the landowners, and co-ordinated by Lands Department to make this happen, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, my colleagues from Taveuni, you are also</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>625 part of the equation in a significant way. Phase 2 is valued at $70 million and will tentatively run from year 3 to year 8. It will put physical and social infrastructure in place. The phase will build a lesson from phase 1 and it will continue to improve essential services and infrastructure for people and tourism businesses and further enhance the environmental, social and cultural sustainability of tourism assets. As we speak, a lot of people in Vanua Levu are coming forth with what they need we should do. That will be accommodated in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Phase 1 will put the stage in place, and what we do in Phase 2 and Phase 3 is learn from Phase 1. So, for those who are there, please do not despair, your views will be heard and will be factored in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Investments will capitalise on the findings from the feasibility studies conducted in Phase 1 including those for a greenfield airport, wastewater management infrastructure and system in Savusavu, renewable energy development options in Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Phase 3, which is valued at $68.5 million, will tentatively run from year 6 to year 10. Building on the previous two phases, the final phase will see long term outcomes such as improved infrastructure connectivity, increase tourism revenue and tourism-related jobs and increase community benefits from integrated tourism development in Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will measure the success of the programme not by how many more tourists Vanua Levu gets but how we the people benefit. As such, the result indicators will include tourism related jobs created by gender, number of people with improved resilient essential services, number of people with access to improved resilient infrastructure connectivity to tourism destination in Vanua Levu, percentage of coastal areas with Locally Managed Marine Area and Other Effective Area--based Conservation Measures (OECM) established in Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker Sir, in terms of how we are managing the programme, the financial allocation would be overseen by the Ministry of Finance as the borrower. The Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation is the leading implementing agency and will play a coordination role with the other implementing agencies. Under our Ministry, a Central Project Management Unit is in place to manage the day to day project activities. This Unit includes a Project Manager and three personnel who have been appointed and are responsible for the daily operation of the project. Two specialised project implementing agencies who will be responsible for procurement and project implementation for the projects are the Fiji Roads Authority and Fiji Airports Limited as they are significantly infrastructure related organisations. The project will support, continued intra-governmental coordination through a Project Steering Committee that has been established and consist of key government and private sector representatives oversee project management. This is an extremely important programme and we are excited to see it unfold over the next few years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you again for this opportunity to deliver my Ministerial Statement on this subject. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems like nowadays, whenever there is something to do with Vanua Levu, I had to be there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very good statement by the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation but it is always good to reflect back and put a mirror on the face of some people. You might recall, Sir, that during the honourable Member’s time as an Opposition Member, when we were doing the 30 kilometre tarsealing of the Buca Bay Road, the former Leader of the Opposition, Ro Teimumu Kepa, once suggested that we were going to build a road leading to nowhere and that was published quite a lot. But it is good now that as Minister for Tourism, he actually understands why we need to do that and build infrastructure in such areas because as you know, if we are talking about</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>626</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 Cakaudrove, the road leading from Savusavu Airport all the way to Napuka has some great views where new tourist destination, hotels even seven star hotels and resorts can be developed – very appropriate place. Such irresponsible statements coming back then was not appropriate. This is what we call, Mr. Speaker, something that a visionary leader sees for the future. So, we have actually done 30 kilometres so, please, further develop that road right up to Napuka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are still dealing with infrastructure, we know that Savusavu is the hidden paradise, but Hibiscus Highway is about to be turned from tarsealed road to gravel. The number of potholes is huge. I ask the Government that before doing the infrastructure, please, maintain what was done by the FijiFirst Government.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> What is your Point of Order, honourable Minister? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- He is misleading Parliament because work is being done to address that. HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Your point is irrelevant then. It is already in the past:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Carry on, honourable Member. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been requesting the honourable Minister for Public Works, Metereological Services and Transport for the past one year to fix the open trench at Kaunitoni Road. It is one year and two months now, honourable Minister, that open trench still remains on the tarsealed road. Please, get it fixed before you talk about Hibiscus Highway. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether this money has been approved or not, it is another question. How many boxes do we have to tick before we access this $200 million? In today’s world, $200 million means nothing, and the way the honourable Minister is trying to explain that is as if we are getting $200 billion to fix the whole tourism sector in Vanua Levu. The Vanua Levu economy does not depend on tourism, and this was proved during the COVID-19 pandemic. The economy at Vanua Levu was not affected because we do not rely on tourism. There are more important sectors, such as agriculture whereby we have Fiji Rice Limited sitting at Dreketi, we have Food Processors sitting at Batiri where the sweet oranges come from, we have the Saqani Kava which is a potential to be a billion dollar market, as explained by the honourable Minister sometimes back, we have the sugar industry and we need to fix these industries if we want to build the economy. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are talking about business, we have a very healthy business community in Labasa. But the issue is the transportation cost from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu. Bringing materials all the way from China and India to Fiji is much cheaper compared to taking the same materials from Suva to Vanua Levu. We need to work on subsidising the freight. Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about tourism, there is a development that is supposed to take place near the Labasa River – the Vualiku Hotel. The Special Administrator, having a conflict of interest, is not allowing this project to go through.</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>627 Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been issues. The landowners who have given their 60 percent consent for the development to take place are requesting for the resignation of the Special Administrator, who has a conflict of interest and is objecting to the development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note, if he cannot do a new international airport, what is this Government doing with regards to the air fares from Nausori to Labasa? I have been saying this all the time. It is cheaper to go to Auckland and come back to Suva, than to visit Taveuni. The only local airline that is providing competition to Fiji Link is now downgrading its service. According to the owner, he is not getting what was promised to him by this Government in terms of support. We need to work on these fundamental issues before we can actually talk about the $200 million that is being provided to fix the tourism industry in Vanua Levu. 11 th Asia Pacific Co-operative Ministers Conference 2024 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Na Turaga Bale Na Tui Cakau, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, those of you at the gallery and people of Fiji who maybe listening to this broadcast through Walesi or livestreaming, or simply listening on the radio; I rise to provide a Ministerial Statement on my recent trip on the 11 th International Co-operative Alliance Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference. But before I do, Sir, allow me to offer some remarks. Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament is a bit poorer today in the passing of Mr. Lemeki Senibale, who passed away while we were away and I take this opportunity, on behalf of Parliament, to extend our condolences, recognising his significant contribution to the smooth running of this august body, and also share our condolences with his family, Sir. I would also like to congratulate the Fijian Drua on their magnificent win against the Queensland Reds and maintaining our top eighth position and, hopefully, Sir, put them on a sure footing to qualify for the Quarter Final. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Statement, I thought I would bring to our attention because it is in- keeping with the desire of the People’s Coalition and this Government, to continue to rebuild the country and look at avenues to really leverage or activate more economic activity in the country. Certainly, after being at this Conference, our focus on co-operatives is certainly an area that we need to focus on. It is a well-known fact, Sir, that we have prioritised the development of co-operatives as one of the key vehicles for economic development and rural transformation across the country. We have done this, Sir, for many reasons, such as it actually suits our way of life, our communal spirit and the way we conduct ourselves in Fiji and the Pacific. It is quite interesting, Sir, when I was listening to the international governments, they did share the same parallels in terms of community spirit and the way they conducted themselves. Cooperatives, Sir, if governed properly from a policy level at an implementation angle, has the ability to unlock the productive use of idle resources, pool resources together and derive economic returns for the communities. They are, of course, a source of employment and poverty alleviation and they contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suppose it is fair to say that our work in the co-operative development space has begun to get international recognition, leading to the Government receiving an invite to the</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>628</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 Ministerial Conference. I must also mention that this is the first time that the Minister responsible for Co-operatives has attended this Conference which happens every four years since the 1990s. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministerial Conference was held in Jordan from 28 th April to 30 th April, 2024. Actually, there were two Pacific Island Countries that were invited, ourselves and the government of Papua New Guinea. My colleague could not make it, so I was the only representative from the South Pacific and I can say that I tried my best to do justice to our presence at that Conference. In the Conference, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the theme was “Partnerships Between Government and Co-operatives for Cooperative Resilience, Sustainable Development, and Inclusive Growth in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and North Africa”. Some of the objectives of the Ministerial Conference, Sir, which were, but not limited to - 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. examine the current state of cooperatives in the Asia Pacific and their potential for contributing to resilience, sustainable development and growth. analyse existing partnerships between governments and cooperatives in the region and identify successful models that have yielded positive outcomes. highlight the benefits of collaborative initiatives between government and co- operatives, including improved access to resources, enhanced regulatory frameworks and social inclusion. identify challenges and obstacles in building effective partnerships and proposed strategies to overcome them. provide recommendations to policymakers and cooperative stakeholders, to strengthen and expand government co-operative partnerships for sustainable and inclusive development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Conference provided an excellent platform to share experience, understand the global developments and reiterate our position on co-operative development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Conference covered the following topics and sessions which included the - 1. 2. 3. study on Assessment of Partnerships Between the Government and Co-operatives; statement by Government representatives; and acceleration of a cooperative identity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations General Assembly, adopted a new resolution on co- operatives in social development on 3 rd November, 2023, calling for the proclamation of 2025 as an International Year of Co-operatives (IYC). The resolution encourages Member States of the United Nations and other relevant stakeholders to take advantage of this proclamation to promote co- operatives and raise awareness of their contribution to the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and their overall social and economic potential. This is, indeed, a wonderful outcome, Sir, and we intend, as a Government, to optimise on this opportunity. There was also a discussion around adapting to the changing environment and building resiliency, particularly when it comes to climate change. And one of things that really struck me, Sir, or the governments that were in the meeting was the direct connection between the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals and what happens in their co-operative environment. SDGs such as SDG 1– No poverty; SDG 5 - Gender Equality; SDG 8 and SDG 13, have been linked quite closely to the co-operatives and it is something that we certainly as Government will endeavour to do and</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>629 also the importance of the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) in all these countries. In terms of our contribution at the Conference, Sir, the importance of co-operatives has been recognised across countries and in some countries, Sir, is actually reflected in their National Constitution - strategy documents to enhance contribution to GDP, the creation of new ministries that we have in Fiji, and the implementation of SDGs. I wish to shed some light on Fiji’s contribution at the Conference. During the discussions, I elaborated on the following issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had provided an overview of the co-operative movement in Fiji. Some highlights provided included that there are 590 operating cooperatives that exist across 15 sectors. Collectively, they hold around $151 million worth of assets, earning around $26 million and generating $2.5 million in profits. I also spoke about the collaboration across Government on how the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Women have adopted a “pro-cooperative” approach in their work. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports has insisted for every youth club, that they seriously contemplate developing a co-operative. This can only be a positive development in this country. A proud moment also was when I reported on the increased interest in women-led co- operatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past few years. From having 46 women led cooperatives in 2022, we now have 58 in 2024. This number continues to grow as well and, in fact, in terms of women leadership, this has increased by over 236 percent over the same period as well. These statistics were used to demonstrate internationally that the co-operative movement is vibrant and is very much alive in Fiji and the South Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the sessions, I also took the opportunity to put forward our request to the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA). It was actually a long list, but we prioritised three areas. Firstly, we made a call that the ICA establish an office in the South Pacific and seriously consider Fiji being the regional hub. Although we fall under Asia Pacific as a grouping by region, all their offices are in Asia and have really advanced their co-operative movements in those areas and we feel that it is time to have a base in Fiji. We also made a request with the ICA regarding the review of our Co-operatives Act. This is quite important, Sir, because it not only encapsulates the Act, but also how we can really boost the co-operative movement and I will share an example. In Jordan, they have a National Co-operative for each agricultural sector. For instance, for dates, they have a National Co-operative that manages the date production and then each member co-operative hinges into that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is somewhere that I would like us to head, Sir. Just imagine, having a National Co-operative for kava, it means better control on our kava, better pricing for our farmers and these are the kind of benefits that this forward thinking will bring. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also sought advice on the National Co-operative Federation which is a body that is already in the Act. As with other countries, it is proven that where a strong functioning apex body for co-operatives exist, they do very well in their development. As I have said, we already have a National Co-operative Federation body that was established in 2018. I think the former Chairman is sitting in this Parliament, honourable Agni Deo Singh, but for obvious reasons, their progress was curtailed and Honorable Minister, you will be pleased to note</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>630</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 that we intend to rejuvenate that body. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also happy to report that our requests were well received with the ICA and they have affirmed their commitment in working with us on the issues we have mentioned. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to place on record that the Ministerial Conference was, indeed, a very invaluable platform for Fiji to be present at the table, otherwise, we miss our opportunity to be heard at international levels. Some countries, particularly countries in the Asia and Middle Eastern regions, have developed their Co-operative Strategic Plan. Fiji does not have one but is earmarked to be part of the MSME Strategic Plan which we are currently developing. We may even have a dedicated Strategic Plan for co-operative development going forward. The Australian Association for Co-operatives has expressed an interest in working in that area. One of the other things that is of benefit to the country is the level of desired co-operation that is now forthcoming, apart from Australia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and even Jordan, in terms of trying to help our co-operative movement moving forward, which is probably missed about in some respect, Sir, over the last few years. We need to strengthen our education around co-operatives. We did have that facility down in Draunibota, Lami. In Malaysia, Sir, they have two universities for co-operatives. So, these are the types of things that, as a country and as an august body, we should be looking at, to ensure that in going forward, we truly maximise the benefit that we can derive from pushing co-operatives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a way forward, I assure this august Parliament that we will continue the discussions with respective agencies, such as the ICA, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Australian High Commission, to implement these items and also look to the other partners such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Jordan, in terms of some of the areas that we can collaborate on. Incidentally, Sir, in Jordan, I was quite surprised that they are exporting banana from Jordan through a cooperative, Sir. This is the type of potential that exists in their beautiful country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I can say that our participation was worthwhile and a success, and where Fiji is reevaluating its position as regional leader to the ICA. It also demonstrated that Fiji is committed to the development of co-operatives, and I look forward to continuing to work, to ensure that the co-operatives movement moves to bigger and greater heights. Thank you for this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since I only have five minutes I will try to fill in as much as I can. I thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I also want to tell him how much we appreciate the engagement with the International Cooperative Alliance because this is one area in Fiji which has actually remained a very apolitical part of our landscape. In Fiji, all previous Governments have dealt with co-operatives in a manner that it should, because it is something that provides us with an area where we can actually empower people, we can safeguard our future generations, and we still have a long way to go with respect to how much we can actually do for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to Fiji alone, I think we have about 379 cooperatives that operate throughout Fiji. Just for everyone’s perspective, it actually holds about US$58 million worth of assets. This is just our cooperatives in Fiji and we do business in co-operatives. These are the figures that came out in 2020 - we do business with our cooperatives close to about FJ$22 million dollars on a yearly basis. It actually comes from quite a few different sectors. They operate within the consumer sector, the sugar sector, the thrift sector, the agriculture sector, the land sector, service</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>631 sector, the livestock sector, so you can see a vast array of activities that happen in these cooperative sectors. The Ministry has done a great job with nurturing the cooperative part of our economy. It forms a part of our SMEs also. In terms of geography, Sir, they are spread well across Fiji. We have about 76 cooperatives around the Northern Division, 152 cooperatives around the Western Division and in the Eastern Division, we have about 50 cooperatives, and there are many great examples of our cooperatives that have succeeded. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an area in which we have been recognised. From about 2000, I remember when the Fijian Trade Policy Framework was being done, that also made cooperatives and how the role of cooperatives in the economic, social and cultural and human capacity spheres recognised. It promoted the education in terms of cooperatives. At that time, it also encouraged the formation of the National Cooperatives Federation (NCF). Our 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan which came out in 2017 promoted those policies to strengthen the cooperatives and install the institutional capacity of cooperatives. We had a Target 100 initiative also that came out in January 2018. This was to assist and guide 100 odd cooperatives across Fiji to be fully compliant with the Act. It also marked the celebration of our cooperative movement in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a law which probably also needs to be looked at to bring it up to speed with today’s activities that are happening. It is an area that we can seriously look at, especially in light of the fact that we want to diversify. As the honourable Minister spelt out, there are many areas that you can look at and see how cooperatives can actually assist Fiji, whether it is sustainable aviation fuel, whether it is farming things that we used to farm before, and he just mentioned about bananas, we do not even see that anymore, for commercial purposes. There are many avenues that have been created by the Ministry for things to go into countries which we still have not utilised. Biosecurity has opened up many pathways which we still do not utilise. So, the education part of it is so important that with so much land that is available, it is the education part of it that is probably lacking that needs to be done so that we can get more and more cooperatives, helping the Fijian economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, the Act would need to be amended, et cetera, or brought up to speed. We have some great stories with respect to the examples of cooperatives in Fiji that have been successful. Just a quick word about the SDGs that the honourable Minister spoke about, we also need to be careful because if you remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last session we had at the Intercontinental, we were reminded kindly by the UNDP that we have not even got close to try and achieve the agenda that we want to by 2030, and now it has been put forward by 2065. Again, I think the honourable Minister is correct. We need to make sure that we are compliant with the SDGs, so that we are environmentally compliant with all the cooperatives that actually come in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also see there are very worthy cooperatives around, like the Nasinu Land Purchase Cooperative that have faced numerous problems. So, it is a problem that the Ministry has been dealing with and I think it is a forward step by making sure that we actively participate in the International Cooperative Alliance. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the floor.</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>632</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 Conditions and Status of Government School HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, good morning. The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, fellow Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and Members of Parliament; my Ministerial Statement today in this Parliament focuses on the update of current conditions and status of Government schools facilities and infrastructure in Viti Levu. Before I deliberate on the issue in detail, Sir, please, allow me to acknowledge the Government Ministries, organisations and individuals who contributed to the Ratu Latianara School’s Flood Rehabilitation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the extensive damage faced by the school, some of them have experienced it for the first time, they have been allowed an additional two weeks school holiday upon their request and the assessment made by the Ministry of Education team to allow them to clean up the school compound including their staff quarters. This flood has unfortunately impacted 30 kindergarten students, 428 primary school students and 293 secondary school students with a total of 751 students. In addition, Sir, out of the 27 staff quarters, 13 secondary teachers and four primary teachers quarters were severely affected and most if not all, the household items were also damaged. On this note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the extent of the damage to the school, the Ministry is urgently working in organising the support from the local authorities, Government agencies, NGOs and community organisations to facilitate the recovery process. The Ministry of Education will supply textbooks, water tanks, library books and school stationeries to the school to be ready to open for Term 2. The Ministry will also be providing psychological support (counselling) through the Substance Abuse and Advisory Council to the students, teachers and the stakeholders of the school. Sir, we acknowledge the hard work of the Head of School and his team, school management committee to have the school ready by 3 rd June to resume in Term 2. We also acknowledge the involvement of the RFMF, Fiji Police Force and the National Fire Authority in joining the community with the cleanup and restoration activities to foster a sense of ownership and resilience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to continue highlight in Parliament the current status of facilities in Government-owned schools. Sir, as you are aware, most of the Government schools’ facilities visited are in dire need of repairs, renovations and maintenance. Some of them will be celebrating 100 years of its existence this year (2024). The Government through its 2023/2024 Budget allocated $1.8 million for upgrade and maintenance of Government schools facilities and $1 million towards the upgrade and maintenance of Government schools quarters. Repairs and maintenance of Government schools were unfortunately carried out in a more ad hoc way as opposed to the periodic maintenance that used to be undertaken by the Public Works Department in the past. During the PWD days, school infrastructures were well kept. There was a standard color code of all Government school infrastructure because there was a standard maintenance plan in place. This is something that the Coalition Government values and embarks on to bring back, so the standard of education facilities in all Government schools are restored. The Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services has conducted an assessment of all Government school facilities. The scope of work has been prepared for all Government school infrastructure and we intend to overhaul all the ailing facilities. We, as Government must provide an environment conducive to learning and living. The Ministry of Education is also grateful to the assistance of the Ministry of Finance for granting us with a Waiver of Tender so the works be given to the Ministry of Public Works,</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>633 Meteorological Services and Transport or to other capable contractors. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, approval came too late and we have missed the timeline given by the Ministry of Public Works. In that case, I have instructed that we procure materials so that we can utilize the budget. The team have been requested to incur expenditures and we expect to start with the procurement and upgrading works soon. The Ministry has arranged to have the school management maintenance teamwork with the Ministry of Public Works to carry out and monitor all the upgrading works. In the meantime, some of the upgrade and maintenance works have been done as witnessed in some of our schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programmes offered in all the Government schools and it is critical that all Government schools must offer some standard form of academic and extra-curricular activities. I have encouraged the Heads of Schools to provide the opportunity to expose their students to a variety of activities and not be restricted to the same traditional sports, like rugby, netball and athletics. We also want to bring back those academic competitions that once were done during earlier times like Shakespearian dramas, quizzes and debates. These joint platforms are opportunities to share best practices, teaching methodologies in STEM subjects and networking amongst the Heads of Government schools, teachers and students. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Government schools lack digital facilities and equipment which has drastic impacts on teaching and learning. For the boarding Government schools, the students accessing internet for research to do English and technical projects in the upper secondary schools are always hindered. Accessing the latest science and engineering journals for pleasure reading in the library and improving internet connectivity. RKS has limited connectivity and so unfortunately that QVS is at a blind spot. The Board of Governors, Head of Schools and teachers are encouraged to work together and collectively improve digitisation and at least have smart boards installed like we find in certain communities and faith- based schools today. Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school chaplains in Government schools are being paid by the students through the vakamisinari or PTA funding support. Without counsellors in some of the Government schools, the chaplains provide an important role in providing pastoral care and a listening ear with spiritual advice much needed by our students today to curb the escalating in disciplinary cases and this is an area for which we still need Government funding. It has become public knowledge, Mr. Speaker, that agriculture is the backbone of any developing economy and this was an avenue to discuss with the Heads of Schools to be thinking outside the box on the utilization of the land. The Heads of Schools were reminded that they were just being given brand new farming tractors and are encouraged to toil the land, not only for consumption for the boarders but also to consider expansion for business ventures. Through this expansion, all Government schools will earn money and the students will also learn financial literacy skills through this venture. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will soon continue with due diligence visits to other Government schools outside Viti Levu including faith-based and local community-owned schools on Taveuni Island, Lau Group, Yasawa and the other remote rural schools in the interior of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu for the sole purpose of capacity building for teachers, heads of schools and the school management committees to improve facilities, share practices to empower students for their future and to have education facilities conducive to teaching and learning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to inform Parliament that the Coalition Government has already reset the wheel for the upgrading and maintenance works of all our Government schools so they restore the status of our Government schools and the pride of our nation. The schools that every child in this</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>634</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 country continue to compete to get enrolled in will churn out the best scholars for leadership positions, empower students for their future and to have education facilities conducive to learning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above stated information on the current status of our Government schools should be improved as our schools are the haven for our students to learn, remain in schools and be marketable in all walks of life when they leave the school gates at the end of their secondary and primary school journey. During my visit, Sir, a constant concern raised by teachers was on the salary level and bands that many states were depressing and demoralizing given the hard work of teaching and managing students. Factors that were raised included new teachers joining the profession sharing the same salary level as those who have served for more than 15 years at the very least. Many have raised that the poor salary levels of teachers compared to the workload and stress they have to endure is leading many to resign and opt for lucrative job markets abroad especially those in New Zealand, Australia and Dubai where teachers are being scouted for job opportunities. The Ministry is urgently addressing these concerns raised and policies are being looked at as we speak to allow for proper right sizing and right fitting into salary scales and grades to support and reward a progressive career assertion plan. The major teacher unions will also continue to be engaged to ensure we capture the proper details and structures that will ensure a sustainable retention and management of teachers not only now but also into the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, providing a conducive teacher work environment to manage and provide a safe enjoyable learning experience for our students is crucial and a happy and well looked after teacher means a productive and highly dedicated teacher. With the high level of stress and challenges teachers today face in a growing environment of aggressive, misbehaving and sometimes violent students, our teachers must have the proper incentives to remain teaching and thus, we accept the urgency of these issue that grapple us must be addressed. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Education for his Ministerial Statement. A nation is judged by how it prepares its citizens, especially its young people for success. Education is not a privilege for a few but a right for the many. Government has an obligation to create opportunities to make sure that all young children benefit from early childhood to primary and to secondary education so that young adults can build their skills and chase their dreams through advance education in ECE, primary, secondary and university. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has always fought to bring education into each home and put opportunities at the fingertip of each child, to empower young people to realize their ambitions. For effective teaching and learning, good teaching and learning resources and conducive learning environment is very important. The FijiFirst Government gave priority to education and introduced Free Education Grant in 2014 and made sure that all schools in Fiji, regardless of the location of the school and regardless of the controlling authority of the schools benefited from the Free Education Grant. The Grant is allocated in six different areas: 1. Administration - 30 percent; 2. Building and Compound Maintenance - 20 percent; 3. IT and Computer - 15 percent; 4. Library and Textbook - 10 percent; 5. PEMAC and Science - 10 percent; and 6. Teaching and Learning Material - 15 percent.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>635 All schools, including Government Schools, can use this allocation of 15 percent to upgrade their computer laboratories. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school management and the school heads were provided training on how to utilize the Free Education Grant and this training was also provided to the Government School Heads and this training is provided every year to ensure that all school managements and school heads were up to date and well-versed with the school management handbook. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the current financial year, around $6 million was given to Government Schools for infrastructure against $344,000 given to Non-Government Schools. For the information of Parliament, there are only 13 Government schools out of 900 primary and secondary schools that we have and about 10,000 students are in these Government schools out of 250,000 students altogether. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. H. CHAND.- After TC Winston, FijiFirst spent more than $300 million to construct schools. We do not discriminate between Government and Non-Government Schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the children who stay in Government hostel schools pay less than $100 per term. Children from poor families and outer islands send their children to Non-Government Schools and these children pay around $400 per term as hostel fees. Why so much emphasis on Government schools? All schools whether Government or Non-Government are given the same amount of Free Education Grant. If Non-Government Schools can build or maintain schools, then why not Government schools? Mr. Speaker, Sir, good governance in the education system promotes effective delivery of education citizens. If Free Education Grant is well-managed by the school management and the school heads, I am sure all the schools in Fiji regardless of the controlling authority will have good facilities, teaching and learning resources and conducive teaching learning environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all schools whether Government or Non-Government should be treated fairly when it comes to allocation of resources. Taxpayers can see how this Government is giving preference to Government schools over Non-Government Schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government fails to appreciate that religious bodies and communities have taken the burden away from the Government by providing schools. The least you can do is to treat all schools in the same manner when it comes to funding.</p></body>
