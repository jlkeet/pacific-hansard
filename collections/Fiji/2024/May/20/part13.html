<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Cane Farmers’ Study Tour to India (Question No. 46/2024) HON. R. R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on the lessons learnt from the study tour of cane farmers to India?</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>636 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 20 th May, 2024 HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the honourable Member’s question, I would like to respond to the earlier comment made by honourable Maharaj in regards to the resignation of the Special Administrator because he has a conflict of interest as he tried to object to the development of the hotel. All I am saying, Mr. Speaker, there is definitely a huge disparity. There is no issue about the Special Administrator. The issue is about the land which was illegally transferred to…. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Sir - Standing Order 74(1). The practice of Parliament, Sir, if he be asked a question, he simply answer the question. This is a completely different matter that he is talking about. If he wants to, he can answer it at a later stage, Sir. This is not the forum for him because he does not have the right to respond to it. Please let him stick to the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Minister. Would you mind sticking to the issue that is being raised rather than that hotel which was raised by honourable Maharaj. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to honourable Rinesh Sharma’s question and I must thank him for his pertinent question. I am aware that honourable Sharma, being a graduate from India, is well acquainted with the quality of training and education taught in India. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that the first-of-its-kind educational trip for our cane farmers to India was, indeed, a great success and a fruitful one for all the participants. Firstly, I want to convey my deepest gratitude to the Government of India for sponsoring the two-weeks training for all the 18 participants, including 14 cane farmers and four officials from the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC). These 14 farmers included four female and ten male farmers that are actively growing and supplying cane to the mills. My sincerest appreciation also goes to the National Sugar Institute of Kanpur for hosting our participants and arranging all logistics for our delegates. For the information of this august Parliament, the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) has just recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Sugar Institute, Kanpur, to acquire the benefit from their training for FSC mills and staff. The comprehensive two-week training, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was made possible by the SCGC with the exceptional support of the Indian High Commission in Fiji. The discussions began in 2023 with a submission of a proposal by the SCGC to the Indian High Commission which was well received and considered to be fully funded by the Government of India under the Indian Technical and Economic Co-operation (ITEC) programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon receiving the approval from the Government of India, the SCGC management identified participants based on selection criteria approved by the Council. The criteria included the need to a balanced gender, ethnic mix and the need for representation of farmers across the cane production areas. The 14 farmers selected are progressive farmers, and influential in their farming communities as a lead farmer. Mr. Speaker, the SCGC have been continuously provided with the various training by FSC and the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) through the Farmer Field Schools and Demonstration Trials. However, there is a need to provide exposure to these farmers to other cane producing countries, especially, India, as one of the largest producers of sugarcane. As we say, seeing is believing; therefore, such international exposure provided an opportunity for our farmers to attain modern cane farming practices and technologies available for improving yields. The two-week training, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was tailor-made to fulfil the needs and capacity requirements of our farmers. The participants visited various sites including sugar research institutes, sugar factories, attended field-days, had interaction sessions with successful farmers and visited their farms in the State of</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>637 Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted, the objective of the programme was to provide an international exposure to our farmers. Uttar Pradesh was a preferred choice as they have the same language as a medium of exchange that eased communication, similar farming practices, and is the largest sugar producing state in India.. During the research and mill visits, the participants were able to learn about the adaptation of the new improved cane varieties, effective crop management practices, crop diversification opportunities, practice of crop rotation and intercropping, pest and weed management practices, soil health, plant nutrition and farm mechanization. In principle, the participants gained insights on methods to enhance cane productivity, model farm set-up, fertiliser applications, disease control, weed management and integrated approaches combining traditional knowledge with modern technologies for sustainable cane production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key attributes of learning were: • Hands-on learning for farmers to experience both, sugar mill operations and farm practices that will provide deeper understanding of how farmers actions on farms affect the quality and quantity of cane subsequently sugar made at the mills. • Holistic approach, the farmers learnt how integrating mills and farm visits encourage them to adopt a holistic approach to sugar cane cultivation and to optimise yield including learning about the preparation and different planting methods. The importance of planting quality cane, adoption of good crops, husbandry practices and the importance of soil analysis and plant nutrients. • Visitations to farms allowed farmers to identify and tailor solutions to address specific solutions or opportunities unique on their farms. • Exposure to a range of practices encouraged farmers to innovate and adapt approach in response to changing market trends, technological advancements and environmental considerations. • Mr. Speaker, Sir, is essential for long-term sustainability in strengthening growers’ commitment to remain competitive in the sugar industry. The learnings from models of crop diversification, intercropping and crop rotation have certainly broadened our farmers understanding on the possibilities of improving revenue, profits and enhance farm sustainability. • Understanding the importance of selective harvesting of matured cane and green cane harvesting to improve sugar recovery. • Revenue Diversification by mills – visits to mills allowed farmers to understand the importance of diversification into cogeneration, ethanol production, refined sugar production and value addition into speciality sugar, something that I have planned for our sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having acquired the necessary knowledge, our 14 farmers are now required to practice and share their learnings with fellow farmers under a prudent monitoring structure set by SCGC. The four officials of SCGC were part of the tour team to learn all the ways and practices whereby they learnt ways to improve service delivery and support to farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must note that sugarcane is a permanent crop and requires 14 months to 16 months to mature, therefore, we must not expect miracles to happen by tomorrow on the farms of these 14 farmers. The new planting season begins this month and I expect these farmers to plant new cane and begin applying their knowledge on their farms which they learnt from India. Therefore, we can expect positive results from the 2025 harvesting season. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned, the SCGC staff will work very closely with the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji and FSC to monitor the progress of these 14 farmers including those in the nearby communities to assess the efficiency in capacity building. I am informed that these farmers have already outlined their plans and will showcase it to fellow farmers in their communities through field days with the support of the</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>638</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 Sugar Research Institute of Fiji. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, such an educational trip was the first of its kind but not the last one. We will continue to have dialogue with the Government of India to make this programme an ongoing event for our cane producers. MR. SPEAKER.- Supplementary question. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I expressed in the last Parliament session that I had a couple of youths who had approached me and asked how could they go on this trip as well. Can the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry elaborate on his selection criteria of the 14 farmers and how has his Ministry ensured that there was a balance of youth representation? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I already outlined that selection was done by SCGC and I will not be able to elaborate as to what was the criteria like. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will skip the question that was supposed to have been raised by honourable Vocea, Question No. 47/2024, since the honourable Prime Minister has made a very thorough statement, and have taken care of the issues that he wanted to raise. (Question No. 47/2024 withdrawn) Prevention of Future Problems - Fijiana Sevens Players (Question No. 48/2024) HON. F. S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports inform Parliament as to what measures have been put in place to prevent the repetition of future incidents, like the Fijiana Sevens players sleeping on airport benches outside Sydney Airport? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I wish to congratulate the Fijian Drua for the win in the weekend and also to congratulate the Lautoka Maroons for successfully defending the Farebrother Sullivan Trophy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in response to the question raised by the honourable Member. Before I do that, Sir, please allow me to make the following remarks: 1. Regarding a similar comment you have made, Sir, in the last sitting, I did receive a letter from the Office of the Prime Minister, seeking clarification on the issue. A report from Rugby House was received and forwarded to the Office of the Prime Minister which confirmed that the allegation was false, and we had discussed the same during our Parliament Workshop at Natadola. 2. Let me categorically state in this august Parliament that your Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Youth and Sports, is committed to the development of sports in Fiji. The honourable Prime Minister shared the values of our Vuvale Partnership and sports diplomacy in his Ministerial Statement this morning. Sports has provided pathways for our youth to live their dreams. Sports have been the catalyst of change for our youth to move away from criminal activities. Sports is the cornerstone of a healthy and vibrant nation. Sir, players welfare and safety has always been the core of our development.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>639 In response to the Oral Question, Sir, your Coalition Government with the Ministry of Youth and Sports and Fiji Rugby is deeply concerned about the recent reports regarding the situation faced by our Fiji Airways Fijiana Sevens Team at Sydney Airport on December 2023, as they transited to Dubai. The welfare and comfort of our athletes are of utmost importance to us, and we sincerely apologise for any inconvenience on discomfort caused to the Team. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to this incident, we want to assure our stakeholders, fans and, most importantly, our players, that we are implementing immediate measures to prevent such occurrences in the future. Firstly, I would like to highlight that a new Team Manager has been on board since January 2024, following a transparent and merit-based recruitment process. This change aims to enhance the overall management and logistical support provided to our teams. Furthermore, we have established a central database for series and teams’ documentation which is meticulously maintained by the Team Manager. This ensures that all necessary information and plans are easily accessible and organised, contributing to smoother operations during travel. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regular management meetings are now held with both, the men’s and women’s team managers prior to any trip, enabling thorough discussion of travel plans and ensuring that appropriate arrangements are in place, particularly during long transit periods. This collaborative approach fosters efficiency and coordination between Team Managers, ultimately, benefiting the entire programme. Additionally, schedules are shared and coordinated between both teams. The Sevens Programme Manager overseas travel schedules and activities to avoid any overlaps on conflicts. After each series leg, comprehensive reports are prepared by the Coach and Manager, highlighting any areas that require attention or improvement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rugby remains committed to providing the highest level of support and care for our athletes and we will continue to review and enhance processes to uphold these standards. We appreciate the understanding and patience of our supporters, as we look towards ensuring the wellbeing and success of our Teams. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Just before I offer the floor to honourable Koya for his supplementary question, I stand to be corrected, honourable Minister, on your opening reply that my report to Cabinet was false regarding the men’s team before the issue on the question which has now been raised is regarding the women’s team.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.:</span> Sir, the allegations that were forwarded to you….</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> No, it was not forwarded to me. I forwarded it to the honourable Prime Minister. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, Sir, we received that report from the Fiji Rugby Union and they fully explained their position on that allegation, which we have forwarded to the Office of the Prime Minister and it was confirmed that it was false. MR. SPEAKER.- My report to the honourable Prime Minister was false?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.:</span> No, Sir, the person that had advised….</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>640</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- I was not advised. In fact, I was delegated in this duty by the honourable Prime Minister to go. All we are talking about here is the welfare of our players. As a former rugby player for our Lautoka Team, that is where we are now, as champions of the Farebrother Sullivan Trophy. But, again, the person that complained was the Coach. I did not go there to go and listen to complaints, I went there to hand out the jerseys as asked of me by the honourable Prime Minister because he was busy. When that issue came up, I raised it by way of a report simply on that basis. So, if we are going to continue with this pointing of fingers, that someone is lying, this is false, then heaven knows what else may come through. The second team was the Fijiana Sevens Team. They were shown pictures of them sleeping on the benches and that is where the question is coming from. All I am raising is, now that my complaint has been labelled as false by the Fiji Rugby Union because honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau was unhappy with the question now being posed in the Business Committee. I said, “No, let us hear it”. The good thing about hearing it is because now, mine is being labelled as “false”. I would like to implore upon you, honourable Minister, please, have your fingers on the pulse. That is all I would like to say. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, if I may, this has become a very sore topic and I may offer some advice, honourable Minister, this requires a thorough investigation, especially now in light of the fact that you are saying that the complaint put forward by Mr. Speaker, has turned out to be a lie. I think it requires a thorough investigation has to what is actually going on in FRU and someone responsible needs to go home. My question was, is this is the only occasion that this happened? I think it has just been answered, there are other occasions that this has happened. Have there been other occasions where our rugby team - our pride and joy, whether it be the female or the male team or any sporting organisations, has this ever happened before, especially in light of the fact that the answer that was given, Mr. Speaker, was, “oh, it was FRU’s fault”, and they started a big finger-pointing exercise. Everyone knows in the whole wide world that Sydney Airport shuts at 12 o’clock. Where and who was responsible for doing the logistics for our rugby team? HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, unfortunately, this is not the first time that has happened. It has happened in the past as well, from the report received from the Fiji Rugby Union. This is what we are trying to address now, particularly the administration and the logistical support for the teams before they leave our shores. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for that reply. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the fact that we have already won two Gold Medals in Sevens, we have won a Bronze Medal for the women and we understand the psychological nature or the impact to the players can be very, very important for our possibility of winning a third Gold and a medal for the women. Can the honourable Minister assure us that all measures have been put in place to make sure that the team members will be in full condition, the best possible conditions – mentally, psychologically and emotionally, to make sure that they bring those Gold Medals back to this country? We want to hear from you. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his comments. We are taking that on board. For this particular incident, I never elaborated on the cause of the incident that happened. It was a misunderstanding between World Rugby and Fiji Rugby Union.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>641 The World Rugby was supposed to provide the transportation part of it but they never realised that Sydney Airport will close at 11 o’clock. Based on that, that is why it was never taken into account. The girls had to sleep outside and there was no prior arrangement from Fiji Rugby Union. Of course, we are taking that on board, I want to assure this august Parliament and members of the public listening and watching television that we are prepared for the Olympics. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government seems to talk a lot but we have seen our sports women and men are affected and as the honourable Minister has said, this is not the first time, it is the second time. The question to the honourable Minister is, was any action taken against the person or particular staff responsible behind this debacle? You have stated that it was World Rugby’s fault but at the end of the day, when Ministers and our sports people are travelling, there is someone managing these things. Was any action taken against the staff? MR. CHAIRMAN.- I think I will not allow that because the honourable Minister has fully explained. There was some kind of communication problem between the World Rugby Union of which FRU is an affiliated member of. So, they organised these things, that did not happen, so people slept on the benches. We leave it at that, honourable Lal. I think we will adjourn Parliament for lunch now. We will return at 2.30 p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.33 p.m.</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>642</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.40 p.m. Operational Partners Agreement for Global Environment Facility (Question No. 49/2024)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C:</span> BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice.</p><p>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Operational Partners Agreement for Global Environment Facility (GEF) for Community Based Integrated Natural Resource Management (CBINRM)? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 26 th March, 2024, Cabinet approved the Operational Partners Agreement for the Global Environment Facility Six-Cycle (GEF-6) Project with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. The Community Based Integrated Natural Resource Management (CBINRM) Project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, centres on two Provinces - in Ra and in Tailevu. The specific focus of the Project is to address the rate of deforestation across the Nakauvadra and Tomaniivi-Wabu Forest Reserves towards the lowlands of Tailevu Province, including mangrove zones. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Project is essentially to promote CBINRM) at landscape level to reduce land degradation, enhance carbon stocks and strengthen local livelihoods in Ra and Tailevu Provinces. Through the Project implementation, it aims to address the negative development impacts of unsustainable forest management, while addressing the poverty and livelihood demands of local communities. The Project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to benefit approximately 3,500 individuals from 17 villages, or 21 landowning units in the district of Dawasamu and Namena in the Tailevu Province, and Nakorotubu in the Ra Province, through the implementation of the three components of the Project which involves strengthening local capacities, community based integrated natural resource management and monitoring and evaluating the lessons of dissemination to replicate it elsewhere. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Project will oversee the implementation of the following activities: 1. 2. 3. 47,719 hectares of land under Improved Land Use Plan Integrated Natural Resource Management at district level, through the development of appropriate land use plans, community integrated development plans and implementation of appropriate restoration programmes. Appropriate training and support provided towards income generating activities, the introduction and supply of resilient crops, as well as revitalisation of traditional knowledge and practices for food and nutrition security and build communities’ resilience. Empowerment of community members, especially the inclusion and engagement of women and youth in sustainable development. The Project implementation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, requires a total of US$2,119,425 million, which is equivalent to FJ$4.8 million, the amount approved by the GEF Secretariat. Of the total allocation for the Ministry - $3.7 million, the remaining balance of FJ$1 million will remain with FAO to cover the cost relating to the Project’s monitoring and evaluation, including mid-term and final project review. Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is also subject to change as the Project progresses.</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>643 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Operational Partners Agreement for the Global Environment Facility Six-Cycle Project on Community Based Integrated Resource Management has been signed. The Ministry of Finance is in the process of releasing the first funding and, therefore, the project is almost ready to go. The FAO is GEF’s implementing agency in this particular case and has an overall responsibility not only in Fiji, but for similar projects elsewhere. The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs is the main Government counterpart and will have the overall executing and technical responsibility of the Project, with FAO providing technical oversight as the agency chosen by the GEF, Sir. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be a Project Steering Committee, as is the case with most funded grant and loan funded projects, which will include the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Climate Change and the Ministry of Finance and Officials from FAO. Basically, the idea of the Project Steering Committee is to ensure that all the preparations and different aspects of implementing the Project on the ground is fully done and that the benefits eventually flow to the people whom the project is intended to. In some cases, and sometimes more often than not, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for these kinds of projects, a lot of funding does not necessarily end up to helping the very people the project is intended (02:39:23) to do. So, the Project Steering Committee, obviously, will have its own standards to ensure that it is done. For example, the six-monthly project progress, financial reports, looking at the annual workplan and making sure that the budget is implemented carefully. So, that is update on the project.</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- There are no supplementary questions.</h4><p>Honourable Members, we will skip Question No. 50/2024 because that has been taken care of. The Minister for Multiethnic Affairs has made his reply to the question that was raised earlier on. We will go right to the sixth Oral Question for today. (Question No. 50/2024 withdrawn) Re-Introduction of School Counselling Services (Question No. 51/2024) HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education update Parliament on the re-introduction of the School Counselling Services? HON. A. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to provide some background into the School Counselling Services that has been given in schools. In 2001, more than 10 large secondary school counselling positions were established within the Ministry of Education and in 2014, these positions were removed and the Counsellors that were appointed were given the teaching positions in the respective school. The Ministry, since 2014, has strengthened the Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC). The SAAC, a statutory Unit with qualified counsellors provided counselling support to students referred from schools and the Unit is also mandated to provide basic counselling training to teachers. Therefore, 35 teacher counsellors were trained and certified with a Diploma in Counselling by APTC.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>644</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 In 2015, Divisional Counsellor positions were established in the four Education Divisions. However, due to the previous Government’s reform of the Civil Service, the Divisional Counsellor positions at the Ministry of Education were neutralised and, even worse, Chaplains’ post was also removed in 2019. All these mechanisms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support health, well-being, safety of teachers and students, were dismantled and, unfortunately, could have led to the increase in disciplinary cases in our education system. The Ministry of Education acknowledges that due to the increasing number of in-discipline cases referred to the SAAC over the years from the schools is quiet alarming, with recent media report of 3,742, an urgent need to decentralise the School Counselling Services to the four Education Divisions, Districts and in large schools. With all the changes that have impacted our social fabric, the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Australian Government under the Vuvale Partnership, have established counselling hubs in all the four Education Divisions and these hubs are in the selected Government schools. However, counselling support is provided to all students in their respective education divisions. The counselling hubs were opened in 2023 at Natabua High School, Nasinu Secondary School, Labasa College and Levuka Public School in 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all disciplinary cases that are reported to the School Heads, for example, for drug use, drug peddling, sex related offences which require counselling services intervention are registered at the District and Divisional Education Offices. These cases are then referred to the SAAC Office, as they are classified as high risk, and SAAC contacts the various Heads of Schools in the Divisions to release the trained counsellors from respective schools - the 35 trained counsellors, to attend to the students. As always, parental consent is obtained by the Head of School prior to registration of the cases with the District Offices and parents are present during all counselling sessions. The SAAC, in collaboration with District and Divisional Education Offices, monitor and evaluate the work of the counselling services, reports and follow ups of the cases are submitted to SAAC, and depending on the seriousness of the cases, these are referred to the relevant authorities, such as the Department of Social Welfare, Medical Services Pacific, Ministry of Health and the Fiji Police Force for their necessary support and actions. Sir, SAAC is also expected to provide a monthly report to the Minister of Education’s Office on the work carried out by the organisation. The Ministry of Education acknowledges that there are limitations in our effort to attend to all cases that are happening in schools as the counselling hubs are located in town areas and SAAC has limited powers also as their work with rural school cases greatly depend on the availability of support, the availability of transport and the availability of finances from District and Divisional Education Offices. The counsellors are then expected to travel to rural schools, subject to availability of transportation and the release of the counsellor from the respective Head of School. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Supply of Tuna in Fiji (Question No. 52/2024) HON. M. D. BULITAVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament whether Fiji has sufficient supply of tuna to support the Government’s recent announcement of its intention to sell more tuna internationally?</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>645 HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to answer the question of Fiji tuna supply, we first need to understand the different categories of fishing feeds that Fiji use to source its tuna. These categories are differentiated under the following fleet: 1. Fiji Fish fleet; 2. Foreign fishing fleet based in Fiji; and 3. Foreign fleet based in foreign ports. Apart from these three categories, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to understand Fiji’s tuna supply, it is imperative that we learn the nature of tuna and that it is a highly migratory species. In layman’s term, this means that tuna knows no bo8undaries and they move around a lot. Tuna that we catch in our waters today is likely to be in Tonga on high seas tomorrow. Therefore, they will be targeted by fishing vessels in Tonga and those in high seas. This means Mr. Speaker, Sir, that fishing vessels and fishing nations such as Fiji compete for the same school of tuna that migrate and feed across our different EEZ. That is why there is always a shortage in raw materials to support Fiji’s aspiration to increasing our market for export size. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in highlighting this, the Government’s recent announcement to underpin the need to ensure that we have enough raw materials feeding our processing facilities. The processing facilities that handle and process fresh and frozen products line including canaries. Currently, we have seen a steady increase in raw materials which relate to the increase in catch sourced from our Fiji fleet and foreign fleet calling into Fiji ports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that change do not happen overnight and there needs to be policies, legislation, partnership agreement and investment on infrastructure that need to be directed to the tuna sector, if we are to see drastic increases on our volume of export and market shares. In light, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with great emphasis on future export needs, the current Government is working towards policies and legislation that supports and increase the number of vessels calling into Fiji ports to lend its catch for our processing facilities. While we are currently seeing a constant on steady supply of tuna, we are also mindful that due to the complexity of the tuna sector, some of these developments takes time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are optimistic that this is the right approach, and the right people will increase our market and export shares. MR. SPEAKER.- Tuna knows no boundaries. I did not know they were that knowledgeable about boundaries. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Minister for his detailed explanation. In 2019, PAFCO at Levuka was only generating about 18 tonnes per day, in 2020 it was producing 120 tonnes a day. What I wanted to emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the result of the fishing vessels that comes into Fiji. Fong Chun Formosa Company (FCF) Taiwan bought Bumble Bee and when Bumble Bee was bought by FCF, they are the biggest supplier of tuna around the world. Basically, they had been feeding PAFCO to ensure that the workers there are employed for the seven days. My question to the honourable Minister, does he think that there is surplus demand now for the Government to go around the world and try and sell tuna to other countries mainly in Europe and USA? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as he alluded to earlier regarding FCF being the major supplier to PAFCO but as mentioned that PAFCO is producing only 13 tonnes on a daily basis. We cannot supply and sell tuna around the world unless we have the capacity in our industry to supply, so we are signing an Agreement with PAFCO and FCF to give us 250 tonnes of tuna per month of tuna so we can access into other countries in the supply of tuna and canneries.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>646</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister from a trade perspective, I know the honourable Minister has been out looking for people to invest in the industry, is the focus on the supply of tuna to only PAFCO or is the focus on developing the industry so that we have more suppliers of the product that is actually going out from Fiji in terms of trade? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are trying to do both at the same time. First, we try to get the stock and we try to move in this tuna hub into the Pacific to attract fishers and fishing companies to come to Fiji. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a supplementary question. I wish to thank the honourable Minister for his answer. Can the honourable Minister advice Parliament on the recent innovative technology and e-platform development currently underway to improve service delivery and operation of the tuna sector? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of advance innovation technology and e- platform is critical and imperative in this day and age. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work to advance innovation and e-platform was initiated by me last year during my study visit to Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) in Solomon Islands. During this visit, I was able to secure the support of the FFA to help us realise the aspiration in technology and e-systems. Throughout last year, we have worked closely with FFA to conduct the needed scope of work and secure external funding to finance this work. This led to a trial conducted on: 1. Fiji electronic post grade massive platform; 2. Fiji electronic catch document scheme; and 3. Fiji boarding and inspection electronic platform. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also honoured to confirm that the trial phase has been completed with the launch date scheduled for next month. The milestone achievement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will indeed strengthen our ability to address a daily operation and needs to provide a more streamlined platform to assist our tuna stakeholders. MR. SPEAKER.- He was really prepared for that supplementary question. (Laughter) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answers from the honourable Minister is sort of confusing me. He is talking about migratory species and then we know that this is an extractive industry, the tuna stocks are depleting. My question is on the licenses that we issue because there has been efforts in the past to reduce the number of licences, yet the honourable Minister is talking about getting more tuna stocks. This is why I am confused, Mr. Speaker, Sir and I want the honourable Minister to state the direction that the Ministry is taking in order to address all these issues. MR. SPEAKER.- Have you got that, honourable Minister? You want to reply?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned earlier, we have limited licence here in Fiji for our EEZ but what we are trying to do now is to get this tuna hub in the Pacific to get those foreign fishing boats to come and lend their fish in Fiji. That is the reason why we are limiting our licences and try to get</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>647 the foreign fishing boats to lend and supply our fish. MR. SPEAKER.- The tuna hub comes from where? HON. K. V. RAVU.- From other Pacific Island countries and the other neighbouring countries like Japan and Taiwan HON. J. USAMATE.- Supplementary question is in relation to what the honourable Minister has just said about the focus of the Ministry to bring in tuna from other countries into Fiji. We have had a shipping fleet in this country for a number of years and a lot of those ships are berthed in the Suva Harbour, they cannot fish, the fisherman are not fishing. There are families that depend upon them, they cannot go to sea because of the high costs, et cetera. The Ministry is focused on bringing fish, what is it doing about our local fishing fleet that is sitting out in the harbours that are not sailing at all? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, we would not want you to elaborate on that hub you are trying to bring here, maybe sleeping there now. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will look into that issue. I think that is a new question coming up and we will try to sort that in the Ministry, our institution.
