<body><h3>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</h3><h4>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the – (a) Anti-Doping Bill 2024 (Bill No. 01/2024) be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill at a later sitting of Parliament; and (e) Upon presentation of the Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today to address this esteemed assembly on a matter of utmost importance to the integrity and fairness of our nation’s sports landscape – the national Anti-Doping Bill 2024. As we gather here, it is imperative that we re-affirm our commitment to upholding the principles of fair play, integrity and athlete welfare in sports. Doping not only undermines these principles but also poses serious health risks to athletes and tarnishes the reputation of sporting competitions. The issue of doping in sports has plagued the integrity of competitions globally. Recognising the importance of fair play and safeguarding the health of athletes, our nation has long been committed to combating doping in sports. However, the existing legislative framework, such as the National Anti-Doping Policy requires enhancement to address emerging challenges and align with international standards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the national Anti-Doping Bill which we are proposing is a pivotal step towards strengthening our nation’s anti-doping efforts, which seeks to consolidate and enhance our existing legislative framework to effectively combat doping practices in sports. By aligning with international standards set forth by organisations like the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), we demonstrate our commitment to being at the forefront of the global fight against doping. Mr. Speaker, Sir, after Fiji’s success at the Olympics, WADA changed our status from a Tier 3 nation to a Tier 2. While this is good news, it does represent some immediate challenges as a Tier 2 country is required to be much more independent than Tier 3. And Fiji cannot continue to rely upon support of Oceania Regional Anti-Doping Organisations (ORADO) as much. Hence, the Bill proposes the need and guidelines to establish the National Anti-Doping Organisation (NADO). Given the above, Fiji will need to be compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code and to that end, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Office of the Solicitor-General and Drug Free Sport Fiji (DFSF) has been working on a corrective action report since 4 th November, 2022, to ensure that compliance and noting the establishment of NADO is a critical component of the report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, should Fiji fail to address the non-conformities, WADA’s compliance taskforce will further report our case for potential non-compliance to the WADA Executive</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 653 Committee and, perhaps, result in a non-participation of Fiji in all international sporting events. The enactment of this Bill is crucial for several reasons, as follows: 1. 2. 3. It reaffirms our commitment to upholding the integrity of sports and promoting clean competition. It establishes a National Anti-Doping Agency, tasked with coordinating and implementing Anti-Doping Programmes, adopts stringent testing protocol, and introduces strict penalties for offenders. By deterring doping through stringent regulations and penalties, we aim to provide a level playing field and fair competition, while protecting the rights of athletes. It addresses the evolving landscape of doping practices, including the misuse of emerging substances and technologies. By empowering regulatory authorities with the necessary tools and powers to investigate and prosecute offenders. Additionally, by aligning our legislation with international standards, we strengthen our position in the global fight against doping and enhance our credibility as a responsible member of the international sports community. Mr. Speaker, this is an unprecedented development, not only for Fiji but for the Pacific. Without a centralised specialised organisation to support law enforcement and regulatory agencies in Fiji, the sports sector will remain vulnerable to the use of performance enhancing drugs. With Fiji taking the lead in sports development in the Pacific region, establishing the National Anti-Doping Platform will enhance our position and reach to the Pacific region. Mr. Speaker, in supporting this Bill, we not only safeguard the integrity of sports, but also uphold the rights of clean athletes who compete with honour and integrity. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our sporting competitions are fair, transparent and free from the scouts of doping. Therefore, I urge all honourable Members of this august Parliament to lend their full support to the National Anti-Doping Bill 2024. Let us stand united in our commitment to preserving the integrity of sports and promoting a level playing field for all athletes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I just want to reiterate, Sir, that from this side of Parliament, we will be supporting the Bill. There are a couple of questions that may also just need to be answered and I am happy to note that it is actually coming before the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights so that we can thoroughly vet it. However, just a quick question on it that perhaps, would be food for thought for the honourable Attorney-General, I see there is a component in here with respect to the Drug Free Sport Fiji (DFSF), whereby in Clause 5, it actually talks about the functions of DFSF and in Clause 5(1)(f), to coordinate with the Fiji Police Force. If this component that is actually being put in there with respect to the Fiji Police Force, are there going to be consequential legislation amendments or is it for purposes of assistance only, or is it going to be a criminal offence, which will mean that some part of it maybe a criminal offence, that will mean that we will have to change some of the laws in our criminal law? That is currently the only question, Sir, but you will get the support from this side of Parliament for it. I think it is a good thing, especially in light of the fact that we are internationally well recognised as a sport loving nation</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>654 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 20 th May, 2024 and we must make sure that we are always clean. At the end of the day, I think it is also good for our children who will partake in sports as that also needs to be addressed from the educational perspective, because sports is big business, as you know, Sir. Many have lost contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, especially because they were not drug free. Gold medals in the Olympics have been lost because of it, and in light of the fact that we have a drug epidemic in Fiji already, that is something that is important. This is important, and it is important for the future of our sports in Fiji. We have got quite a few speakers, not for today but later on, maybe in support of it. It is just that one question, honourable Attorney-General. If it is, I am not sure what the purpose is for the Fiji Police Force or in terms of the coordination with the Fiji Police Force. The Fiji Revenue and Customs Service, I can understand, local sports and entities, et cetera, and how it comes in but is there a criminal component if you get busted? Is there a criminal component to it that will be added to our criminal law act? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, when you make your reply, then you answer the question that has been raised. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports for a well presented and articulated presentation this afternoon. Fiji is a sports nation and for someone that has been involved in sports, not only at the national level but also at the regional level. I think this is long outstanding, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is something that we have always wanted to have something like this, that not only is in compliance with the international norm, but is also in line with the development and progress of sports here in Fiji. I fully support this Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is good news to athletes and sporting federation and bodies that are listening out there. Thank you, Sir. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by honourable Koya and honourable Naivalurua, we support the Bill as it is going to the Committee. Thank you very much, honourable Minister for Sports. You have done well than the honourable Attorney-General in moving Bills through Standing Order 51. Just two things I would like to request from the honourable Minister, given they have done the executive consultation on the Bill, if it comes through with the various consultations that has been done because it will help the Committee in doing its Parliamentary oversight in terms of moving around with the various consultations that are done. Secondly, the Bill was done by a Consultant from UNESCO, probably that assisted the Ministry with drafting. Could that be made available too when it comes to the Committee where we are able to sit with the Consultant and also the leading drafter at the Office of the Solicitor-General, given that there should be cooperation, plus the Terms of Reference of the Bill, which would be helpful to the Committee? Thank you. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports for being the first person to bring a Bill that is not under Standing Order 51. Congratulations, Mr. Attorney-General! MR. SPEAKER.- That is a good one.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>20 th May, 2024 Anti-Doping Bill 2024 655 HON. J. USAMATE.- At one point in time, honourable Members, Parliament had been loaded with questions relating to drugs, et cetera. The very important role that the Minister plays in sports is to ensure that we are free from doping. He has brought this, and we are grateful that the response is positive, even though questions have been raised. But I leave that to you, honourable Minister, if you want to speak in reply, especially to the questions raised by honourable Koya. HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all those Members who have contributed to the Bill so far. Yes, we will be assisting the Committee with all that they need regarding the Bill. We will be supporting you on that. I have nothing further to add, Sir. Question put. Motion agreed to.
