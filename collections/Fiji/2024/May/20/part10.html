<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery, as well as those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. Honourable Members, please, join me in also welcoming the Ambassador of Japan, His Excellency Mr. Rokuichiro Michii. Thank you for joining us today, Your Excellency. Medical Check and Wellness Assessment Honourable Members, a Medical Team will be stationed at the Level 2 foyer from Tuesday through Thursday this week, to conduct medical checks and wellness assessments. I encourage all</p><p>20 th May, 2024</p><h4>Communications from the Speaker</h4><p>613 honourable Members to make use of this service. Women in Leadership For the information of all honourable Members, Parliament will host a Women’s Mock Parliament, focussing on the theme, “Women in Leadership”. The necessary preparations are underway, and we hope to have this event at the end of July this year. The Secretariat is working closing with UNDP - Fiji Parliament Support Project, to ensure the successful implementation of this initiative. Formal Attire – Members of Parliament Honourable Members, the House Committee has duly met to discuss issues pertaining to the welfare of honourable Members and, at this juncture, please, allow me to convey the decision of the House Committee, which has also been endorsed Business Committee. Honourable Members, you may remove your coat only after the Prayers each day, that is, your jacket. Safari wear is deemed a formal attire, and this can be worn during Parliamentary Sittings, as well as Committee meetings. Provision of Lunch During Parliamentary Sitting Honourable Members, the provision of lunch during Parliament sitting week will resume from this week. Quite a lot of requests have been coming from both sides and you must understand, honourable Members, that I have also requested Medical Teams to be brought in for medical checkups to be conducted here. It is not that I want to scare you, but as has happened in the past, some honourable Members become unconscious during sittings, probably due to heavy food intake during parliamentary sittings. But, again, lunch has been provided, honourable Ketan. Committee Review Report – Time Allocation Honourable Members, the Business Committee has agreed to uphold the practice in the April Sitting with respect to the speaking times in the debate in the Committee Review Reports, as follows: 1. the mover will move the motion for up to five minutes; and 2. up to minutes for the right of reply. 3. There will only be two speakers from each side of Parliament and each of the two speakers</p><h4>will have up to 10 minutes to speak.</h4><p>The key issue here is the Committee Reports. Please, do not confuse this when we will be having Treaties being brought before us and you might think this applies too, no, we will rely on the Whips to provide the list of speakers. For the information of honourable Members, I have also received the response to Written Question No. 09/2024 from the honourable Prime Minister and this will be conveyed to the honourable Premila Kumar and a copy will be uploaded on the Parliament website. SODELPA Whip Honourable Members, I have also received confirmation from the SODELPA Party Leader, honourable Aseri Radrodro, that honourable Ifereimi Vasu is now the SODELPA Whip. I wish the honourable Minister the best in his tenure as Whip.</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>20 th May, 2024 Tabling of Report - Emoluments Committee Honourable Members, we have been informed by the Chairperson of the Emoluments Committee that the Committee Report will be tabled at a later sitting date, as it has not completed its deliberations.</p></body>
