<body><h3>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE - FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED</h3><p>GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE - FIJI SUGAR CORPORATION LIMITED HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 131, and for the purposes of Section 145(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, I move: That Parliament approves -</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 885 1. the increase in Government Guarantee for the Fiji Sugar Corporation Limited’s domestic borrowings of $75 million for the period 1 st August, 2022 to 31 st May, 2028 which is the guarantee period by $20 million; and 2. that FSC be exempted from paying any guarantee fee.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as we all know, FSC is Fiji’s Sugar Milling Company incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1972 to take over the milling activities from South Pacific Sugar Milling and CSR Limited in 1973. The Fiji Sugar Corporation operates three sugar Mills; two on Viti Levu in Lautoka and Rarawai, Ba, and third in Labasa, Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has been guaranteeing FSC’s domestic and offshore borrowing in the past years. The latest domestic guarantee cover was approved by Parliament on 28 th July, 2022 whereby Parliament approved an additional guarantee to FSC of $75 million for a guarantee period 1 st August, 2022 to 31 st May, 2028. Sir, FSC on 8 th August, 2022 and March 2024, executed and utilised the guarantee with the Bank of the South Pacific Limited for a loan facility of $50 million and HFC Bank for an overdraft facility of $25 million respectively. The FSC has fully exhausted the approved Government Guarantee limit. On the other hand, the Government also guaranteed FSC’s offshore borrowings which was approved on 15 th September, 2017, whereby Parliament approved the extension of the Government Guarantee period for the EXIM Bank of India loan of USD$50.4 million from 19 th September, 2019 to 31 st December, 2028. Both the parliamentary approvals exempted FSC from paying the guarantee fee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC has been operating at 75 percent production capacity for the past years and the company’s operation has been adversely affected by various uncontrollable factors ranging from spate of natural disasters, volatility in the world sugar price, milling inefficiencies resulting from the failed mill upgrade project, deteriorating cane quality and decrease in cane production. As of May 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC’s total operating cost is $60.6 million, of which approximately 44 percent - $26.7 million was dispensed as salaries and wages. This was an increase of about 8 percent when compared to $56 million as total operating cost in 2022 financial year, the increase mainly attributed to increase in salaries to staff, except the Executive Management, rise in fuel price and post COVID-19 recovery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC had continuously been carrying net losses for the past 10 years. As at 31 st May, 2023, FSC incurred a net loss of $23 million, compared to $44.3 million net losses for the 2022 financial year. FSC’s total liabilities has acceded its total asset based for the last 10 years, technically meaning it has been insolvent during that period. This is well-known, Mr. Speaker, Sir. For the 2024 financial year 2023 cane season, FSC anticipates better results, with cane production of 1.56 million tonnes and sugar makeup of around 139,628 tonnes, hence $240.3 million in total revenue was expected from sugar proceeds and molasses for the financial year. It is projected that earnings before interest, excess depreciation armortisation for 2024 financial year will be a positive $22.2 million. The world sugar price, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know has moved in FSC’s favour last year, currently hovering around US$0.90 cents per pound compared to below $0.14 cents per pound, some</p><div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div><p>886 Government Guarantee - FSC 23 rd May, 2024 two years back at the time of pricing - an increase of about 39 percent. The price had increased over US$0.25 cents per pound. Late last year, it was projected to stay closer to about $0.20 cents per pound. This is projected to improve the financial position of FSC, except for natural disasters and other unexpected events. It is expected, therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the key performance perimeters for the next five years will be achieved. As of 30 th April, 2024, FSC’s outstanding borrowings guaranteed by Government stood at $276.2 million, of which $200.2 million is covered by Domestic Government Guarantee, and $76 million which is about US$32.7 million is covered by Offshore Government Guarantee. The financial implications of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of 30 th April, 2024, the total Government Guarantee debt stood at $1.03 billion or $1,030.8 million or 7.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product. With FSC accessing an additional $20 million which is what the guarantee is asking, borrowings will increase the total Government Guarantee exposure to $1,050.8 million or $1.05 billion or 7.9 percent of GDP. In the event of a default, the Government will be liable for the guarantee borrowing of the FSC. The Ministry of Finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also working with FSC and the Ministry of Sugar to monitor the restructuring efforts of the Board and Management of FSC, to ensure any fiscal risk that might arise and that are there are properly communicated, mitigated and managed by FSC with the Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and similar to the previous one, I have a list of speakers in front of me, as follows: 1. Hon. P. D. Kumar; 2. Hon. Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; 3. Hon. Leader of the Opposition; and 4. Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation. From my understanding, the Assistant Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office would like to participate too so you have three. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion for the Government to guarantee FSC’s borrowings of $75 million for the period from 1 st August 2022 to 31 st May, 2028 and also to exempt FSC from paying a guarantee fee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge the importance of the guarantee to FSC. It will help FSC to borrow, to ensure continuous production and export. But we are also very concerned the manner in which FSC is currently operating. That, I will discuss a little later but I want to simply say that guarantee is important. It will only kick in if FSC cannot pay the loan. So, let us hope that over a period of time, FSC improves, as the honourable Minister has highlighted, that the world sugar price is looking favourable and if it does that, then obviously it is very good for the Government, for the people and FSC. Now, I must say, unlike the Opposition of the past, we understand that the role of the Opposition is not merely to oppose but also to support beneficial proposals from the Government. And this is one set of proposal and there are many others we have supported as you can see.</p><div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 887 We support the motion because we know the significance of the sugar industry to Fiji’s economy. It not only supports export reserves but also safeguards our foreign exchange. During COVID period it was a sugar industry that was bringing in foreign exchange and keeping our foreign reserve intact. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC is the major employer in Fiji, supporting thousands of jobs directly and in directly. Most sugarcane farms are in rural areas where economic opportunities are limited. This morning, we heard from the honourable Minister for Agriculture. He was talking about the importance of supporting agriculture to eradicate poverty. Sir, in the same way, I also believe by supporting FSC, it means reducing the risk of poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a Government Guarantee, FSC could secure financing for improving efficiency and productivity, reduce reliance on just raw sugar exports. There has been and it must be noted by all of us. There has been a lot of support given directly or indirectly by the Government over the years with only one hope, that all players in the sugar sector will play their part in increasing the sugar production, and that is where the failure is. Unfortunately, despite the assistance, the sugar sector is not performing to its optimum. We can blame one another till the cows come home. We can start from the Lome Convention when Fiji was receiving preferential sugar prices and we can ask ourselves why we did not upgrade our mills or diversify into other products during the golden period. We can also talk about the non-renewable of land leases around 1997 when farmers have to find shelter in informal settlements along Suva and Nausori corridor. We can also talk about large sums of loan taken from EXIM Bank in 2004-2005 to upgrade our Mills and we know that the Mills were not upgraded to that standard. We can also talk about the assistance offered by European Union that was not taken up to improve farming and milling. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the solution of the problem is to remove politics from this industry, that is the only solution. We need to build the sugar industry purely based on the business model and now honourable Singh is there, he has been running his business, and I am sure he will be able to bring that business sense into the operation of various institutions linked to the sugar sector and I believe this is what is missing. They have been relying too much on the Government for assistance. I want to speak on the importance of diversification so that the Government does not have to guarantee FSC loans and how the various agencies can start moving into that direction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is very little diversification of crops adopted by the sugarcane farmers. When I am talking about diversification, it starts with farmers, the millers and also other subsidiaries or you can say, organisations, for example, Sugarcane Farmers Fund as well as the South Pacific Fertilizer company. So, let us start with the farmers, We were quite surprised because in Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we invited all the stakeholders, we had a discussion with FSC and other stakeholders and I was taken aback when the Field Officers at FSC gave their opinion and they believed that if farmers start planting alternative crops they might move away from sugarcane. So, they were more worried from that perspective. But on the other hand, we have iTLTB that says that, good husbandry must be practised. The soil should be in good state and if the soil is not looked after, then there can be penalties to the farmers. But it just does not make sense and we can see that in all these, agriculture is far removed. They are not anywhere near sugarcane farms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me talk about FSC. The FSC has not diversified into alternate products, they are producing ethanol from bagasse for their own use but they can do better than that by using</p><div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div><p>888 Government Guarantee - FSC 23 rd May, 2024 hog fuel, et cetera, to produce more energy for electricity grid, but that is not happening to the level that we desire. But what else can they do? Can they move towards refined and specialised sugars to better manage their revenue and cash flow risk? Mr. Speaker, Sir, by diversifying, FSC can reduce reliance on just one single product. We have the Sugarcane Growers Fund. By now, it should have become a financial lender for all farms, generating profits for cane farmers so that cane farmers benefit from this diversification. We understand that the Sugarcane Growers Fund was established by cane farmers. It does not mean that it should be just there for the cane farmers, they can diversify into lending and the interest they generate, they can also offer loans to the cane farmers at a much reduced rate. So, it is a win-win situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have South Pacific Fertilizer company - a subsidiary of Sugarcane Growers Fund. Over the years, the government has been subsidising the cost of fertilizer. But did the South Pacific Fertilizer make any effort to change its financial position? Did they diversify or tried to diversify? They have not, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They are still blending fertilizers but farmers are demanding fertilizers based on their soil type. They have not fully moved into becoming the supplier of fertilizers to the non-sugar sector. There is an opportunity, but that opportunity has not been ceased. Mechanical harvesters are there but co-operatives face the problem of spare parts and qualified mechanics for repairs and maintenance. Why these services could not be provided by the Sugar Sector? They had not looked at this area at all and when we go out in the field, when we meet farmers and the co-operatives, they have been complaining about this particular issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Sector should have embarked on this diversification programme probably decades ago. We should have had a Sugar Refinery Company decades ago. This merely depicts the lack of foresight and goodwill. More are broadly diversifying the revenue base would position the Sugar Sector to offer better prices to farmers. Our problem is, we are trying to seek efficiency and productivity from institutions established during the Colonial era. Other countries have moved away from these structures and modernised the law so that the Sugar Sector operates on a business model, and we have not done that purely because of politics. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of these institutions, I remember in one of our meetings when I questioned the people around the table and my question was very simple, that you have visited so many countries and seen how the countries were running their sugar mill, the whole Sugar Sector. What can you tell us about the institutional structures they have? Do they have the same institution structures that we have at the moment? Some of them actually just smiled way, but we can see there is a push and pull factor at this level. While we are trying to improve the Sugar Industry, we will not be able to achieve unless and until we make some drastic changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard from honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we have another opportunity knocking on our door. With an increase in world market price for sugar, I do not know how long it is going to stay but I am aware that around 2017, FSC faced a 33 percent reduction in the world sugar export prices, so that was quite significant. And you can probably see that, that is the reason why they need assistance from the Government - to keep the company afloat. But I believe that with the sugar price increase, there is an opportunity and we should grab that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the world’s largest sugar producers are moving towards ethanol while others are facing similar problems like Fiji where production has dropped, and a good example is Cuba. India is moving towards ethanol production, which means they will be demanding more sugar from other countries, and they have gone into high value product. In other words, if you produce ethanol, you get better price than the raw sugar in the world market stage.</p><div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 889 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to focus on how to raise efficiency, how to raise production and how to build the confidence of farmers in the industry. At the end of the day, I believe we have created so many structures and so many institutions, but at the end of the day, the farmers are the losers. They are depending on all these institutions to work in harmony and improve the revenue so that they can gain from it. But in fact, it looks like it is the other way round. We are just trying to use farmer’s money to keep this institutions going but they are not getting the level of return they should get.</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words I support the motion that was presented by the honourable</h4><p>Deputy Prime Minister. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Premila for all her sentiments and suggestions for the Sugar Industry. One thing I will have to assure this honourable Parliament is that the first thing that I did when I became the Minister was to get the mill Board for FSC who understood about the operations of the Sugar Industry. One particular person I made the Chairman was Mr. Nitya Reddy because he was a former accountant of all the mills in Fiji, including the Ghief Accountant, before he actually migrated to New Zealand. Ever since he came to the new Board, he has taken a new direction on FSC. I assure Parliament that ‘yes’, he is doing basically what we want and what Parliament wants and to bring the sugar industry back on the street. Mr. Speaker Sir, that will of course make FSC more efficient and make FSC profitable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. Sir the rationale behind this motion is to embed the unwavering confidence that the Sugar Industry is on the right particularly towards a robust and sustainable future. This confidence is based on serval strategic initiatives and notable positive developments within the industry. Firstly, I would like to highlight that we have significantly expanded our support programmes for the sugar industry. The number of programmes have increased from 6 to 13 in the current financial year, demonstrate our commitment to the comprehensive support for all aspects of the industry. Secondly, we have actively been addressing the long strategic issues of the land leases by providing subsidies on the premium payments. This initiative is designed to elevate financial background on the farmers and ensure that land remains accessible and affordable for the cane cultivations. As I have explained this is written in the earlier response to the question raised by honourable Virendra Lal. Furthermore Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are engaging more with the younger farmers and promoting the use of mechanisation as we recognise that these elements are crucial for the future of the sugar industry. By promoting the youth involvements and modern agriculture technologies we are building a more resilient and efficient economic sector.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- Youth involvement:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Additionally, we have achieved a remarkable milestone by making a high speed payment for the 2022 crop in the rate of $91.38 per tonne. Sir, just for the information of Parliament, we actually will be paying this fourth cane payment which comes out of Tuesday are $21.75. This is the highest paid for the fourth cane payment but not</p><div><a name="81">Page 81</a></div><p>890 Government Guarantee - FSC 23 rd May, 2024 only that, after paying this fourth cane payment, a total payment will be $101.08 which is higher than last year. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Of course, there is another last payment after that is called partial payment that will be another $2 or $3. We are looking at...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- No money:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- No pride than sugar:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> We are looking at about $105 at the end. So what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this current payment we will be injecting $34.1 million in the economy. This significant payment reflects our commitment to ensuring fair compensation for our hardworking farmers and providing them with the financial stability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the groundwork of the Coalition Government is evident and it is clear that the industry is part of the rebuild. The approval of this motion will be instrumental in ensuring that this recovery continues unbeaten. By increasing the Government’s guarantee and exempting from the guarantee fees we are providing a necessary financial support and confidence that will enable FSC to meets its commitment towards our hardworking farmers. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the motion is not just a financial manoeuvrer, it is a strategic step towards securing the future of the Sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I would like to say what actually was the background. Every time that FSC needed funds because we have a sugar buyer in UK, we had to borrow a short-term fund from them which costed FSC about $1 million interest for the 45 days borrowing. Now apart from that, the buyer was double dipping. First, it means we have to sell our sugar that is currently on the fields. They come and buy our sugar at that price and they basically tie our hands and legs and the gate price. First, we are losing by selling sugar at lower price, then we have to go back and borrow a short-term funding which was costing us a million dollars US so I am saying here what the idea now with the current Board of Directors we have had discussion with. Let us increase our Government Guarantee, let us have our local banks borrow whereby we can negotiate with HFC, FDB or any bank for a short-term funding and, of course, the interest rate that we will pay will remain in Fiji. So, this whole idea to have these kinds of facilities, that as for FSC, they will not use this for capital projects. This will facilitate that each time FSC needs refunding they can go back and apply for short term funding from local banks. So Mr. Speaker, Sir, that’s the whole idea of this government guarantee. I urge all the members of Parliament to support this motions as it is a vital component for our ongoing efforts to revitalize and sustain the Sugar Industry for the benefit of all Fijians. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.– I now offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition. The floor is yours, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU. - Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I also wish to contribute to the motion raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance to increase the Government Guarantee for the Fiji Sugar Corporation Ltd domestic borrowings of $750 million for</p><div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 891 the period of 1 st August 2022 to 31 st May 2028 and of course that the FSC be exempted from paying the guarantee fee. As alluded to by my colleague, honourable Premila Kumar, we fully support the motion, given the importance of FSC and how it benefits, not only the farmers and the people involved but of course how it helps us economically too as a country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again as alluded to by the honourable Minister, this government guarantee is something that is not new and of course the last guarantee was given on 28 th July 2022 and we are just continuing with it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Of course, we will all agree that we need FSC to continue its work but of course with more efficiency as well and particularly profitability and that is something that we all hope will be achieved sometimes in the future. I thank the honourable Minister, for the changes that he has stated, particularly the work that the Board is undertaking but of course, this requires the collective efforts of all key stakeholders and again, I want to emphasize that Mr. Speaker, Sir. Today, we have talked at length about land that has already been made available and I think the big question, particularly in terms of the land that is available is the question on utilization. I looked at the last Annual Report for 2023 and just looking at the Labasa 640,000 tonnes of cane, that is well below what Vanua Levu particularly, the cane belt areas is capable of. I know during the heydays, it was around 2 – 3 million for Labasa alone and that’s the challenge that we all have, and we hope we can work together on this. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are still open to the Special Committee that was part of His Excellency’s opening address last year, the commitment by Government to form a Select Committee to look at the Sugar Industry, probably not just Sugar but of course the whole Agricultural sector, something that has been circulating as well behind the scenes, particularly in the work of the Committees given the importance of agriculture and how it contributes to our national development, economic progress and most importantly, the need for us to diversify and broaden the economic pace so that we can be in a better position particularly to meet all the expectations that are there before us. Perhaps, the only other issue that I wish to raise I have talked about land utilisation as alluded too by honourable Premila Kumar, these all boils down to increase production, particularly in the field. FSC, of course, is operating well below its capacity and the only way to improve apart from diversification I think the basic is to let us just produce more cane in all the three mills so that it will help not only in the financial position of FSC because that is how FSC makes its money. The more sugarcane it crushes the more sugar we have. We sell and that is how it can make its operating cost and of course, reinvest as well something that is badly needed so that we can come away from this Government guarantee. That is the key question for us. The Sugar Research Institute plays a very important role in this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the identification, research, selection of the right varieties and that is something that I also wish to also say in here with all due respect having served as Commissioner in Vanua Levu, it is the FSC extension workers. We need to shake them. They need to do more because my observation, it seems that they focused more on cane logistics rather than the normal extension work that is expected of FSC field workers. This is an area. They need to work with the farmers. Most of the farmers are unsupervised. They only come and see them when its time to fix the road because the mill is about to open in the next few weeks. That is when you see all the vehicles running all over the places and so forth, so they focussed more on logistics rather than the basic work which is on farm extension. That is something that they really need to do to improve cane production.</p><div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div><p>892 Government Guarantee - FSC 23 rd May, 2024 I see from the honourable Members from the other side that I have to sit down now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but that is my contribution. Again, FSC is important and let us work together to grow the industry to improve on its efficiency and most importantly. ensure that it goes back to a level of profitability. I fully support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the motion before Parliament for the Guarantee to the FSC borrowing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will take this from tourism and aviation perspective. In that, we need to ensure that FSC continues to operate viably for the production of ethanol known as the sustainable aviation field that were drive aviation in the future. I had a brief Parliament on a Ministerial Statements on the importance of SAF that we cannot do without it. It has to be part of aviation going forward, going hand in hand with our tourism industry. At this point, Mr. Speaker, indications are that we need to produce about 3.5 million tonnes of cane to enable us to produce ethanol at a level that we would require in this country for our aviation. Our production right now is around 1.6 million tonnes, for the record we have was 4.2 billion so it is possible, it is durable that we can get back to about 3.5 million tonnes of canes to enable us to produce efficient ethanol. The sentiments expressed by honourable Kumar is very true, I think the fragmentation within the industry is not helping. I was a cane farmer myself. When I was here with the Economic Affairs Committee we had consultations for Bill 19 and Bill 20 designed by the previous Government to revamp the industry and what we saw was that it is quite fragmented and if you can reconcile all those institutions within FSC, it can bring back the production that we want. Today, there is about 40,000 hectares that are available for cane but the yield hectare is about 47 right now. We have farmers in this country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one in Labasa that we met during that time, he was producing 125 tonnes per hectare and I was told in Nadi, there was someone producing 150 tons per hectare. If you can up the yield, we can double or triple what we currently do today. But it means a more cohesion within those institutions that are part of the FSC. On ethanol, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as indicated by honourable Kumar, some countries have gone into ethanol in a big way and that is somewhere Fiji should be headed to, there is of course, SAF is quite expensive these days but as the whole world gears up for the production of SAF because we want to be net zero by 2050, the aviation industry in the world. With the support from the developed countries at the COP28, the commitment by the developed countries to help finance developing countries like Fiji is there, technology transfer is also there. Our capacity building is also there. In the cause of trying the cost of producing SAF will come down, so Fiji should get itself up to produce its own ASF, it will be tragic that we have the few stocks through strain and then we export our fuel for aviation. As I said there is an opportunity with ADB to carry out the feasibility study for FSC and Fiji Airways on the production of ethanol in Fiji and I have also asked them to look at cassava because cassava is also a feed stock for ethanol. All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have indicated it could be transformative for Fiji when you go into SAF production. Cassava has grown everywhere in the country and properly harness, it could transform the market for us at the village level and across the country. Tourism is critical for the country and this ethanol should be produced to help our aviation and help our tourism industry hence the need to strengthen FSC and position it to produce SAF in the coming year. On aviation, Mr.</p><div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Government Guarantee - FSC 893 Speaker, Sir, if I could just go back to what I said yesterday that tourism today is about $3.3 billion and in the next four years, it can be $4.3 billion. So, it is quite significant and we spoke about liberalisation of aviation policy and let me just share with our people across the isle that we all subscribe to a restrictive aviation policy all this while but things have changed hence the liberalisation of our air aviation policy. As I said yesterday, right now with America we can only fly to Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Fransico but we need to go into all the ports in the United States. All that has changed the thinking, the Americans are saying, “Liberalize your Aviation Policy and then we can talk about you coming in.” That is why I spoke against open air in September last year, but I have changed my tune this year, it is for that reason - the reason that, if we do not do it, we do not get access to American ports where lies a huge part of the future of our tourism industry. So, please, be assured that it is not a change that was made without the due thought process and, of course, all our negotiations, Fiji Airways was part of it. So, we did not go out there and negotiate something separate from Fiji Airways, it was all there, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted our people on the other side to be assured that we are doing this in the best way for Fiji, the Tourism Industry and our national airways. On that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for ethanol, SAF is very critical, and as I have said once, I never thought that one day I would be talking about FSC’s future with Fiji Airways and vice-versa. But that is the way forward for Fiji, and I would like to see that we continue to support FSC for the future of aviation in this country. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion before Parliament. Before I begin, I wish to pay tribute to the late Mr. Eliki Bomani, a former civil servant who has just passed away earlier this week. Mr. Bomani from Namuana, Tavuki, Kadavu, is the son of the former Alliance Party Minister, Mr. Solomoni Momoivalu. He joined the Public Service straight from Marist Brothers High School and rose through the ranks to reach the post of the Deputy Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office in 2012. We offer our warm condolences to his Mataqali Verata, his wife - Patricia, daughter - Letila Momoivalu and the vanua of Erauraki. May his soul rest in peace and rise in glory. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have heard from this afternoon, there has been a lot of discussions on the Sugar Industry and, of course, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs in our various trips across the country. We have noted that Sugar Industry is not sustainable because the small farmers are facing the brunt- they are not able to survive with the current small acreage that they have. I think the future of the industry is to make sure that we have larger farms and more economical to produce. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that has been missing which I have looked through all the reports, is a more coherent policy which needs to be formulated. Of course, I would like to thank the honourable Minister, who has come up with an idea of having this policy. We have requested FAO, they will be starting in June to come up with this new policy and this new policy will lay the ground rules - how many farmers do we really need? How many acres do we need there on the ground? Of course, where are the markets? These will be clearly stipulated in this policy. I would like to thank the honourable Minister. He has this foresight, he has very strategic thinking about the new way to address the challenges that we face here in this industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to emphasise the need to adequately streamline where FSC is sourcing its finance from. Currently, FSC obtains the loans and finances from a number of financial</p><div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div><p>894 Government Guarantee - FSC 23 rd May, 2024 institutions. Once we have the policy in place and a much more clear roadmap, perhaps may be it will be prudent for FSC to be looking at a sole financial provider. Of course, once we put together all the various financial sources into one single source, we would benefit from a single financial provider that offers a preferential interest rate. Of course there is a lot of this in the market. I am sure that FSC Board will be able to look into that. I think that is all from my side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of course I do support the motion before Parliament. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be as brief as possible. I want to thank all the honourable Members for their support and some of the issues raised. The sugar industry including the institutions within the industry have been a big challenge. The signals that we have provided as a Government over the last 17 months, has seen a new sense of confidence amongst the sugarcane farmers, I was in Labasa last weekend, there was a first Northern Development Summit Innovation and Entrepreneurship and what I was told, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the sense of confidence, there are a lot of farmers a sort of getting back, working towards trying to increase their production and it is largely coming from the price incentive with the highest cane price ever in the history of Fiji. Last year was $91, this year the fourth cane payment has just been announced today of $21.75, again, the highest ever and the final price is expected to be more than $100. These are price signals that are actually motivating the farmers to produce more because they can possibilities of better income. The Government on its part, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continue with some of the programmes that were there including subsidies for fertilizer and weedicides. We allocated $2 million within Ministry of Sugar Budget for lease subsidies and in addition to that as the honourable Minister for Sugar pointed out, the Government provided further $1.2 million for the renewal of 218 agricultural leases of which about 45 average. What we have done in the last 14 to 15 months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as well as in the last Budget has given the signal. The honourable Leader of the Opposition made two very good points and I agree with him wholeheartedly. He talked about the share extension and training. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji for a long time whether you talk about FSC, whether you talk about agriculture, probably one of the best research extension and training programmes and unfortunately in the last so many years that was completely dismantled and it is now being built and that is very important because if farmers to do not get that kind of attention from FSC and other institutions within the industry then a lot of the issues particularly planting the right cane variety and the Minister talked about the wrong variety that a lot of farmers were introduced to and where the sugar content was much lower. So, I think as a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are addressing that. The second good point that the honourable Leader of the Opposition made was about the farm level production and he is right. If you do not have cane production, nothing will work., FSC will not be profitable, no arm of the industry will work. The 2006 European Union funding of $350 million, I think honourable Members perhaps you do not need to understand that. During the late Mr. Qarase’s term as a Prime Minister that loan was negotiated (it is not a loan, it was a grant) which was going to look at three components in the industry. They were going to look at alternative livelihood, it was going to look upgrading of the mills and it was going to look at Research Extension efficiency and effectiveness at the farm level so that farmers income was increased. Obviously, we lost that in the last 15 years. No substantial funds were injected to improve in fact on the other hand we lost the railways which is been a major contributor to the high cost of production and transportation of cane for the famers. So that is something that the Government is looking at and hopefully there will be some improvement.</p><div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 895 The issue about the lease renewals, the honourable Leader of the Opposition said in 1997 and 1998 in fact I want to give them some statistics. Under the SVT government led by the honourable Prime Minister at that time in 1998, 82 percent of all the leases were renewed. And those that wanted to move in fact the schemes in Navua and other places were set up to do that. So we understand that as a Government and we have been in the last 14 months addressing that head-on and that is already showing positive results for the industry. Honourable Kumar, talked about politics. In fact, it is the other way around when politics was there sugar production was very high. There is a lot of knowledge-sharing between Sugar Cane Growers Councils, various institutions and the mechanisms within those institutions provided that but I agree with the points raised that all these institutions, there is no room for these institutions – the Sugar Research Institute, Sugarcane Growers Fund, FSC to be working in silos. They need to come together. They need to understand that all these institutions are very important and I think the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry has already made that very public statement and I hope that the stakeholders, particularly FSC, will look at restructuring. As I have said before, the Ministry of Finance in working with the Ministry of Sugar will ensure that appropriate restructuring takes place and that FSC manages its affairs in an official and effective manner. I thank all the honourable Members for the support to the motion. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
