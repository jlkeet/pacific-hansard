<body><h3>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024</h3><h4>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Child Justice Bill 2024 (Bill No. 04/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the July Sitting of Parliament; (e) Upon presenting the Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must be debated, voted upon by Parliament but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, before I begin my speech, I would love to just acknowledge our students that are here in Parliament who have come especially to be here to be present as I present this Bill. I wish to acknowledge the students from the Learning Centre, LDS Church College, Gospel High School, Yat Sen School, Multiple Intelligence School, Holy Trinity School, William Cross School, John Wesley School and Kalabu Primary School. I also wish to acknowledge some children’s organisations that are here including Vision Fiji as well as the Suva Bahai Community and, of course, I acknowledge our staff that are here, our Permanent Secretary as well as our Director Children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister… MR. SPEAKER.- And the members of your constituency from Nasinu?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.:</span> The children are here Sir, yes.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; today we have the chance to make history here in Fiji and, indeed, yet again to lead the entire Pacific region. I am immensely proud to stand before you today to introduce the Child Justice Bill 2024. This Bill offers us generational change, a law that will catapult us from old ways of thinking, that keep crime rates the same and if children without rights to a new safer Fiji. One way children in conflict with the law do not go on to reoffend but instead go on to become contributing members of society. At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the previous government under the leadership of the former Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama, for having put this proposed law</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>860 Child Justice Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 together in the first place. I acknowledge my predecessors in the Ministry who laid the foundation for this great work which I picked up and it has finally come to this point. The new Child Justice Bill 2024 finally responds to why children come into contact with the law. The Bill draws on the research and science about what stops the children from offending. This means we now have the chance to pass a law that will keep the community safer because our justice measures will work and over the course of the next few minutes or so, you are going to hear me use the words “science” and “research” a lot. That is because the traditional ways of thinking are not going to get us out of where we are now, because if you always do what you have always done, you will always get what you have always got. It is the research and science that is now loud and clear and how we can stop youth offending at its earliest. Loud and clear on how to stop our children from re-offending. Research and science tells us, this Bill will work to reduce crime and break cycles of it for generations, but it is also based on logic. If our interventions do not get to the heart of why children offend and instead, we criminalize our children and re-criminalize them, then we are only perpetuating a cycle of re-offending for our children. Today we know that most often, children who offend have escaped unsafe homes or have no homes at all. There is a deep connection between children who have no care and children who offend. Research from some of our nearest neighbours shows that children who have experienced the psychological damage of child abuse trauma, or who had an intellectual disability make up about 90 percent of our children that are being incarcerated, and that the crimes they commit are largely crimes committed in order to survive or to self-medicate this trauma. It is only logical that we intervene to specifically address these issues and we will drastically reduce crime committed by children thus disrupting the cycle of offending. Over the past decade Mr. Speaker, Sir, studies conducted have consistently demonstrated that diversion programmes are far more effective than preventing child crime compared to charging or incarcerating a child. Research indicates that with appropriate diversion measures, three-quarters of children do not reoffend within six months, and over half do not engage in further criminal behaviour within two years. Many children have also shared how these interventions have helped them regain control of their lives. I will tell you a true story that illustrates the science at its most basic. Let me tell you about a young boy we will call Sailosi. Sailosi’s father abused Sailosi and Sailosi’s mother since he was born. Sailosi’s father was unemployed and forced his mum into being a sex worker, so he would have money. In order to escape the domestic violence and sexual slavery, Sailosi’s mother escaped to the streets, taking Sailosi with her, so Sailosi was raised by people on the streets. He was homeless for his entire early childhood. The Department of Social Welfare intervened with Sailosi was three years old and put him in a Children’s Home, but Sailosi’s father came and forced his way into the Home and took Sailosi away. In his early teens, in his desperation to escape his father’s continuing abuse, Sailosi turned back to the streets where he grew up. It was around this time that his mum died from cancer. This meant that Sailosi had absolutely no one. He was a young child with no one to feed or clothe him. With nothing to eat, no place to sleep and no one to care for him, Sailosi shoplifted food and stole items just to survive. I want you to think about what comes next. Should Sailosi be charged and punished for the consequences of being abused by his father and trying to survive homeless? Should our justice system demonise him for his life of being a child victim? This was one case where diversion was actually used. The Minister at the time ordered Sailosi to be returned to the Children’s Home where he was looked after and received counselling. He is now 14 years old, well settled and</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 861 attending secondary school. This could have been a very, very different story, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but legislative change could mean the same ending for so many children in Sailosi’s situation, children who would otherwise go on to live a life of misery and commit crime to survive, instead of changing paths to become a responsible member contributing to our society, just like Sailosi. This new law would see the Ministry involved as a matter of course in all cases just like this. Never before have we had laws in this country that recognises the life factors that give rise to children coming into conflict with the law and put clear responsibility on a welfare department to intervene and address it, to change the life of that child, thereby, making a safer Fijian society. So, what happens if this Bill does not get passed? Then we are stuck with the current law - the Juveniles Act 1973. Yes, it is over 50 years old and does not respond to the long-established criminological research of the last two decades and evades our international human rights obligations. This old Act operates on a completely outdated understanding of how and why children come into conflict with the law. It lacks any approach to diversion, like the one we have just heard, and it lacks any approach to restorative justice. Importantly, without any formal provisions on diversion, no one, not even our Ministry has the mandated responsibility to be looking into and resolving the broader circumstances for the child. In fact, the Juveniles Act 1973 adopts an old British approach, which is even now well and truly obsolete in Britian, and globally recognised as an abuse of human rights, but is still in place here in Fiji. Now, as our practices and approach to child welfare have moved to world-leading with also our proposed Child Care and Protection Bill 2024, which is yet to come, the Juveniles Act 1973 is completely out of step even with our Fijian approach to child protection and care. This Bill was subject to extensive consultation across the Fijian community. It lives up to our unabating relentless commitment to our children. You will not be surprised to hear there is a strong support for this Bill, even from the international community and those who support Fiji so generously. You will not be surprised to hear the support from our children’s organisations, even our service providers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were some concerns raised about raising the age of criminal responsibility from 10 years to 14 years, as we are proposing in this Bill. What will happen to our children under 14 years, you might ask? Will they go unpunished to commit more crime? No, they will not, Mr. Speaker. The Bill explicitly prescribes the intervention, diversion and care that must be taken in relation to these children by our Ministry, so that we see lives change direction, even lives like Sailosi. The Bill does not propose to leave children under the age of 14 years out on the streets to offend again. But it does come from an understanding that we do need to ask questions about these children. Who are these children? Why did they come into conflict with the law in the first place? If we do not that, how can we stop it from happening again? But do not listen to me, listen to the science. Extensive research across the world clearly shows that the younger a child at their first arrest, the greater their chances of future offending. A study of incarcerated youth found that children arrested before the age of 14 years, are three times more likely to reoffend as adults, compared to children arrested when they are over the age of 14 years. Therefore, diverting younger children increases the chances greatly that they will not offend again. This means, our community will be safer. It means, precious police resources, precious court resources, precious DPP resources will all be saved. Not only will they now not be dealing with children under 14 years, but there will be less recidivism and less crime over time. But most</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>862 Child Justice Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 importantly, Mr. Speaker, this is our chance to change the lives of our children. It is our chance to stop punishing children, like Sailosi, for living a life they did not choose. We cannot ignore the medical science. Doctors all over the world have come out in their number to protest holding 10-year-old children criminally responsible, because it is completely against medial consensus regarding brain development. Children under the age of 14 years have not yet developed the social, emotional and intellectual maturity necessary for criminal responsibility. This is why we treat our children differently in other parts of our legal system. Think about it, Mr. Speaker. If we act like their brains are old enough at 10 years to make fully informed decisions about committing crime, does that not mean we should drop the age for the right to drink alcohol too, and the right to vote to the age of 10? The age of criminal responsibility of 10 years old, out of step with these other legal rights and responsibilities. If we punish children for lives of continual despair, we are not only guilty of a system that willingly abuses their human rights, but we create legacies of intergenerational trauma. Is that what we want for the future of Fiji? We have the chance here, honourable Members, to disrupt suffering for generations to come. Let us not forget the fact that criminalising children under the age of 14 contravenes our commitments under the Convention on the Rights of a Child. We would all do well to remember that the science and human rights basis for raising the age are so sound, that we are becoming out of step with much of the world. A significant number of countries in Africa have raised the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years, countries like Korea, China, Cambodia, Kuwait, Laos, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Philippines, Timor Leste, and the list goes on and on. These countries have a minimum age criminal responsibility of 14 years. There are some misplaced ideas that with increasing criminal responsibility to 14 years, children will be used as drug mules; that this will not curb younger children taking drugs. Again, honourable Members, let me bore you with the science because you are about to discover that this Bill is what we need to reduce drug-taking in our children. Young people who have experienced childhood trauma are six times more likely to abuse marijuana and nine times more likely to use hard drugs. The science is clear that these children are looking for any escape from their traumatic memories. Being charged by Police and then being imprisoned with children who have suffered the same fate will not change that. But proper intervention, care and diversion will. It is the chance to actually get these children off the treadmill of drug abuse and deal with their trauma to stop it happening again. What, of the vulnerability of younger children to be used as drug mules? This Bill is designed to reduce the number of children who need to live a life of crime in order to survive, and therefore be vulnerable to drug trafficking just to survive. In its place, this Bill sees a direct intervention and diversion that will mean these children are no longer 'easy prey'. Importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are deep concerns about the younger age at which children sexually offend. These things is what has driven this legislation which is legislation for change. When children sexually offend against other children, statistics show this is most often precipitated by the fact that they themselves were victims of sexual abuse at a very young age, often at the hands of their own family. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this does not mean that every victim of child sexual abuse will go on to offend, but amongst children who do sexually offend, this experience is prevalent. Research in our own region shows that if you intervene early enough, you can change the trajectory of offending permanently. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this new Bill gives that opportunity. Our old law or the law in place today, does not. I do not believe that any of us here in this Parliament does not care for children. But think</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Child Justice Bill 2024 863 about the money we throw away in policing, our court system, our DPP, if we continue these processes, it will only see children before the justice system again, and again, and again. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, adopts all the rich, uncontroverted knowledge that will see children in this country thrive, and keep our community safe. Surely, we know too much from the science to persist with outdated, old ways that keep us from progressing. This is our chance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to move our society forward, to activate generational change in an unprecedented way. It is in your hands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, I commend this Bill to Parliament under Standing Order 51. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a short contribution on the Bill that is before Parliament. I thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation for the Bill and also acknowledging the previous FijiFirst Government who had done the executive consultation, and we thank you for carrying this Bill forward and tabling it to Parliament. We all agree to the motion that is before Parliament and that is going through Standing Order 51 but to Committees. In place of the motion, she had specified July to come to Parliament, probably that will be upon your discretion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the July sitting is always prioritised for Budget. Once the Bill is referred by you to Committees and probably from the honourable Chairman, communication can be made to the office in terms of probably an extension for an August sitting. There is also a ruling by you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Committees sittings too are to be due by 29 th June, 2024. Those are some of the administrative issues that we might face as Committee while we deliberate because it is quite a thick Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the various stakeholders too that we would like to engage, the consultants, the terms of reference, probably from the honourable Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General’s Office and the executive consultation report, first brough by the FijiFirst Government in 2021 and 2022. The consultation report would be very thick and the various venues that they have conducting consultations in, that will enable the Committees to put its alternative workplan on the timelines that they will need to work on very strictly before we come back to Parliament. However, in regard to the content and the substance of the Bill, again, on child justice, we do not have any issues on that. We leave that when we come to deliberation in the Committees and we will bring back a substantive report to Parliament. Without further more to say, we support the motion and the Bill before Parliament and the procedure and the manner that the honourable mover has moved it. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the honourable Minister for bringing this Bill to the floor. I do recall when we were going around the country doing consultation on the Registration of Sex Offenders Bill, that was one of the times where the Committees did realise that children under the age of 18 when they commit those kind of offences, there was a lot of loopholes in the laws and we needed to ensure how we can bring them back to the community, because a minor creating an offence and then getting his whole life disrupted by an offence that was committed during his age when he was not even 18 years was something that was brought forward before the Committee. Though it is under Standing Order 51 but it is going to Committees. It will be scrutinised well and this is something that we will need to protect our children</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>864 Child Justice Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 in this era. Currently, we have the Juveniles Act which is quite old and was due for review. So, I would like to commend the honourable Minister for bringing this Bill and sending it to Committees. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their contribution to the debate. Certainly, in terms of when it will return to Parliament, that is something for Parliament to consider, we are certainly open to August. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that was the timeframe too for the Anti-Doping Bill that is going to Committees so it is certainly open to that. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to thank you all and I thank all our children and parents</p><h4>who are here to be present for this historic Bill being tabled in Parliament.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR.
