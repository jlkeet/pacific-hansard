<body><h3>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3><h4>CORRECTIONS SERVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20 th May, 2024, I move that: The Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 02/2024) be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.:</span> My apology, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I am beginning to worry, are we coming or going. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the newly appointed Commissioner for Corrections Service, Dr. Jalesi Nakarawa. Dr. Nakarawa is also from the beautiful island of Kadavu, is a former Corrections Officer and held the position of Assistant Commissioner before he migrated to New Zealand. He is one of the first group of officers to graduate from USP while still working as a Corrections Officer in Naboro. He graduated with a PhD in Law from Waikato University, returned to Fiji and served as an Assistant Professor at the Fiji National University. Mr. Speaker Sir, I will be brief. Most of the issues that are being canvassed here have already been canvassed on Monday. I rise to contribute to the debate of the Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 which was tabled on Monday, 20 th May, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, many changes have occurred over the years with the operations and administration of the Fiji Corrections Service. The Bill simply amends the Corrections Service Act 2006 to improve the Administration of the Corrections Service while plans to conduct a holistic review of the Act are underway. It is important to amend the Act to extend the list of international standards to include the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners namely the Nelson Mandela Rules, the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and the Non-custodian Measures for women offenders which is the Bangkok Rules and to ensure the</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>872 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 and the Non-Custodian Measures for women offenders which is the Bangkok Rules and to ensure the well-being of the prisoners who are under the care of the Corrections Service. It is also worth mentioning that the practice in the past years, that had Medical Officers and Registered Nurses are appointed by the Commissioner of the Corrections Service, thus amendment to that is necessary to reflect the same. One of the core roles of the medical staff is to conduct medical checks for all newly admitted inmates. This is to ensure that newly admitted inmates are not suffering from any illnesses and that they have not sustained any injuries prior to their admission. This allows the medical staff to address the medical needs of newly admitted inmates. Medical check-ups are also conducted for those who are about to be released under any of the early release schemes as well as for those who are being released for full discharge. The Allocation and Classification Board is already in place. The practice is that the Supervisor of the Division closest to Headquarters sits on the Board to ensure that there are no delays in the work of the Board due to the geographical location of the centres. That addresses the issue raised by the honourable Bulitavu why the Supervisor in the Northern and Western Divisions do not sit in the Classification Board. While the Bill amends to align the current practices, there will be room to create new policies after the holistic review of the Act is complete and the appointment of the new Commissioner is just at the right time. There has been consultation with the team from the Fiji Corrections Service and with the Office of the Solicitor-General. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not go into the clauses of the Bill as I had touched on it on Monday, I hope that my colleagues on the other side, they did it in the last session where they spoke highly of the changes that are needed in the Fiji Corrections Service. It is only the right thing to support the Bill. MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, before I offer the floor, I have a list given by the honourable Whips, as follows: 1. Hon. M. D. Bulitavu; 2. Hon. Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; 3. Hon. Ioane Naivalurua; and 4. Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be brief. This side of Parliament fully supports the Bill that is before Parliament because it will include a few necessary amendments, that is, the Mandela Rules, Bangkok Rules and also the Tokyo Rules in terms of non-custodial sentences. For the Bangkok Rules, especially for the treatment of women prisoners because we have heard incidents in the past where women have been locked up with men in some of our receiving centers, especially the ones in Labasa and there are some incidences that happened in the past. In terms of the Nelson Mandela Rules which is also on the treatment and the humane treatment of prisoners. Moving forward, we have got a special clause (clause 6) in terms of where officers who do not report back or to notify their senior officers for seven days, they are deemed to have resigned. There are many cases of Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL) regarding prison officers, given the lack of pay plus hoping that a job evaluation exercise comes in faster to prevent all those AWOLS and all those welfare for Corrections Officers. Moving forward, in clause 9 in terms of medical examination, I think this is a timely intervention through this particular legislation, given all prisoners will now go through medical check-ups once they are brought in at the Corrections Centre. This medical check-ups will help</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 873 determine what kind of meal classes they have, whether it is “c” scale, “d” scale or “s” scale meals that they have given the medical conditions that they have. In addition, on the central allocation and classification board, there is also time being given. In the current practice was through the Commissioner’s orders, honourable Naivaluarua might like to talk about that, they have a big list of composition officers who are part of that but this has been streamlined and will help in the classification of prisoners and allocating them in suitable prisons because they are located in Suva, the West and in Labasa. They will only receive prisoners once all the records come to this particular Board and they will then classify them through the crimes that they have committed. Those who have committed rape or sexual offences will be held in a separate prison away from the others who have offended other offences. Clause 15, in terms of having a psychological report, it is timely given the long process that is there for those prisoners who have come through special stage, when they want to apply for community work and also placement for paid employment. This will actually quicken the the rehabilitation process that is currently there. Introduction of psychologists, to determine whether a particular prisoner is fit and healthy to do further education and also to work outside, that is timing and also welcomed. The other thing honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Corrections is the inclusion of the Parole Board, probably you can look into the remittance of our convicts that are held in the various centres. That is all Sir, this side of Parliament supports the Bill that is before Parliament. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to stand in support of the Bill that has been explained this afternoon to us by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. I think we all understand, Sir, that part of our consideration here in this Parliament, we make laws, we change them, we amend and repeal is that once we identify that there are some regime of laws that need some changes, when we effect change, we ensure that the language of that amendment that we bring in is simple, and is readable and understandable by the general public. Part of it also I think is when we look at this Bill, it is seeking to ensure that there is alignment and correct alignment of terminology and references which explains part of the cosmetic changes that this Bill seeks to introduce but more importantly, I think which is found in the beginning of the Bill is that it is seeking to be constitutionally compliant which brings me to the point where the honourable Bulitavu had spoken about the three rules which we are seeking in this Bill to bring into the framework of the Prisons law - the Mandela Rules, the Tokyo Rules as well as the Bangkok Rules. These are all conventions that seek to establish minimum standards of how prison and prison’s administration are supposed to be administered while also at the same time ensuring both the safety of those that are administering the prison system as well as those who are in the prison system, the prisoners themselves. In relation to the Bangkok Rules, one of the things that we probably would want to highlight is that, what I would mean is the adoption of the 70 rules that relates to the safe management of women prisoners. This is something that I think is worthwhile in reading up on the text because it would provide the necessary framework, that would allow all of us to see that women prisoners would go into prison and serve their time, the offenders would come back and get rehabilitated back into society. The last rule, of course, is ensuring that there are minimum standards that are observed for non-custodial prisoners, and I think this is important because when we are looking at that aspect Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>874 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 One of the things that we realise in our history and not just here, I think it applies everywhere else in the Commonwealth is that there is always a high degree and a high rate of recividism. People who go to prison, they do not get rehabilitated properly, they come back into society, they find the environment quite new, very enticing to commit any other forms of crimes, they commit it, they go back to prison and in 10 years you find a rap sheet of people who have many many offendingsthroughout their lives. I think when we look at rehabilitation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key things that rehabilitation programmes in our corrections and prison service is supposed to is to ensure that, that prisoner does not go back to prison ever again. So, these special measures, these minimum standards, I think when they are brought into the framework of our prison’s department is going to help the prisons officers and those who administer deal with high recidivism and ensure that they no longer become part of those statistics. So, the Bill that is presently before the Parliament this afternoon seeks exactly to do that, observe the constitutional requirement for compliance and at the same time home-in on those rules where we can operationalise or the prisons department can operationalise the requirements of those rules so that we can have very good rehabilitation system, that can allow for prisoners to come into prison, serve their time and come back a changed man or woman. I stand in this Parliament this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again thanking the honourable Bulitavu for coming in support of the Bill and I am sure that the honourable Naivalurua, who is a former Commissioner of Prisons would also see the good that this Bill will bring into Parliament and ultimately be part of our laws in Fiji. I am in support of the Bill, Mr. Speaker. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Corrections Service is one of those closely scrutinized and monitored organisations as it should be because of the nature of the work. But, before I continue, I join the honourable Attorney-General in congratulating the new Commissioner of Corrections, Dr. Jalesi Nakarawa, and if I may wish to add on to his profile, he is also someone from up Flagstaff - ex-Marist. I just wanted to place that on record, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Also, I thank the officers - men and women, who have toiled hard at the front line, I am referring to their work as work in the frontline. It is not only stressful, quite demanding and sometimes demoralising on some situations. I also at this juncture wish to convey my appreciation to the Acting Commissioner, Salote Panapasa, for holding on to the fort before the appointment of the new Commissioner. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2006, the principal Act was enacted, and it has taken the Corrections 18 years to where we are today. It has transformed the organisation into a better organisation, a more effective, more efficient and an organisation that now fully understands its primary function and role. I had the blessings to be there in the time it was enacted, and I can look back with pride in what this Act has done. Like any other Act for that matter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the situation changes, the environment changes, it needs to be reviewed, adjusted and amended, so therefore, the 18 clauses that has been presented by the honourable Attorney-General, I have examined and scrutinised it in line with the Act and I believe, it is a good amendment, a good change that will improve the operation of the organisation not only in terms of its focus but above all, its ability to deliver back to society, a product that is those that had been incarcerated in corrections to be a better person, to re-join their families and loved ones.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 875 That is important aspect, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the role and function of a Corrections service. The ability to care, look after, treat and handover again to society a better person. That in essence is the role and function of the Corrections Service. As I examined the clauses that needs to be changed, I commend the honourable Attorney-General and his team, especially in the area of allocation and the classification. This is an important aspect of corrections. They need to be what I call “carefully and correctly diagnosed” simply meaning that we need to find out the reasons why they are there. Some of them are deeply rooted and some of them are very difficult to understand why they are there when we find out what has caused them to commit that particular offence, then we are challenged with the ability of finding out the right treatment for this offender. Then we are able to allocate them for the place where they can be cared for whether it is in the maximum, the medium, minimum and so forth. This is a very important part of the work of the hierarchy in Corrections. I wish to highlight that this is a good part of the amendment that has been done by the review team. I also commend the work which has always been a big administrative headache for leadership in Corrections. Those that disappear and we never see them again and is now included here in this particular Act, so thank you. The other one that I wanted to mention too, is the focus on the health care of inmates which is outlined in section 26, clearly articulated that everyone needs to be medically examined as you come in or also when you leave. I thank the work that has been done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a great work. It is timely and I think with this amendment here, it will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation to be a robust, focussed organisation that can deliver service back to the community. Looking forward, I would ask, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that on the second review, we go beyond Standing Order 51 and we fully scrutinize the next review of this particular Act. I fully support the amendment to the Act. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to hold us any longer than we need to. First of all, may I thank the outgoing Acting Commissioner Ms. Panapasa for the work that she has done all this while and also congratulate the new Commissioner. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members who had spoken before me including the honourable Attorney-General the former Magistrate, former Commissioner of Corrections, honourable Mosese Bulitavu both as Counsel and also college graduate and also honourable Vosarogo are more qualified than I who only for a very short-time was a Permanent Secretary for Justice during the time when the honourable Naivalurua was the Commissioner for Corrections. In a small way, I had a very small contribution to what is being proposed in Parliament today. They said almost everything that needs to be said about supporting this Bill and I support this Bill strongly. My argument for it is this Bill makes the inmates more human in that sense. For those of us that may never been inside either as inmate or Corrections Officer, perhaps fail to understand exactly the space that has often been referred to in a very negative fashion by members of society, so it is the outcasts of society that go there. It is always a challenge to try and create an environment that makes them or gives them the freedom to become more human than less the freedom, to enjoy the freedom at least to a certain degree than they would be enjoying inside. So many of the proposals here especially the mentions of the different Conventions, the Constitution in terms of their rights. These are important for us as Members of Parliament, not only us, but the members of our community to reflect on this and especially when the outcome, …</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>876 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 most of the Members here have spoken about, the important part is when they come out. What they make of their life when they come out? This Bill, I think in a special way helps them to make them better people and makes them productive members of society when they come out. I think there are many, many successful stories that attest to that. So, in that regard, I support essentially the proposal of this Bill as has been already moved in Parliament and also the sentiments that have been spoken by the Members who have spoken before me. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity and I support the Bill. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to thank each and every Member who have spoken. It is a good demonstration when the people of Fiji see that Members of Parliament really do care about members of the society, vulnerable, who sometimes not of their own choice but for circumstances do end up in prison that they are still cared for. This is one of the milestone achievements of the Acting Commissioner, Ms. Panapasa. There was a handing over ceremony yesterday, I salute her and the direction was given to complete this project and with the incoming new Commissioner, we hope to have a holistic review of the Fiji Corrections Service. MR. CHAIRMAN.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [A Bill for an Act to amend the Corrections Service Act 2006 (Bill No. 02/2024 enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No……… of 2024)]</p></body>
