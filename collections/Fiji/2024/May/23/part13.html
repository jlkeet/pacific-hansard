C BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Adaptive Social Protection Strategy and its Implementation Plan. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The Adaptive Social Protection (ASP) Strategy and its implementation plan was endorsed by Cabinet in April 2024. The ASP Strategy and the implementation plan aims to assist Government of Fiji to enhance its existing social protection mechanism so that it can offer rapid and timely assistance to poor and vulnerable households particularly to cope with the negative impact of crisis. The genesis of this strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strategy from 5- Years strategy (2024 to 2029) stems from the measures that were undertaken during COVID, US$100 million (almost FJ$200 million) through the World Bank, about $42 million from DFAT and others made up the volume of social protection support that many households and families received during COVID. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since then the Government in 2022, and obviously from last year, we have been working closely with development partners and local partners to ensure that the strategy is put in place to mitigate the impact of shocks such as natural disasters, economic crisis, including those that may arise from health emergencies. Under the Social Protection Response System Development Project, the World Bank provided technical and financial support to various activities including the design of the strategy that we now have which was approved by Cabinet and again the financing from the World Bank was secured during COVID and that is being built on for another five years. The total funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is expected to be part of the three approaches, particularly the two approaches will amount to about $294 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ASP Strategy Plan was developed under the review of a Project Steering Committee led by the Ministry of Finance, together with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection as the key implementing agency. The approach to formulating the strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was based on extensive stakeholder engagement. There were 11 thematic workshops with a total of 229 participants from Government agencies, civil society organisations, development partners, field consultations at national, divisional, provincial, district and community levels were conducted with another 300 participants.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>840</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main idea behind this strategy is to expand particularly in approach one to expand social assistance benefits and to reach disaster hit communities. The important issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the strategy is to look at how the country is prepared to address the most vulnerable who get affected the most during disasters. The honourable Leader of the Opposition was talking about poverty, we can argue about the revised poverty rate from 28 percent to 24 percent. But the fact is, honourable Leader of the Opposition that the large percentage, in fact two-thirds of those leaving below the poverty line are usually in the rural areas, and when disasters, particularly natural disasters such as droughts, floods, cyclones hit these areas, these are the people who are affected the most and are the most vulnerable. Therefore, the strategy really is to ensure that these groups of people are addressed first. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, there are five priority action areas and I do not want to get into the details of those specific priority areas, but the strategy is a public document, it is available for everyone to see and look at what is there. The point I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the impact of climate change as we all know, Fiji is ranked 15th globally in terms of disaster risk and more and more what we have seen in the last 10 years, it was part of the world in the Pacific, including Fiji. We hope and pray for six months and probably more than six months now that we do not get hit by a devastating flood or cyclone or other forms of disaster, temperatures, patterns of heavy rain fall have both increased over the past five decades in Fiji. Climate change has increasingly affected much of the country, including rising seas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and saltwater intrusion we have seen in many villages and coastal communities and the excessive heat and the damaged crops and natural resources are also adding to the vulnerability of those in that category where this particular strategy in the National Adaptation Social Protection Strategy and Implementation Plan is directed between 2024 to 2029. The honourable Leader of the Opposition was saying the other day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the important thing is about implementation. We have got the strategy, we have got these priority areas, we have got the action plans, how it is implemented at times of disasters and before disasters, the preparedness will ensure whether this adaptive strategy is going to be effective or not. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister for your response. My understanding about social protection is, they are founded on certain principles. One of them is the equality and non-discrimination. How do you ensure these principles are reflected in the implementation plan right throughout because you are saying that the big challenge now is getting the implementation done. The question is, how will you ensure that these key principles of equality and non-discrimination will be part of this plan from the first to the final stage? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- I do not know what you exactly mean, but it is assumed that any of those plans or action plans that are there with respect to addressing fundamentally those who would be affected by disasters, there is no room for discrimination. When you are looking at those who are affected in a particular area, if there is a coastal inundation, saltwater intrusion during a certain weather pattern and groups and communities are affected, the strategy is very clear that those vulnerable groups will be provided with the support that they would need. I do not expect and there should never be allowed any form of discrimination in the provision of those protection services, whether it is through cash transfer or to provide support to build infrastructure. It should be on the principle of non-discrimination.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>841 Progress of EFL Extension Grid (Question No. 79/2024) HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the progress of the EFL extension grid to Soa Village, Matuku Village, Wailailai in Bucalevu, Nakorotubu, Ra? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the projects in question, Wailailai is completed, Bucalevu is still in progress while Soa and Matuku are yet to start. The total cost of Wailailai Settlement is $98,000, benefitting 13 households. For Bucalevu Village, grid extension works is completed, and house wiring is planned to commence next month. The total project cost is $170,000 that will benefit 15 households. For Soa and Matuku Villages in Ra, the Ministry, through the Department of Energy is processing the final 50 percent payment to Energy Fiji Limited for grid extension works. The total cost of the project is $713,000, which is planned to commence in August this year. The project is envisaged to benefit a total of 152 customers. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, some communities, like Uluisavudua in Sawani, Naitasiri, and those living in the villages of Natua, Vunidamoli, Laucala and Naiqaqi in Wailevu West, Cakaudrove have also been waiting. Is this the same programme that they come under or is there another programme because they have been waiting since September last year where they were told that the grid will be extended too. Again, this year, the same story. I just want to know whether it is the same programme so that people know while they are waiting for confirmation from the Department of Energy? (Honourable Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, when the honourable Minister has given his reply, then you may rise to ask your supplementary question. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a totally new question because right now, we are at the Wainibuka River and I do not know why you brought up those areas which are not around there. There is a limited budget but all those requests … (Hon. K. K. Lal interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- Could we let the honourable Minister reply? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The requests are there, I am not sure about the status of it. Definitely, as a Government which is concerned about social development, social equity and development for all rather than specific which are targeted towards your voters, it is all there, we will follow up on that. You can contact me separately and I will follow up on that. The extension of the grid is very costly. Normally we will look at the number of households and beneficiaries so there are some cost benefit analysis. We cannot extend it if it costs half a million and there are just three houses there. That is the kind of consideration that needs to be considered. The other one is the limited budget, but we are working with development partners through UNDP and also KOICA to expand the Rural Electrification Fund.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>842</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for what has been mentioned about Wailailai in Bucalevu, Ra. He has not been mentioned about the EFL Extension Grid in Bucalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- There is another Wailailai in Wailoku. HON. T. R. MATASAWALEVU.- This Wailailai is in Bucalevu in Ra. Nothing has been done to the EFL Extension Grid right now. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, the honourable Member is referring to Wailailai in Wainibuka. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, I will look into that and get back to you on that information. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, still on grid extension because there are certain names mentioned and there are some more. This was just a claim when I tried to get Dakunimoto in Tabia connected. Some people claim as soon as NFP comes into the picture, they will have it done in year’s time. Sir, it is one year and six months. Just a clarification, when are those people going to get their houses connected to the grid extension? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I mean that is also a concern when I came in, the length of waiting time. I have asked the Director of Energy to review it and as I mentioned, budget is not a problem but is limited. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Our people are waiting, when we come back in 2027 then we will connect it. MR. SPEAKER.- We can just let them wait until 2027. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The Rural Electrification Fund needs to be expanded. So, that is why we are working with other development partners to look into expanding that; not only for the grid but also renewable energy. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has mentioned twice limited budget and the honourable Minister for Finance has said he has got money. I thank the honourable Minister for his answers. It is good that you understand now that grid extension is very costly because when you were on this side and we were on that side, you would ask the same question. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Who was that side? HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some households along King’s Road, the wires are already there since 2023 but not being connected to the grid and they were already being funded.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was still right from Baulevu:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- You listen. Funds have already been provided for the projects but they are not linking to the grid:</span> Can you tell honourable Minister when will that be done? MR. SPEAKER.- Are you asking the honourable Minister or you engaging in other….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- Honourable Minister:</span></p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>843 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- First of all, thank you honourable Member, he should refrain from pointing. I do not know whether it is hypertension or something because he keeps jumping up and pointing. The second point is, he was the Assistant Minister for the Ministry. He knows all the details and those delays were from your time. I am just there to catch up on the work left by the former honourable Minister and his Assistant Minister, but I thank him. We were in the Economic Affairs Committee, so we were cooperating really well and I thank him for his question. He was the Chairman of that Committee and in every report we always support him. Going back to the electrification, we went to Nasau Village in Ra, there was a whole lot of lamp posts and wires, et cetera, sitting there and we asked them as to why those were sitting there? They replied, “That is from the FijiFirst Government time and just before the elections, they diverted the contractors to the supporters.” That is something we will need to rectify as we move forward. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! Plans to Improve Workers Compensation System (Question No. 80/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on plans to improve the workers compensation system in order to deliver better social justice to the workers in Fiji?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir and I thank the honourable Kiran for her question.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would just like to update this august Parliament on the proposal to transfer cases from Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji (ACCF) to the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations as endorsed by the Interim ACCF Board. The purpose is to expedite the processing and pay out compensation in a timely manner, as well as making it cost effective. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the recent deaths that have occurred during and in the cause of employment until 31 st December, 2018 are investigated by my Ministry under the Workmen’s Compensation Act which is a faulty-based system. To determine the cause of injuries and deaths upon completion of investigations, reports are submitted to trained medical assessors for their expert opinion, assessment to determine the status of each case. Once a medical report is received and the percentage of disability is awarded to the workers, or medical opinion stated that the death was work related, then the Ministry calculates the compensation amount and forwards it to the employers for the payment of compensation to the workers concerned or the dependants as the deceased to workers. This is for all cases that had occurred prior to 2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the financial year 2022-2023, my Ministry has successfully settled 208 cases, consisting of 172 injuries and 36 death cases. For the current financial year, as of 30 th April, 2024, a total of 109 cases, 91 injuries and 18 death cases had been settled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the five key players in the administration of the Workmen’s Compensation Act are: 1. Employers: 2. Workers; 3. Medical practitioners;</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>844</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 4. Employment Relations Tribunal; and 5. Ministry of Employment. While the Ministry is tasked to investigate the injuries and deaths that occur and affect the workers, a professional opinion of the medical assessor is vital in determining our outcome - the outcome of any compensation case. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as at 30 th April, 2024, the Ministry had 305 pending cases of which 230 are injury cases and 75 are death cases. The Ministry is endeavoring to make sure that all these cases are disposed off by 31 st December, 2024. Majority of them, of course are with the Employment Relations Tribunal and some are those that we are still trying to locate the victims. Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to this, the Ministry has currently engaged, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders to transfer the cases from the ACCF to the Ministry. These are the cases currently handled by the ACCF under the No Fault Scheme from 1 st January, 2019. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has been the enforcement arm of ACCF regarding employment accidents, since its establishment in 2019. The ACCF was established in 2019. My Ministry has been assisting ACCF with investigation of cases, dealing with complaints on non-payment of wages of injured workers and conducting meetings with employers on reporting of cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, my Ministry has the entire machinery to deal with worker’s compensation cases where the staff have undergone relevant training and standard operating procedures are in place to deal with these cases effectively and expeditiously. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposal to transfer the processing of the employment and school accident was submitted to Cabinet and the decision is pending as further consultation is required for Cabinet’s consideration. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to inform this august Parliament that the interim ACCF Board has been approved by Cabinet and my Permanent Secretary has been appointed the interim Chairperson. The Interim Board Members have been tasked to conduct an independent review of the Commission that had the first meeting on 19 th April, 2024. Sir, I am happy to report that 264 pending cases have been approved for payment by the interim Board. This comprises of 131 employment cases,115 motor vehicle accident cases and 18 cases of school accidents. These pending cases on ACCF have been resolved by the interim Board and payment of $1,237,500 have been made to those that qualify under the No Fault Scheme, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, you have pointed out what the Ministry of Employment is actually going to take over with respect to ACCF. Is it correct that you are obviously looking at dis-establishing the entire ACCF and functions with respect employment and schools will go to you and the rest will go to the LTA? Whilst on the topic, Sir, do you not think that it would be a conflict of interest for the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment to be sitting as the Chair of the ACCF currently? HON. A. D. SINGH.- The Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Employment is the Chair and that appointment was made by the Office of the Attorney-General which is the appointing authority. MR. SPEAKER.- I think he has answered your question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Half of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>845 MR. SPEAKER.- What? Should be one question only. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first one was the question that this is heading towards the complete dis-establishment of the ACCF. MR. SPEAKER.- You want to reply to that, honourable Minister? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my apology. Can the question be repeated? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir. Is it correct, honourable Minister, that in light of what you have actually advised Parliament now that the proposal is that the ACCF be completely dis- established and the functions with respect to the education and employment will go to the Ministry of Employment and the rest will go to LTA? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not the case. The ACCF is there. The Accident Compensation and the school accidents are being passed onto us. The Interim Board is going to look at the entire process, the consultation with the Ministry of Works is still ongoing in terms of how LTA cases are going to be handled. As it is, LTA still stays with ACCF. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Alvick Maharaj, your supplementary question? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification. When the ACCF came into the picture, all the cases were supposed to be referred to ACCF under the no fault policy. Does the Board have the powers to reverse these cases back to Workmen’s Compensation, because I think the ACCF Act has not been amended by Parliament. So the cases are referred to ACCF according to the Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before the cases are referred to the Workmen’s Compensation with the Ministry of Employment, the Act needs to be changed, because I do not believe the Board has those powers because it will be an issue if it is done without amending the law. At the moment, they should be compensated at no fault policy, that is why it is being referred to ACCF. MR. SPEAKER.- You are asking, does the Board have the powers?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Yes, according to the Act.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the powers of the Board under the Act are as follows: 1. To assist ACCF in the assessment of the current and pending applications for compensation with the Commission. 2. Approve an application for compensation after reviewing all relevant information. 3. Prescribe the amount of compensation payable to personal injury or death under the no fault compensation scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as stipulated under section 11(1) of the ACCF Act and I quote: “The Commission may in writing, either generally or particularly, delegate any of its powers, authority, duties and functions to its officers, employees, agents or consultants as it thinks fit.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Interim ACCF Board is an independent Board, had its first meeting on 19 th April, 2024 and made the following decisions: 1. Non-renewal of the ACCF CEO’s contract which had expired in January.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>846</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 2. Appointment of the interim officer in charge to oversee daily operations of the ACCF. 3. Appointment of interim ACCF Secretariat. 4. Appointment of interim Chair (already there) to clear all cases pending with ACCF. 5. Review the renewal of LTA’s contract with ACCF - it remains with ACCF. 6. Non-renewal of Veritas Finance Private Limited claims agent for ACCF contracts and processing of employment and school accidents will be done by my Ministry. The Board has decided that Veritas, the company that had been contracted by ACCF for $900,000 a year to just process is not being engaged anymore. So we are going to save $900,000 a year for government because my Ministry has the full capacity to actually process those and then pass them back to ACCF for approval. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. I think that takes care of all your questions, honourable Maharaj. Does the Board have the powers? That has been fully explained by the honourable Minister which are the delegated authorities. (Hon. A. A. Maharaj interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- He is reading from the Act. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just quoting from what transpired in this Parliament when the Accident Compensation Commission Act was approved that once all the pending cases with the Workmen’s Compensation Team is done, all the clauses there in the law to govern that particular department would be repealed. They do not have the mandate of the Parliament at this point in time to continue with any new cases. That is why the ACCF was developed in the first place. So, the ACCF Board …. MR. SPEAKER.- We are talking about delegated authority here and I hope you understand, honourable Maharaj, you have been here for quite some time. That is the legislation, the empowerment that is now being read out by the honourable Minister and we will leave it at that. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important because we have had a lot of people come up to our office. Honourable Minister, can you explain exactly why claimants who have been completely processed still have not been paid, whether it be, I think there are claimants there from an education and employment perspective, they still have not been paid. I understand there may be some difficulties with the Board but now you are saying that there is a Board there but they have not been paid. Can you explain why they still have not been paid? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I wish to thank the honourable Member for the question. The pending cases were there from the beginning of 2022. There were around 1,000 cases pending then. When the Board took over, there were 1,447 cases. The Board has now, as I have alluded to earlier, done the first lot. There are 20 others that they are approving this week and the approval is continuing as processing is taking place. There is processing and there is approval by the Board. There are challenges, of course. One of the challenges is getting the services of trained doctors who actually assess impairment. Those are some of the challenges, otherwise since this interim Board has come in, they have sped up the actual processing. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the fact that when you set up your budget last year, you did not include the processing of these cases. I am wondering how are you funding this, or is your Ministry then being paid by the ACCF to do this?</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>847 HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my predecessor, honourable Usamate was also the Minister at one time. He knows very well that we have a Directorate -the Director of Occupational Health and Safety Board. There is a Board, a Director in the Ministry, and a full set of staff within the Ministry who were processing in the past, until ACCF was given birth to and it was hived away. We have the trained staff, we have SOPs, we have the ability and we have been doing three- quarter of the work anyway. It was just the processing and then Veritas. We have calculated and the cost is going to be reduced by 70 percent if we take over everything. Assistance to Cane Farmers - Land Lease Renewals (Question No. 81/2024) HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry update Parliament on how the Ministry plans to assist cane farmers obtain land lease renewals on leases that are expiring? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question by honourable Virendra Lal and thank him for this important question. We are all aware of the challenges faced by the sugar industry as we listened to the debate on the motion by the honourable Tubuna on Tuesday. One, of course, is related to the challenges in accessing good agricultural land including lease expiry and competing demand of land for the alternative use of sub-residential, commercial business developments and land needed by the landowning units themselves for daily use and support the maintenance as such. Completion for this land has been an impediment to cane production and in sugarcane fields. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the challenges we have been very supportive in improving the livelihoods of the sugarcane farmers to its service delivery and direct financial support to the farmers with grants and subsidies. Sir, one of the financial support is to the grant assistance for land acquisition and lease renewals to establish cane farms. Mr. Speaker, Sir, between 2018 and 2020, the Ministry spent a total of $1.52 million to assist 267 farmers inclusive of 46 female farmers for the payment of 100 percent of the lease renewal cost and purchase of new farms with a maximum grant of $10,000 per farmer. These farmers were also registered with cane planting grants and input subsidies to established farmers. In this financial year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $2 million has been allocated under the new farmers and lease renewal programme to assist with the payment of their lease renewals and purchase of farm costs. The Ministry is covering one-third on a maximum of $7,500, whichever is lower of the lease renewal cost on the purchase of farm. As of last week, we have received 163 applications and so far 95 farmers have signed the agreement with the Ministry to receive funding for the leases for the cane farmers. Majority of these farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were from Vanua Levu, mainly from Seaqaqa cane belt areas and have been assisted with a total of $0.4 million for the payment of lease renewable cost. The rest of the applications are being assessed by the Ministry and the farmers will be assisted before the end of this financial year.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>848</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 To add on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the cane is grown under leased land which has been leased from the iTaukei Land Trust Board. According to the information obtained from iTLTB, a total of 1,609 cane leases will be expiring between 2024 to 2031 both, in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. My Ministry, together with the industry stakeholders: the Fiji Sugar Corporation, Sugar Cane Growers Council, Sugar Cane Growers Fund have been working in close collaboration with iTLTB to assist both, the cane farmers and the landowners. These sugar industry institutions have established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with iTLTB to share useful information on the sugar industry and have been at the forefront to resolve the lease-related issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTLTB Chairman has been in consultation with the landowners and the cane farmers regarding these lease renewals for mutual benefit of both parties. Farmers are no longer required to wait for the lease to expire in five years, but they can start consultation within 10 years before it expires. This will bring confidence for the continuity of not only the farmers but the sugar industry as a whole. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have appointed the Chief Executive Officer of iTLTB on the Board of the Fiji Sugar Corporation, who will assist and better understand the needs of the sugar industry in terms of the land requirements firsthand. Mr. Nata will be able to discuss issues of the landowners and iTLTB directly with the FSC Board and management. In this way, Sir, we will be able to develop strategies with iTLTB and serve the needs of both the landowners, tenants and our sugarcane farmers as well. By understanding of the situation,both the cane farmers and landowners and the sugar industry, we can initiate better dialogue between both parties. We want to invite the landowners and young itaukei youth, including women to venture into sugarcane farming, a sector that is becoming favorable with the rise of world sugar price. There is no need to struggle in searching for sugarcane markets as the market is already established. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had informed this august Parliament that the sugar price is currently quite favorable and likely to remain positive in future years as we see the global trends, therefore, I also encourage our landowners to take this opportunity to venture into cane farming and make use of their land for income generation. And importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are ready to provide assistance to them through our grant-programmes to become cane farmers of tomorrow. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over 90 percent of iTLTB leases have been issued for 30 years and deemed short for investment in the agriculture sector, particularly, for growing of cane, which is a permanent crop. I am thankful that iTLTB has considered offering leases on a longer term as an option, especially for 50 years or 99-year lease term. This will give sufficient time for farmers to recoup returns for their investments. I am grateful that honourable Vasu had supported the issuing of leases on a longer-term lease for cane farming, and that benefits both the farmers and landowners and contributes to wider economic development, and I thank honourable Vasu for his vision. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government had also established a Task Force on renewals, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. In September 2023, the Task Force has submitted its report to the Cabinet with various solutions proposed. One of the key findings was the difficulties faced by both sugar and non-sugar farmers in paying their outstanding lease premiums.</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>849 Mr. Speaker, Sir, a request was made for the government to assist these farmers to allow them to continue farming. Based on Cabinet's approval, our Coalition Government has paid over $1.22m for 218 leases as payment for the outstanding lease premiums. Of these 218 leases, 42 leases were for cane farmers and this has supported them to increase cane production and enhance long-term sustainability of the industry. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this government and my Ministry is in full support of assisting cane farmers whose leases expired in previous years and we will continue to support others whose leases are about to expire in the near future. Consultations and dialogue are ongoing and have become better overtime. I fully trust that majority of the leases expiring will be renewed to allow farmers to carry on with sugarcane farming for the betterment of the sugarcane sector and livelihoods of nearly 20 percent of Fiji's population. Thank you, Sir. HON. V. LAL.- The honourable Minister is talking mostly about itaukei land. Sir, what about those farmers who are tenants of freehold landlords and their leases have expired? Why I am saying this, Sir, is because I come from Rakiraki where there is a big piece of freehold land and the tenant leases have expired and they are cane farmers. So, what happens in that case? MR. SPEAKER.- It is quite difficult to get freeholders because they are owners in perpetuating. You will get me, of those parcels of land under them. The authority rests with them, whether they want an extension or renewal. Then that can be conveyed to them but I think what the honourable is referring to is where the Government can interact easily because of them being kind of a cozy government, the iTaukei Land Trust Board. HON. V. LAL.- It is the then laws in fact are asking for substantial amount of premium and that is where the problem is because these farmers are unable to pay the premium so in that case, my question is, is the honourable Minister or is the government going to have those farmers as well? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give examples to the honourable Member. I was talking to this freehold owner, the late Mr. Uday Singh in Ba. His families are willing to give the land out to the farmers and they are trying to identify farmers who is going to come and work on the farm and motivate. So, it is a question between the negotiation of both parties, if they come to a figure and our formulas stands, honourable Member is that, about 30 percent was owned by the 500. That is the maximum ceiling we can give at this stage, but we are quite happy to deal with any landowners whether it be freehold or state land. MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps, further to that honourable Virendra Lal, that was the great thing about Agricultural Landlord and Tenants Act (ALTA). It took care of all tenancies whether it is within freehold, State land or what. The controlling law there was ALTA; ALTA kind of superseded the Native Land Trust Act. Your Government in the past, I do not know what they have done with ALTA, I really do not know what is the full effect of ALTA now. Maybe they have cushioned them down or watered it down, so that now affects tenants. They may be regarded as ALTA tenants because their predominant use is agricultural use. That is where ALTA comes and kicks in, but now we do not know. (Inaudible interjection) MR. SPEAKER.- It depends on the owner and the tenant. I hope I am answering that concern of yours. Maybe the honourable Attorney-General can explain what is the fate of ALTA now, is it still in existence or not? Sorry about that honourable Alvick.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>850</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. What was actually discussed yesterday with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. Let us per se if we had some sitting tenants who are actually cultivating sugar which is at the moment State freehold and during this process, while the lease is still there, it gets converted to iTaukei land. (Chorus of interjections) No, no, just listen to the question first. If that transpires and a premium has to be paid to iTLTB for a new lease under iTLTB, who actually pays for that? Will it be the farmers or will the Ministry of Sugar step in to help the farmers MR. SPEAKER.- That is why I was asking about the fate of ALTA. You know what the Labour Government used to say before, you have entrenched legislation for the Fijian interest, that is our entrenched legislation for the cane farmers and farmers alike under ALTA. This is the second time you have raised that issue, honourable Maharaj. It is up to you honourable Minister. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since honourable Alvick Maharaj stood up, you have</p><h4>helped me answering a lot of questions on that, so I leave it at that.</h4><p>(Laughter) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on ALTA if I remember correctly, it is still in existence but subject to review. The reason being, because of the situation that most of the leases expired from 1997; you fully understand that, Sir. There was an urgent need to renew the leases. That is why the Government then went into the Committee for Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL), but if you look at the first CBUL paper when Parliament is back on, we had to review ALTA. My question to the honourable Minister is, it seems that now two systems are running in parallel. You are still using CBUL as a mode of payment and you have just released the last payment and now it has brought up CBUL, the 4 percent subsidy to $101 million, but you still have another Land Committee. So, where does that leave the CBUL Taskforce that was established to look at the same issue - the renewal of leases? MR. SPEAKER.- Before you answer that, honourable Leader of the Opposition, the law is law. If ALTA overrides Native Land Trust Act, then automatically ALTA is the ruling one. But in this respect, as I have stated, I do not know, and you have answered that quite well now that it is still in existence. CBUL is not ALTA, let us be clear about that. With the expiry of leases that have gone through and nothing was done to them, then that means clearly those very important sections of ALTA has also been watered down because ALTA guarantees the protection of the interest of tenants, whether they be under Native Land, State Land or Freehold Land. Mr. Jai Ram Reddy used to have a lot of preceding cases on testing the power of ALTA, even poultry farming in Vitogo, that came under ALTA, but NLTB thought it was a special commercial intensive use. No, it fell under the ambit of ALTA because the courts decided in favour of Jai Ram Reddy’s plea. That is the full effect of this, honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is exactly my point. ALTA is in existence. From 1997, despite the existence of ALTA, the leases were not renewed. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Who was ruling in the past 16 years? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- No, that is not true!</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>851 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Oso! (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- It is difficult to explain this. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why the under the Chaudhry Government (Labour Government) started the resettlement. There was aMinistry of Sugar, Agriculture and Land Resettlement. That was why Navovo was established in Nadroga, Navudi was established in Dreketi, we have Raiwaqa, Vakabalea and Valelawa because of the non-renewal of leases. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ALTA was in existence, but it was the politics then that did not renew the leases. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- How many leases did you people renew? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- That is why CBUL was just formed to renew the leases with the top-up subsidy from the 6 percent UCV to 10 percent to entice the landowners to quicken the process of the renewal of leases. MR. SPEAKER.- But actually with CBUL coming in, it made ALTA redundant.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> No, I am telling you because I worked all my life in that particular organisation.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Let us look at the papers:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney:</span> General, you want to make some comments as well? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to enlighten Parliament, land under ALTA, when the lease expires, if you have any issue, you go to the tribunal. So, I cannot understand why leases were not renewed. There is a legal recourse there - the tribunal and still sits there. So ALTA still exists, there is a recourse for tenants. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will leave it at that, honourable Members. The key Minister to reply to this is the Minister for Sugar, but I have tried to come in to help, and now the honourable Attorney-General has fully explained that. The tribunal is still there. (Question No. 82/2024 withdrawn) Social Welfare Management Information System (Question No. 83/2024) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform Parliament as to how the $1million allocation in this financial year for the Social Welfare Management Information System has been utilised?</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>852</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. In late 2022, there was a partnership with the Australian Government and a flagship programme which is the Partnerships for Social Protection Programme (P4SP). We undertook the review of the six social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare, which you are aware of. Following that extensive consultation, in May 2023, there was a technical review report produced and then endorsed by Cabinet. Of course, that review had recommendations for changes that needed to happen. The following are some of the key achievements in the current budget year: 1. An increase of the monthly benefit amounts by the Coalition Government for all those six areas. 2. There was a conversion of the food voucher to cash to simplify the programme delivery and also in meeting the needs of the beneficiaries. 3. There was a reduction of voucher printing and transition to electronic payments with Post Fiji. 4. There was a review of the Standard Operating Procedures for all of the six social assistance schemes. 5. We obtained Cabinet approval on the shock responsive initiative, such as the adaptive social protection strategy, which honourable Professor Prasad just talked about. 6. There was design and development of an interim IT Management Solution. In addition, there are currently a few activities underway by the Ministry, and we are hoping that there will be progress in this regard: 1. A consideration of the possible conversion of the Bus Fare Assistance Scheme to cash for our pensioners and our disability beneficiaries. 2. We are looking at the revival (as I have talked about) of the Welfare Graduation Programme in terms of providing a sustainable pathway, which we are working with certain Ministries including the Ministry of Agriculture who talked about that in his Ministerial Statement this morning on how to alleviate poverty. We are identifying those from the Social Welfare Scheme or the Family Assistance Scheme to be graduated under that Programme in the Ministry of Agriculture. 3. We also need to review and update the proxy means test, the test for Family Assistance Scheme, engaging a Management Information System (MIS) firm to develop a comprehensive and strategic solution. One of the core recommendations, Mr. Speaker, of the technical review, as in your question, is the Integrated Beneficiary Management System. It is a more elaborate system for the social assistance schemes. This is being developed by the Ministry with the support of our development partners. It will establish integration with existing databases and information systems to be managed by Government and other external stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once it is established, it will be addressing the following three objectives: 1. improve efficiency, cost savings and sustainability through the sharing of resources; 2. enabling effective provision of the social protection services; and 3. improving transparency and accountability. However, while this solution represents an impressive achievement for Fiji, the technical review identified gaps in the areas of data management, the digitisation of the beneficiary data and data protection, which all needed priority attention.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>853 Some of the Ministry’s online systems crashed in the year 2020 and some processes were reverted back to manual although trying to transition to digital. Therefore, in 2024, we have to come up with an interim solution in order to digitise that information. Honourable Premila Kumar, is complaining. This is where the budget is going to the $1 million, which is the question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> You haven’t used the money.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is part of the interim solution to this point:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, the interim solution includes the utilising of this budget which we engaged USP students to come and assist the Ministry in the different Divisions to undertake the processing from manual to digital. Mr. Speaker, there has been significant support provided by DFAT, the Government of Australia in terms of the solutions. But, Mr. Speaker, in terms of the comprehensive solution, we do need to engage specialist roles which is the Principal MIS consultant, the Senior MIS Consultant, Developers, an IT Team Lead, Social Protection Specialist, Economists and Project Managers. Of course, this has been a great saving too for the Ministry because our development partners have come in to assist. That is the answer to your question, honourable Kumar, in terms of whether it is completely being used. It is essential, Mr. Speaker, to reserve sufficient funds, to ensure a thorough completion of this project. So, we have requested from the Ministry of Finance, whatever the balance that we have to transfer it into the new year so that we can continue to work with our development partners to be able to realise this. The simple answer is, Mr. Speaker, we could have utilised all of the $1 million in this current financial year but our development partners have come to the table, so we have shared this cost. So, we are asking for the balance to be transferred into the new year with our development partners to continue to work on this integrated comprehensive solution. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister needs to learn from honourable Deputy Prime Minister because he answered his question so well when he was talking about the Financial Management System. And when you compare her response to him, a similar question about a system, she went around – beating around the bush, telling us where, what happened, this and that, but the simple question is, honourable Minister, that you have actually not used the money for the system. You have used the money for other things but not to build the system. The money was allocated for the system. So, that is the question. Own up! HON. L. D. TABUYA.- I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I do not understand whether that was a question or a comment, but I do want to reiterate that the budget is being utilised in partnership with our development partners who have come to the table to work together. So, it has been partly used with our development partners because they are the ones that reviewed the system. The Government of Australia offered to the Ministry, so we have taken that funds with our funds working together and the balance of it to be transferred to next year to be used in partnership with the Government of Australia to continue to develop this and to complete this integrated system. (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I do want to say rather than commenting that way, the previous Government with honourable Kumar should really take credit because this started in their time. So, we are just carrying out what they have put together. So, I acknowledge the good work that</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>854</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 they have done, rather than attacking how the partnerships are working with our bilaterial partners to deliver to our people. HON, J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a simple question to the honourable Minister. When the budget was requested for $1 million allocation, it must have had a list of activities, projects and programmes that were associated with it. As we reach this point in time with the next budget around the corner, are we on track to receive 100 percent of all the things for which this money was allocated for? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- I believe I have answered that question. It has been partially utilised and we are requesting the Ministry of Finance that it goes into the next year. So, it is actually a bit of savings for us because of the support of the Government of Australia to come to the table to be able to contribute to the funding of this system. That is all it is. In terms of what they are commenting on that we have not utilised it, therefore, we are not delivering it, we are delivering. It is a partnership, and they should acknowledge that. We thank the Government of Australia for their partnership. Recognition of Indigenous Arts and Craft (Question No. 84/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the action taken to improve the recognition of indigenous arts and craft, and also the contemporary art? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to honourable Vanawalu’s question, and I thank the honourable Member for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s art sector has enormous potentials. Yet, over the years, it has been the most neglected. Our Ministry is focusing on delivering practical and impactful actions that will enhance this creative sector. As I speak our National Organising Committee based at the Fiji Arts Council is preparing a 100 member Fijian delegation made up of traditional and contemporary artists and artisans, to participate at the upcoming 13 th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture in Hawaii on 6th June to 16th June, 2024. At this Festival, our artists and artisans will achieve maximum exposure at the international stage, sell their works of art to international buyers and most importantly, learn from other artists and artisans in the region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for years, our artists have been looking for homes, a space where they are able to express themselves freely and collaborate with fellow Fijian artists. With Cabinet approval in 2023, we were able to secure the old St. Steven’s Building to be Fiji’s first National Art Galley - the new home for our artists and artisans. A National Task Force made up of skilled professionals and technical people in the areas of arts and heritage is now working on the gallery. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge our past leaders for establishing a national institution responsible for art in Fiji, the Fiji Arts Council. Established as a charitable trust with an annual grant received from Government, Fiji is the only Pacific Island country that has an arts council. The Fiji Arts Council continues to build on existing support for the development of indigenous and contemporary arts alike.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>855 In 2021, through the United Nations Informal Economies Recovery Project implemented by International Labour Organization (ILO) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) visual artists joined force to establish the Viti Association of Visual Artists (VAVA) with performing artists coming together and help create the Fiji Islands Dance Association (FIDA). This is in addition to the one of the existing and oldest art collectives in Fiji, the Performing Rights Association (FIPRA). Those collectives are working with the Fiji Arts Council to explore ways to increase opportunities for informal sector enterprises and workers to influence decision-making of Government and policy through a collective formalised voice. This also includes working towards improved access to social safety net and professional development for artists and artisans. In this regard, the Fiji Arts Council has, in the recent past, provided support letters for established art entrepreneurs to access grants and loans from credit facilities, like the Fiji Development Bank. A handful have succeeded. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that art is enjoyed by all, the Fiji Arts Council and its key partners organise community workshops on basic art skills, such as screen printing, masi making and visual arts programme for youth and children. The Fiji Arts Council works with the iTaukei Institution of Language and Culture to organise and implement indigenous art revitalisation, such as the tuli kuro workshop. The reviving of the Wea Fish Trap used by the people of Lasakau, Bau; the mahima (salt) making revival workshop in Nadroga, and many others. The Fiji Museum also work in collaboration with the Fiji Arts Council and other partners to ensure that its exhibitions programme display indigenous skills in heritage and art. In particular, the new Voyages Exhibition at the Fiji Museum has drawn attention, not only from locals, but international museums and visitors alike, with over 60,000 visitors visiting the Exhibition since its opening in December 2022. In 2023, the visiting Maori Contemporary Artists from New Zealand collaborated with the Fiji Museum and Fiji Arts Council to organise pottery and masi design workshops as part of a trail connecting our communities through these art pieces. Through partnerships with the Ministry of Women, we continue to support our women in the development of their craft and its sales during the National Women’s Expo. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Culture and the Fiji Arts Council organise ongoing business and entrepreneurship training for skilled artists and artisans, who would like to establish their own business. We are also working with the Ministry of Education to assist our master artists and artisans in allowing them to teach basic art lessons in schools. This complements the current move by the Ministry to ensure that indigenous skills and knowledge systems are embedded in our National Education Curriculum. Through the Department of Culture, we are currently engaging seven retired Curriculum Advisors and former teachers to map our existing curriculum and to gauge extent with which culture, heritage and arts issues are reflected in learning and teaching materials used in our schools. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the protections of our artists is crucial, to ensure proper safeguarding of the creative knowledge and innovation through the Ministry of Trade’s Fijian made initiative.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>856</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 The Fiji Art Council assesses works of art submitted by Fijians to ensure the highest of quality is produced before they are issued with a licence and branded ‘Fijian crafted’ sticker. This serves as an authentication mechanism for locally produced works of heritage and arts. Our current intellectual property regimes fall short of protecting our artists’ works, especially those that are community owned. In this regard, the pending Traditional Knowledge and Expression of Culture Bill will ensure that indigenous art forms with communal genesis can be protected. On the other hand, we are proposing in the new financial year to work with the Office of the Attorney-General, to undertake a feasibility study on the possibility of developing a specific legislation for art development in Fiji. To cover the works of the Fiji Arts Council and gaps that currently exist in relation to protection for our indigenous and contemporary artists and artisans alike. In as far as policy is concerned, Cabinet approved in May 2023, the adoption and implementation of the new Fiji National Cultural Policy. Priority 3 of the Policy emphasises the need to establish a national strategy for creative industries to - 1. strengthen the capacity and skills of cultural producers and practitioners; 2. improve the quality and diversity of cultural products and services; 3. increase the access and visibility of cultural products and services in local, regional, and international markets; 4. promote the recognition and protection of cultural rights and intellectual property of cultural producers and practitioners; and 5. foster collaboration and coordination among stakeholders in the cultural sector, including Government, private sector, civil society and development partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to support the arts and creative sector, as this can be a source of employment generation for our communities and our people. This will boost their livelihood and foster economic growth and wealth for the nation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.– Thank you, honourable Minister. That was quite a lengthy one. I would like to humbly ask, honourable Ministers, when you do your replies, please, have it concise, very short and sweet, otherwise its more or less a statement coming up. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the complementary facility or institute in our drive to preserve our arts is a national art gallery. Fiji does not have a national art gallery, but other countries have. Does the Ministry or the Government have plans to set up a national art gallery that will entice all these artisans to take their art there? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on my understanding from the Fiji Arts Council, the Gallery that we have now covers all ethnic groups and they provide assistance to all. But, today I was just briefing on the iTaukei side of the ars, but they assist all the ethnic groups in Fiji. If you go there during the display, you can see all the ethnicities, all Fijians are there. If there is a need to do a national art gallery, then we are looking forward to look into it. MR. SPEAKER.- I thought in your explanation that you have converted the St. Stevens Building, the old Grammar School Hostel, into that particular place, Arts Council now. That is the question that honourable Naupoto raised. We earmarked that when we were organising the</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>857 Melanesian Arts Festival some years back. He was very much involved in organising that. We were even looking at the old St. Stevens Building. It is a potential area, but then it was housing the Government ICT. But now, they have converted that into a Gallery. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question relates to the protection of our indigenous art and craft and also contemporary art. I know you have mentioned that you will shortly be having negotiations with the Attorney-General Chambers. I am assuming that my question relates to your looking at trademark protection and copyright protection, which is something that has been done by New Zealand, Canada and some other countries really well. Are you also looking at basically authenticity, because in the world without any borders, there is a particular area where authenticity marks, which may be done through the Ministry of Trade, et cetera, on how they do the Fijian organic products, but will you be looking at authenticity marks also with respect to our art and craft in order to protect our indigenous art and craft? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as for now, as I have stated in my brief, all art and craft that will be going in for trade and branded as Fiji made, has come through the Fiji Arts Council whereby they look at it, make sure the quality and everything is in line. But we are still working with the Office of the Solicitor-General with regard to how we can protect all those areas. MR. SPEAKER.- It is, perhaps, just a suggestion. It works both ways. You either have the law to safeguard that, or the people who make to ensure it will not end up like a sword from Suvavou being given out to the tourists because that is not genuine. So, what we would like to see is, it is the people that do that themselves. They have an appreciation that what I am doing is genuine. That is the question that was being raised.</p></body>
