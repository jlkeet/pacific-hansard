<body><h3>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024</h3><h4>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 (Bill No. 05/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill at a sitting of Parliament in August; and (e) Upon presentation of the report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must be debated and voted by Parliament, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, today has been almost 12 years in the making. It is my privilege to introduce to Parliament a life changing Bill for the wellbeing of Fijian families today and for generations to come. I acknowledge the political will of the previous Government to bring this law. I thank the former Prime Minister, as well as my predecessors, including the late honourable Jiko Luveni, for the hard work that was rendered to this historic Bill to finally make its way to Parliament today. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 has waited years for us to reach this point in our human rights evolution. It embodies our commitment to the protection of our children under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a Convention that Fiji signed in 1993. This Bill commits us to protecting and supporting all Fijian children, but especially those deprived of parental care and those who cannot remain with their families because of abuse or neglect. It is a vital plan in our Government’s overall mission and strategy to free the children of this country from abuse and neglect and addressing why people perpetrate abuse in the first place. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this point, I look forward to sharing our plans in terms of bringing a national plan of action to eliminate violence against children in the months to come. But right now, this Bill heralds a new beginning for our children and for generations of Fijian families to come. Why is this Bill so important? There is one statistic that encapsulates its importance. Five out of every six children in Fiji face some form of abuse or neglect by their families. It is difficult to read that statistic aloud. The thought of being one of those children, Mr. Speaker, is truly unimaginable. But this shocking statistic illustrates the extent of child abuse and neglect in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, every one of these children carries a story of lasting hurt and trauma that will impact their adult lives. If we do not act urgently, we risk a deeply traumatized generation where cycles of abuse will continue across their offspring and their offspring’s offspring.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>866 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 If this statistic is not a call to action for our nation, then I do not know what is, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Children are precious gifts from God. It is our duty as a people and Members of Parliament to protect and support them to thrive, especially our most vulnerable children. Ultimately, it is our children who will take this country forward after we are long gone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill represents the Government’s response to that call to action. Therefore, we refer this Bill to be moved under Standing Order 51, not just because of our commitments under the Human Rights Convention, but because we want to bring to life children’s rights, their development and their wellbeing. We want to give all of our Fiji’s children the best future they can possibly imagine. This Bill is so urgently needed because our current system of child protection, Mr. Speaker, is based on an outdated philosophy of rescue and removal developed over 50 years ago. In that time, the world and knowledge about what works to recover children and families has changed drastically. We know this approach has become more and more outdated because it ignores the importance of children’s holistic development within their own families and communities. Indeed, it ignores the harm of depriving a child of their broader families’ nurture and the importance of their community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nation’s Committee that monitors the Child Rights Convention has pointed out that the number of residential homes and children coming into residential care in Fiji just keeps increasing over the years. Most children find themselves in residential care because they have been neglected or abused by families. These children spend very long periods of time in residential care with no love of family or their community. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot let this continue. That is why the Child Care and Protection Bill prioritises family preservation and family-based forms of care. It explicitly acknowledges and reinforces the key role of parents, families and communities in raising children and protecting them from harm. It also clearly presents the distinction between children in need of care and protection and children in conflict with the law. Importantly, under the current child protection laws, the Government can only intervene once a child has been abused, and we know this is far too late. Success only comes when you can prevent or intervene early. This new Bill encompasses prevention, early intervention and response services. Options for voluntary care plans can be negotiated with the child’s parents where court orders are used as a last resort when agreements cannot be reached. The child, the parents, the extended family, traditional community leaders, can be actively involved with care planning. Priority is given to kinship and family-based care. Prevention and early intervention has to be the new talk that we walk. That will be the key to breaking cycles of abuse that are afflicted upon 83 percent of our children. Mr. Speaker, Sir, without this new law, we will continue to have a child protection system that, at its best, can only be the proverbial ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. The ambulance will continue to desperately try and reach as many children once they have already been abused, but have no ability to intervene with the family, stopping this from occurring. We need to get up there on the cliff, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and stop the abuse and neglect from being perpetuated by families against children. We need to support communities to prevent violence in their families and to be the broad network of support for a child’s recovery from trauma. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, some may think that this Bill is only about children but let me assure you that this Bill does not serve the human rights of Children alone. The</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 867 world’s largest study on childhood adversity shows that adults who experience abuse, neglect and trauma as children, were far more likely to suffer long-term intellectual, behavioral and physical, and mental health problems. This Bill is about the health of our entire society and our nation. This Bills put us well on the way to improving the physical and mental health of generations of Fijians to come. But this is not all that the Bill ultimately achieves for Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. If we support our families and communities to stop abusing and neglecting children, we will also see a safer Fiji. Child abuse and neglect does untold damage to a child and their development. The psychological harm, the lack of love and the lack of a home leave many children vulnerable to conflict with the criminal justice system, and this continues well into adulthood. That is why, Mr. Speaker, this very Bill will set the foundations for the changes our country so desperately needs when it comes to children in conflict with the law. It will set the platform to realise the aspirations of the Child Justice Bill 2024, should it be passed. But it should also ultimately reduce the number of adults in conflict with the law, many of whom have experienced such backgrounds as the context to their own offending. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking to make seismic change here, and this will require investment in our child protection workforce. This is why the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 provides for the upgrading of the Child Protection Services under the Department of the Social Welfare to a Department of Children with its own Director of Children, Assistant Director of Children and a complement of specialised Child Welfare Officers at the national and divisional level. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are confident that this Bill will respond to the long overdue call for change to reduce horrific levels of child abuse and neglect that are carried on in our community, and to truly ensure the children are treated like precious gifts from God. To make sure we got it right, we conducted extensive consultation on the Bill. These consultations engaged community members, the justice community, faith-based community, child rights organisations, CSOs and other Fijian Government agencies. We received wide support from the Bill, especially from our civil society organisations. We also know, Mr. Speaker, that this Bill sits at the forefront of child protection lawmaking around the world. It is based on research about what works for children and families. It finally moves us away from our outdated child protection laws to one that will be a shining light for the whole Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Gandhi once said, “The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.” Children are chief among our most vulnerable and are most treasured. This Bill changes the bar on how we shall be measured. I commend this Bill before Parliament under Standing Order 51, and I strongly urge honourable Members to support it. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise again to give a short contribution from this side of Parliament. Again, I thank the honourable Minister for tabling the Bill, and I also thank her for acknowledging the FijiFirst Government that had initially worked on this Bill and her predecessor. I think that is the way forward. We have nothing to say in the substance of the Bill, given the Bill will be referred to the Standing Committee for Justice, Law and Human Rights and we will have proper deliberations when it comes to the hearing of public submission, moving around holding discussions with the stakeholders and consultants and the terms of reference, plus sitting with the consultants and the drafters from the Office of the Solicitor-General.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>868 Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we probably might come up with some proposed amendments but that is too premature now for us to comment on. Again, I thank the honourable Minister for suggesting that in the premise of the motion, that we come back to Parliament in the August sitting. I hope that Parliament through you, Sir, with the Secretariat will facilitate that, given that we have Budget in July and also the Committees needs to sit and bring these two Bills. They are both quite thick Bills, the one moved earlier and this one. I think the Committees, we have a very short time to bring this and I hope that the cooperation from the Secretariat and the request from the Committees will be taken on board. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just upon me to thank all honourable Members of this Parliament for their indication that they support what is before Parliament and that it does go under Standing Order 51 to the Committees, and I wish the Committee all the very best in their deliberations. This has been consulted quite extensively and it has been 12 years, so hopefully they do not take 12 years more. I know they have a few months before them, and some very hard-working Members are in that Committee. We all look forward to the Report when we come back to Parliament. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 (Bill No. 05/2024) committed to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and to report back in the August sitting of Parliament]</p></body>
