<body><h3>METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES BILL 2024</h3><p>METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES BILL 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Tuesday 21 st May, 2024, I move: That the Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill (Bill No. 03/2024) be debated, voted upon and passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Just before you do so, Sir, first of all I would like to apologise for something that I mentioned that was highlighted by honourable Bala - it is one hour for each Bill. I said what was written on my script here, that is, one hour for the two Bills. That has now been corrected, one hour for one Bill. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of Opposition and esteemed Members of Parliament, I rise today to share my views and clarify the details of the Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 that is before this august Parliament that was introduced on Tuesday. This is a significant milestone in Fiji’s Government Framework. It marks the first ever attempt to create a comprehensive governing framework, to guide and empower the Department of Meteorological and Hydrological Services in the provision of its services. It is designed not only to regulate the provision of weather forecast, meteorological and hydrological services within Fiji but also to recognise and extend its influence and expertise throughout the region.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 877 The objectives of the Bill as already mentioned are multifaceted, recognise and empower the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services, empowers the Director of Meteorological Services to carry out his or her duties in the most effective manner in the practical provisions of weather forecast and recognise the many other services which are essential for the critical functions of Fiji’s Meteorological and Hydrological Services. The proposed Bill also provides the effective and efficient provision of Meteorological and Hydrological Services that contribute to a sustainable economic development, protection of life, and of course in the protection of hydrological property from meteorological and hydrological disasters which is a common occurrence in our region. Sir, it also encompasses the important contribution of the Fiji Meteorological Services towards the Nadi flight information region, as already mentioned especially with the Pacific region. It provides broadcast throughout the region. The Bill also recognises the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services leading role in the region by providing weather forecast and warnings to smaller island neighbouring countries such as Tuvalu, Niue, Kiribati, Cook Islands, Tokelau and Nauru, to name a few. I had mentioned the possibilities of public private engagement in the delivery of the services. This is an important element moving forward and it did encompass interaction and collaboration between entities from the public, private and business sector, as well as academia and civil society in the production and delivery of weather, climate hydrological marine and related environmental data, information and services which could be extended to those. Some examples of public/private engagements are as follows: 1. Private companies installing meteorological observing instruments in high rise buildings and exchanging meteorological data with the Meteorological Office. 2. Vessels being fitted with barometers, anemometers and meteorological data are then transmitted to the Meteorological Office at regular intervals. 3. Collaboration between research institutions and meteorological and hydrological services where meteorological data is supplied to research institutions who, in turn, analyse data, determine trends and publish scientific journals, such as the Intergovernmental Pannel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reports, et cetera. Sir, the proposed Bill also enables the issuance of impact days forecast which contributes to the broader Fiji Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems which also strengthens the linkages between Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services and the Natural Disaster Management Office. I have already stated that the regional specialised Meteorological Centre is one of the only six centres globally and this Bill assists in strengthening that. Its functions include the naming of tropical cyclones and related alerts and warnings. Sir, following the devastating flood of 2012 and recommendations of recognised international organizations, Cabinet had agreed that the sole mandated for issuing flood forecasting Fiji be moved from the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Water Authority of Fiji to be vested with the Fiji Meteorological Services. As a Coalition Government, we continue from that and to put through the legislation and regulations and, of course, to operationalise. Sir, the proposed Bill tends to mirror similar Acts that have been passed, for example, in Australia, Vanuatu, Seychelles and Tonga, to name a few. The Clauses of the Bill, we have already distributed that, so I will not go through each one but basically provide for the definitions, objectives and functions, and also what the services are</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>878 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 empowered to do. It also includes technical audit functions and what the Bill empowers individuals such as the Ministers, in terms of making regulations. One of the key elements in terms of not only the Meteorological Services but the scientific technical areas in the Ministry is the high turnover and this is something we are very concerned about. Since my short time there, there have been two or three acting directors and they have been recruited by regional organisations. We cannot compete with them, but there is room within this Bill, that maybe we could have some sort of MOU with them in terms of the message we could take to prevent that, or to have some sort of secondment from the Fiji Government to these regional organisations in order that we can manage some of the issues such as high turnover of very technical and experienced professional staff. Thank you, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and similar to the ones that we have gone over, I also have a list given by the Whips, and the batting will be as follows, the: 1. Hon. J. Usamate; 2. Hon. Attorney-General and Minister for Justice; 3. Hon. Leader of the Opposition; and 4. Hon. Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister, again, and I thank you, Sir, for giving me the floor to speak on this Bill. As has been mentioned previously, the Bill has been a long time coming. There had been a prior Bill in 2016 and then the Bill was rejuvenated, again, in 2018-2019 to get it going. Sir, I am really glad to see that it has finally come to Parliament after such a long time. The honourable Minister had talked about the history of weather forecasting and collecting meteorological information in Fiji, starting in the late 1800s, then we had the New Zealand Air Force, then the South Pacific Air Traffic Council that took place, and over the years, the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services has continued to grow, but the fact that we now have this legislation, as the honourable Minister has pointed out, empowers the Director. It gives power to the Director to be able to carry out their roles in the best possible way. So, they will now have this legislative basis on which to build the operation into the future. As he has pointed out, our Fiji Meteorological Services has quite a good reputation. It is, in fact, responsible for the Flight Information Centre in Nadi and also has been recognised as the regional specialised meteorological centre. So, it has global recognition in terms of what it does and it has a special status with the World Meteorological Organization. In this particular Bill, we are combining both of these two special arms in which we need good forecasting and good information, - meteorological and hydrological, because we all know that the biggest disasters in Fiji are not, all the time, cyclones. It is flooding - flooding is the big one because even if you do not have a cyclone, if the cyclone does not pass through Fiji, flooding will happen, so flooding is very, very critical for us. Anything around flooding is very important for anything that we do. Looking through the Bill itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see that now, for this Act, there will be no longer be a Fiji Meteorological Services, but will now become a Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services, managed by a Director.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 879 Just looking through some of the parts on Clause 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the functions of the Service, I think they are all very good. There is just one issue that I wanted to highlight here, which I think the honourable Minister and the Director Meteorological Services would have been engaged with and, that is, Clause 5(1)(m) that states, and I quote: “arrange with any ministry, department, public agency, office or person to take and record meteorological observations or to record hydrological data and transmit…” I think this is very important – the ‘transmit’ bit. If you go around, you have the automatic weather stations, you have the hydrological meters in the rivers, but sometimes they are not transmitting. I think that is something that we need to make sure because if the data is there, the data is being captured but it is not being sent to the place where it is analysed, observed and interpreted, then there is a breakdown in the system. Sometimes in the past, we were to resort to manual people to actually go there and to try to get the readings. I think that is one part that struck me in my time as the Minister. The other part is this, we have very good modelling systems but sometimes, I do not think the modelling systems do not take into account the moisture content in the soil. They look at the amount of precipitation and rainfall, but nothing seems to measure the amount of moisture content in the soil because if there is a lot of moisture content in the soil, then the flooding will happen very quickly. So, I am hopeful that as they develop their models into the future, they will be able to take up ways to try to address these important issues that will even then fine tune further the very, very good work that has been done by the Fiji Meteorological Services. As the honourable Minister has pointed out, we lose a lot of these people – very good assets. There is a very short band of latitude in the world where people earn the skills to learn about tropical cyclones. We are smacked in the middle of that Centre – of that place where people learn their skills to predict and forecast tropical cyclones because they happen, it is just this brief brand of area around the equator. So, our people who come through the Centre and the training that they do, they get good jobs everywhere. We have lost them to a lot of places, so I think this is going to be a challenge for us going into the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, going to Clause 5(2), we noticed there, and it reads: “The service may provide commercial meteorological and hydrological services for remuneration.” I think this is also good because being able to provide something for a fee of service, will also enhance the reputation of the Centre and it also forces them to enhance their own abilities so that they can deliver the kind of information that people are willing to pay for. In the future, as the honourable Minister has pointed out, they will be looking maybe at some time in the future, the Meteorological Services or Hydrological Service might be hived off as an entity on its own. I think that is good - overall, in the development of Government, we always want to see Government produce. Government maintains the policy, the regulatory bit, but the actual operations go out, and that is what has already happened in the Ministry of Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport, Water Authority of Fiji has gone, Fiji Roads Authority has gone, the policy is maintained but this has gone out. So, I think over the long-term, that is a good development. Ultimately, it might take a few more years, a lot of work might still need to be done, before we can get to that.</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>880 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 There is one sticky bit that we might have with the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is around Clause 7(1) and (2). Clause 7(1) says, and I quote: “Any person who issues a weather warning or alert, including a flood alert, or causes the warning or alert to be issued without the prior authorisation of the Director in consultation with the Minister, commits an offence…” I understand why this was put in the first place because under the World Meteorological Organization in Nadi is recognised as the place where this forecasting is done. They have been given the right to be the first level where they provide the basic information on predicting cyclones and forecasting. At the moment also, we have a lot to agencies that do that. We all know about Na Draki, so I think this needs to be grappled with, because we have the freedom of information issue. How do we grapple with that? Clause 7(1) says that when someone does it, issues or authorizes the issuance of a weather warning or alert, it is an offence and is liable on conviction. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give you one scenario. In the Ba Market which has a lot of flooding, sometimes the vendors will call the Ba Market Master and say, ‘there is going to be flood’. They are giving a weather warning. Will they then be liable for conviction, when that warning has not been authorised by the Director? This is a far-fetched thing, but it can happen. So, the wording of what it actually means. What does a weather warning or alert mean? Does it mean someone saying something like that because when market vendors do that, they know that it is something that is very important for them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 10 - Indemnification from liability - maybe honourable Attorney- General, that should be referring to ‘exclusion of liability’. The way that it is worded now, because at the end of that sentence at the bottom, it says, “unless it is shown that the person did not act in good faith or with reasonable care”. So, I suggest maybe that, that might be considered. Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for your indulgence. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had indicated yesterday, it is a very brief Bill, only 12 Clauses. Their assets is in Clauses 5 and 6. This is the key – the powers and the positions of the Director. Clause 4 is the establishment of the Service; Clause 5 is the functions of the Service and Clause 6 is the powers of the Director. This is the essence of the Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is now codified. Before you draw from this legislation, from this regulation, so it makes the people at the Fiji Meteorological Services so happy and satisfied that, at least, it is now codified in one legislation. In terms of the issue about weather warnings, that is the reason why it is not put in the Act - it is put in the Regulations because situations has arisen in the past. The reason why it is stated here is because it has arisen in the past and has caused confusion so there will be further discussion and that will come out in the Regulation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 10 is standard where officers of the Corrections, Military and Police are indemnified from any civil and criminal liability. There is a standard provision, but I note what honourable Usamate said.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 881 Sir, this Bill brings in budget allocation, it is also a forward-looking Bill. Clause 8(c) states, and I quote: “The funds of the Service consist of the following – (c) income from any commercial services provided by the Service.” This morning, we had discussed - there is a wind of change, things change, of course. So, in this line of work, there are some expectations that they will provide some services to other providers. That is why it is put there. Where the situation arises, it is provided for by law. The Bill allows the Fiji Meteorological Services to continue their work but with confidence with having a legal base now. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work of the Fiji Meteorological Services was inherited from the South Pacific Air Transport Council, which is a branch of New Zealand Meteorological Services. The role and scope of the work of the Director of the Meteorological and Hydrological Services is big and vital, not just for Fiji, but for the region as we there are only six centres in the world that provide essential tropical cyclone-related information. This means that we are the leading Meteorological Office in the South Pacific region and, thus, the Fiji Meteorological Office names tropical cyclones as soon as they are detected. We have the legal and moral obligation to smaller countries in the Pacific who are heavily reliant on Fiji for aviation and weather forecasting, such as Tuvalu, Niue, Kiribati, Cook Islands, Tokelau, Nauru, Tonga and Samoa. It is crucial to have this Bill passed, given that we now understand the importance of Meteorological and Hydrological Service and the role they play in Fiji and in the region. The Bill is a reflection of the urgency which we seek to in order to establish the Meteorological and Hydrological Service. Early warning leads to early action and, therefore, action leads to having sustainable economic development, protection of life, livelihoods and property from meteorological and hydrological disaster and hazards. That is the reality of what is to come, once the Bill is passed. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend the Bill to be passed. MR. SPEAKER.- Now I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU. –Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will be very brief in my contribution as well. As alluded to by honourable Usamate, we support the Bill, but we are making some recommendations as well, if it is still relevant, and maybe the Government can take it into consideration. I was not so much in favour of this coming under Standing Orders 51 for one session only rather than not referring it to the Committee, simply because of two reasons and, again, I will explain it today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I had alluded to the other day, when this was drafted way back in 2016, it was just about Meteorological Services. When it came back, it included Hydrological Services as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I have given the history behind this Unit. This is based on experiences in the various offices that we have served in. The first reason is the compartmentalization in work, but then on the other hand, the issue of overlap and duplication. Now, we have the Public Works again. Previously, as I have said, hydrological services used to be part of Water Supplies under PWD.</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>882 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 We also have hydrology functions in the Ministry of Mineral Resources, we also have Water Authority of Fiji, so this is again, I am talking about the overlaps and even duplication but at the same time, the compartmentalization of this. This is why I was raising this issue again because given what has progressed over the years as we were drafting this Bill. The second reason and main one was on the role of Director Meteorological Services as the focal point for IPCC. Again, I say that this was drafted before the Climate Change Act 2021 came in. The honourable Minister keeps referring to the link between Meteorological Services and Director NDMO, but let me read from section 69 of the Climate Change Act 2021, and I quote: “The Director, in consultation with the Fiji Meteorological Service and other relevant stakeholders, may build…” I will not read the rest of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is just because of the link between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Director, Fiji Meteorological Service as the focal point and, of course, their link with Director Climate Change. Section 69(3) talks about integrated risk scenarios must be developed based on the scientific knowledge about climate change including relevant information published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the National Adaptation Plan. The only reason why I am raising this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of course if it is too late now may be something that Government can consider for the future because we know that climate change is the biggest existential threat that we are facing and we must be seen, particularly the role of Parliament in the development of legislations, we must make sure that all the legislation are in sync and of course particularly are aligned to the Conventions that we have ratified as well. In the history of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was established way back in 1988 and approved by the General Assembly. It was between UN Environment (UNEP) and World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and this is where the role of the Director of Fiji Meteorological Service becomes important as the focal point for science related issues when it comes to climate change. I just want that to be considered by Government if it is too late now to refer it to the Committee but probably something that is worth looking into and this is something that we also have discussed with Director, NDMO because when the Climate Act also was drafted, we had not had COVID back then. In terms of the emergency framework, these are the new developments and as we are just into the process of getting the new Bills now it would be good if these factors are included because it will save us a lot of work as well in the long term. Again, may I just raise the issue again about Clause 10 of the Bill, probably it is just the wording, honourable Attorney-General because indemnification probably in the way it is in the context it does not fit well with the wordings that are in there. Probably, the exclusion of liability is the proper word rather than indemnification, Sir. Despite those comments we support the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before this august Parliament to express my support for the Meteorological and Hydrological Bill currently under debate.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 883 Recently, the National Disaster Management Office in collaboration with Fiji Meteorological Office has installed community based flood early warning system in the Western Division with 17 new floodgates soon to be installed Central Division. This is achieved through the kind funding of NDMI Korea and the New Zealand Government. We support Section 3(b) which promotes public private engagement. Selected sites for the above stated floodgates that I have stated above are critical because the long data sparse areas normally referred to as black spots because of the lack of hydrological data from some tributaries or flood prone areas in Fiji. Just recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen the floods in Serua and that is one of the areas of interest that we would like to install this floodgates in as well in the future. This system will transmit critical flood data directly to the Meteorological Office to aid in community-based early flood warning systems. This support Section 5(1)(l) of the Bill. The NDMO will implement similar systems for the hazards, accurate and timely early warning from the Fiji Meteorological Office are absolutely essential for the NDMO to effectively prepare for and respond to disasters ensuring better decision making and quick emergency responses that ultimately saves lives and property. Mr. Speaker, Sir, weather patterns have become increasingly unpredictable as we all know due to the impact of climate change on our island nation and the Bill that is before us will enable the Fiji Meteorological Office to establish robust meteorological and hydrological systems to address this evolving weather conditions. It supports the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of Climate Change. At an international level Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 3(c) of the Bill contributes to the UN mandate of Disaster Risk Reduction where accurate weather and water data are fundamental for risk assessment and management. One key area of collaboration with the Met. Office is impact based forecasting where the Meteorological office provides warnings alongside exposure information and the NDMO analysis the risk impacts and vulnerabilities in affected areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this contributes to the broader multi-hazard early warning system of Fiji which is being included in the Revised Disaster Bill which I had tabled earlier and formalising this ongoing work with a legal framework ensures accountability to both the government offices and the people of Fiji. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill promotes economic resilience, sustainability by enhancing meteorological and hydrological services which will benefit various sectors such as agriculture, water ways and infrastructural planning. The Bill also mandates the Fiji Meteorological office as a sole provider as shared to us by the honourable Usamate and during disasters incorrect warnings can cause public panic and providing these legal mandate will hold accountable any organisation other than Meteorological Office that issues such warnings. Thereby mitigating misinformation that can affect disaster response. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill will improve our ability to predict and monitor natural hazards thereby, reducing the risk and the impact of disaster such as floods, storms and droughts. Finally, this Bill complements the Natural Disaster Risk Bill which I tabled earlier and Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>884 Government Guarantee - FSC 23 rd May, 2024 HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Members for their contribution and insights into this Bill and also for their positive responses. Some of the issues raised are technical issues regarding the transmission of data, modelling system, et cetera, which are issues in terms of capacity within the organisation and that is something which this Bill and also the enhancement of the capacities within it can addressed together with our development partners. Especially, the scientific organisations, the issue regarding weather warnings, there was a mention of weather warnings from someone in the market but of course that is not something that we are referring too, it could be or it is from my understanding those who is purporting to be official warnings. That is something even can be clarified through regulatory provisions. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Please, address the Speaker. Yes, including that, if it is purporting to be official and not originating from a scientifically verified and officially recognised. The overlaps raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and duplication, of course, that continues to be an issue throughout most of the ministries and from the way I see it, it is an attitude problem in leadership but if you are a good leader whether you are Director Meteorology or Permanent Secretary, you should be able to communicate openly and with a good heart to resolve and address the issues. At the end of the day what matters is how we deliver the service to the people. Duplication of functions and all these should be issues which should not hinder that and of course weather and hydrology, we note that in terms of moving forward and trying to enhance that in order to ensure that there is no duplication or confusion. Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition regarding IPCC and the Climate Change Act 2021, ensuring that the Director Meteorological Service continues to be the focal point and ensuring that the Director, Climate Change or PS Climate Change will of course be part of that, so that we can move forward together in a coordinated manner in terms of climate change and other international engagements that we do. I would just like to acknowledge our development partners who have assisted the Meteorological Services: Australian DFAT, UNDP, Korean Meteorological Agency, JICA and various other scientific agencies which have assisted and continue to assist us. I commend the Bill for the approval and support of the Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [A Bill for an Act to provide for the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services and the protection of livelihoods and property for Meteorological and Hydrological Disasters and Hazards and for related matters enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. ……. of 2024)]</p></body>
