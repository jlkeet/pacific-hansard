RABUKA.- Good morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ministers and honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers and Members of Parliament. I also bid a very good morning to our visitors to the Parliament this morning, students and our honourable Member visitor from Vanuatu and all of you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for your interest in the proceedings of the Parliament of Fiji and all those who are tuning in to the live broadcast of today’s proceedings and those listening to the radio. Ni sa bula vinaka, namaste and a very good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement elaborating on Fiji’s bilateral relationship with New Zealand and our Duavata Partnership Agreement. Sir, New Zealand is one of our oldest partners and friends in the region. It is one of the first countries that Fiji established diplomatic relationships with upon independence in 1970. We share more than just our geographic location, we share a rich historic, political, cultural and people-to-people links that informs our relationship on all fronts. Even as a colony, we stood together in times of crisis, as we did with our other allies. Our service personnel stood together in the Pacific during WWII, in the Solomons, in Bougainville and later on in Malaya. And in recent times, in peacekeeping missions in Lebanon, Sinai, with the South Pacific Peacekeeping Forces in Bougainville, Timor Leste, and again in the Solomons under the Regional Assistance Mission Solomon Islands (RAMSI).</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>816</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 Outside the military front, we stand together in times of natural disasters and at the humanitarian emergency front. The relationship between Fiji and New Zealand assumed a new frame with the signing of the Duavata Partnership Agreement in 2022. Sir, under the Duavata Partnership, Fiji and New Zealand collaborate on the following areas: 1. Economic Resilience; 2. Security; 3. Social Well-Being; and 4. Climate Change and Resilience. The Duavata Partnership covers the period 2022 – 2025 and we are now looking at review of the agreement to identify opportunities for further collaboration in the key sectors. On the invitation of the then Prime Minister in New Zealand, honourable Christopher Hipkins I undertook an official visit to New Zealand from 5 th June to 8 th June last year. It was a first official visit of a Fijian Prime Minister to New Zealand in 16 years and my first official visit after 25 years since I last visited as Prime Minister in 1998. Sir, the visit involved a number of high-level engagements with key government and non- government stakeholders. I met with the then Prime Minister Hipkins and we discussed a range of issue including the: 1. growing geo-strategic interest in the region; 2. Pacific regionalism; and 3. the importance of building longer term capabilities so that Fiji and Pacific Island Countries are self-reliant and how New Zealand can help us in that journey. Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand and Fiji alongside other Pacific Island forum leaders share an ambitious vision for the social, cultural, economic and environmental resilience of the region where we are strong, prosperous and secure. We are stronger when we combine our efforts and focus on Pacific regionalism and the priorities of the Blue Pacific continent. Mr. Speaker, we share a strong focus on regionalism, including upholding Pacific Islands Forum unity; support for the University of South Pacific; and working with other traditional partners, such as Australia, on defence and security measures. We also discussed our long history of close sporting, cultural, and people-to-people links and the work we are doing in the spirit of our Duavata Partnership Agreement. Mr. Speaker, Fiji and New Zealand are connected by the depth of our cooperation across a broad range of sectors, including policing, health, trade and industry, education and fisheries, to name a few. I also told the then honourable Prime Minister that the People's Coalition Government is serious about growing our economy and that we are keen to work harder to boost Fiji's export capacity to New Zealand. The then Prime Minister also expressed gratitude for the deployment to New Zealand of our emergency and RFMF personnel following Cyclone Gabrielle. The then honourable Prime Minister and I also discussed a Defence Cooperation Agreement that will allow defence officials to undertake engagement in different areas, including capacity building and upskilling and exposure to new technologies, interoperability and technical support, among other matters. The Agreement will also strengthen maritime security and improve the disaster and humanitarian response co-ordination between our two nations.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>817 Mr. Speaker, that Defence Cooperation Agreement was signed the following week between our two Defence Ministers in Suva on 14th June, 2023. Most of the former military officers in this august Parliament were beneficiaries of the then Defence Cooperation Programme or Military Assistance Programme with New Zealand during our times in service. On meeting with thenForeign Minister, honourable Nanaia Mahuta, we delved into our economic recovery after the pandemic, and the challenges that climate change poses to our development aspirations. We agreed that climate change remains the single greatest threat to lives and livelihoods in the Pacific region. After that meeting, honourable Mahuta announced the additional support of NZ$11.1 million to assist our response to the impacts of climate change. I welcomed the boost which will support the implementation of renewable energy projects, infrastructure resilience, and climate policy. At the meeting with honourable Mahuta, I also raised the possibility of the grant of visa on arrival for Fiji citizens. This is an issue that we will continue to raise with the New Zealand government. I also had the opportunity to meet with the then Minister for Climate Change, honourable James Shaw. We discussed opportunities where Fiji and New Zealand can work together at the multilateral level and in particular at the Conference of the Parties (COP) negotiations. We also discussed the need for public- private sector cooperation and the importance of new technologies in moving us forward to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand has been a long-term proactive partner in supporting Fiji's ongoing efforts to manage the increasingly detrimental impacts of climate change. New Zealand has provided NZ$20 million in flexible climate finance, along with capacity support and technical assistance to support Fiji in delivering on our national climate change priorities. New Zealand also continues to support the National Disaster Management Office, including the prepositioning of emergency supplies in Fiji to assist during times of disaster, as and when needed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand remains one of our most important trade and investment partners with two-way trade between New Zealand and Fiji reaching an all-time high of NZ$1.36 billion in 2023. Mr. Speaker, New Zealand has also been supporting Fiji with trade negotiations capacity support. This includes a grant of NZ$800,000, to support ongoing training for our trade officials. We continue to collaborate on trade issues including for the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) which this august Parliament has resolved to ratify earlier this week. While in New Zealand, I also met with the Fiji-New Zealand Business Council. The event was attended by up to 100 members of the Fiji-New Zealand Business Council and I record with regret that some of those very distinguished former Fiji citizens were there at that meeting are now no longer with us. I raised with our private sector partners the importance of continuing to invest in Fiji, highlighting Fiji's positive economic growth, following the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the Government’s investment target of NZ$2 billion. I also expressed my support towards the revival of the Fiji-NZ Business Council as an avenue to open up further opportunities of investment to Fiji. I am happy to see the next Fiji-New Zealand Business Council meeting being hosted here in Fiji in June. Mr. Speaker Sir, I also made sure to take time to visit members of the Fiji diaspora living in both Auckland and Wellington. We were able to share with the Fijian Community our national development priorities, the upward trajectory of growth and development. In particular, I conveyed to them our appreciation for their continued support through remittances received from New Zealand. As you may be aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, personal remittances to Fiji reached $1.25 billion in 2023, an</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>818</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 increase of 20.4 percent over the figure in 2022. Our people abroad make valuable contributions and I urged the diaspora community to continue to be good Ambassadors of Fiji to New Zealand.. I also urged them to be law abiding contributors to the New Zealand economy. In concluding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to thank the New Zealand Government for the protocols and courtesies accorded to me during my visit. Please allow me to express my gratitude to the people and Government of New Zealand for the support and assistance we continue to receive under the Duavata Partnership.. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you to the honourable Prime Minister for updating us on the Duavata Partnership that we have with New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular partnership that was born in 2022 was done to elevate the relationship to a new level and we are happy to hear that it is now being reviewed and taken to another level by the honourable Prime Minister only for the betterment of Fiji. It has a new level of expanded strategic cooperation and also in the years to come, it is also based on the shared values that we have with New Zealand, Sir, and an equal partnership. A lot of it actually comes through trust and cooperation. We, of course, have our shared identity as the honourable Prime Minister has pointed out. We have mutual respect, we have historical connections and these are things that are important to this particular Duavata Partnership. The goals are fairly much the same, but I want to also take this opportunity to say thank you also to New Zealand for all the tremendous support that they have given us during times that have been hard and also during COVID-19 and whenever we have natural disasters. We have the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also as a shared vision for our work that we do in improving the lives of our citizens and people and also for the planet, Sir. I think, when this agreement actually started, they took notice of our 5-Year and 20-Year Development Plans, I know it is being reviewed at the moment, I hope that all of that also forms a part of the review that is currently happening. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am informed by the honourable Leader of the Opposition that there was a tremendous amount of support given to our dairy industry. I think it was about $12 million that came, it was very handy because majority part of it was given to take care of brucellosis and tuberculosis issues that we had in the dairy industry. It is also a good opportunity and a time to say thank you to New Zealand. The partnership also looked at the democracy and its values, economic resilience as the honourable Prime Minister has pointed out, and also with respect to security and the tremendous amount of help and assistance that have been given by New Zealand in terms of defence. Regionally speaking, they have stood up at a time of need of our Pacific neighbours where they uplifted our soldiers, et cetera, whenever we have come to the aid of our Pacific Island neighbours. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has also been a lot of strengthening of institutional capacity and Fiji’s governance bodies in terms of the judiciary, defence and security forces so that the rule of law is consistently upheld and this is very important. I think sometimes we miss what we have in our partnership, but it needs to be said and it is a very important aspect of this particular agreement. The social well-being also in terms of coordinating preparedness for natural disasters, like COVID-19</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>819 that actually came along, Mr. Speaker, all of these things have come out of it and born out of that particular partnership. One of the most important things that the honourable Prime Minister pointed out, and again we have a total support with respect to this partnership is climate change. I think New Zealand recognises this so much with respect to Fiji’s position, where we are and how we have actually gone ahead and been able to do a lot in that particular space. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this particular partnership is based on trust, respect and openness. It is certainly an example to the rest of the world on how you can operate in a region and we are extremely confident and happy that this particular agreement will be taken forward in the direction that it has from 2022, as we have a very strong relationship with New Zealand. They have always stood by us in times of need. I think a lot has been said by the honourable Prime Minister that has covered a lot and I wish you well in the review, et cetera that has gone on, Sir, and may this relationship prosper with our neighbours and our brothers and sisters in New Zealand. One small point, I do not think there is any one in this room that does not have a relative in New Zealand. There are quite a few of our diaspora that live there. May this relationship prosper, Mr. Speaker. Fight Against Poverty Through Active Agriculture Production HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I want to join the honourable Prime Ministers in welcoming the Year 8 students of Marist Brothers Primary School and I am proud to say that it includes my youngest son, Joshua Rayalu. I hope that his visit to Parliament will alleviate all his questions because he keeps asking me, “what do you do in that House”, and that he will one day join his father, grandfather and great grandfather as a Member of this august Parliament and serve the people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before this august Parliament to outline a vision on the use of agriculture as a tool in Fiji’s fight against poverty and the associated social ills. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we understand, poverty leads to many other social ills such as drug and substance abuse, domestic violence, suicide and exploitation of children, to name a few. Poverty is a cancer that is eating away at the very flesh and muscle and bones of society that must be addressed head-on by Government in partnership with relevant stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) for the period 2019 to 2020 estimated that the national incidence of poverty in Fiji impacted 24.1 percent of our population. Poverty is a bottleneck to socio-economic development, thus if we are to improve the quality of people’s lives in Fiji, greater efforts must be made by Government to fight and reduce poverty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must understand that the fight against poverty in reality is a fight against drug and substance abuse, particularly against our youth, fight against domestic violence against our women and fight against the exploitation of our children among the many other social ills brought about by poverty.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>820</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the last National Agricultural Census Report, close to 40 percent of households in Fiji are involved in agriculture, yet they are often constrained by limited access to resources, services, technologies, markets and economic opportunities that lower agricultural productivity and income levels. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s objective to realise the full potential of Agriculture as a tool for socio-economic development and growth has led to the formulation of a 5-year Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for 2024-2028 that aligns with Government’s National Development Plan (NDP) and the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals to develop and transform agriculture in Fiji. Priority areas in the National Development Plan that align with the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways Strategic Development Plan include: Food and Nutrition Security; Health and Medical Services through the one health strategy; Social inclusion and empowerment; • • • • Women and youth empowerment and development through agriculture; • • Support large scale agriculture production to achieve economies of scale; and Support the development of Small and Medium Enterprises. In the short term, the Ministry’s SDP provides a roadmap to fulfill the Fijian Governments call for agriculture to drive sustainable development and economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government through the Ministry of Agriculture has already embarked on consultations with other Ministries, Civil Society Organisations and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) on the use of agriculture as a tool to fight poverty. Government will use a multi-sectoral approach to address social, economic and political challenges that are often faced by individuals, marginalised groups and communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the multi-sectoral approach will work towards: • Identifying and assisting the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in Fiji, in actual fact this project will target the poorest of the poor. • Relocation and training for the identified families and individuals to utilise identified idle lands for active agriculture production. • Targeting women and youth to get involved in active agriculture production with the renewed interest and gradually elevating them to be agricultural entrepreneurs through SME development. • Putting in the necessary financial investment to build rural infrastructure, especially in energy, transport, water and sanitation in collaboration with other sectors. • Addressing structural constraints faced by the poor agricultural households through increasing their access to government assistance, as an example, the farm road development and other programmes that currently run within the Ministry. • Improving their capacity to manage risks and increase their agricultural productivity. • Group small-scale farmers into cooperatives and link them directly to markets and improve the food systems. • Creation of decent off-farm employment for the poor in agriculture and the rural non-farm economy, including fostering entrepreneurship and providing occupational skills. • Building of human capital, in particular, access to basic social services such as health and education, as well as occupational skills and organisation capacity.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>821 Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that the agriculture sector has a great potential to contribute to sustainable development and fight against poverty and its social ills. This, however, will need the support and collaboration of other Government ministries and stakeholders. The potential for the sector to grow during challenging times has been proven during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, that is, when other sectors remained stagnant, the agriculture sector grew its agriculture production by 7 percent in the 2020-2021 period and by 16 percent in the 2021- 2022 period. Mr. Speaker, Sir, poverty issues related to rural urban-drift, rise in informal settlements and crime were previously addressed by the Pacific Community Network (PCN) in a project that was supported by the Ministry of Housing between 2016-2017. This involved the relocation of poor households from informal settlements to settle on agricultural leased land and engaged in productive agriculture activities and small businesses. There were five families relocated to Lomaivuna and five were relocated to Waidina. To-date the five families in Lomaivuna have developed from a hopeless situation living in informal settlements to a life full of hope where they have thrived in agriculture, ensured their food security and livelihoods requirements and are able to send their children to universities. The other five families in Waidina, however, did not survive as the support services ran out when the programme was shelved in 2018 by the Ministry of Housing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways staff through consultations with other government ministries has received wide support to jointly address the issue of poverty using the mandates of each ministry. We have also drafted a Cabinet paper for endorsement and requested a budget for this work under the 2024-2025 financial year. The outcomes from the consultations have taken note of the issues faced and lessons learnt from the PCN Project in 2016 and government through the Ministry of Agriculture will take the lead in the implementation of the upcoming project to use agriculture as a tool to alleviate poverty beginning with the poorest of the poor in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the estimation for population for the year 2020 and the last Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) Report for the 2019-2020, there are approximately 55,000 households in Fiji who are living in poverty. This project will commence after identifying the poorest of the poor within these households to start off with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, I ask this august Parliament to support this initiative on the use of agriculture as a tool to alleviate poverty and other related social ills in Fiji. We look forward to further discussions, collaboration and coordination with other Government ministries, the Opposition included and relevant stakeholders and partners that work within this space. God bless Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for their response, I am intending to adjourn Parliament for tea, at the same time, I would like to invite the school children of Marist Brothers Primary School who are here and also members of the public in the gallery to, please, join your parliamentarians when we break for tea. On this issue of poverty, just a small contribution from the Chair, as you go up towards Lami and crossing the Tamavua-i-Wai Bridge, when you look to the left when you travelling towards Lami, you will notice the old Suva Dump that used to be the rubbish dump before. It is now covered with bush, strangely there are patches of plantations there now; cassava, dalo and everything. That has happened on their own volition addressing the issue that the honourable Minister has raised, that is, food security.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>822</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 Most of these people come from the islands, they have land in their islands but out here, they will come across whether it is a dump site or whether that dump site is emitting gas, gas will kind of poison the food, they do not know that. We look on without giving proper advice there as it is allowable or not and further up, there is a clearance of tiri or dogo land. There grows another kind of weed known locally as karisi ni Jaina (watercress). That is another variety and you see women in numbers sitting there pulling the karisi out, bundling it and selling. I do not know whether they sell it in the Delainavesi market out there in the streets, but these are things that are happening before our eyes for food security and how they want to address poverty. They are taking their own initiatives here. That is all I just wanted to share, so we do not look far, just look immediately around us and you will notice this happening. We intend to adjourn Parliament now. The Parliament adjourned at 10.38 a.m.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>823 The Parliament resumed at 11.33 a.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we move on, I would just like to acknowledge the presence of the University of Fiji Journalism students who are seated in the gallery with their lecturer, Mr. Matai Niumataiwalu. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I welcome the students and of course, our colleague Mr. Niumataiwalu into Parliament this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the Ministerial Statement made by the honourable Minister for Agriculture. Again honourable Minister, be assured there is always support from the Opposition on agriculture, not only on agriculture, but on key sectors as well because agriculture is important for us in terms of food security and economic empowerment as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am thankful to the honourable Minister for bringing again the poverty incident level according to the 2019 and 2020 HIES Report because that 24.1 percent is something that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance has always not agreed to and he has his own figures. But that was pre-there before elections, honourable Minister. I know he has changed and accepted that figure as official now. The incidence of poverty level stands at 24.1 percent. Thank you, honourable Minister. Agriculture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just refer as I have stated, totally agree to almost everything that the honourable Minister had stated. Of course, thank you for your strategic development plan, we from the Opposition have also requested for a copy of the plan, given the importance of the sector. Just a quick comment, again, I think I have raised it a few times, I have talked about food and nutrition security, I keep asking about the Food and Nutrition Security Policy that was drafted way back in 2017 but still has not made its way even perhaps to Cabinet. I do not know where it is but that is a very important document given our commitment to FAO in Rome in 2016 when we received our award based on our achievements on the MDGs then. So that is a key document for Government because we made that commitment to the Director General FAO in Rome. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the recent Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants Congress, I was in a session with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka on alternative tourism and I spoke very passionately again, not only on agriculture but on the resource-based sector. I started by referring to the country private sector diagnostics that was done by World Bank and IFC. One of the key areas that was highlighted in as far as Fiji’s economy and our post COVID-19 recovery is on agri-logistics. It is not only about the agriculture itself but, of course, the value chain as well. This is very important for us in terms of the way forward. We have to create the environment and therefore, the three levels of investment, particularly on the resource-based and I am talking here particularly for agriculture, private sector investment because part of that report too, I am sure the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance is aware, is on infrastructure, land access, air access, seaport access and even communications and energy. These are all important enablers for agriculture to go to the next level, particularly in terms of cold storage because is perishable. I will not talk more on that but perhaps, the other one that I raised and caught the attention of most of the participants is, classic economics tells us about land, labor and capital but in some of the research that I did, for us to go to the next level, we add another three to land, labour and capital; science, technology and entrepreneurship. That will elevate us the next level and it is time now that we sit together, look at the strategic development plan, I saw in last</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>824</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 week’s paper about tissue culture in banana; that is good. That is science and technology but we need to take it to the dairy sector, we need to take it to fisheries, et cetera. Perhaps the suggestion that I will always make here, something that Government needs to consider seriously is about getting specialists from abroad in capacities where we are lack in. Science, technology and entrepreneurship will help us in moving, not only agriculture but the resource-based sector forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Once again, I fully support it and we will continue to provide the necessary advice as well to the other side of Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, you had asked to speak last and now, you have changed your mind again. You sent a message and I accepted it that you wanted to speak the last. Update on Fiji’s Participation at IMO HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, I can speak the last. The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, esteemed Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians joining via the Parliament livestream; I stand before you today to discuss an important aspect of our nation’s maritime policy, the establishment of an International Maritime Organization (IMO) Regional Presence Office (RPO), and our active participation in key IMO meetings. These efforts are integral to safeguard our marine environment, enhancing maritime safety and promoting sustainable development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the international shipping industry is responsible for transporting 90 percent of the world’s commodities. It not only the most cost-effective option for international import an export, but also the safest and most eco-friendly mode of transport as emphasised by Ocean Insights. It is employing approximately 1.5 million individuals worldwide, the shipping industry is significant source of employment. However, it is predominantly male with females making up only 2 percent of all seafarers. In our region, the maritime shipping industry plays a critical role, serving as the back bone of transportation of Pacific Island countries and their communities by moving of majority people, goods and resources. This sector is vital for fostering trade and economic growth, influencing nearly every aspect of the development initiatives. In terms of the establishment of the IMO or RPO, as Fiji has long recognised the pivotal role that IMO plays in the global maritime industry, the establishment of an RPO endorsed by the Government in our region, is a testament to our commitment to supporting IMOs initiatives and ensuring that the unique needs of Pacific Island countries are addressed. The RPO will serve as a hub for regional cooperation providing technical assistance, capacity building and facilitating the implementation of IMO conventions and standards. It will also enhance our ability to respond effectively to maritime challenges, including environment protection, safety and security. By having a regional office, we can ensure that our maritime policies are aligned with the regulations, standards and best practices, while also tailoring them to a specific regional context. On 18 th March 2024, during the margins of the Marine Environment Protection Committee, (MEPC 81), I had the honour of signing an MOU on the RPO on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Fiji with the IMO Secretary-General, Mr. Arsenio Dominguez, on behalf of the IMO. The MOU outlines the framework for establishing the IMOs RPO in Fiji, designed to enhance maritime development in the region, including some of the objectives to bridge the gap in maritime development needs and execution, the continued support in terms of IMO support to the region, especially, in standards and regulations in alignment with the international norms.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>825 Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was also discussion on the IMO Green House Gas (GHG) emissions reduction negotiations. The gravity of climate crisis cannot be overstated. It is imperative for us to take resolute and decisive measures to alleviate its impacts. Fiji is part of the lines of high ambition states when we call ourselves in that group, the six pack, that have been actively participating the IMO GHG emission reduction negotiations. The Pacific’s role is well recognised as being catalytic to achieving the high levels of ambition agreed in the 2023 Revised IMO Strategy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2023 Revised IMO GHG Strategy represent a comprehensive and ambitious plan to address climate change by significantly reducing the carbon footprint of the maritime industry. For the information of this august Parliament, the revised IMO GHG Strategy sets ambitious targets for the maritime sector to reduce its emissions, aligning with the broader goal of limiting global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement. The key targets under the revised strategy include achieving a reduction of the carbon intensity of international shipping as measured by carbon dioxide emissions per transport work by, at least, 40 percent by 2030 and 70 percent by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. Moreover, the strategy aims for the total GHG emissions from international shipping to be reduced by, at least, 50 percent by 2050, also compared to 2008 levels. These targets represent a significant step towards decarbonisation of the sector with further discussions anticipated in setting a pathway towards full carbonisation by the end of the century. Having agreed on the 2023 strategy negotiations on GHG reduction for shipping at IMO will culminate in 2025 in agreement of a basket of measures to achieve the IMO’s 2023 strategy for the decarbonisation of shipping by 2050, including an economic measure that puts a price on GHG emissions. Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 82) in October 2024 through to MEPC 83 next May is the critical period for negotiating of the detail of the proposed measures and disbursement of revenues. The Pacific Alliance have previously submitted that the measures to be adopted should comprise a simple Global Fuel Standard (GFS) and a universal mandatory levy of all international maritime GHG emissions with an entry price of $150 per tonne, CO2 equivalent. Global fuel standard seeks to promote the use of cleaner more environmentally friendly fuels to minimise the environmental impact of shipping. I am happy to say that there is a growing consensus around a universal levy as the leading contender from many states at the IMO meeting. Sir, the Pacific Alliance has successfully inserted the concept of an equitable transition into a strategy and has called for at least 50 percent of revenues to flow to the Global South, in particular the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and the Least Developing Countries (LDCs). Potential revenues from IMO measures could be as high as $100 billion per annum. The earliest these measures will flow in any real quantity in 2027 if we do our homework and also push for this, if our negotiators are successful in confirming the basket of measures and revenue disbursement architecture by 2025, today, I am also committed to this highly ambitious timelines. There are two critical negotiation rounds at IMO in September and October 2024 and April 2025 with submission deadlines in early 2024 and February 2025 respectively. The Pacific will need to make multiple submissions to both rounds with a content dependent on the outcome of ongoing bilateral negotiations with multiple partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, active participation at IMO is crucial for advancing our national interest and contributing to global maritime governance in addition to the basket of measures and also the</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>826</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 financial rewards for our island countries as highly affected by climate change. Fiji has been vocal and proactive member in the IMO and we have reaffirmed our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and we advocate for stronger measures. We have also highlighted the need for financial mechanisms to support our developing countries and which will continue to participate in various international working groups, focussing on specific issues such as reduction of sulphur oxide emissions, developing of low carbon and zero carbon fuels and the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems. Our experts have consistently provided valuable insights and best practices from our regional experiences. The honourable Prime Minister has mentioned the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnerships and, of course, my predecessor honourable Usamate and the Leader of the Opposition and again this is an important initiative which we will continue to support. Domestic shipping had no profile a decade ago today and partly due to the success of the Pacific Alliance, the significant understanding amongst donors and Fiji and RMI agreed to co-chair the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership which calls for an investment for $500 million in climate financing across six Pacific Island States. The honourable Prime Minister has reaffirmed Fiji’s commitment to the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnerships at the margins of COP 28 in terms of green shipping leading the global energy transition. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Marshall Island is a key partner and we will continue to liaise closely with them and the RMI Special Envoy for Maritime Decarbonization, His Excellency Ambassador Ishoda, has invited Fiji to join him in hosting a Ministerial Donor Council in Korea mid- year with the intention of bringing together Pacific Ministers with our major bilateral partners and the Global Climate Fund to bring focus and high level political support to this initiative and to ensure it remains firmly under country control. This would be the first major multi-country application to the GCF of its kind, Ministers from Tuvalu and Vanuatu have already signaled their commitment to support this approach and the EU &amp; Government of Netherlands have been approached to support. This proposal would fit well with the existing Fijian initiatives in particular the Agreement with Australia for the Revitalizations of Ship Building and Ship Repair in Fiji. Given our position as a major transshipment hub, Fiji’s best position for the PBSP countries to act as the region’s technology transfer hub with numerous multipliers of Fiji’s engineering ship repair, maintenance industries, its maritime facilities and financing an insurance sub-sectors. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our engagement with IMO is not just about compliance with international regulations, it is about shaping the future and ensuring that we have the best outcomes for our nation in Fiji and for our people. Fiji is committed to being a leader in sustainable maritime development and ensuring that our maritime industry contributes effectively to our economy and our global community. Sir, in conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the establishment of the IMO Regional Office and our active participation in terms of all the contributions of all the officials and our regional partner countries and I thank the honourable Prime Minister for reaffirming out stance at the IMO when he met the Secretary-General in his recent visit to the UK.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>827 I also acknowledge and thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition, my predecessor, honourable Jone Usamate for their contributions in the area of climate change and the previous work done in terms of the IMO and our negotiations, and we as a Coalition Government will continue to build upon the work of past governments prior to us. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement on the engagements with the IMO and on the opening up of the Regional Office in the Pacific and also the further developments that have taken place in order to implement and make operational some of the commitments that have been made. We, in the Pacific are just small dots in the ocean and we are, indeed, maritime organisation, maritime countries and anything to do with the ocean is always very important for us. I must congratulate the honourable Minister for the signing with the IMO for the opening of the office here in the Pacific. The regional office which once again enhances our image as the hub for the Pacific and it also allows us to be very closely involved with all the things that will be taking place in anything to do with oceans in the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things I was talking about, I think yesterday in relation to the honourable Prime Minister’s Address, one of the key things in terms of the greenhouse gas emission strategy for the IMO. The first of the strategies was implemented in 2018 and I was a part of those initial discussions and now we have the new 2023 which provided a lot more details and these targets that we have are not easy targets. The target for 2030 is to reduce emissions by 40 percent within six years. This is a huge target, and I am glad to hear from the Minister that he has talked about the various ways in which we try to approach this, through the Pacific Blue Shipping and access to the funding, different ways of getting that funding but also, I am glad to hear of the first multi-country approach to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) which is a group of small island nations and I think this is very innovative. In fact, the small island nations of the Pacific are very innovative in anything to do with oceans to try to get that fund because if I just stated an example, for here in Fiji, our largest vessels in the country are the ro-ro vessels. They are old fleets and big ships, but they are very old, and we have seen the incidents that have taken place over the past few years. You always have the balance between trying to decarbonize these fleets and not realizing that everything to do with trade depends on our shipping fleets, especially as they travel across the country, so we have very old boats. I think we need to find ways to get newer boats into the system and I am not too sure how that can be done, because to decarbonize old boats, the only thing you can do is to get rid of them. The huge challenge there and as I look at the target again, I think the target was to decarbonize 80 percent of all our boats by the year 2040 and I am looking forward for us being able to progress this well so we can achieve this target. I am glad to hear the initiatives that the Minister has made together with the other party. One of the things that come to my mind, if we are going to have a levy, I am not too sure about this universal levy. I am glad to hear that most of the money that is raised from the revenue of this levy will come to the Global South; will come to the Small Island Developing States. But in my mind, I am wondering if we still have old ships, does that mean that we also pay a higher fine for the fact that we have high gas emitting vessels? I hope that that is an issue that can be addressed into the future. We obviously need support for our shipping sector and I know that this has been something that has been discussed regionally, at the global level and I am glad to hear about the innovative</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>828</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 measures that are taking place now to try to push this forward and I look forward to the events for success, so we can really decarbonize our ships in the Pacific so we can join this fight against climate change in the world. I was also reading up and I noticed that we also entered into some agreements with the United States to establishing a green shipping corridor where they will be providing technical cooperations to help us in the early adaption of zero emission fuels. I think eventually that is where we will be going into the future, but once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his speech and on this side, we will be in full support on anything to do with the greenhouse gas emissions and the support for the maritime sector in the Pacific. Strengthening the Fight Against Corruption - FICAC HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers, fellow honourable Members of this august Parliament and members of the public in the gallery and those watching and joining us virtually; good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I believe it is fitting at this juncture to pay tribute to the late Joji Washington Dumukoro, the Acting Deputy Secretary for Home Affairs who will be laid to rest today. Mr. Dumukoro is from Kadavu, he joined me at the Ministry of Home Affairs in 2000 when the staff of PSC and Parliament were transferred as a result of the events of 2000. Since then, we have become friends, he is probably one of the only staff who has worked there for, I believe, a good 24 years. May his soul rest in peace. It says in Deuteronomy 16:19 and I quote: “They are not to be unjust or show partiality in their judgments; and they are not to accept bribes, for gifts blind the eyes even of wise and honest men, and cause them to give wrong decisions.” I rise today to address this esteemed Parliament on the important role and achievements of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC). At the outset, I would like to state that corruption in any form undermines the rule of law, disturbs economic growth, and erodes public trust. The Bible like every other religious book, they all denounce corruption. II Peter 2:19 states and I quote: “They promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of destructive habits - for we are slaves of anything that has conquered us.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand here today for this Parliament to create a legacy. A legacy that all of us will denounce corruption, just like going to fight for poverty as we heard this morning, just like going to fight for drugs, all of us, not only this side of Parliament, I ask our colleagues from the other side, as we go out, if anything let us be untied …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Same here:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> … to fight corruption. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to combating corruption, as it is a complex issue and often requires a multi-functional approach. A key strategy for preventing corruption is strengthening the anti-corruption laws, enacting and enforcing robust anti-corruption laws to deter corrupt activities. The primary role of FICAC is to investigate, institute and conduct criminal proceedings against corruption, a mandate it has carried out with distinction since its establishment. The primary objective of the Commission guided by section 12 of the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Act No.11 of 2007 is to eradicate corruption. Given the above, the following are objectives adopted by the Commission to successfully carry out its mandated responsibilities:</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>829 • • • • Successful investigation; Effective prosecution with the presentation of solid evidence; Effective education and corruption prevention programmes with the presentation of relevant data; and Successful formulation of anti-corruption policies through a series of effective and efficient prevention programmes. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Commission is continuously challenged to sustain the fight against corruption through greater empowerment and visibility. I wish to highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes at one point this side of Parliament had some issues about FICAC. The reason being, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because it was promulgated when Parliament was not sitting. A law was brought in first in 2007, there was no wider consultation, yes, but has come over time, there has been set up, there has been awareness, there has been successful prosecutions and today as parliamentarians our role is to fully support the work of FICAC. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to accomplish the desired standards, the current systems, processes and procedures of the institution needs to be consistently reviewed and strengthened. In view of the above, the Commission anticipates an extension to its organisational growth and expansion in the future. As such, the Commission foresees its future to have ascertained stronger brand image and position with its partners and stakeholders. It must align itself to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030 (SDGs) set by the United Nations (UN), the Commission envisions to strongly uphold its key responsibilities in preventing and combating corruption in the country and assisting the nation to accomplish the set Sustainable Development Goals. The Commission desires to be an institution which is resourceful and well equipped with tangible and intangible necessities to lead the fight against corruption. Also, it envisages sanctioning the Fijian Constitution in terms of the prevention and the minimisation to assist the Government to rapidly adapt and comply with the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Since its inception, FICAC has conducted a number of corruption prevention activities, national and regional initiatives, investigated a number of complaints received, successfully prosecuted and appealed cases in the High Court, including the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is important to acknowledge the commitment and hard work of our dedicated officers who strive daily to prevent and combat corruption in our nation. It is also significant to ensure the morale and performance of these officers and their IK for. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2018, there had been no salary increments for the staff members of FICAC. This prolonged period without financial recognition of their effort was a cause of concern. However, this situation saw a positive change with the new Acting Deputy Commissioner assumed the role in 2023. With the unwavering support of the Coalition Government, a much needed salary adjustment was implemented, ensuring that the hardworking staff members received their deserved increments. This decisive action was important in acknowledging and valuing the contributions of the officers, thereby, fostering a more motivated and dedicated workforce. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the salary increment was indeed a great news for the staff, and the Commission is committed to ensure that the staff are well catered for. Part of the policy of the Commission in terms of its staff welfare, a comprehensive health insurance covers for officers and</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>830</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 their families; ample opportunities for growth within the organisation and relevant professional training and development programmes. These initiatives are essential in retaining the talented staff members and preventing brain drain. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most prevalent forms of corruption among public officials have been identified as Causing a Loss and Abuse of Office. In quarter 3 alone, the Commission received 203 complaints across its office in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa. There were 168 complaints from the Central and Eastern Divisions - 14 from the Western and 21 in the Northern Division. Each of these complaint is thoroughly assessed by the State Counsel. In an effort to provide even a better service to the people of Fiji, FICAC expanded its Investigation Department and the Legal Department in terms of its manpower and resources. The Investigation Department has branched out to Lautoka and Labasa offices, while the Legal Department remain centralised with plans to expand to these branches in the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the launch of its Strategic Plan, FICAC has established the Economic Crime Unit to expedite and investigate cases involving proceeds of crime, unexplained wealth and civil forfeiture matters. Yesterday, we talked about transnational crimes, that is why it is important for this unit to be set up, to ensure that those cases are properly investigated. This unit is specifically tasked with investigating offences under the Cybercrime Act 2021, in addition to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1997 and unexplained wealth under the Prevention of Bribery Act No. 12 of 2007. In the last quarter, the Commission’s Investigation Department handled a total of 151 cases. Of these, seven cases were charged and taken to court; three cases were submitted for legal opinion; eight cases were submitted for closure and the remining 133 cases are still under investigation. As we delve deeper into the intricacies of combating corruption, it becomes increasingly evident that this battle requires and united front. Corruption is an evil multi-faceted and multi-dimensional problem that requires a comprehensive approach, but only in an environment of transparency, accountability and integrity, which the Coalition strives to uphold duly. The Commission needs collaboration, innovation and incentive systems that facilitates cross-sectoral incentives and shared accountability across different Ministries, agencies, levels of Government and non-Government stakeholders. All are required, including the private sector, non-state actors and the general public at large. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to shed some light on the progress made and the challenges that lie ahead. The Commission’s commitment to this cause is exemplified through its education and prevention programme. As such, we must recognise that education and prevention efforts are crucial, not only for promoting transparency, accountability and integrity, but they accelerate progress in meeting development goals. By engaging robustly with the stakeholders across the spectrum, from Government institutions to private enterprises, from communities to youth groups and clubs, from primary schools to tertiary institutions, as well as NGOs and civil society organisations. As technology continues to shape our world, the Commission remains proactive in adapting to these changes. The key initiatives such as the development of an online recruitment portal and online appraisal are being explored to enhance efficiency and address potential delays. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Commission acknowledge it cannot tackle corruptions single handily the fight against corruption is everyone civic duty. Therefore, stressing the important fact that comparing corruption was the active participation of all members of society to ensure more transparent, efficient and equitable world together with the support of involvement of all stakeholders</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>831 we can strive towards our society free from the cycles of corruptions. The Commission needs sufficient funding to sustain its operation and accommodate changes for the next five years, as highlighted in the Commission Strategic Plan which was launched in February of this year. We also agreed to assist individual officers in different departments their efforts to drive to achieve their KPIs Annual Corporate Plan for 2024-2025. The Coalition Government place a great emphasis on the importance of never forgetting the grass root communities and those at the outer islands. And, yes, the Coalition Government has positively shown its support towards the Commission in carrying out this role and functions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, unlike the previous Government which often interfered with how the Commission carried out its roles and functions …. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash HON. S. D. TURAGA.- …causing officers to work under constant fear of termination or dismissal the Coalition Government takes a different approach.. With the Coalition Government, there is commitment to allow independent statutory institutions like FICAC to operate autonomously without interference in a day to day operations. The Coalition Government respect the staff of these organisations enforce an environment where they can carry out their duties effectively and without undue influence. Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will refer back to the Bible. Galatians 6:8, states and I quote: “If you plant in the field of your natural desires, from it you will gather the harvest of death; if you plant in the field of the spirit, from the spirit you will gather the harvest of eternal life.” I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to address this august Parliament, HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my response to the honourable Attorney-General and the statement on the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember during campaign this is the very Government that wanted to abolish FICAC. We have seen this but again he is now praising FICAC. Yesterday, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka wanted to talk about the open skies. Few months back he said all this kind of flip-flop politics coming from the other side of Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, can we have this wind of change. (Laughter) HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. But, again, FICAC was created by back then in the previous administration and I thank the honourable Attorney-General that his eyes is open today to acknowledge the good work of the previous Government. His duty is to continue that good work. As alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister the other day, a new Government needs to build on the success of the previous government and that has to be the culture. The honourable Prime</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>832</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 Minister specifically said no Government is forever. The good work done by FICAC, the only thing that FICAC needs is more funding. The honourable Attorney-General can ask the honourable Minister for Finance for more funding. When the honourable Attorney-General was talking about increment to FICAC officials, I saw the honourable Minister for Finance smiling away. But again, I am not saying that because some from the other side are under investigation too but again we need to support the institution. We need to practice what we preach, especially coming from the honourable Attorney-General as the Minister responsible for FICAC. Also, public knowledge, the honourable Attorney-General too is under investigation under FICAC. But again, if we are to practice what we preach, the Bible verse that he had read to us a while ago, we have to stick to the text of the Word. If I were the honourable Attorney-General and Minister responsible for FICAC, I would have given that portfolio away to probably honourable Tikoduadua or the honourable Prime Minister and after my investigation is completed, then that particular portfolio can come back. (Laughter) Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are obligations under FICAC. FICAC is an international obligation under the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and I spoke the other day about the Annual Report for FICAC on the Periodic Review – The Peer Reporting, and I think it is due in June, honourable Attorney-General. I think we need to make our report on the whole review; how are we going to review FICAC and whether FICAC is relevant and how are we going to develop FICAC to combat the objectives that FICAC were made with. On education and other programmes that are happening, awareness, corruption is everywhere and any government that comes in will be blamed by any Opposition that that particular government, to borrow your words honourable Attorney-General will try to “weaponize” this kind of institution. However, I hope you do not weaponize these kinds of institutions and let it grow so that we eradicate the very principles that this particular organisation fights for and that is to combat corruption. I thank the honourable Attorney-General again and Minister responsible for FICAC for acknowledging the good works that has been done by the past and also moving forward on why this particular organisation needs to be strengthened. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to make his Statement, I would like to acknowledge the presence of a tribe from New Zealand in the North Island known as Ngāpuhi. Their land comprises the areas that were part of the Waitangi Treaty, I am told. So, they are here for some visitation, and we acknowledge your presence here, ladies and gentlemen. (Acclamation) Aquaculture Assistance by the Government of Japan HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; a very good afternoon and ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a Statement on the recent achievement that is foreseen to improve and boost Fiji's capability within the Aquaculture Sector. However, before I address this</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>833 matter, I wish to take a short moment to address honourable Usamate's question in this august Parliament on Monday. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members have raised and I summarise the issue that we were to address our vessels that were tied up along the foreshore here in Suva, due to their parent business becoming non-operational. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji national long line fleet, one of the last standing domestic fleets in the region, is fully operational within Fiji's EEZ and in areas beyond national jurisdictions, that is the high seas and my Ministry is moving to develop the various capacities needed to take the industry into the near future, the element that I have raised in this august Parliament on Monday. The vessels that the honourable Minister is alluding into Suva's foreshore are foreign vessels that have come to utilise many services that Fiji has to offer, such as bunkering and provision services, scheduled slipway engagements for repairs and maintenance and also to await the change in vessel crews, amidst enjoying the vibrant environment, agriculture that Fiji has to offer. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate that my Ministry is moving to play its part well with the relevant line agencies and industry stakeholders in order to meet this Coalition Government’s processes to develop Fiji as a regional hub, poised at meeting these demands and ensuring that they are met more efficiently into the future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to now transit and deliver a statement on the recent achievement that is foreseen to improve and boost Fiji’s capability within the aquaculture sector. MR. SPEAKER.- Could I just interrupt you for a while there, honourable Minister? What you have just stated is that the ships out here are waiting for the change around of the crews?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- It has really taken a long while:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- Some are waiting for maintenance:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Qo e wawa veisau tiko qo se veisau na kai waqa? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Yes, some are waiting for maintenance and the slipway to be cleared then their turns are up. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Usamate, that answers your concern. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to transit and deliver a statement on the recent achievement that is foreseen to improve and boost Fiji’s capability within the aquaculture sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe we are all aware of the current assistance rendered to the Fiji Government through the Ministry of Fisheries as part of the collaboration with the Government and People of Japan. Through this assistance, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries received three excavators and three trucks, made possible by the Japanese Official Development Assistance through this International Cooperation System. Like any responsible Government, our commitment underpins our willingness to improve the livelihood of our people, our economy and our resources.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>834</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>23 rd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I took up office, recognizing the status of existing projects. Through the commitment of the Coalition Government, helped lead to the work of the Ministry of Fisheries to achieve the needed outcomes. The result is now measured with the successful procurement of the excavators and trucks which will boost and drive the achievement of aquaculture aspirations. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, allow me to shed light on past aquaculture practices and how the procurement of the Japanese aided machinery address challenges that once affected Fiji’s aquaculture growth. Sir, in the past, our service to the aquaculture sector was measured by our ability to: • Provide technical support; • Funding of pond construction and start up; • Feeding supply; and • Hatchery production for pond stocking. While these targets and goals seem viable on paper, the Ministry of Fisheries continue to face challenges in operationalizing the aquaculture work plan. One of the underlying reasons was the high cost of pond construction and maintenance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries has close to 500 aquaculture farmers around Fiji. The hiring of an excavator and trucks for construction and maintenance of ponds cost around $10,000. The high cost incurred in the pond works, often result in the high cost of pond management and production. Ideally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is more viable to divert and utilize the funds allocated for pond construction and maintenance to the operational needs and farm management. The re-allocated funds can be used for hatchery production, feed purchases, market access and product enhancement therefore, providing the needed support to enhance the development of aquaculture sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits envisaged are widespread. The Ministry of Fisheries has developed a robust plan to ensure that we maximise the utilisation of these Japanese-aided machineries. First is the strategic placement of excavators and trucks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as aquaculture farms are dispersed across our main geographical divisions, we have developed a relocation plan to have the excavators and trucks relocated to our main aquaculture clusters in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. This approach will result in the quick turn-around time for pond constructions, enhance the expansion and commercialisation of aquaculture farms, reduce operating costs incurred by current farmers and address the issue of loss of farming interest that lead to dormant ponds and enable the aquaculture farmers to meet local demand and in future, supply the export market, all of which are key development steps, critical to the survival of further development of the aquaculture sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is just the beginning. The future looks extremely bright, with lots of big possibilities. I am committed to progress the aquaculture sector towards the realisation of these big possibilities. With our collective effort and commitment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will serve our people's needs by: • provide a reliable source of protein and essential nutrients, contributing to our nation's food security; • boost economic growth through significant progress from subsistence to semi commercial and fully commercialised aquaculture farms;</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>835 • support employment opportunities by creating jobs in farming, processing, distribution and related activities; • contribute to import substitution and compete against external markets; • enhance sustainable fisheries by alleviating pressure on wild caught fish; • achieve diversification in the fisheries sector; and • boost coastal and rural development. All of the above are driven towards our commitment to serve our people. Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was deeply honoured to have officiated at the handing over ceremony. It is a milestone I always dreamt about and have now come to realise as a Minister. Therefore, I would like to re-emphasise our appreciation to the Government and the People of Japan for their continued partnership and support. It is certainly onwards and upwards from here. The onus is now on our people: the team I work with in fisheries and our wide stakeholders and partners. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are committed to take the aquaculture sector to bigger heights. Through our commitment, the Ministry of Fisheries is determined to steer Fiji towards a robust aquaculture sector that serves our people, addresses our needs and safeguards our economy for our sustenance and the survival of our future generation. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for his Statement this morning on aquaculture. Sir, the discussions on the provision of machinery for aquaculture emanated from the discussions that the machines were brought in from Japan was supposed to be divided between the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Ministry of Fisheries. Unfortunately, in the formation of the Ministry of Waterways, all the machineries were diverted to them. The machinery as the honourable Minister has stated will be critical for the development of aquaculture. Basically, we ask that it comes with a flat top truck so the digger can be loaded on to the flat top truck and taken to various areas in the Western, Northern and Central Divisions. This is to help new and existing aquaculture farmers. I would like to encourage the honourable Minister to try and continue the discussions with Korea who had initially agreed to provide a US$10 million for the development of mariculture in Makogai. These basically to farm non-migratory species, like donu and kawakawa for the benefit of the maritime islands. Basically, cage farming will also provide the possibility of spawning for high value species like donu and kawakawa. I am not really sure whether the discussions with Korea is at the moment, but they had initially given the green light for the US$10 million for the development of Makogai, not only for the maritime islands, but also the coastal islands of Vanua Levu with these high value species. This will greatly develop the stock within our reef system if they spawn within. This is basically practised in South-East Asia and commonly called as cage farming. I would encourage the honourable Minister to try and pursue that because not only it will help, the Japanese Government has helped the Northern, Central and Eastern and Western Divisions, this will help the small islands in the maritime zone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the aquaculture is quite a difficult venture to go into; there has been a lot of failures.
