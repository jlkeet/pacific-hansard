<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, please take note that there will be two Committee Reports for tabling today. Review Report – Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019-2020 Annual Reports HON. S. TUBUNA,- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund, 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports. Last year and early this year, the Committee undertook site visits to the Western and Northern Divisions to delve into the operational dynamics of the sugar industry. Additionally, the Committee received submissions from the Chief Executive Officer of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund. The Committee was made aware of the legislative challenges faced by the Sugar Cane Growers Fund to extend credit services to non-sugar sector and the poor financial performance of the South Pacific Fertilizers Limited in which Sugar Cane Growers Fund has 90 percent shares. The Committee noted that the Annual Reports provided by the Sugar Cane Growers Fund failed to include Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the periods under review. These indicators are essential for the Committee to make more informed recommendations and to gauge the performance of the organisation. The Committee further noted that various assistance and programmes provided by the Ministry of Sugar other than Sugar Cane Growers Fund to assist sugarcane farmers in improving production and quality of cane. For example, sugarcane development and farm assistance, weedicide and fertiliser subsidy, funding to improve the cane access roads, subsidy to purchase mechanical harvesters, grants to encourage new farmers in the sugar sector and cane cartage grant. While discussing the reports, the Committee noted that utilising rail transport for cane would prove significantly more cost-effective compared to trucks. Trucks rely heavily on fuel and are subject to escalating fuel prices and contribute to road congestion and cause road damage. While the Committee expressed satisfaction with the Sugar Cane Growers Fund’s Annual Reports during the review periods, it also acknowledged areas for improvement. This includes the need for improved coordination, commitment and accountability amongst all stakeholders. I would like to extend our appreciation to all the stakeholders for their valuable input. Finally, I would like to thank our Committee Members who are part of the team that produced this Report, namely: Deputy Chairperson, honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Premila Kumar, honourable Tomasi Tunabuna and honourable Semi Koroilavesau. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Consolidated Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2019 and 2020 Review Report to Parliament.

TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion without notice: That a debate on the contents of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the decision of the Standing Orders Committee, I now call on the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources to table the Committee’s Report. For the information of honourable Members, this should have been undertaken by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament but since he was busy, he has, therefore, asked honourable Minister Vosarogo to stand in for him. Standing Orders - Amendments HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consideration and review of the practices and procedures of Parliament and to make recommendations for the improvement and change or for the development of new practices and procedures are the mandates of the Standing Orders Committee. As a living document, the Standing Orders should be regularly amended to align, of course, with the ever-evolving rules and procedures of any modern, democratic society. This ensures that the Parliamentary processes remain relevant and practical in addressing the needs of that society. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Orders Committee met on four separate occasions: on 1st May, 3rd May, 17th May and the 22nd May, 2024. On these occasions, the Committee met and discussed the Amendments to the Standing Orders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed Amendments to the Standing Orders which have now been circulated to all honourable Members of Parliament are necessary because they impact the way Parliament conducts itself. These proposed Amendments relate to the performance, functions and the workings of Parliament. In considering and reviewing the practices and procedures of Parliament, the proposed Amendments which the Committee agreed to are hereby presented to Parliament as mandated under Standing Orders 128. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report of the Standing Orders Committee, by convention, is a functional document. The recommended Amendments as well as the Committee meeting minutes are also annexed to this Report. At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I express my appreciation to Substantive and Alternative Members who contributed greatly to the review process: honourable Speaker as the Chairperson, honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau, honourable Alitia Bainivalu, honourable Pio Tikoduadua, honourable Aseri Radrodro and later the honourable Ifereimi Vasu and, of course, the honourable Viliame Naupoto and also the honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure and honourable Alvick Maharaj. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Orders Committee, I hereby commend this Report to Parliament.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>815 (Reported handed to the Secretary-General) HON.
