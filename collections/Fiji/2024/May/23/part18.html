<body><h3>NATURAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3><p>NATURAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024 HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 06/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights; (d) Standing Committee must report on the Bill in the July or August sitting of Parliament and</p><h4>upon presentation of the Report on the Bill by the Standing Committee; and</h4><p>(e) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament but that one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise before this august Parliament today to move that the Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 be moved under Standing Order 51 with the referral to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Members of this august Parliament would know, the review of the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 began under the leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Minister for Disaster Management. The review is a culmination of over a decade</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 869 long review process, marked by extensive consultations and incorporation of lessons learnt from past disasters, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the Bill that is before you today. This process aims to streamline the time spent deliberating on the Bill, while ensuring its integrity and transparency, and it is essential that we balance the democratic process by allowing thorough examination of the Bill, while also emphasising the urgency of its endorsement. This legislation provides a crucial legal framework needed to protect our people from the devastating impacts of disasters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the prime reason for the urgency required in tabling the Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 through Standing 51 is because of the unpredictability of hazards that we are now facing and the unprecedented damage and losses that they incur on our economy and society in general. One clear indication is of the recent flooding in the Serua area last week. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic that swept through the country in 2019 and the back- to-back cyclones of TC Yasa and TC Ana in 2021, has put pressure on to our already fragile environment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these were extraordinary in terms of their nature and frequency and stretched our disaster management capabilities to the limit. There have been gaps identified in inter- agency coordination and responsibilities that needed to be urgently addressed to enable effective and efficient disaster risk management and the timely saving of lives and livelihoods. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have done the necessary consultations amongst Government agencies. The Bill refines our disaster risk management governance arrangements, to ensure that there is clarity and efficiency in the way we respond to the new hazards and disasters we are now facing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is completely contextualised to Fiji’s unique needs, while at the same time aligns Fiji to international standards and best practices, as outlined in global and regional disaster risk reduction frameworks. The Bill is a product of constant consultations and lessons learnt from disasters and, of course, the good work done by my predecessor, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, during his tenure as Minister responsible for disaster management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our conceited opinion and as responsible stewards for the safety and security of our people, we must treat this Bill as a matter of utmost priority. The changing weather and hazards we are now facing due to the impacts of climate change means that we cannot rely on our past experience and lull ourselves into a false sense of security. In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the prompt enactment of the Bill ensures that all necessary protocols, funding and organisational structures are in place, to effectively manage and mitigate disaster risks, potentially savings lives and reducing damage before the start of the new cyclone season. There are several critical initiatives aimed at enhancing humanitarian coordination that needs to be in place before the cyclone season starts, such as the humanitarian actors registry that will control and streamline humanitarian action in the country, as well as the establishment of the disaster volunteer scheme that will ensure the protection of disaster volunteers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is one of Government’s policy reform actions of the joint budget support operation with multiple development partners, together with a contingent to a funding</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>870 Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 23 rd May, 2024 package of over $500 million. And by expanding the Bill under Standing Order 51 with referral to the Standing Committee, will surely demonstrate our collective commitment to protecting foreign and domestic investments in the country by reassuring investors and stakeholders of the country’s resilience and stability, thereby, maintaining economic confidence and preventing potential financial losses. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recommend that this Bill be referred to the Standing Committee for Justice, Law and Human Rights, with the Committee to revert to Parliament in the July or August sitting. I strongly urge honourable Members to support the motion that is before this august Parliament. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick word on the Bill that is before Parliament, I think everyone knows that this Bill was born out of TC Winston, one of the worst disasters that we have ever had in this country, and we understand the urgency with which it needs to be dealt with, bearing in mind that we are susceptible to so much in terms of climate change and all that happens around the country, and it has taken a bit of time to get to Parliament. I want to take this opportunity, Sir, to speak for and on behalf of the Committee. We welcome all the work but because of what we had mentioned earlier, Sir, our schedule would mean that we may not be able to bring it back in the July session. Hopefully, the mover of the motion will agree that it comes in the session afterwards - in August or September. The Bill is quite comprehensive, it will probably not require as much consultation, as I think a lot of work has been done but it certainly will require a little bit of scrutiny and we have it on good words from our Chairman, that we will do our absolute utmost with your help, Sir, to ensure that we actually get it done before August. It is very timely that we actually get this done as quickly as possible. For a nation like ours, it is very important that we get this done because it guides us in terms of NDMO and I am also under the gun because he is the former Minister, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. I have been given to understand that the honourable Minister has also, kind of, added something herewith a backslash August. Am I right, honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I will leave that in your good hands for your decision.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Thank you, so it is August. HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank everyone for all the hard work that has been done and I have no further comments to add. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Natural Disaster Risk Management (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 06/2024 committed to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and report back in the August sitting of Parliament]</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 871 HON. F. S. KOYA.- A Point of Order, Sir, just a quick clarification, unfortunately the printers have missed pages 58 and 59 in all the Bills, just so that the Secretary-General can be aware and get us the copies as quickly as possible. I think that applies to everyone. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, we are going to organise that. Thank you for notifying us, honourable Koya. The honourable Minister has given that to us, it is just a printing error. Honourable Members, the next two Bills are for debate and enactment. I also remind honourable Members that pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 20 th May, 2024 and on Tuesday, 21 st May, 2024 that the debate on each of the two Bills will be limited to one hour only. I hope I am very, very clear on that; two bills - one hour only. This is nothing new, especially those sitting on this side. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Bring it on! MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, I like that.</p></body>
