<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT –STANDING ORDERS OF PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – STANDING ORDERS OF PARLIAMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, I move: That the Amendments recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in its Report in the Review of the Standing Orders of Parliament to the Republic of Fiji be adopted today by Parliament.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak and debate the Amendment as recommended by the Standing Orders Committee in the review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament to the Republic of Fiji as we undertaken in the last couple of meetings. (Laughter) As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I tabled the report of the Standing Order Committee this morning after careful deliberation between the honourable Members of the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had alluded to when I tabled the report of the Standing Orders Committee this morning, I informed the Parliament that the Standing Orders Committee met on four separate occasions. On 1st May, 3rd May, 17th May and finally yesterday the 22nd of May, 2024 during lunch break.</p><div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div><p>896 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 23 rd May, 2024 On those occasions the Committee met and discussed Amendments to the Standing Orders. There were Amendments proposed by the Opposition which were missed during the Amendments to the Standing Orders last year, for obvious reasons as well as from the secretariat upon discussions with the UNDP consultant, Mr. Kevin Deveaux. At this juncture, I must convey my real appreciation on the extensive deliberation and work undertaken by the Standing Orders Committee and for reaching agreements on the Amendments. In that regard, I seek the honourable Members support for the motion this evening to enable the proposed Amendments by the Committee to be adopted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee agreed to the following to allow the secretariat to finalise the minutes of the meetings and draft of the Amended Standing Orders as well as the Committee’s Report on these documents were subsequently then conveyed to the Committee members for their perusal, their comments and finalisation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed Amendments to the Standing Orders which have been circulated to all honourable Members of Parliament are necessary because they impact the way Parliament conducts itself now and in moving forward. These proposed Amendment relate to performance, functions and the workings of our Parliament. In considering and reviewing the practices and procedures of Parliament, the proposed amendments which the Committee agreed to during its meetings on the four separate occasions as mentioned earlier in terms of the review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji I hereby present it to Parliament as mandated by Standing Order 128 which all honourable Members have hopefully received a hard as well as an e-copy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now proceed to the proposed amendments and these are only in the following provisions which relate to Standing Orders 37, 42, 45, 110, 122, 126, 127 and 137 respectively. The proposed amendments for Standing Order 37, where it is proposed to have a new insertion in the current provision where “when a petition is moved, it should be seconded and debated before the honourable Speaker proposes a question on the motion” to Parliament before it is considered whether it would be referred to the relevant Standing Committee or otherwise. On Standing Order 42, it is proposed amendment to increase Oral Questions to 10 by increasing the Opposition Oral Questions to five and by increasing the Government’s Oral Questions to five as opposed to the current eight questions that we now presently practice. On Standing Order 45, it is proposed as an amendment to the timing on asking Oral and Supplementary Questions to one minute and the responses by the Ministers must be ten minutes for the Oral Questions however the responses to the supplementary questions by the honourable Ministers would be from five minutes to 10 minutes. That is the first set of amendments. Mr. Speaker, Sir. The next set of amendments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are relating to Committee issues on Standing Orders 109(2)(b), 110(3), 112, 126 and 127. The proposed amendment pursuant to Standing Order 109(2)(b) was the inclusion of the word “aviation” as part of the mandate of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs as well as the proposed amendment to Standing Order 110 in terms of enquiry or intention to investigate component of the Standing Committees where terms of references would have to be provided by the Chairpersons but the terms of preference by, Mr. Speaker, would be used by the relevant Committee wanting to do enquiries.</p><div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 897 Mr. Speaker, Sir, also on the proposed amendment on Standing Order 122 was in regards to a resolution on the appointment of the appointing of sub-committees outlining its membership component and voting rights will spark of the sub-committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendment to Standing Order 126 is on the Whips of each Party to be included as Members to the House Committee because of the roles all Whips play in each of our political parties in Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as well as the proposed amendment to Standing Order 127, that before a Member is referred to the Privileges Committee, they should be given the opportunity to give a personal explanation pursuant to Standing Order 80 and at the discretion of the honourable Speaker, the matter may or may not be referred to the Privileges Committee. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the proposed amendment to Standing Order 137(2) where the correct amendment to the number is visible and is to be adopted. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion and as you would have known that by Convention, the Report of the Standing Orders Committee is a functional document, recommended amendments are reflected in Annexure 1 of the Report and the Minutes of the proceedings of the Committee are reflected in the Annexure 2 of the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to earlier, I convey much appreciation on the extensive deliberation that was conducted and work undertaken by the Standing Orders Committee on a very bipartisan level. I thank the Members and the Standing Orders Committee from both sides of Parliament and I hereby commend these amendments to Parliament and respectfully seek each of our Members of Parliaments’ support for the adoption of the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I also have a list of speakers in front of me, as follows: 1. Hon. A. A. Maharaj; 2. Hon. Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; and 3. Hon. V. Naupoto. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Vosarogo for presenting this particular report that had some extensive deliberation when the Committee was sitting. I would like to thank the Committee, even though a bit late, but the submission that was actually submitted by Opposition was finely discussed by the Committee and I am grateful to say that at least from our recommendation, four recommendations did make through which was quite substantial, especially being outnumbered in Standing Order Committee when we have five sitting from the Government side and only one representing the Opposition. I think that is something that we need to look atin the future as to how we can change the membership of the Standing Orders Committee to make it a bit bipartisan in nature. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first one that I would like to discuss a bit on is Standing Order 37 whereby a debate can be carried out by Members, we do know that most of the time Opposition Members bring in petitions. However, as discussed in the Committee stage, there would be other members who might actually hail from that particular location where the subject matter is from and they would like to contribute as it is their constituency as well and they represent the people from that place so they should be given a chance to speak before an informed decision is made by the Members whether they want to actually vote in favour of the petition or not.</p><div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div><p>898 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 23 rd May, 2024</p><h4>Secondly, there are 10 questions and additional question coming to Opposition.</h4><p>Next one is, Whips to be included in the House Committee. We have seen the Whips are the ones who are communicating basically with all the staff and House Committee is looking after the wellbeing and welfare of all the Members. It is appropriate for the Whips to be sitting on the House Committee. Fourth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we propose and we are happy that is passed and part of the Standing Committees whereby a Member of Parliament is given a chance to explain himself, if there is a matter of privilege. We are dealing with honourable Members and I think it is only right that the Member is heard in public before a decision is made by the honourable Speaker, whether a Member should be sent to Privileges Committee or not. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for being on our side when we were having a discussion because you also provided us some very fruitful contribution and that is one of the reasons why these matters were accepted by the Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are certain things that I would like to bring the attention that were not accepted by the Committee and as the saying goes, we should practice what we preach. If we are given a chance to change what is not being practiced, it would be a good opportunity for people to have and use that moment to change what you have been preaching about. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- One of them was the use of Standing Order 51, as stated in the meeting as well. We have nothing against the use of Standing Order 51, the Constitution allows it, the Standing Order allows it but our concern was if a Bill is lly brought under Standing Order 51 and to be debated and passed in a single sitting and is not referred to any particular Committee, the Members should not be restricted with any timeframe to scrutinize that particular Bill. At least in this Parliament, we should not actually have a timeframe whereby we restrict the Members to one hour or half an hour or two hours, especially if it is not being scrutinize by the Committee. As I have said, we should practice what we preach. The Opposition has been preaching this for the past eight years so it was a time for them to change the practice but unfortunately, they did not. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing that we requested was for</p><h4>Ministerial Statements …</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Get it right:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> … to be 10 minutes. During the past eight years, there were two parties in Opposition, so they were actually given five minutes each which accumulated to 10 minutes. I am not too sure what Government is afraid of, of giving us that 10 minutes to actually response to their Ministerial Statement but unfortunately did not go through and we are still stuck with five minutes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know by the time we stand up and get ready, two and half minutes has gone, by the time we come to the subject, the bell rings. So, if you want some fruitful and very important discussion with regards to the Ministerial Statement, I think we should have gone with the 10 minutes.</p><div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 899 The other thing that we have some gentlemen agreement now as part of the Committee was, that Parliament be given precedence. I know it is not part of the Standing Orders, it was supposed to be amended in such a way that we can actually have Members to give precedence to Parliament. One of the reasons why we brought this one was, either you are Member of a Committee, either you are an Assistant Minister, Minister or Prime Minister. First and foremost is, we are Members of Parliament, you are given that position just because you are Member of Parliament. So if you are in Parliament, your responsibility is to Parliament and to the people who have voted us because we have actually seen in Committee stages, even in the Select Committee or Standing Committee whereby Members they do not appear in Committees and the normal work of the Committees cannot go through either it be a Select Committee or Standing Committee. That was the request from our side to be incorporated unfortunately, it did not go through. The last one Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did recommend and we thought that the honourable Prime Minister would take this happily after years of experience in Parliament of having a 30-minute question and answer session for Prime Minister but unfortunately, that was declined as well. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- But literally, we thought that would be taken onboard as well but unfortunately, it is not. Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do support the motion that is before Parliament and we do support the changes that are coming to the Standing Order Committee.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Levu na vosa:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Minister for moving this motion and the contribution so far, particularly from my respective colleague, the former Whip for the Opposition. The proposed amendments as being articulated by the honourable Minister for Lands and I think that is actually quite clear to all of us, there is really no need to go too long into the details. But I would just like to make some clarifications on some of the issues raised by honourable Maharaj. We do not share anything in the Government, we are the Government after all. But I think, what I quite like Mr. Speaker, Sir, about the discussions in the Standing Orders Committee that there was enough goodwill on the part of the Government to accommodate some of the wishes, and these wishes as you very rightfully enforced in the Committee are good for democracy and also good for Parliament and our people. I have been in the Standing Orders Committee since the inception of all these sessions of Parliament. I have never enjoyed this environment of reaching consensus and I think it is quite a good spirit to enhance and I think the more we do this, I actually suggested this to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Chair of the Committee, that none of these orders are cast in stone. There is always provision for it to be changed as we go along. And as we mature as a Parliament, I am sure that a lot of these Standing Orders that has been the cause for concern over all this while will eventually be out the window, so as to allow much greater room for discussion, whether you be on this side of Parliament or that side, it is Parliament that actually reigns at the end of the day. Just on the matter of Standing Order 51, I have heard what honourable Maharaj has said but I know that I have moved the position of the Government to keep the order as it were. But I think as we go through developing maturity on the side of the Government that only really on matters that are really urgent that we need to use this order. Otherwise, I believe one of the steps that we are taking,</p><div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div><p>900 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 23 rd May, 2024 particularly these Bills that were passed today that had to go into Committee, first thing we need to continue to develop, allow more time for speaking and allow more time for scrutiny by the Committee. That can only be good for Parliament and the people but for now I think, the way Standing Order 51 is worded is adequate enough to accommodate all of our wishes until such time that we make it more liberal. Precedence of parliamentary business, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had spoke at length about this, particularly my opposition to the fact to actually write in the Standing Order the issue about precedence of Parliament. One of the main reasons for that, is that, Parliament must take precedence over everything, where it is necessary that either Members of the Opposition or Government must attend. I think it is quite clear that every once in a while, particularly in Government, there are times that we cannot be here. It means no disrespect but I think it is good Parliament practice that if you are not able to attend, you must seek the leave of the Speaker to be excused from Parliament and I think that is good practice and that is why we had asked for the provision not to be included. Prime Minister’s question time and urgent question, I think the provision of urgent oral questions to be posed to Government takes care of a lot of the urgent issues, so I believe at this time, the need for the Prime Minister’s question time and all the circus that encompasses it. I think we have been to the parliaments in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, you watch question time, it is just like a movie. It does not really augur well for the spirit of the Fijian Parliament which is part of the reason we think that maybe that should be kept in the back burner for a while. Nevertheless, I would really like to thank the contribution of the Government in this process and also my honourable colleagues from the other side in the discussions that we reached and I would like to re-emphasise the fact that the more this Parliament becomes mature, I think that will gives us the opportunity to continue to review these set of orders for what is best for this Parliament and best for our country. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a document that guides the work of this Parliament, the People’s House as we come in here and do the work of the people. It is quite an important document. When I went in to the first meeting, Sir, I realised I was the only one sitting on one side, all the other side was full and I thought to myself, “man, this is so unfair, I represent 26 seats and I get outnumbered all the time” my thought was, I am representing the Opposition and then it dawned on me that that was the wrong thought. I think that the right thinking when we go to amend this document is just to make sure that we the representatives of the people, when we come into this Parliament to do the work of the people that these documents allows us to do so and do so fairly. I think that in the past and maybe now, there is still this thinking of writing this document to benefit either that side of Parliament or this side. I think it should be written to benefit Parliament to ensure that both sides function properly to allow us to do the work of the people properly. All the recommendations that are in the document now, in my view are recommendations that will allow us to do our job as representatives of the people better, not good for the Opposition or good for Government, it is good for the Parliament as a whole for us to do the job as representatives of the people in this Parliament. I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as we go forward in looking at this document under your leadership, governs what we do in this the House of the People, that we will move away a little bit</p><div><a name="92">Page 92</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 901 from whether this benefits the Opposition or it benefits the Government, and you look at it as, “Okay, this document allows the Parliament of Fiji to do their job and do their properly.” I think that some of the changes that the honourable Minister was alluding to maybe will begin to go out and shape this document into one that is really focused on the work that we do as the representatives of the people. I support all the changes that are here, it reflects that need to have those changes in this document so that we are able to do our job properly. If we can move away from whether this document benefits Opposition or Government more, I think we will come up with a very good document that will in the end allow us to do our job better. I support the changes in these amendments that we have come through. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members of Parliament who have contributed to the motion on the Standing Orders which we have tabled in Parliament this morning and we are seeking to have it passage through tonight. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting, I have never considered it to be of that meaning when I was reading through yesterday and today - the reference to the Standing Orders being a living document. Sir, just when I was hearing my colleagues in Parliament share their experience, I realise that it is actually a document that is designed to grow, change overtime as our collective experience and advancing Parliament changes with time. So, I think some of the suggestions that have been suggested in this Parliament, the one that have been referred to in his speech by the honourable Alvick Maharaj, they were the same ones that have been referred to by the Opposition in 2014 to 2022 but you know, they did not do anything about it. We are doing something. The point that we wanted to make is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we come half-way, they need to work the other half. That is the way Parliament is supposed to work. In relations to the privilege, I thought that it was going to be mentioned by the honourable Tikoduadua being an ex-privileged Member, it provides for an opportunity and it is the sort of right environment that should be given. When someone is cited for privilege, this amendment actually gives ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- And the honourable Speaker:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.:</span> … and of course the honourable Speaker.</p><p>These amendments actually provides the privileged Member an opportunity to speak to the allegation before the complaint is referred to the Privileges Committee. It is an opportunity that was never there before. I am sure it is an opportunity as we had discussed also at the Committee level is, it provides the people of Fiji an opportunity for the person who has been privileged to be heard in open Parliament and to be heard by people who are going to be watching before everything else goes back and before it comes back to Parliament with recommendations. So that is the sort of fairness that we were quite prepared as Government side to concede because we think that it is the most fairest thing to do. Of course, I want to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to thank you for your guidance through the four meetings that has culminated in the adoption of what to be adopted amendments today. We thank you for your foresight and your timeless advice during the meetings in Committee.</p><div><a name="93">Page 93</a></div><p>902 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 23 rd May, 2024 Lastly, I wanted to say that now we are beginning to see shapes of the Standing Orders more into becoming the document that will ultimately and ultimately serve the interest of the people of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote on the motion. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today and before I go further in adjourning Parliament, I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you, especially the honourable Prime Minister, in providing his vision as well by way of the support that he gave that enabled us to visit Australia. This is the Standing Orders Committee and in doing so, we are also encouraged by his support that some of the new provisions that we have now will allow us to do oversight and scrutiny and also more importantly how we are going to better utilise the services of the 12 Members of Parliament in the Opposition, who do not belong to any Standing Committee or to be a Member of any Standing Committee as there are only six. However, we are grateful that through this hard work by the support from the honourable Prime Minister in allowing us to continue with that purpose, it has come to fruition now by seeing that is now part of the Standing Orders, and those Committees will be part of the sub-Committees of Standing Committees, and they can engage themselves in the work of the sub-Committees’ Standing Committees, but when it comes to the vote, it is the substantive Standing Committees will be doing the vote. So, this, honourable Members will only be heavily participating in all the work required by the terms of reference that is going to be provided for them to look in the scrutiny and oversight of the Bills. But, when it comes to the vote, it goes back to the substantive Standing Committee to make the vote. From that way, we protect the numbers from both from the Government and from the Opposition and also through the Standing Orders, you may find that we are very careful in the provision of the terms of reference to ensure we do not go beyond the perimeters of where we should be confining ourselves to in terms of scrutiny and oversight. This is to allow the sub-Committee of Standing Committees to do their work but without intruding, trespassing or going beyond what we are supposed to confine ourselves to, but ensuring that we are mindful of the perimeters of existing Government policies and more importantly, the legislations. So those are the few things I wish to highlight, and I wish to thank each and every one of you. The result of this has come about through our great work and like I said earlier on in some of our meetings, when we are seated in this august Parliament, I only look to each and every one of you who have taken the oath to be represented in this Parliament under the Constitution and simply equal in front of me, the Speaker, by being Members of Parliament. So, when we leave this august Parliament and go out, we are all Members of Parliament, and when we travel together, we should show solidarity there. In some of our overseas trips, in coming back. the way the protocol officers of Parliament organise their trips by going, is no problem. We are all traveling as one, but into returning, some of us do not have any seats. They had suggested to me, if they can fly to Sydney and back to Fiji. I said no, “We travel as one, we come back as one.” I think that is very important. Then, we will be projecting the image that we are all equal here - 55 Members of Parliament, period, no more, no less.</p><div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div><p>23 rd May, 2024 Review Report – Standing Orders of Parliament 903 I thank the honourable Prime Minister, thank you the Government side and the Opposition side. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 8.29 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94</p></body>
