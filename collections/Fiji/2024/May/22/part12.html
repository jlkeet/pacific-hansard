<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> The following honourable Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40, the: 1. Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 2. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 3. Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forests; 4. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; and 5.

Honourable Members, Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will then invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. I now call on the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs to deliver his Statement. Vanua Levu Road Upgrade Project MR. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very good morning to you. The honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of this august Parliament; ni bula vinaka. A very good morning to the students who are visiting us, those who have been acknowledged this morning and also those who have not been acknowledged, and to everyone tuning in into the live</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>756</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 broadcast of today’s Parliamentary Sitting; ni sa bula vina’a, namaste and good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Ministerial Statement on the Vanua Levu Road Upgrade Project. The Project is to be funded by a grant from the People’s Republic of China through the China International Development Co-operation Agency (CIDCA). It is anticipated that the road upgrade will stimulate development of tourism, renewable energy projects, including hydro power facilities and the transport and movement of people, including through the planned Nabouwalu township which is the main transport link to Vitilevu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the “One China Policy” has been the firm foundation of the Fiji-China diplomatic relations, founded some 49 years ago. As you are aware, Sir, I met President Xi Jinping on the margins of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) held in San Francisco in November last year. The key deliberations during our meeting centered around China’s global development initiatives, with a specific focus on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the BRI is designed to foster economic connectivity, trade, and cultural exchange, particularly through infrastructure development. This also resonates with our national development objectives. The BRI aligns with Fiji’s agenda, emphasizing shared goals of policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation and financial integration. Since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the BRI in 2018, bilateral and economic co-operation and people-to-people exchanges have yielded fruitful results. Fiji will continue to promote the cooperation with China under the framework of the BRI in areas such as infrastructure construction, renewable energy, agriculture and fisheries. In talks with President Xi, I emphasised Fiji and China’s strong historical ties, underpinned by shared aspirations and common interests, fostering a comprehensive strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust and respect. The multifaceted collaboration between Fiji and China spans people-to-people relations and cooperation across sectors such as agriculture, education, health, trade and investment, poverty reduction, infrastructure and climate change. President Xi and I also discussed practical matters, including Fiji’s concessional loan with China, as well as the Vanualevu Road Upgrading Project. As Minister responsible for Climate Change, I expressed our interest in collaborating with China on recycling initiatives, recognising the potential for economic incentives derived from China’s experience in industrial recycling processes. At this juncture, Sir, I wish to cordially thank the Ambassador Zhou Jian for our continuing discussions on the prospects for future cooperation in the areas of socio-economic development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the China Aid Project will improve the following roads in Vanualevu: 1. Part of the Nabouwalu-Makolei Road in Bua; 2. Natewa-West Coast in Cakaudrove (unfortunately, it does not go to my village); and 3. Nabalebale-Naviavia/Dawara Roads in Cakaudrove. The project is estimated to cost FJ$300 million and will be the flagship project under China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Fiji.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>757 Vanualevu has an area of 5,581.1 square kilometres or 2,157.2 square miles, and a population of 135,965, as confirmed by the 2019-2020 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey Report. The roads being upgraded are currently still unpaved gravel that connect rural village roads and need to be paved. Such road conditions increase travelling time, damage transported commodities and goods, are insufficient for current traffic loads, and restrict socio-economic development in general. Tabulated below are villages, schools and health facilities that will benefit from the 82 kilometre road upgrade. Road No. of villages No. of schools/tertiary No. of Health Facilities Nabouwalu/ Nasolo (15 km) Natewa West Coast (32 km) Wailevu West (35 km) Total 15 22 61 98 8 8 18 34 3 4 5 12 No. of Government Facilities 6 6 3 15 The project will fulfill our objectives to promote economic growth, foster fair distribution of development gains to the population and improving social conditions, particularly in the rural areas. As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, remote rural and island communities in Fiji are relatively poor and isolated from economic opportunities and social services, particularly when rural access roads and jetties are in poor condition. Further, our country is prone to disruptive natural events, such as tropical cyclones and resultant flooding. Fiji’s topography has restricted the 11,000 kilometre road network to spine or circumferential main roads with feeder roads, leaving few route alternatives. In the main urban areas, lower-level municipal roads are neglected, rough, and sometimes impassable. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, transport infrastructure and services are key to promoting economic growth and social development. Further, rural industries such as sugarcane farming, forestry and tourism rely on road access, for example, from plantations to processing plants and to our ports. This project will also facilitate better access to health facilities for those in districts of Vaturova, Koroalau, Wailevu, Solevu, Vuya and Nabouwalu, with a population of approximately 10,000. The upgrading and sealing of these rural roads will also enable better access to banks and financial institutions to boost the culture of savings, as well as to micro and small businesses. Further, the provision of good quality roads will ensure better transportation and linkages of quality farm produce to markets, middlemen, traders and processing plants for export purposes. Rural communities residing along the roads being upgraded will also have better access to Government services and offices. In fact, there are 12 Health Facilities and 15 Government Stations along these three roads currently. The current poor road conditions greatly affect operations for rural service providers. Poor road quality hinders access, and it is costly for those residing in the districts of Nadi, Solevu and</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>758</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 Vuya. The project will complete a major link in the strategic network and provide a faster route for traffic around the island of Vanua Levu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the project, a feasibility study was carried out earlier this year by a technical team from China. The team conducted a thorough investigation on road traffic and conditions. Ambassador Zhou Zian and I visited the team during the Study to discuss their preliminary findings, and I was pleased to host the team at Drekeniwai (my village) for afternoon tea. The Feasibility Report is now being finalised and will be studied by the China International Development Cooperation (CIDCA) before work commences. This project prioritizes areas requiring upgrading, such as this portion of Vanua Levu, previously overlooked. The project seamlessly continues the Fiji Roads Upgrading Programme (FRUP), which commenced soon after Independence by the Alliance Government. The FRUP was continued by the SVT Coalition Government in the 1990s and SDL Government in early 2006. This project connects the previous iterations of FRUP. In the past, the chiefs and leaders of Cakaudrove politely deferred road development to areas facing greater challenges in other parts of Fiji, “ Me ra liu mada o ira qore, Tu‘aqu, ‘tou qai muri o ‘edatou”. However, it is now time to address neglect and ensure we also improve road conditions. Previously, the Fiji Road Upgrading Projects (FRUP1, FRUP2, FRUP3) saw upgrades of the national highways on Viti Levu. These upgrades were based on the identified need and demand for transport and economic activities to be supported to benefit the large populations in those areas. This is also the case with this Vanua Levu Road Upgrading Projects. Mr. Speaker, Sir, future road upgrading plans will see round the island roads completed on the larger islands as infrastructure development projects flow to the remaining large islands and maritime provinces. The project is expected to commence in 2025. It is anticipated to be completed within 24 months to 36 months after completion of necessary technical work. Sir, I would like to express the Government’s appreciation to the people and the Government of China for their continued assistance and support. I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to deliver this Ministerial Statement on the Vanua Levu Roads Project. I thank the Government of China who are willing to come on board since we were isolated after the events of 1987, 2000 and 2006. They decided to stay with us, and we changed our policies. We introduced the Look North Policy, and they have been there since, when others are saying that the new Chinese influence has come into the region when they are only filling a vacuum left when our traditional partners at that time turned away from us. Vina’a vaalevu, dhanyavaad and shukriya. MR. SPEAKER.- I think I will be very diplomatic in refraining myself from making any comments. Maybe, the honourable Leader of the Opposition will be providing us with the necessary response. (Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought for a moment there that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was going to reply. (Laughter)</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>759 Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement today, talking about the planned developments on Vanua Levu. I think everyone in Vanua Levu looks forward to it, and it is a progressive development of all the things that had been done in the past, as pointed out under FRUP. Also, during the time that we were in office, we took the Look North Policy a step further forward. We developed the Northern Development Programme, and we saw some major developments such as the paving of the road from Nabouwalu up to Dreketi, the road to Bagasau and all developments in Vanua Levu. There continued to be a lot of challenges in Vanua Levu. When we came in, we found out that it was the second largest island in Fiji but still had a lot of major infrastructure challenges. During that time, there was quite a lot of development that was undertaken, and I am glad to see that this is now moving forward. I would also like to express our appreciation to the People’s Republic of China for their assistance to us, as their Prime Minister has been a good friend to Fiji through thick and thin. When others were not beside us, they were there to help us along during the years. We have also been seeing part of this Belt and Road Initiative. We are glad to see that this road is going to have an impact on road upgrades in various parts of Vanua Levu. A lot of us in Parliament have links to the Natewa-West Coast Road, villages along the coast of Saqani and all those areas are all looking forward to that assistance. There are a lot of industrial activities and agriculture take place in this area. Also, on the road from Naibalebale to Naviavia, down to Dawara, and also from Nabouwalu to Makolei. These are places where there are very good agricultural sites. A lot of work have been done there. With the port up in Nabouwalu, the passage of this road will allow production to increase and people to have good access to markets. As the honourable Prime Minister has pointed out, this will also allow access to schools and health facilities for the people who live along those roads. Sir, I congratulate this particular aspect. However, there are still some concerns. I think the Government needs to take note of some of the major issues that we need on roads in Vanua Levu. One, of course, is the major road that we have from Nayarabale to Vanuavou. This is a major access where people can cut across from the bay, moving quickly across to Labasa. This is a road that, once done, will open up a lot of economic opportunities for people in that particular area. There is a road also from Sevaci to Korotasere, that is the road that needs to be upgraded. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one very important one that cuts across from the South end of Vanua Levu that links up to Labasa is the Daria Road. That particular road still has splash crossings, and a lot of people travel on this road and move cargo to get to Labasa faster. I think that is a very important one that we need to address. Also, the road towards the other side of Vanua Levu, the Tukavesi/Napuka, Sir, that road will also require a lot of other repairs. There are a few other roads in Vanua Levu that I would like to mention for the Government to consider: 1. There has been a pilot cut in the Tikina o Navakasiga to the village of Naivaka. It is still a pilot cut. I would urge Government to see how that pilot cut can be completed so that that road is actually completed.</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>760</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 2. There is also a road that was mentioned by FRA, the road from Nasasa in Nadogo going up to Valevoni Village which is in Saqani. That is a road too that I am hoping that the people will be able to do it. 3. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the completion of the extension of the road from Naqolotu to linkup to Nabukelevu to complete the loop around the South end of Kadavu. I think that one will come in very handy for the people in that area, especially for honourable Koroilavesau. 4. A lot of needs for roaders in the upper reach of Naitisiri. 5. The last one that I am mentioning is the Hibiscus Highway. I was there two weeks ago. I have never seen it in the state that it is in now. I know that there is a planned project that exists, but I have never ever seen it in this state. I hope that that road will need to be ripped and remade because of the huge potholes. So, I am hopeful that the Government and the Minister responsible is aware of it. I know that there is a project plan in place but I just wanted to raise this because that is very critical for our tourism in that area. Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his</p><h4>Ministerial Statement this morning.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> At this juncture, I would also like to acknowledge the presence of a very senior partner of a big contractor in road making up in the North, Mr. Wise, who is sitting in the gallery and is in red shirt. He is a partner of RPA - a major contractor up there in the North. Welcome, Mr. Wise. Also, for those who I have not mentioned, we welcome you to today’s sitting. Well, we have heard from the Opposition the roads – he has jumped from Vanua Levu to Kadavu, and that is what we are here for. We have to highlight all these to bring the attention of the Government of the day to the plight that the people are encountering. ICT Development - Starlink Satellite Technology HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you and apologies for the premature rise, but I suppose I am probably as good as any authority on Vanua Levu being a vasu from Vanua Levu that I am, I did not stop the new development. The Opposition was wanting to stand up as well. (Laughter) But, leaving that aside, on behalf of this august Parliament, let me welcome the students from Marist Brothers Primary School. It was a rival school to my school, which is Suva Methodist Primary School. We welcome you here today and hope you will learn something from your Parliament. In Parliament, sometimes we are a bit loud but trust me, it is done in the spirit of trying to serve our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today to provide an update in terms of the efforts being undertaken regarding ICT development by the ‘do nothing’ Government, Sir, including the recent announcement of Starlink officially commencing its services in Fiji. This marks a significant milestone for our nation, as the highly anticipated introduction of Starlink Satellite Technology is, indeed, a game changer, particularly in further empowering remote, maritime and underserved communities.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>761 This also demonstrates the increased confidence of global companies in Fiji and in the region, as evidenced by Google’s extension of subsea cable connections to Fiji and the region. These strategic engagements and developments tangibly contribute to the Coalition Government’s goal of diversifying the economy of Fiji, rebuilding the economic architecture of Fiji, progressing into a more digital economy and cementing Fiji as the hub of the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform this august Parliament that we are making more progress in this regard. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding Starlink and to provide some background, in November last year, Starlink was issued with a Spectrum Licence by the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, and a Telecommunications Licence by the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji (TAF). Following that, Starlink was then to carry out the necessary compliance procedures and arrangements to operationalise in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of satellite technology is not new, as our service providers have been employing the use of satellite technology through partnerships with Oneweb, International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Intelsat) and Kacific, to progressively connect our unconnected rural communities. But what is new is that now, our people can directly utilise the services of a satellite provider and currently, only Starlink has acquired a licence to do that in Fiji. If you like, Sir, as we say in Tailevu, it is the democratisation of communications globally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will also hear me throughout this Statement reference LEW, which is the acronym for a category of satellites, known as Low Earth Orbiting Satellites. This category of satellites, as the name suggests, fly closer to earth compared to other satellites (at around 200 kilometres above the earth as opposed to 1200 kilometres above the earth). Starlink and Oneweb are LEOs. The Kacific, which is also used in Fiji by our service providers, is part of another category of satellites known as Geostationary Orbit Satellites (GEOs). The benefits of LEOs extend beyond high-speed internet. Its resilience during emergencies and capacity for rapid disaster recovery are particularly noteworthy and in the Fiji context, this is quite significant. Unlike traditional land-based infrastructure, which can be severely damaged by natural disasters, LEO satellites network remain generally unaffected. This was demonstrated firsthand when Starlink reconnected our neighbours Tonga after the 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption which severed over 200 kilometres of its vital undersea cable communications, cutting off its link to the world. The length of the severed cable link was roughly the distance between Suva and Nadi through the Queen’s Highway. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to announce that as of 20 th May, 2024, our people can now directly subscribe to Starlink’s services via their company’s website. We had anticipated that this news would come earlier, Sir, however, due to some logistical and operational challenges in preparing to operationalise, there was a delay between the approval and them starting on the ground. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the regulatory front, I understand that during this period, some individuals and businesses had purchased Starlink kits from abroad and Starlink is currently working with TAF, to ensure that all Starlink devices and services operating in Fiji are compliant with our regulations. I see from the Starlink website that there are packages available for personal and business use already, and I am sure that this will catapult the internet in our underserved regions, providing new opportunities for education, health, business and personal communication. I would also like to urge our local telecommunications operators to take advantage of the opportunities presented by Starlink’s entry into our market. I understand that our providers have</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>762</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 been partnering with other satellite providers to provide this connectivity to remote and rural communities. By leveraging this technology, operators have further options to provide backhaul services to areas that were previously unreachable or prohibitively expensive to connect. This collaboration will further enhance our national connectivity and will contribute to ensure that no region is left behind in our digital transformation journey. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to note that satellite internet connectivity through LEOs is not a panacea to all our challenges in providing meaningful connectivity to our people. Like everything in life, Sir, it has its advantages and disadvantages. While satellite connectivity has a pivotal role, particularly in reaching the most remote areas and especially in disaster management, terrestrial communication technologies play an equally critical role in our national connectivity. Terrestrial communication technologies, such as fibre optic networks and cellular infrastructure, are advancing rapidly. Two of our service providers are making significant strides in this area and are continuing their 5G testing right now and providing live user trials. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November last year, I briefed Parliament on Google’s South Pacific Connect initiative in Fiji and today, I would like to share an update on the ongoing efforts. The Ministry, through our Trade Commission in San Francisco and the team at Investment Fiji, have been working closely with Google, to ensure that adequate assistance is provided as Google works to complete regulatory compliances and further their engagements in Fiji. I had recently led a Trade Mission to North America as part of the North America Business Mission where key members of the Fiji Delegation met with representatives of the Google Network Infrastructure for a project update. Google’s Vice President of Global Network Infrastructure was one of the keynote speakers at the North America Business Forum that was held in San Francisco on 8 th May, 2024, and this shows the company's commitment, not only in its investment in Fiji but also being a reputable partner, showcasing Fiji's capabilities to potential investors. Alongside this, our Director-General Digital Government Transformation, Cybersecurity and Communications was attending the Cyber and Tech Retreat and was initiating discussions with Google's Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Policy on other areas of collaboration, utilising new and emerging technologies and also artificial intelligence. These demonstrate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a coordinated and extensive approach that we are taking. I am looking forward to many more collaborative and strategic partnerships and initiatives as a result of this. In addition to the Honomoana and Tabua subsea cables that was recently announced, Google has also announced that it will deliver two new intra-Pacific cables, namely, the Bulikula and Halaihai, in collaboration with Amalgamated Telecom Holdings (ATH), APTelecom and Telstra, to increase digital connectivity in the Central Pacific. The Bulikula cable will connect Guam with Fiji and potentially onward to South-East Asia, while the second cable will link Guam, French Polynesia through to Fiji and onward potentially to South America. This will form a ring between Guam, French Polynesia and Fiji, while connecting Fiji to Australia and the United States. The ring will also include pre-positioned branching units, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that will allow other Pacific Island countries to set up connections - a second connection. This will make Fiji truly the hub of the Pacific and continue this Government's desire to create benefits for all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to share the promising future that subsea internet investment has for our nation. According to a report titled, "Connecting Fiji: The opportunity for growth and</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>763 prosperity from subsea cable internet investment" by a company called Access Partnership, the new subsea cable infrastructure is set to significantly enhance our economic output through increased internet usage by reducing IP transit prices and network latency. A more dynamic local subsea cable market is projected to lower IP transit prices by 1.4 percent annually, spurring higher internet data traffic growth by, at least, 0.9 percent each year. These advancements are estimated to boost our global GDP by US$295 million by 2030, and create nearly 3,600 jobs, representing 1 percent of our 2019 figures. Investing in subsea internet infrastructure is a significant step towards a more prosperous and connected Fiji. These initiatives reiterate the Coalition Government's understanding that a resilient and modern ICT infrastructure is the backbone of any digital transformation effort in Fiji. Therefore, we have earmarked various key Government services to be digitised through our ongoing Business Now Project. Phase 1 will involve digitising several "Starting a Business" services and Phase 2 involves automating the approval through Town and Country Planning. This will truly transform how the technology is being used in Government and the good news is we would not be stopping there. Through the platform that is being provided which is called Fiji Integrated Licences and Permits Approval System (FILPAS), we will be able to digitise more of the licensing processes and permits across all the Ministries quite rapidly. Apart from this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a National Digital Strategy being developed for Fiji. In fact, next week, we are holding the validation workshop for the strategy. That is how fast, Sir, we are moving in terms of digital transformation. We are also planning at the commencement of the Budget to fully announce our desire to connect the unconnected around the country. We have a bit of money in the Trust Accounts, and we will put that to good use, also inviting some development partners to top it up to ensure that we connect. One of the things that is becoming obvious as well is that, with this improved ICT infrastructure or enhanced ICT infrastructure, we will need to position the education curriculum to be able to capture the benefits from this new emerging restructure of the Fijian economy. To the students of Marist Brothers, start looking for jobs in IT and technology. Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the vast adoption of digital technologies by our people, we are also mindful that this will also increase the threat landscape. Therefore, we are undertaking parallel efforts to bolster our cybersecurity efforts, and I will speak more on this in my response to the motion that the honourable Attorney General will be tabling today on the adoption of the Budapest Convention. One thing is clear, Sir, these ICT developments reiterate the need for Government to accede to the Budapest Convention as it is the only international treaty that is dealing with cybercrime and electronic evidence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, the entry of Starlink into Fiji’s market, as well as Google’s ongoing project and our digitalization efforts, marks an exciting new chapter in our efforts to expand internet access, improve connectivity and make services accessible for all. These initiatives underscore our commitment to bridging the digital divide and ensuring that all our people have the tools and opportunities to succeed in the digital age. The Coalition Government remains dedicated to supporting and fostering such advancements, and we look forward to the numerous benefits that these ICT developments will bring to our nation, and to the region. Mr. Speaker, Sir, together, we are building a more connected, inclusive, and prosperous Fiji, and by extension, a prosperous Pacific region. Thank you for this opportunity, Sir.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>764</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this juncture, I intend to adjourn Parliament for tea. In so doing, I take this opportunity to invite the students of Marist Primary School and those members of the public sitting in the gallery to join our honourable Members of Parliament for morning tea at the Big Committee Room. The Parliament adjourned at 10.43 a.m.</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>765 The Parliament resumed at 11.29 a.m.</p><h4>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we have only five minutes, I will try and be as</h4><p>quick as possible, with all the information that I have. Mr. Speaker, I take my hat off to the honourable Minister with respect to moving the ICT section forward and doing so much work, in terms of continuity also in terms of growing Fiji. As we all know, Sir, Fiji, despite our geographical challenges, we remain one of the most developed countries in terms of ICT in our region. I took a cursory glance over a report that was done by the Department of Commerce from USA, and this is coming from the International Trade Administration. They have done a thorough examination of our system - this is for investors to have a look at and there are some very good bits of critical information that have come up. So, in that report, they have mentioned how we have benefitted from it and this is totally independent of what we may say from different sides of Parliament. It basically spelt out how we benefitted from an extensive submarine cable networking which connects Fiji to neighbouring Pacific islands, we have operators, like Vodafone Fiji, Amalgamated Telecom Holdings (ATH), Telecom Fiji Limited, Digicel Fiji, and now we have Starlink as part of the whole ICT landscape. We still have a small issue regarding 5 percent of our country still not having mobile network coverage, but this inclusion by Starlink will benefit our rural communities. The only thing that I see, and I had a chat with the honourable Minister about this, it may be a little cost prohibitive, at the moment, for our rural communities. In my five minutes, I want to emphasize here, and I hope the honourable Minister of Finance will support the honourable Minister for Trade in may be looking at an avenue where we can subsidise this so that our communities are able to access this particular Starlink services being provided because right now, it is very cost prohibitive, and it is in its infancy status. Honourable Minister of Finance, on behalf of the rural people, I think we both speak the same language so, please, ensure and maybe there is some subsidy to our rural communities with respect to the service. Our ICT platform, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been fantastic. We have got mobile money which was introduced to us in Fiji where we can pay our bills, we can deposit, and we can also withdraw. It is actually a phenomenal platform to build on. But there are things that we must open our eyes to and be very careful about and I think the report itself actually says it. There are recent regional studies that have been done that have said that with the increased connectivity that we have, the region faces risks, and these particular risks are cyber-attacks. When you get into this particular space, you are also getting into the illegal space where you are actually going to be very, very vulnerable. The potential for this to cause financial loss and harm is actually great, fraud in terms of unauthorized access to banking, et cetera, all of those things, and the well- being of our citizens is at stake. Whilst we do this, whilst we open up and whilst we make this landscape modern in terms of a modern nation State and look at it like that, we must be very wary of these particular cyber-attacks that actually happen. Mobile security applications and software applications will also be increasingly in demand.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>766</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, it helps our business process outsourcing area and that was an area that we looked at which was going to be a phenomenal amount of business for Fiji. Also in the cyber-security operations, we could actually benefit out of all of this. As I have said, Telecom Fiji Limited is a regulator and that is something that we would need to look at, honourable Attorney-General, in terms of the regulations or laws that need to be put into this space. The modernization of these laws is a very important area but, at the same time, we must not have blinkers on, we must look at it in terms of how we can protect it and make sure that we protect our citizens. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have only got 15 seconds left but I did promise the honourable Minister that I was being supportive of this. Thank you, Sir. Logging Operations in the Maritime Islands HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; ni sa bula vinaka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the progress of our logging operation in the maritime islands, a vital project that contributes to our economy and supports our local communities, a project where Government has also re-strategised and invested heavily in since this financial year, recognising and addressing the plight of our resource owners on these islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total area of pine to be harvested in Muani, Kadavu, for this project amounts to 83 hectares - a significant undertaking that requires careful planning, considerable logistics and inter-agency coordination before execution. I am pleased to announce that $600,000 was released last Friday from the Ministry of Finance to meet the barge costs for Muani. Mr. Speaker, Sir, groundwork costs, including field verification for stocktaking as a requirement for harvesting licence and Muani Jetty scoping works came to a total of $13,500. The barge grant of $600,000 will cover the transportation of six barge loads, each carrying 2,000 tonnes from Muani to Lautoka Port. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that the logging companies, Drelaga Holdings Limited and Burning Bush Pte Limited, are currently conducting logging in Muani. The expected first load is scheduled for 1 st June, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to highlight the details of the machines that make up the logging fleet currently in Muani - a total of four John Deer Skidders, three CAT Bell Loaders, one CAT Front loader, one CAT Bulldozer and three trucks – one 12-wheeler and two 10 wheelers. In addition, four twin cabs are used as standby vehicles on site. These machines and vehicles are essential for the successful transportation, stacking and stockpiling of logs at every stage of our operation as per standard requirement of harvesting plans. The harvesting crew consists of 30 dedicated contractors, each with their own specific roles, from machine operators to chainsaw operators, all working together to ensure the smooth operation of our harvesting project. These workers are currently camping in the village of Muani, with accommodation provided by the landowners for the comfort and convenience of the contractors. With guidance from the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), the port construction is anticipated to be completed on 24 th May, 2024, subject to favourable weather conditions.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>767 Mr. Speaker, Sir, importantly, the landowners will be paid by Tropik Wood Industries Ltd at the rate of $60 per tonne, resulting in an expected total payout of $0.8 million. This financial support will not only benefit the landowners but also underlines our commitment to fostering positive relationships with our communities who are relying on Government for technical support towards investments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same initiative has been projected for Lakeba whereby another $250,000 has been released as an additional grant to Fiji Pine Trust from the Ministry of Finance. This will be for the construction of a port in Wainiyabia, Lakeba in consultation with the Fiji Roads Authority. The Forest Power House, a company that will be contracted to construct the Lakeba Port is expected to start before the month end. The harvesting licence is currently being progressed to ensure all requirements are complied with. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the expected return for the landowners in Lakeba will be $960,000 for the initial licence area of 83 hectares. The total area stocked in Lakeba is about 700 hectares and licences will be progressively determined based on current levels of compliance and preparation of harvesting plans for identified viable areas suitable for harvesting. The Ministry is working closely with the Fiji Pine Trust in developing a 20-Year Forest Management Plan with harvesting schedules for all pine schemes in the maritime islands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Narocake Pine Scheme in Gau has also been assisted through Forestry’s Pine Development Capital Project in processing pine posts. The Ministry has committed a total of $25,000 and produced a volume of 79 cubic metres worth of $59,724.75 from these sales. With these funds, the Narocake Pine Scheme also was able to purchase a three-tonne canopy truck together with the assistance from the Ministry of Trade and Co-operatives, the Scheme managed to develop the Narocake Co-operative Limited as part of our Community Development Programme for Fiji Pine Trust grant and Head 32 - Maritime Pine Development. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under Head 50, Moala and Lakeba had been assisted in the Housing Rehabilitation Programme. A total of 82.5 cubic metres for Moala, which is equivalent to 15 house frames and 60.5 cubic metres for Lakeba, which is equivalent to 11 house frames were funded. The value of timber harvested and processed for Lakeba house frames is $66,550 and $90,750 for Moala. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are various measurable outputs and outcomes from these maritime project support and beneficiaries, including the communities, private sectors and the nation as a whole. For the communities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are: 1. 2. 3. Financial benefits: This includes the payment of $60 per tonne to landowners, resulting in a total payout of $0.8 million. This direct financial support will enhance the livelihoods of the local landowners and their families. Employment opportunities for the communities: The project will create numerous job opportunities in logging, transportation, and pot operations, leading to increased employment in the local communities. Infrastructure development: The construction and upgrading of port facilities, guided by the Fiji Roads Authority will improve local infrastructure, providing long-term benefits to the communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the private sector will also benefit through:</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>768</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 1. 2. 3. Economic activities: The release of $647,000 to Tropik Wood Industries will stimulate the activities within the private sector through barge subsidy. Business opportunities: The logistics and transportation sectors will benefit from the movement of six barge loads, each carrying 2000 tonnes of logs, creating new business opportunities and partnership. Sustainable practice: By adhering to sustainable logging practice the private sector can demonstrate its commitment to environmental stewardship, corporate social responsibility, enhancing its reputation to ensuring a long-term viability. For the nation as a whole, there will be: 1. 2. 3. 4. Expected economic growth: The overall economic contribution of this logging operation, including job-creation and business opportunities will support national economic growth. - Sustainable Development: the project aligns with our national goals of promoting sustainable practices ensuring that our natural resources are managed responsibly for future generations. Enhanced Infrastructure: the improvements in port facilities and related infrastructure will have lasting positive impacts on national logistics and capabilities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the cooperation and assistance of our financial and investment partners we are confident that this long overdue harvesting of matured maritime pine project will yield positive outcomes for all stakeholders involved. Together, we can continue to drive economic growth, promote sustainable practices, ensure improved livelihoods and support the wellbeing of our people. Thank you for this opportunity, vinaka. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for the response. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to respond to the honourable Minister’s Statement. I also wish to thank the honourable Minister for this initiative in cultivating the pine plantations in the maritime islands. Most of these pine trees have been standing from 40 to 50 years and most have been destroyed by cyclone or fire. So, the holdings now that are available for logging will be much lesser than what was initially planted 40 years ago. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Government for responding to the request. Most of these pine plantations run under the scheme of landowners. The planting of the pine was done on an ad hoc basis where the advice to the landowners who were providing the labourers to actually plant the pine seedlings in the initial stage. So, planting of the pine were done on an ad hoc basis and I mean some of the pine were planted on the hillside which the landowners now find difficulty in accessing them. I can say that around Ono in Kadavu the landowners introduced bullocks to pull pine logs, but they had difficulty, and I am thankful to the honourable Minister for initiating this plan to try and harvest this pine scheme.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>769 The honourable Minister stated that they have allocated $250,000 for a jetty at Wainiyabia. I would urge him to check that amount if it will be able to build a jetty. I know for a fact that deep waters in Wainiyabia is about 200 metres from the shoreline, $250,000, I think is at the lower end of the scale. I agree with the honourable Minister that the development on the infrastructure, roads and wharves to be built to access this pine logging would give access to other natural resources, farmers will be able to access their farms and will provide the impetus for them to farm and sell their products to the market. I think that is a positive outlook that can be reached out of this scheme that is going on now. I understand if the logs are left to stand without this assistance, these logs will finally be destroyed. The landowners do not have the capacity nor the financial background to be able to harvest even though they had laboured in the past 40 years not only to plant these pine plantations but also to look after them during all these years. This is a positive move and I urge the Government to provide more assistance to the Fiji Pine Trust which has been looking after this pine plantation for the last 30 years. I understand that Fiji Pine initiated this move but found out that it was uneconomical midway 20 years or 30 years ago and abandoned the initiative and that responsibility was given to the Fiji Pine Trust. I would urge that more funding is given to the Fiji Pine Trust to assist them to assist all the landowners who are owners of these pine schemes. They are isolated and with the distance from the market, it is quite difficult for them to transport to either Lautoka or the other markets that are available to resale these commodities to merchants. Again, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for realistic and I hope that this initiative will go to the other islands in the maritime zone of Lomaiviti, Lau and in Kadavu. Fiji’s Transition to Open Skies HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I am honored to enlighten this distinguished Parliament regarding the Open Skies Air Services Agreements in relation to Fiji’s Aviation Policy. Fiji's aviation sector is pivotal, linking Fijians globally, bolstering tourism, trade and employment, and serving our Pacific communities. It is a cornerstone of economic activity, with various metrics highlighting its significance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has endorsed amending the Civil Aviation Policy to adopt open skies on a case-by-case basis, recognising both global benefits and regional challenges. The industry is a global connector, fostering interactions among people, cultures, and businesses. It is a substantial economic contributor, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reporting that Fiji's air transport, including airlines and their supply chain, supports US$465 billion of GDP, with foreign tourism adding US$1.7 billion, totaling 43 percent of the nation's GDP. Despite the challenges, aviation has shown resilience and growth, doubling in size every 15 years. Fiji's aviation policy framework aims to enhance connectivity, ensuring efficient market access, air navigation, aircraft and airport systems, and security, yielding benefits like improved travel experiences, economic growth, and increased traffic.</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>770</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker Sir, the aviation industry's access to markets worldwide relies heavily on the Air Services Agreement (ASA). Also known as air transport agreements or bilateral and multilateral air agreements, these contracts between countries set the terms and regulations for international air transport services. They provide the framework for airlines from participating countries to offer passenger and cargo services. As an illustration, Fiji has 27 traditional bilateral ASAs with other nations. For instance, our current ASA with the United States permits Fiji Airways to fly to Honolulu, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Any expansion to additional US destinations would require further negotiations between the Fijian and US Governments. Efforts over the past few years to amend this Agreement with the United States have been unsuccessful. The United States is a leader in Open Skies ASAs and has always viewed Fiji Aviation Policy as restrictive. Traditional ASAs govern several critical areas, including airline designation, ownership and control, routes and capacity, tariffs and pricing, safety and security, customs and immigration, as well as code-sharing and alliances. Mr. Speaker Sir, traditional bilateral ASAs often involved reciprocal benefits, where each country secured advantages for their carriers, sometimes neglecting consumer interests. Increasing international market access for air service providers is crucial for maximizing the air transport sector's economic contribution. Liberalization, as seen in open-skies agreements, reduces regulations on capacity and frequency, fostering competition, promoting travel and trade, and boosting productivity. Open skies agreements allow unlimited commercial services by designated airlines without needing explicit ministerial approval for routes, capacity, frequency and pricing. Sovereignty is preserved, with interventions limited to safety and security. These agreements liberalize and deregulate the international aviation market. Key features include no route restrictions, unlimited frequency and capacity, and deregulated pricing, where airlines set fares based on market conditions. Mr. Speaker Sir, the degree of "sky openness" is determined by the nine "freedoms of the air" outlined in the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation: First Freedom: Fly across a country without landing. 1. 2. Second Freedom: Land for non-traffic purposes. 3. Third Freedom: Drop off passengers from the airline's home country. 4. Fourth Freedom: Pick up passengers to take to the airline's home country. 5. Fifth Freedom: Carry passengers between two foreign countries during flights that also touch the airline's home country. Beyond these, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) considers the additional freedoms "so-called" as they are not widely recognised by treaty: 6. Sixth Freedom: Carry passengers between two foreign countries via the airline’s home country. 7. Seventh Freedom: Operate flights between two foreign countries without touching the airline's home country. 8. Eighth Freedom: Transport cabotage traffic between two points within a foreign country, as part of a flight to/from the home country. 9. Ninth Freedom: Transport cabotage traffic entirely within a foreign country.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>771 Mr. Speaker, Sir, bilateral Open Skies ASAs provide unrestricted market access, including Third Freedom, Fourth Freedom and Fifth Freedom traffic rights, capacity, frequencies, code-sharing and tariffs. The first Agreement was signed in 1992 between the Netherlands and the United States. Since then, over 300 such Agreements have been signed involving more than 150 countries, with the US leading with 119 Agreements. Many countries have also signed Open Skies Agreements with the European Union or its members. Open Skies Agreements have driven the continuous growth of air traffic. These measures enhance market and capital access, leading to better connectivity, sustainable economic development, and stronger, more passenger-friendly carriers and airports. Opening the air transport market results in more efficient airspace utilisation, competitive fares and more travel choices. Liberalisation positively impacts tourism, employment and the economy. Improved air cargo connectivity boosts productivity, opens new markets, enhances exports and increases domestic market competition from foreign producers. The push for regulatory convergence on liberalisation and competition at bilateral and regional levels underscores its importance. Mr. Speaker Sir, we are now embracing open skies boldly. The Maldives, similar to other Small Island Developing States, like Fiji, faces limitations due to small land mass and high transport costs. However, its open skies policy has eliminated isolation issues, ensuring good connections to labour and markets. In 2023, the Maldives welcomed 1,878,537 visitors, a 12.1 percent increase from 2022, showing the benefits of open skies. Our neighbours Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, have adopted open skies policies, reaping benefits such as increased travel and trade, enhanced productivity and high-quality job creation. We must envision a future without constraints. While Fiji previously believed that open skies were unsuitable for small economies, this has not been tested. Our Coalition Government is now promoting and adopting open skies. Mr. Speaker Sir, with liberalisation, discussions are underway with the United States to finalize an Open Skies Agreement, allowing our national airline to operate to various US destinations, thereby boosting trade and tourism. We support our national airline and are committed to elevating our economic growth through enhanced air connectivity, competition and better consumer choices. We have embraced open skies in our Aviation Policy, to ensure Fiji is not left behind. Mr. Speaker Sir, the Coalition Government fully supports our national airline's network diversification plans to enhance profitability through the open skies policies. We believe Open Skies Agreements will enable airlines to operate commercially, allocate capital efficiently and adapt to changes. This policy will help our national airline expand, optimise capacity and ownership, and improve return on investment. We will, however, closely monitor global open skies trends to ensure no negative impact on our national airline. We have taken a balanced approach to liberalisation, providing flexibility and freedom, while ensuring local air transport remains profitable and continuous. Fiji commits to evaluating Open Skies Agreements individually, considering economic, strategic and operational factors. We support this transition to open skies, working with stakeholders to ensure it aligns with national objectives. This policy balances global open skies trends with Fiji's unique context, emphasising flexibility, pragmatism and national interests. For tourism, Fiji achieved a significant milestone by welcoming a record 929,740 visitors in 2023. This surge in tourism contributed to over FJ$3.3 billion in revenue, exceeding our financial goals a year ahead of schedule.</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>772</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 Looking forward into 2024, we expect a steady growth in visitor arrivals, projected to increase by 2 percent to 5 percent, compared to the previous year. With improved airline capacity, we anticipate better accessibility to our islands at an average of 8 percent to 12 percent increase in flights. The thriving investment environment in Fiji, marked by the opening of new resorts and the launch of significant developments, signals a strong investment scene, promising a bright future for our tourism sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next four years, we plan to grow our visitor economy by an additional $1 billion and that is very exciting, indeed, for Fiji. I was horrified by the poor attitude shown by honourable Maharaj towards Tourism. He said on Monday, and I quote, “Vanua Levu economy does not depend on tourism, we do not rely on tourism”. Mr. Speaker, Vanua Levu has huge potential for tourism and tourists increase its share for the billions in tourism and help make more billions from tourism for Fiji. He scoffed at the US$200 billion that will be deployed in Vanua Levu to improve the infrastructure and improve the opportunities for tourism. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very poor, very poor! HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- That is $447 million, Mr. Speaker. I wish you would all agree that tourism is important also for Vanua Levu, and for the Coalition Government, we are plying apply about US$200 million to create an environment conducive to the tourism industry.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> $10 million hotel development.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. R. GAVOKA.:</span> I know, Mr. Speaker, that the air fare is still high in Vanua Levu, but with these improved investments, improve in infrastructure, with ATR landing in Taveuni and Labasa and better connectivity in Savusavu with frequency and volume, the air fares will come down. It is simple economics, so we are getting there. (Honourable Opposition Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> You have no idea, no idea.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> With more frequency and more volume, the air fare will come down.</p><p>So, it is not aggressively/drastically stopping at all these programmes. The Open Skies policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is expected to significantly enhance Fiji’s tourism industry, a major source of revenue and employment. This policy change, is set to create new opportunities for Fiji’s tourism and aviation industries, improve connectivity and potentially increase visitor numbers, which are crucial for the island nation’s economy. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Open Skies offer significant economic benefits for consumers, airlines, airports, communities and economies. Increasing international market access to our national airline is crucial for maximising the air transport sector’s economic contribution. Let us unite in support of Fiji Airways and allow it to thrive under the Open Skies Policy. Vinaka vakalevu. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I want to reiterate, I have only got five minutes but I want to start off with the quote from a message delivered by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation on 7 th March, 2023, which is a good date to</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>773 remember because 7 th is my birthday, and I quote: “For a small country like Fiji, you cannot go for open skies because when you go for open skies, the big boys …</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Case by case:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Not case by case, just listen. This was only 12 months ago.</p><p>“When you go for open skies, the big boys can come and compete with our national airlines and that will be damaging for us, and we need our airlines to survive.” (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> 12 months ago he said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. K. LAL.:</span> Hear, hear! HON. F. S. KOYA.- There are many things. We all support tourism…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> It’s on a one-on-one basis.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> But remember this, open skies could be the death warrant for Fiji Airways, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, two of the most important people in the industry would be the Minister responsible for Tourism and Civil Aviation and the CEO of Fiji Airways. Let me quote about what the CEO for Fiji Airways, Mr. Andre Viljoen, actually said in June 2018. He expressed concerns about the impact of open skies policy on a small national carrier, like Fiji Airways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what you call, ‘flipping and flopping’. (Chorus of interjections) HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the same CEO, and he warned that while increased competition might lower airfares, it could also lead to the demise of the national airlines. (Chorus of interjections) HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, this very airline saved our behind during COVID-19, so we must protect it at all costs, Sir. If we start even thinking about Open Skies, he spoke about all the different freedoms, Mr. Speaker, we are asking for trouble if we really go down the road because his narrative now, his open skies, what can we do for Fiji? Sir, we have not even done our homework with respect to that at the moment. He mentioned Maldives very proudly. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Maldives does not even have an international airline anymore because of this Open Skies Policy. He is buried and dead, Sir. We cannot, we must not, and we should not ever go down this road where we are actually going to write and basically write a death warrant for Fiji Airways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what changed in the last 12 months? What has actually changed? (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>774</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 HON. F. S. KOYA.- No, no, he has changed. The CEO of Fiji Airways has changed. Do not wave because I do not think you know anything about it. Countries that have adopted Open Skies policy, invariably, what happens is that the larger airlines actually come in and cannibalise the local airlines. Sir, we cannot compete, but we have done this in such a sustainable fashion uptil now. Why can we not continue to do so? We cannot even cater for more tourists, at the moment, because we do not have the necessary hotels. We need to concentrate on building more hotels, so that is probably what the target should be, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking about Open Skies now should be something at a very much later stage. We need to put more rooms on the ground. Investments and policies need to be created for that. We have had office from the Emirates, the US, so why are we now pandering to all those things that we should not be doing right now, because the necessary infrastructure with respect to more tourists in Fiji is not on the ground yet? We want tourism to grow, I am telling you, honourable Minister. Of course, we want tourism to grow. We want tourism to grow in the North, we want tourism to grow in my side of the country - the West even more, Sir, but we cannot do this in an unsustainable fashion. We must always ensure that when we speak, we check every single word that we actually say. He only said this 12 months ago. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you sign this ASA agreement, there are Fifth and Sixth Freedoms, et cetera, that he actually spoke about. You must be very wise about how you do this. The previous Permanent Secretaries at Civil Aviation have also spoken about this, Andre Viljoen himself has actually spoken about this, he himself has spoken about this, the former Minister for Civil Aviation has spoken about this - all were on the same page. Why is he changing now, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Please, honourable Minister, be very careful where you tread with respect to Open Skies. I thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! No running commentaries, honourable Members. The speaker has spoken and that is it. Financial Management Information System HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin my Ministerial Statement, I think honourable Koya was a bit more excited than I thought he would be. I think the idea of Open Skies ASA is actually a contractual framework between a service provider and a client, which specifies a number of different aspects of how it is going to be done. So, all that hoo-haa about Open Skies and suddenly things will end is not going to happen because the Agreement itself is going to be looked at carefully. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me provide an update on the replacement of the Government’s Financial Management Information System, which is scheduled to go live on 1 st August, 2024. What is the Financial Management System and Payroll System? Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Finance has been undergoing numerous reforms to modernise its IT systems and processes and had embarked on a major IT project to replace the current</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>775 two-decade old Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and the 40-year-old payroll system. The FMIS system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the accounting system for the whole of Government. So, each year, when the Budget is prepared and approved by Parliament, the Ministry of Finance uploads the entire Budget Appropriation on FMIS. Funds are allocated to individual Heads of appropriations, which is managed by the respective Permanent Secretaries who are the Chief Accounting Officers for their Ministries. During the financial year when a Ministry wants to procure an item, the accounting staff of that agency will get on to FMIS and make a commitment to issue an LPO. Once the item is supplied and the invoice is issued by the supplier, the LPO will be closed in the FMIS, and a payment will be generated online with funds transferred to the respective bank account of the vendor. This, then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, creates an accounting transaction which gets recorded in the FMIS. Such transactions happen daily in different agencies throughout the financial year. Apart from this, there are other known expenditure and accounting processes including Request to Incur Expenditure (RIE), virements, cashflow adjustments, excess approvals, reconciliations, redeployments and procurement processes that continue throughout the year. Once the financial year is completed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FMIS is used to generate all financial reports that are then audited by the Office of the Auditor-General, submitted back to Parliament for further debate and scrutiny on the use of public funds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these processes used to be done manually around 20 years ago. However, the former SDL Government, led by the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase, then instituted a major financial reform between 2004 to 2006, which included the roll out of the current FMIS system that we are using. I think it was a forward-looking strategy and thinking and system change by the SDL Government. Back then, the size of the budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was only around 25 percent of the current Government spending. The number of users were also significantly lower, and the volume of transactions were also small. Similarly, we also had a "stand-alone" Payroll System which used to pay the salaries of all civil servants, including Parliamentarians like us. This system is centrally managed by the Ministry of Finance to pay the salaries of about 35,000 civil servants. This payroll system was not integrated with the FMIS. In layman's language, the two systems, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were not talking to each other. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we came into Government 17 months ago, the Permanent Secretary for Finance and his team provided me a briefing on the state of the economy and public finances, on the current systems and processes of the Ministry of Finance, the legislations and policies that guide the operations of the Ministry, and our major deliverables and plans. During that briefing, I was quite shocked when they highlighted to me about the challenges with the current FMIS system and a very desperate and shocking situation with the 40-year-old Payroll System. This was highlighted as the highest operational and accountability risk, not only for the Ministry of Finance, but for the whole of Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Since then and immediately after that, we made that as one of our top priorities and, with the approval of Parliament, for a total budget of about $14 million for a new FMIS which will have an inbuilt payroll system.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>776</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 The Ministry of Finance, in fact, Mr. Speaker, did a very good job, together with the support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (all the technical support was provided by ADB), and we embarked on developing a new system. Let me start with the Payroll System, Mr. Speaker, because it is important for me to explain what was there. The existing payroll system was tailor-made for the Fijian Government and had been in existence for over 40 years since 1984. This system was developed by a local company called "Solutions for Business", which was managed and operated by an individual named Mr. Barry Kay. I pay tribute to this great gentleman, who passed away later last year at the age of 86. He was the only person, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who, over the years, was providing the technical backup, despite all the challenges and hiccups that the Ministry of Finance staff, at the back end of the activities, were trying to handle. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this Payroll System was developed 40 years ago, it served the purpose at that time but, over the years, piecemeal changes were made, and the system had lagged behind and it was not what ought to be a modern Payroll System. There were a number of challenges that the Payroll System created for the Ministry of Finance staff, for the Office of the Auditor-General, for the timely production of Annual Reports and activities because the Payroll System was not integrated with the FMIS which was rolled out in 2006, as I have said, by the SDL Government. This meant that the payroll activity is actually not available on the FMIS on a real time basis. This lack of integration and control has led to the overspending on their salary budget by many agencies, year after year, and if you look at the Reports of the Office of the Auditor-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, every year that issue has been highlighted. There are several processes that have to be manually input into the system with no provision of uploads and attachments that could have brought out efficiency. Third and the most critical issue was that the payroll software was managed, as I had said, by a single person, who was getting on in his life, his health was not very good and at one point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were panicking that if something happens to him and the system collapses, there was no one who had been trained, except one person that we identified and we quickly hired her to come as a consultant and provide some support in case there was a disaster. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FMIS system had also become quite outdated with a number of challenges in terms of controls, reporting, efficiency and system security. Reports had to be manually extracted, and part of the reason why Ministries were not able to produce annual reports on time was that the system was not generating all these reports easily, and they used to spend a lot of time manually extracting the information and basically, the capabilities were not there as a modern system. There was, obviously, a little or no provision available to upgrade the system to meet our accounting needs which has evolved and become more complex over time. Apart from this, the current FMIS is only accessible through GOVNET, which means that staff cannot directly access FMIS from homes or other locations if they want to work and look at how the challenges could be met. The engagement of ADB, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provided us with a lot of technical support, with the experience that the ADB had in putting in place this, sort of, systems around the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ADB’s technical assessment, as a first step, it was very clear that the current FMIS and the Payroll System cannot be brought together in any technical way and, therefore, there was a need for a new system. We immediately made sure that we went through an international</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>777 local tender process, and this went through a technical evaluation committee and the tender was approved, chaired by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the international company called Bisan Solutions which specialises in government Public Financial Management Systems which has done this in countries such as US, Belgium and many others around the world, including Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The total cost is estimated to be around $12 million, and when everything is fully operational, the backup and service fee would be covered as part of that budget. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that after 14 months, immediately after that briefing, we embarked on to it, and it has taken us 14 months of hard work to get this system ready. The training is all done now, to GO LIVE on 1st August - the start of the new financial year. What are the benefits of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir? Once we GO LIVE, the new system will bring about greater efficiency in our accounting processes, improve financial reporting, strengthen internal controls and audit trails and enhance the security of the system which will also be web-based. Overall, financial processing and reporting will be enhanced with real-time transaction updates which is useful for management decision-making and policy formulation. Apart from this, Financial Statements will be directly extracted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the system with significant improvements in timelines for Ministries and Departments in preparation of accounts, audit and presentation. In fact, Sir, we think that this will create real time production of accounts, time for audits and timely presentation of reports to Parliament, as it happens in many other countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also undertaking work to integrate the new FMIS with the Budget and Debt Management System, in fact, the whole budget process. In fact, I was also surprised when I came in last year that the whole budget process is excel-based. The Ministry of Finance is also working towards a budget software which will be integrated with the new FMIS at a later stage because it is almost like doing the whole budget process manually. That was a big concern to me in this day and age of technology. The new FMIS will also eliminate any manual intervention, like data punching, and majority of the payroll=related calculations will be possible through the new system, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It will also be easier to generate ad hoc reports and customize reports with new parameters to suit the needs of the users and decision-making process. For example, we had a written question from honourable Premila Kumar. Those sorts of reports, Sir, is not easy right now with the current system for us to generate and this is why all this kind of information was always available as part of annual reports or audit reports. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say that this new system, apart from making so much easier for the staff, for the Office of the Auditor-General or audit trails, it will also provide better analytics which will allow us to desegregate financial and accounting data to categories, like climate change, gender-based activities, simply with a click of a button. I would say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a major transformative project to modernize the Government Financial Management Information System and this fits in well with all the major financial management reforms that the Ministry has undertaken. I want to just quickly highlight some of those: 1. The various legislative amendments to the Financial Management Act, Financial Instructions, Procurement Regulations, Audit Act, Statistics Act, with the objective to</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>778</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 improve financial management and governance, including improved transparency, accountability, external oversight and greater independence to our Audit and Statistics Office. 2. The strengthening of the budget formulation process with the new Public Sector Investment Programme Guidelines that improves the appraisal and selection of capital projects with a better value for money and effectiveness in achieving the outcomes. 3. We established the Strategic Planning Office which is now a fully-fledged Office within the Ministry of Finance, which was always there, which is also currently formulating the new National Development Plan. 4. The new Debt Management Strategy which is focused on reducing the Debt-to-GDP ratio, reducing the cost of debt by accessing more concessional loans to multilateral, bilateral and other effective liability management options, and rests on timely data assessment and analysis that can inform policy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this is one of the major transformative reforms that the Government has undertaken and this should be a legacy of the Coalition Government - to provide a system that will improve accountability, transparency, audit, timely submission of reports to Parliament, as well as to the people of Fiji. I want to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to thank the entire FMIS Team. There are 20 people from within the Ministry of Finance who were working almost full time, day and night, led by the Head of Treasury, Mr. Atin Chand, and all the staff across Government agency, for all the hard work because without them, we would not have got all the processes and systems aligned with the technical aspects of the system. I want to really thank them. Also, I want to thank my Permanent Secretary, Mr. Shiri Gounder, for his leadership and the hard work and many hours of late-night work towards this project and various other financial management reforms that we have been able to undertake in the last 17 months since we came into Government. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we are on schedule for a new FMIS to GO LIVE on 1 st August, 2024, which is the start of a new financial year. Let me say that we are now working on the Budget and once we are able to add to the current system, the process of Budget will become so much easier for the Government and the Ministry of Finance and all the staff, not only the Ministry of Finance but throughout the Government, to be able to access, produce reports, and ensure that it is done in a timely manner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for</p><h4>Finance for his Ministerial Statement.</h4><p>While we are living in the 21 st century, technology is very important, no doubt about it. We need technology, we need a new system, and the system needs to be upgraded in order to actually have some better controls. There have been a lot of attempts previously under the digitalFIJI Programme as well, whereby the honourable Minister would now know that our systems are not talking to each other, especially when we have a budget of more than $4 billion. When the system from one Ministry is not talking to another Ministry’s system, it becomes very difficult for Ministry of Finance to account for the money that was given to the Ministry, and the amount of money that is being utilised by the Ministry. All these systems need to be talking to</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>779 each other. We need to have a centralised system. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very good step forward, we are trying to develop something because if we look at the system nowadays, especially when it comes to commercial companies, there are three aspects - there is an Accounting System, an Inventory Management and there is Payroll. All these systems talk to each other. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have seen in Government for decades, there is a huge disconnect. For example, at the moment, as the honourable Minister was saying is implementing that particular component in the Ministry of Finance. If we look at Ministry of Health and the Fiji Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Services (FPBS), these two systems are not linked to each other. Government Pharmacy, being one of the major buyers of Government, spends almost close to $60 million but there is no systematic way of reporting back to the Ministry of Finance when it comes to the reporting system through a particular software, Sir. It is a very good move by the Ministry of Finance that they are trying to implement. What I would like to suggest is, there are certain entities, such as Municipal Councils, Provincial Councils, where we need to implement the software. Very rightfully said, things are done on manual basis and when things are done manually, the records go missing. People are leaving, there is no proper record of receipts, and the reports get delayed, before it is presented to Parliament. Sir, I have a suggestion, if we can expand this particular programme to all other Ministries and anywhere, particularly where the Government grant is going. I have mentioned the Ministry of Health and FPBS is one of the major spenders with almost $60 million, likewise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education where Government gives huge amounts as grants to schools but, again, there is no proper recording system or there is no proper way to report back to the Ministry of Education on how the grant is actually utilised because that is taxpayers’ money. We need to go to that extent because I believe close to $250 million to $300 million is given to high schools and primary schools as grant, so we need to be accountable. If that can be done and very rightfully said by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, we now have Starlink that will provide connectivity throughout Fiji, we can actually have systems in schools hooking up to this networking system where they can use the software to report back to the Ministry of Finance. In a nutshell, I would like to say, this is a very good programme. Succession plan is very important. We need to train the right people and retain them within the Ministry to look after that. Rightfully, Sir, if we actually rely on one person and if he is no longer there, the system can collapse. If we are actually looking at a payroll system, we might be dealing with close to 30,000 civil servants who will be affected, including Members of Parliament and Ministers as well. So, we need to have some backup plans and to have backup servers whereby we can actually keep this data. We do not want a system which transpired some years ago, that collapsed, and we did not have a backup system. So, we need to work on these kinds of issues in order to implement, and I would like to thank the honourable Minister for taking this initiative and project on board. MR. SPEAKER.- The Ministry of Health, as you have highlighted, is not part and parcel of what they are trying. Now, they are bringing in the Ministry of Health. When you look back at past Governments’ decisions, beginning from SDL, they kind of lack that. For example, the Ministry of Health run on their own, they did their own pay rise, et cetera. But when it came to the future governments like FijiFirst, they did likewise too. They increased the pay of the doctors without aligning to what has been recommended now.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>780</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 Now, we have reached a stage where even the Ministry of Home Affairs is having trouble with running their own payroll. Now, we need to converge them together and see, like you have stated, there is accountability and transparency into how decisions are going to be made. It comes right down to the recruitment process. You may recall that when we were in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, we asked the Ministry of Finance, “What is the problem with this?” The usual answer from the Permanent Secretary then, a Rotuman lady, “We do not have the capacity.” But they have been tasked with that responsibility, the Permanent Secretaries. Hopefully, having been reassured by your support and the support of the Opposition to this Government initiative, we hope things would turn out for the better. Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now since the Standing Order Executive Committee would be meeting in the Small Committee Room to discuss issues that have been pending, so that we may address things rather quickly when Parliament is still in session. We are going to adjourn now, and we will resume at about 3.00 p.m. or 3.15 p.m., when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.38 p.m.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>781 The Parliament resumed at 3.22 p.m.</p></body>
