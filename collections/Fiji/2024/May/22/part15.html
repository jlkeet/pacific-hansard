<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p>Preservation of Levuka’s Historical Monuments (Question No. 72/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update Parliament on the work that has been undertaken during this financial year to preserve historical monuments in Levuka? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Kumar for the question. Earlier this year, we visited Levuka. We have looked at the heritage areas. We have a good discussions with stakeholders there in Levuka and from that discussions, we have formed a committee to review and have a look at the heritage sites. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from this year’s operational budget of $19,000 and the rollover from 2022- 2023 and 2023-2024 was $1.5 million which happens to renovate the Levuka Community Centre. From the brief that was given to me yesterday, it should be completed by the end of this month. Unfortunately, the funds is not enough to fully equip the Centre and we might need additional funds for that. Regarding the Deed of Cession site, the first phase was supposed to be fencing and walkway and the second one was supposed to be the walls and the drainage, we decided to change it around, so do the walls and drainage first so that the foundation is compact before we carry out the fencing and the walkway. They have already got quotations for contractors. We have provided Levuka Town Councils $50,000 that we supposed to provide. The Committee has also reviewed the reports that was done after TC Winston. They have just picked those who urgently need the repair. Those ones will try and propose it for next year’s budget for funding. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the honourable Minister for his response. My only concern at this stage is that the honourable Minister has not been briefed very well. That is why, perhaps, we are not able to carry on with the work because, again, you are forming</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>793 a committee, discussions and we are not able to use the money allocated for the year. This work had already started with the Heritage Architect. We have only one heritage architect - Setoki is his name and I have forgotten the company, and he had already planned all the heritage sites and what needs to be done. One had to use this $150,000 to continue with one activity at a time to complete that. So, I just wanted to brief the honourable Minister so that he can pick it up from there and move on with the heritage works that we started. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- She is just briefing you, Sir, so we will rest it there. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when UNESCO actually declares a particular site as a World Heritage Site, one of the conditions attached to it is that you must have a buffer zone. So, in your work that you are currently doing, honourable Minister, are you also ensuring because what it is, is these sites are outstanding universal value. That is why we have these buffer zones. My question really is, when you do this particular work, are you also ensuring that the buffer zone is protected and looked after so that we are in compliance with the UNESCO requirements? Because these things, if not done, we may lose the status of World Heritage Listing. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reports that I received from the new team, they have highlighted the issue about the buffer zone that needs to be addressed. I have been briefed on that one. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Forgive me for my ignorance on this issue, honourable Minister, but is the old Levuka Hospital part of the heritage? Because it is an eyesore and this has been raised continuously by the Lomaiviti Provincial Council, especially the Mata ni Tikina from Levuka Vakaviti. So, what is the plan about the Levuka Hospital, please? HON. I. VASU.- Yes, it is under the heritage site. In our discussions yesterday, I have directed the Board for National Trust to have a look at the buildings there at the hospital. Those that cannot be repaired, if they can recommend that for condemnation so that they can write to Levuka Town Council and advise them that those buildings, you cannot do any more thing about it when I looked at it. It is just an eyesore, you are correct. We just have to condemn then we clear it. If they need to build another building there, then they have to follow the structure that is out there, that should be followed and be in line with the heritage recommendations. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. Being a military engineer, he knows his area of the woods very well. Fiji Volunteer Service &amp; School Employment Exposure Programme (Question No. 73/2024) HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on the Fiji Volunteer Service established under the National Employment Centre Act 2009 and the joint School Employment Exposure Programme (SEEP)? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the question. The Volunteer Service was established under Part 10 of the National Employment Centre Act 2009, to promote a strong sense of service and civic pride amongst the people of the Fiji Islands.</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>794</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, volunteering is considered one of the best and productive means or forms of personal and professional development, richly adding value to society in the most cost-effective and caring ways through contribution of effort, skills and time in charitable ventures and humanitarian assistance to the less fortunate people in society. Only yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, did we hear from the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports regarding the various activities our youth are going to get into. We have in the past, had our Boys Scouts, Girl Guides, St. Johns, and so many others, Duke of Edinburgh, all these were very good training and development programmes for our youth. Somewhere along the line, we kind of lost them, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, it has now additionally become a means of training and entry into the job market of our new graduates as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the scheme, last year a total of 111 graduate volunteers were engaged with the local employers, including Government Ministries. For the current financial year, a total of 122 graduate employees are engaged. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry also reviewed the volunteer allowance from the previous $120 per week. As an incentive to support volunteerism where graduate volunteers are now paid a weekly allowance of $180. And out of this, 50 percent or $90 is paid by the host employer and the balance is paid by the Ministry. So that is for graduates or those who are degree holders. Our attachment for certificate levels and diploma levels are now paid $150 per week compared to the previous $100 per week where 50 percent again is paid by the host employer and the other 50 percent paid by the Ministry. A large number of employers are able to benefit from this and it is mutual where new graduates are able to acquire training attachments and at the end of that there are those that are actually employed fulltime by the same employer and the period is between three to six months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other scheme is the Student Employment Exposure Programme (SEEP). It is spearheaded through smooth transition of students from schools into the world of work, into decent jobs and employment growth, based on students’ subject combination, skills and potentials in line with their interests. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SEEP programme was initially launched in November 2018 in the Central Division before it was launched in the West and later in the North in 2019. This Programme was later shelved following the onset of COVID in 2020. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole practical exercise is an early intervention for students to experience work readiness and to help students nurture their employability skills needed in any work environment. This is highlighted in the National Employment Policy - Policy Priority Number One: to create more opportunities for young people aged 15 years to 24 years to follow clear pathways from education to employment. The objective is for education and training providers to have a closer link with employers, and I firmly believe that the SEEP programme will go a long way towards fulfilling the policy priority. The opportunity will provide hands-on experience in the world of work and allow students the opportunity to make decisions on their career pathways. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 28 secondary schools in the Central Division participated in this year’s programme, with a total of 163 Year 11 students. For the first time, we have schools from rural areas, including Waidina Secondary School and Wainimala Secondary School from the Province of Naitasir,i and Nuku Secondary School from the Province of Serua. These students, Sir,</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>795 were hosted by 12 private organisations and eight Government Ministries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for schools in the Central Division that missed out, my Ministry intends to continue this collaboration in the next school holiday with other schools in the West before moving to the North. When these students are attached to these workplaces, they are paid a small pocket allowance of $20 a day and their bus fares are taken care of by the Ministry of Education through the topping up their cards. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must acknowledge our partners from the Ministry of Education, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation (FCEF) for this collaboration, which could bridge the gaps between the education system and our world of work. HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister brief and share with this august Parliament what was the response and the feedback on the shift from schools that participated - the students and the employers that engaged them during the two weeks holiday? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and again I wish to thank the honourable Member for the question. The feedback that we have received from the Ministry of Education and other social partners including the ILO and Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation has been overwhelming with positive feedback. My team has been inundated with queries on why other schools missed out and when will be the next round. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the feedback from our team, students participated have actually shown remarkable adaptability and enthusiasm diving into the new work environment, for instance, we had science students from various schools who initially were apprehensive about working in non-science settings such as administrative office or retail outlets. However, once immersed in the environment, very quickly they adapted and showcased their soft skills such as communication, teamwork and problem-solving. Similarly, students with backgrounds in agriculture surprised us with their versatility and willingness to learn the embraced opportunities to work in the diverse sectors including hospitality and customer service where they effectively apply their knowledge and sustainable practices and agriculture practices to their roles. For example, we had students from agricultural background excelled in roles that require them to educate customers about organic produce or assist in garden maintenance at resorts. There are numerous other examples of that nature, Sir. In the BPO sector, it is an evolving industry and has been particularly encouraging. The company has provided the students with exposure to a dynamic and technology-driven work environment. Despite being unfamiliar with the industry, students quickly adapted to tasks such as data entry, customer support and digital marketing. Their eagerness to learn and adapt to newer technologies impressed employers demonstrating their potential to excel in this emerging industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary, the SEEP initiative has provided the students with valuable opportunity to develop and showcase their soft skills regardless of their academic backgrounds. Their involvement in diverse industries highlight their adaptability and readiness to embrace new challenges. Mr. Speaker, Sir, feedback from employers that hosted them during the school holidays praised these students for their dedication and I must acknowledge all the organisations, including Government Ministries that hosted these students. Employers were excited about the programme</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>796</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 and look forward to assisting students in engaging them in the upcoming holidays. They were also to pay students additional allowances as part of the two-week performance assessment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, this programme, as I have stated earlier, is going to be an ongoing one because of the success that we have noted. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his explanation of the National Volunteer Service. I was listening and I hear that the volunteers are continuing to do their diplomas, people with diplomas and degrees. I am just wondering about those that do not rise to that level of qualification. There are a lot of people who do certificates in trade, people do in dance and other things like music. Is there any thought from the Ministry to grow this volunteer service not just for the people? I think a lot of people who do straight office type jobs. They are the ones who do the diplomas and degrees, and they are getting into the service but is there any thought about those others who do not have the opportunity to do diplomas and degrees. They attend a lot of these schools around the place, some of them are registered under the Fiji Higher Education Commission. Is there any scope to also give these people the opportunity under the Fiji Volunteer Scheme. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question. I may have missed, my apology. The Certificate holders are included with the Diploma holders. The others is food for thought that we could take into consideration. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Before, I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I thank you for your replies honourable Minister. But I detect that there are some similarities in the way supplementary questions are being raised, I mean, the questions and the answers. It is beginning to look like what was displayed by the honourable Minister for Fisheries and honourable Ratu Niudamu because when he read out his reply to the supplementary question which is just to elucidate, he went on to about three or four pages. Yes, just a comment on that. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Minister on the Fiji Volunteer Service. I know that when this was established, there was a National Register. Then for those who are not particularly close to the main centres, they had problems in getting registered in the National Register. Has that changed? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the question. All the officers of the Ministry nationwide are able to register. So they can go to any of our offices and register and we are now digitising the whole process to be able to get them to register online as well. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- I really thank the honourable Minister for this Voluntary Programme and it is crucial that the programme is thoroughly evaluated, to ensure that it delivers the practical benefit without compromising the overall learning experience. My question to the honourable Minister; since you said that it is going to be ongoing, do you get them to register into the Voluntary FNPF Scheme? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for that question or more like a suggestion, that initiative is now under discussion, Sir.</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>797</p><h4>Written Questions</h4><p>Capital Projects for 2023-2024 Financial Year (Question No. 74/2024) HON.

I would like to raise my concern raising a Point of Order in the Standing Order on maintaining the decorum of Parliament, as they continue to undermine, because we are permitted under Standing Order 45(3).
