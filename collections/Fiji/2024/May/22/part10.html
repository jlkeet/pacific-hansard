<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting. I know it has been a tough and a hectic week for the past few days, especially on all those who are joining us in the gallery, and those watching proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. Year 8 Students – Marist Brothers Primary School Honourable Members, this morning, we are joined by the Teachers and Year 8 Students of Marist Brothers Primary School. There is a steady influx of children coming in to sit and witness for themselves what is going on in this Parliament. This is your Parliament, children, and we are here representing you, we are here to make laws, change laws, amend laws, even repealing the laws. We wish you well in your visit today and hopefully, someday, some of you might be joining us here in becoming Members of Parliament as well. Australian High Commission Officials Honourable Members, we are also joined by Ms. Rebecca Brown and Mr. Bharat Mohan, both from the Australian High Commission. Thank you for joining us this morning. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework - Gazette Honourable Members, please, kindly take note that pursuant to Standing Order 130(5), I have provided notification in the Gazette that the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework has been approved</p><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>753 by Parliament. So, that will see to the quick gazetting of that Framework. So, Government’s work in seeing that it is being taken to their next round of meeting in Singapore, this has been held with it as well in Parliament. Standing Orders Committee Meeting Also, honourable Members, I wish to remind Members of the Standing Orders Committee that we are having our meeting at the Small Committee Room when Parliament suspends proceedings for lunch. I hope you have read copies that have been circulated to you. Emoluments Committee Report Honourable Members, indeed, for your information, I can confirm that I have received notification from the Chairperson of the Emoluments Committee that she will table the Committee’s Report in today’s sitting. This business will be dealt with under Item 4 in today’s Order Paper.</p></body>
