<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2018 to 2021 Annual Reports HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I hereby present the Standing Committee’s Consolidated Review Report on the Annual Report of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for the years 2018 to 2021. The Committee has undertaken its scrutiny on the Ministry’s Annual Reports for the said period under review and noted the overall performance of the Ministry through the hard work of the staff. The Committee noted that the Annual Reports clearly defined the roles of the two Departments within the Ministry. Whilst the Committee noted the delay in the submission of the said Annual Reports, the Committee appreciated the initiatives undertaken by the Ministry to address the delays in submitting Annual Reports. The Annual Reports clearly articulated the Ministry's role, annual targets, strategic priorities, achievements, responsibilities, challenges faced and way forward. The Committee noted that the Ministry is involved in a lot of technical areas of operation, pertaining to Mineral Resources, Land Use, GIS Survey, Geological Survey, Valuation, Ground Water Exploration, Drilling, Mining, et cetera. The Ministry has had to deal with the constraints, such as lack of resources in all the specialised areas. The Committee has proposed a few recommendations to the Ministry for the purposes of improving its services. I wish to extend my appreciation to the Executive and staff of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for their hard work and dedication. At this juncture, I take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members who were involved in the production of this bipartisan Report, namely, honourable Jone Usamate as Deputy Chairperson, honourable Ratu Isikeli Tuiwailevu, honourable Iliesa Vanawalu and honourable Joseph Nand as an Alternate Member. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Report to Parliament.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>754</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a motion without notice: That a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p>Question put. Motion agreed to. Review Report on the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989 and Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014 HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Special Committee on Emoluments was formed by a resolution of Parliament on Wednesday 12 th July, 2023. However, due to the non-inclusion of other Offices, such as the Office of the President and Office of the Speaker, and the review of the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989, an amended motion was later moved to rectify the anomalies that were previously not included. In that respect, a new motion for the review of all the Offices mentioned above, was moved by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, seconded and debated, and was passed as a Resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023. The Committee was required to: (a) review the salaries, allowances and benefits of the Members of Parliament, the President and Speaker, as provided for under the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014; review the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989; and (b) (c) must report back to Parliament at a later sitting. The Committee initiated its first meeting on 24 th July 2023, and collectively agreed to call for submissions from all the respective Political Parties represented in Parliament. The Committee subsequently received submissions from SODELPA, the FijiFirst Party, the National Federation Party and the People’s Alliance Party. After receiving submissions from respective Parties, the Committee felt that it was appropriate to engage an independent consultant to review the salaries, allowances and benefits of the Members of Parliament, the President and the Speaker, and then submit a report back to the Committee. To this end, an advertisement for an independent consultant was published in the dailies but, unfortunately, there were no applicants. Therefore, through the support of the Parliamentary Support Project, the Committee reached out to the UNDP with the same mandate, to put a call out for an independent consultant to undertake this work. Through that process, we were able to identify an independent consultant, who had actually carried out work before for the same Parliament. The Committee unanimously reached a general consensus of all the proposed recommendations from the independent consultant and the amendments to the Act which are outlined in the matrix enclosed in the Report to be tabled today. So, I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, that this is truly a bipartisan Report.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>755 I would like to express my sincere appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Committee, namely, honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau, honourable Aseri Radrodro, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Mosese Bulitavu, for their hard work and dedication in the many meetings that we have had, and also the work of our independent consultant through UNDP. On behalf of the Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hereby commend this Report to Parliament. (Report handed to Secretary-General) HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Wednesday, 12 th of July, 2023 and Monday, 11 th of September, 2023, I hereby move a motion without notice: That a debate on the contents and the adoption of this Report is to be initiated at a future sitting.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.
