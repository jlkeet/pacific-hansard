<body><h3>CONVENTION ON CYBERCRIME</h3><h4>CONVENTION ON CYBERCRIME</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move that for the purposes of Section 51 of the Constitution and pursuant to Standing Order 130(4): That Parliament approves the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence tabled its report on the review of the Convention on 14 th July, 2023, noting full support for Fiji to accede to the Convention. As a matter of background, the Convention of Cybercrime, also known as the Budapest Convention, was tabled in this august Parliament on 1 st September, 2022. Given that Parliament dissolved in October that year, the work on the report could not progress. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and all those involved in the process. We assure the work was progressed with further tremendous work, and finalising and tabling of the report on the review of the Budapest Convention. The use of cybercrime is no longer an emerging issue, but rather it is one of the ways in which criminal offences are committed. It is evident that technology advances at a rapid rate. Online platforms and e-transactions are norm of the society, with daily communication and the provision of services. This extends to matter before the courts and our laws. It is in this light that being part of a bigger network becomes essential a country like Fiji with our limited resources and expertise. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cybercrime Act 2021 was enacted in February 2021, but for one section, commenced on 14 th November 2022. Prior to this, the Crimes Act 2009 was the only law that dealt with computer offences, the provision of which was no longer sufficient to accommodate the evolving the nature of computer offences and computer related offence committed worldwide. Cybercrime offence are transboundary offences. By this, I mean that with the use of a technology or computer system an individual may be able to hack into a computer system that is in another country and causes the serious inclusion across jurisdictions. Cybercrime offence in fact are now in strategically part of the other traditional transboundary offences such as trafficking of persons and of illicit drugs, to name a few. I would like to provide in this august Parliament the type of offences that is currently been dealt by the Fiji Police Force: • • • • Complaint on dishonest obtaining or dealing in personal financial information; Unauthorised modification or restricted data held in computer; Traffic in obscene publications; and Phonography activities or explicit presentation of sexual activity in images or in writing involve a juveniles posting an intimate visual recording and closing up by posting electronic communication. We see here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nature of the offences now and what we can anticipate in the future. What is alarming is the need to educate and advocate for sensible online behaviour and practices. This is not purely a matter for criminal law. In this one that requires everyone’s effort in combating cyber and related offences.</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 799 We can start, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by being part of a bigger network of countries whose progress is based upon actual ex-prisoners and assistance received from bigger pool of expertise and resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Article 39 of the Convention provides for the purpose of present Convention is to supplement applicable multilateral and bilateral treaties or arrangement as between the parties, including the provision of: • • • European Convention on Extradition; European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal matters; and The additional Protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. The Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provides for a substantive criminal offences, procedural measures and international corporation provision requires for its member States to domesticates. To become a member of a Convention entails the following advantages for Fiji has highlighted in the Report: 1. Convention provides a legal framework for cyber offences. 2. It creates a harmonised effect on similar offences across member State jurisdiction. Chapter 2 of the Convention in particular provides general and specific provisions for International Corporation amongst members States. Not only with respect to Cybercrime offences and again by means of computer but with respect to crime involving electronic devices. Partisan Convention engaged with each other in trusted and efficient corporation which will benefit Smaller Island Developing States (SIDS) like Fiji in terms of capacity building and international engagement. 3. 4. It promotes effective and efficient communication, detection, investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of cyber related offences both nationally and internationally. It promotes corporation between the private sector and criminal justice authorities for members of the Convention. It gives that member the need to have a domestic legal framework on Cybercrime and electronic evidence in place. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned the Cybercrime Act 2021 commenced on the 14 th November, 2022. Another, it provide access to capacity building programmes, technical assistance is necessary to facilitate a full implementation of the Convention and to enhance the ability to corporate internationally. Fiji as a member State we also participate in the negotiation of future instruments and for the evolution of the Convention. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Article 37 of the Convention, provides inter alia that in respect of any State acceding to the Convention, that Convention antic to force on the first day of the month following the expiration for a period of three months after the date of deposit of the instrument accession with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Subject to Parliamentary approval, proper steps will be taken to ensure the instrument of accession will be deposited in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>800 Convention on Cybercrime 22 nd May, 2024 In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have come a long way in our preparation, advocacy and awareness measures particularly with the line Ministry, the Ministry of Communication to reach this stage we can assess for our cybercrime offenses need to be tackled with the proper understanding, framework, planning and resources. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is ready. It is recommended that Fiji accedes to the Convention on Cybercrime, and I strongly urge Members of Parliament to support the motion. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and before I offer the floor, I have a list of speakers from the Whips. The batting will be led off by: 1. Honourable Premila Kumar; 2. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-opertatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 3. Honourable Faiyaz Koya; 4. Honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs; 5. Honourable Viliame Naupoto; and rounded off by 6. Honourable Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development, and Disaster Management. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion that Fiji accedes to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, and I thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense for guiding Parliament with their very comprehensive Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our lives revolve around computers, laptops, smartphones and many other technologies that are available in the market. We spend more time online in our social and professional world. We shop, work, bank, conduct financial transactions, play, and access various services that are available online. Governments around the world are also moving their services online for convenience and efficiency. We have seen nations moving towards cashless society. With such convenience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, comes the increasing threat of cybercrime to consumers, businesses, and even governments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the beginning of 2023, 87.7 percent of Fiji’s population were active online users, 59 percent of Fiji’s population are social media users, and 1.28 million mobile connections are active online. These numbers must have increased by now because we are in 2024, and the mobile user number if you look at it, it is more than our population, so it is quite big. That means people have smart phone in the palm of their hand and they can use this anytime anywhere, to conduct any financial transaction, or to do anything they want to with that phone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is no wonder that so many people are affected by cybercrimes, causing consumers and business owners immense financial, emotional distress, and psychological harm. Fiji, like many other developing countries, is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and harmful online activities such as cyberbullying, online shouting, harassment, stalking, as well as the use of internet for criminal activities such as romance scams, and financial and investment scams, to name a few. Now, according to the Global State of Scams Report 2023, because scam is so common in Fiji, the financial loss due to scams amounts to a staggering $1 trillion, equivalent to 1 percent of the global GDP and only 7 percent of the victims recover their lost funds, that is what I want to emphasize. Only 7 percent are able to recover their funds, that means all other money goes into the</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 801 into the hands of criminals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one is immune to online crimes, and we are well versed with the most recent eBay scam in Fiji, costing unsuspecting consumers more than $3.6 million. The recovery of lost fund remains a problem for Fiji Consumers, just like what we have seen globally, and equally disappointing is the pace at which perpetrators are punished for swindling Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have assisted many victims of cybercrime in my previous role as the CEO of the Consumer Council. I have seen helpless victims knocking on the doors of agencies for assistance to recover their lost fund, and even those victims who were used as money-mule in money laundering activities. At that time, Fiji had no mechanism in place to assist the victims. We were at the mercy of the banks, asking the banks if they can assist, but there was no other way to help the victims. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that the economic cost of cybercrime is huge. Cybercrime makes more money when compared to the national economy. It is estimated that cybercrime will make around $10 trillion by 2025. No wonder a single nation cannot fight the crime in isolation! Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rise in cybercrime is an issue that knows no borders and spares no nation. We need a collective effort to fight this crime. It is for this reason that we must ratify the Budapest Convention for international cooperation. All big mighty companies, such as Facebook, You Tube, Instagram, Tik Tok, you name it, are all housed in America. For a small country like ours, it will be difficult to collect electronic evidence without this global co-operation. It is a bitter truth that much of our critical data and infrastructure resides in private hands. Mr. Speaker, Sir, embracing an international framework, like the Budapest Convention, not only strengthens our cybersecurity capabilities but also integrates us into a global network dedicated to combating cybercrimes. The FijiFirst Government has put in place several measures to combat cybercrime, for example, the Online Safety Act 2018 and Cybercrime Act 2021. So, Fiji is already ahead, even without acceding to Budapest Convention. Ratifying this Convention will only help Fiji improve its current legislation to international standards, if it is not already done. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits of ratifying the Budapest Convention open the door to capacity building initiative. It will equip our law enforcement agencies with technical expertise and tools for investigation and prosecution, and Fiji can be part of evidence-sharing mechanism. Being a party to this Convention will also give access to a global network of experts to ensure justice is swift and certain. We have heard from honourable Kamikamica this morning about connecting the unconnected and giving our people equal opportunity to access digital space. The more people come online, the crime becomes bigger and bigger and with the amount of money criminals collect, they become more smarter, and they can invest in more tools to counteract what the countries try and put to protect its people. So, this is the fight between most powerful people, whether it is the technology providers or the criminals, against a country with only limited amount of funds. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budapest Convention will definitely create a safer and more secure digital space for consumers and businesses, therefore, I recommend and support the motion before Parliament, and I sincerely hope that we are able to move on with this Convention very quickly. There has been a huge delay, it was quite disappointing. The honourable Attorney-General has been talking about efficiency, Sir, and I hope he should have been more efficient for this particular convention because it is so much needed right now.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>802 Convention on Cybercrime 22 nd May, 2024 HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in full support of the motion tabled by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, that Parliament approves the Fiji’s accession to the Convention on Cybercrime, or most commonly referred to as the Budapest Convention. Mr. Speaker, Sir, bolstering cyber-security posture, including combating cybercrime, is paramount as we move into a more integrated digital economy. In order to effectively do this, enhancing global cooperation is needed and the Convention on Cybercrime plays a tangible role in addressing the complexities of cybercrime and electronic evidence, a domain that knows no borders in reach and impact. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Convention applies to any crime committed via the internet and any other computer network, dealing particularly with infringement of copyrights, computer-related fraud, child pornography and violations of network security. Any crime that has electronic evidence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, be it a text message, email, CCTV footage, audio, IP Address or call log, can benefit from the SWIFT International Corporation provisions of the Budapest Convention. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament’s endorsement of the Fiji accession to the Budapest Convention further signifies our global commitment to ensuring a safe and secure cyberspace for our people. Sir, I would like to share some statistics on the cyber threat landscape which demonstrates why this motion needs to be supported by all honourable Members in this Parliament. The Pacific Security Outlook Report 2023-2024 highlighted that the activity of cybercriminals and State-sponsored threat actors have increased globally, and the direct and indirect targeting of Pacific individuals, businesses, e-commerce systems and government systems remain a threat. It mentions the three most important cyber threats in the region were phishing, ransomware and malware attacks. The earlier edition of the Report of 2022-2023 provide examples of the increased of cyber- attacks in the region, namely, in one of the region’s largest ever cyber-attacks. Papua New Guinea’s Ministry of Finance Government pay system was targeted by ransomware of cyberattack in October 2021. Criminals attacked the Department of Finance’s Integrated Financial Management System, seeking a payment in bitcoin for restoration of services. In 2021, Australia was affected by ransomware attack on a critical emergency, surgical and other healthcare services. In March 2022, the Republic of the Marshall Islands’ National Telecommunications Authority experienced major distributed denial of services cyber-attack that disrupted internet for about 10 days. Furthermore, the World Economic Forum, in its Global Risks Report 2024 stated, that out of the 10 risks within a two-year projection, cyber insecurity is the number four global threat. Microsoft estimates that the global impact of cyberattacks is predicted to reach over $10 billion per annum by next year. These are further exacerbated by the shortage of the necessary workforce. This is the reality that we are facing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but it is not bleak, if we work together. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are putting together the necessary foundational elements and working closely with the many stakeholders to ensure that we are in a position to combat these new and emerging threats. This cannot be handled alone by one Ministry, it cannot be handled alone by the Government, it requires all of us.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 803 Within Government we are strengthening areas of collaboration between Ministries and partner agencies and ensuring that we are building capacity amongst relevant stakeholders. This is to ensure that we are not duplicating work, and we are streamlining and leveraging existing regional and global efforts. All of these adds up to the many layers of protection and resilience that we need, to ensure a more sustainable digital economy. I would now like to turn briefly to outline our efforts in preparing to accede to and become a party to the Budapest Convention. We have partnered with the Council of Europe in this journey, from our Cybersecurity Crime Act that is aligned to the Budapest Convention, to enhancing capacity of our criminal justice authorities and partners on electronic evidence and fostering collaboration on the 24/7 Network. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an observer, Fiji joins the 72 Parties to the Convention, the 20 Observer countries and other like-minded countries in harmonising our laws, to ensure prompt and efficient international cooperation to criminalise and prosecute cyber offences. One key action item for Fiji is the designation of the 24/7 Network POC. We have been focusing our efforts on ensuring that this is done properly. With the support of the Council of Europe, we have been holding numerous interagency sessions to deepen our understanding on the 24/7 Network POC, and in order to collectively identify the competent national 24/7 Network POC, which is a requirement of the Budapest Convention and the Cybercrime Act. The interagency 24/7 Network POC stakeholders included the: Fiji Police Force; 1. Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 2. Office of the Attorney-General; 3. Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration; 4. 5. Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; 6. 7. 8. Ministry of Communications. Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption; Fiji Intelligence Unit; and As a result of the 24/7 Network POC sessions with other countries and better understanding the models that they were using and operating, this has enabled the Interagency Committee to be able to collectively identify which agencies are best equipped to become part of the network. The POC is to provide immediate assistance for the purpose of investigations of cybercrimes or the collection of electronic evidence of cybercrime for any of the Budapest Convention Signatory States and is the focal point to request for the same type of assistance from any of our Budapest Convention State members. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tangible benefit of being part of the 24/7 Network was shared by one of the member countries where previously, it would take three months to process a request from a different country to preserve electronic evidence through the usual diplomatic process. Under the 24/7 Network, the timeline was shortened to five days for a similar request. This was due to the immediate response afforded under the 24/7 Network. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will give much needed boost to the capabilities of our law enforcement and prosecution agencies and, therefore, similar to other State members to the Convention, our 24/7 Network POC will be the Fiji Police Force and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We are finalising this legal designation with the Office of the Attorney-General.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>804 Convention on Cybercrime 22 nd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had earlier referred to the work that is being done to build capacity across our different agencies. The Government has facilitated dedicated capacity, building workshops for criminal justice authorities, including the judiciary, prosecution, law enforcement and policy agencies, as we continue to prioritise these efforts. We are building capacities that are sustainable, such as the Train the Trainer initiatives in the design and development of electronic evidence curriculum for the first responders, such as our Police Officers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, additional dedicated workshops, sessions and conferences are being planned for the prosecution, judiciary, law enforcement and the Ministries, according to their identified priorities. These will be done under the Council of Europe’s capacity building programme, known as Global Action on Cybercrime Extended (GLACY-e) initiative, whereby Fiji as an observer, is the only Pacific recipient to benefit from this initiative. We are already seeing this cooperation in action with electronic evidence workshops for the Fiji Police Force Officials, that was successfully conducted earlier this year. Next month, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be convening a national conference on cybercrime and e- evidence for prosecutors, which is also being supported under the GLACY-e programme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for capacity building, it is not necessarily about the number of workshops or seminars that are organised. It is about providing the appropriate resources to the right agency that has the expertise and mandate to carry out a task successfully, and that is the focus of our international partnerships. For example, in December 2023, in partnership with the World Bank and the Korean Internet and Security Agency, the Ministry organised a workshop which was attended by the Ministry of Home Affairs on bolstering our cybersecurity efforts for critical information and infrastructure, including Government infrastructure. We have also closed the tender for the holistic review of the Department of ITC Services that will work with partners to bolster the capabilities of the agency that looks after Government networks and systems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is an active contributor to the ICT regional and international forums, notwithstanding our constrained resources and we have seen the value in progressing our national and common priorities, which ultimately shapes ICT development. Last year, alongside my fellow ICT Ministers, we convened to discuss the common challenges and opportunities that existed. This resulted in the signing of the Lagatoi Declaration, which outlined six priorities, including cybersecurity. This builds on the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the 2018 Boe Declaration. Fiji also hosted the Inaugural Pacific Cyber Security Capacity Building and Coordination Conference last October that provided a platform for the region to discuss the status and roadmap for cybersecurity capacity building. Mr. Speaker, as you can recall, as mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister, the highlight as well of our efforts was the signing of the MOU between the honourable Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Australia on cybersecurity. This demonstrates the priority that Government attaches to this, with the laser focus on bolstering cybersecurity through a dedicated strategy of policies, human resourcing, national search co-operation and online safety efforts. The Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology has already commenced discussions on an implementation plan. Mr. Speaker, Fiji is also actively participating at the United Nations Open Ended Working Group in the development of ICT in the context of international security, or commonly known as the OEWG, which is the only UN forum on cybersecurity and norms of responsible state behaviour in the cyberspace.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 805 Mr. Speaker, our longstanding partner, the Council of Europe, is standing ready to provide further workshops and awareness sessions, including our legislature. It is important that as Members of Parliament, we are briefed on how the Convention functions with the evolving threat landscape and the malicious use of technology. The short answer is that, approximately 23 years since the Convention was opened for signature, the Budapest Convention is still the only international treaty on this topic, and it is still applicable as it was drafted to be technology-neutral and there are guidance notes for member States that are released to address evolving threats, such as ransomware and malware. There are also two new Protocols to the Convention. Fiji can explore these Protocols, once we have acceded to the Budapest Convention. I urge all honourable Members to support this motion in recognising the Budapest Convention as it is pivotal in safeguarding our nation and the region against evolving threats. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to say ‘thank you’ to the Committee for a very comprehensive Report that has been put before us. This Report coming to us has been long overdue, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee have recommended that we ratify the Convention without reservations. Of course, it has our support in making sure that this is done. I had mentioned earlier this morning, Sir, that in Fiji, we are in a particular position in the region where we are one of the most developed economies in the Pacific in terms of ICT and ICT infrastructure, and we spoke about it this morning. We actually have a global ranking, and we are placed 107 out of 176 odd nations in ICT Development Index. Now, what that effectively means is that it puts us in a different space, Mr. Speaker, Sir. When I say different space, it is not actually just a good space, it is also the space that needs nurturing, it means looking after, et cetera, and this helps us in terms of cybersecurity. As I have said earlier on this morning, Sir, the studies along the region have said that by doing all of these, by having more increased connectivity, et cetera, we are also at risk in terms of cybersecurity and the region is also at risk, and the potential to cause a lot of harm whether it is financial or unauthorized access to banking, et cetera, as well as harm to the wellbeing of our citizens. There are few things that need to be spelt out and I think in the Report, you will see that the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit (FFIU) has actually reported that some $90,000 was lost due to cybercrime and this is where Fijians were sending money across to, I think, somewhere in Africa. So, it has a big bearing on us, Sir, it is very important for us to ratify this particular Convention. What it does also, it provides a legal framework for international cooperation for us and in terms of cybercrime and electronic evidence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to relay (it is actually in the Report, it is good to read this, and everyone should read this) the experience that they had in Tonga. Tonga adopted its Computer Crimes Act 2019 and it covered all of the provisions in the Budapest Convention. Tonga requested accession to the Budapest Convention in 2017 and then it became a party, so they beat us to it. But following the request, Sir, Tonga immediately became a priority country for the Global Action on Cybercrime (GLACY) and it extended to Global Action on Cybercrime Extended (GLACY +) Project, a joint project with the European Union. So, you can see the benefits that can be derived out of us acceding to this particular Convention.</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>806 Convention on Cybercrime 22 nd May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a whole host of recommendations that have been given by the Committee. The kind of cybercrimes and we are all aware of it, but I think we need reminding, is in terms of ATM scheming that is happening, email spoofing, business emails being compromised, et cetera, that is now a part of the landscape of ICT. So, we have to deal with it so by adhering to and actually acceding to the actual Convention, we are doing something that is good for all Fijians. The figure that I was talking about earlier with respect to people sending money to Benin in Africa is $98,658 lost because of cybercrime. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Deputy Prime and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has also mentioned about PIFS being very supportive and I think the Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the Declaration also recognise the challenges that have been posed by this. This is phenomenal for the security of our people, Sir, and it is a critical infrastructure, it is also a protection of data and information. In terms of international convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ratifying this Convention can only enhance Fiji’s ability to combat cybercrime through international cooperation. It actually could lead to more effective prevention and of actual prosecution of cybercrime. I will just speak on the prosecution part in just a few minutes, Sir, but it also helps us in terms of capacity building. It actually could provide access for technical assistance and training programmes and strengthening our response to cybercrime. It will actually provide the comprehensive legal framework for international cooperation on cybercrime. We will also need to ensure that our domestic laws and amendments are in place and ratification may require some amendments to take place, and I think the Office of the Attorney- General will give very wise and are probably on to it already, in terms of the Cybercrime Act and also juveniles, et cetera. The implications of these amendments can be farfetched and have very long tentacles, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have to really, really think about how we do it. And in doing these legislations, we have the ability to access our development partners in terms of how it can be done best for a better future for all Fijians. The resource allocation also, honourable Minister of Finance, in the next Budget, maybe we need to start looking into this also as more resources will be needed by the Ministry to ensure that we are compliant also. In terms of education, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think this is an area that we probably also need to ensure that there is a whole lot more public awareness. Awareness is important, eveyone is savvy in terms of being able to use these things and I am going to say something that maybe is not very parliamentary, but when it actually goes all wonky and of order, no one knows what to do and how to get that justice again. So, it requires education at all levels and that very ICT network that we have can be used to ensure that we make sure that we educate all parts of our population, whether it is in the rural area or not, or it is actually in city-based places. Public awareness, as I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, campaigns need to happen. We have phenomenal billboards around Fiji, and these are great ways to actually make public aware, and we have changing billboards, et cetera, that happen. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of gender-based violence, we have been speaking about it, there is a lot that actually happens, and I think Fiji also needs to pay heed and also pay attention to the fact that there is another convention - the Istanbul Convention, that deals with women, children and girls, et cetera, and this offers additional protections online for them. It is something that we probably need</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 807 to fast-track, honourable Attorney General, and bring to the fore and see if we could actually accede that also. There are emerging developments happening on a daily basis with respect to this particular area, there is a new UN Convention actually coming forth soon, and I understand the benefits of this Convention should be considered alongside the actual Convention that we are signing. I just want to explain a little bit about the Istanbul Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It prevents violence, protects victims and it also ends the impunity of perpetrators, especially when it comes to women, and it is a form of violation of human rights, et cetera. Now this is something very important that we need to look at and this probably needs to go hand in hand in terms of us ratifying this particular Convention. I think on 28 th June, 2023, the European Union ratified the Istanbul Convention so it is something that we need to look at. All in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is a good thing that we are doing. I think the recommendations that have come through from the Committee are very, very important and I think eveyone should make sure that they read the recommendations. Most of all, Sir, I think that what they have actually pointed out with respect to the recommendations is that the budgetary resources need to be allocated in trainings, advocacy, and they have spoken about the national laws, they have spoken about the roles and responsibility of the existing laws and they have also mentioned that we should anticipate the release of a new United Nations Convention on Counting the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes. These are very important recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I think Parliament should be very aware of what these are and make sure they read up on it because it is important to us and I think this ratification will put us in a better space. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the time and I fully support it, Sir. HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also rise in support of the motion that is before Parliament and I want to say ‘thank you’, on behalf of those of us in the Committee, to all the speakers who have spoken before me. I know that honourable Koya has pretty much covered the Report, but I also want to make mention that Fiji, like many developing nations, is confronted with an ever-evolving cyber landscape and we no longer function in isolation. I also want to mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the extreme effects of global cyber threats and attacks on critical infrastructure, including e-government infrastructure, becoming a party to this Convention will enhance Fiji’s ability to combat cybercrime, as we have all heard today with the international support and assistance from the base where this Convention is deposited. This, especially, is in relation to continued capacity building to better equip Fiji’s criminal justice system, including the Judiciary, Prosecution and Law Enforcement Agencies. Undoubtedly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is the most comprehensive and coherent international agreement on cybercrime and electronic evidence to-date. Just going to the Report from the Committee on page 15, I also want to repeat something that honourable Koya mentioned that acceding to the Convention is not just in Fiji’s interest, but it is in the region’s interest also and some honourable Members may not realise that from the region, Australia and Tonga have acceded to the Convention already, while New Zealand and Vanuatu have been invited to accede, as Fiji has done. The Committee has strongly recommended that Fiji ratifies the Convention without reservation, but I also wanted to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that apart from the main recommendations, there are other recommendations in the Report that need consideration. And one of the many</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>808 Convention on Cybercrime 22 nd May, 2024 recommendations is for Fiji to consider other Conventions, as honourable Koya has mentioned, the Istanbul Convention to work hand in hand with the Budapest Convention because of the recognition of online gender-based violence, being a violation of a woman’s human right. So, the Budapest Convention will, indeed, help Fiji become a harder target for cybercrime and cyber criminals, and I have no reservation in recommending this motion before us. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, at the outset, I thank the Government through the honourable Attorney-General, for bringing this back to Parliament for approval. It closes the loop in the process of treaties. This Treaty has come a long way. It started by the previous Government - the FijiFirst Government, in a different parliamentary term also and then it came to this Parliament under the new Government. I understand the length it took, given that this Convention fell on to your lap and you have taken it on. You have allocated this to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, we have come back, and the loop is now closed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are creating a little bit of history, in a sense that this is the first Treaty in this Parliament sitting that we have dealt with. Normally, according to the Standing Orders, we learn on how we do this, as we go forward, if there are further treaties that will come. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know a lot has been said by my colleagues that have spoken before, but there is no doubt that the cyber space/cyber domain where cyber criminals operate is man-made construct. The more we connect, the more space we give for people to be able to commit those crimes through the cyberspace. If I may quote you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you spoke to us during that workshop in Nadi in May on the Regional Pacific Islands Parliamentary Workshop on Cyber Crime, you told us, and I quote; “Our vulnerability to cybercrime increases as we continually move towards new online technologies and services.” You added that, “This is good, but it also comes with risks”. And if you connect your statement to what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, the very noble move to connect those that are unconnected is good for our people and apply what you have said, it means that we should not lose sight of the fact that as we connect, we extend the space and reach for criminals to commit cybercrime. Mr. Speaker, Sir, cyberspace dominates an influence, as mentioned by honourable Premila Kumar, and some of our speakers who have spoken before, from home, to schools, workplaces, and it is also on a much bigger scale influence the way we fight wars now. It has headed on in the battle space, as in before, it is just the land, the sea, air and space but now, there is a battle space called the cyber battle space and we now have Military Units in developed countries that are formed just to prepare for that battle in the cyberspace. Because of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it really makes very good sense to sign up to this Convention - the only one that is there in the world right now, and partner with those that are at the forefront of this battle of fighting cybercrime. I think that as a small nation with a small economy like ours, it is important and makes very good sense for us to sign up and partner with those countries that are very well developed, they have been through this and are at the forefront, as I have said. I was thinking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to conclude that as we connect, and we have heard that Google and Starlink are coming, and when we give them licence, they provide us with the cyberspace. I was just thinking of an idea that may be, for those who come and provide us with that, that perhaps there could be a levy or fee that we can charge them as part of their licence and that fee is used to advertise against cybercrime - little videos on television. We saw one during a workshop, where they</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 809 did one in Samoa - advertisements on radio, billboards, and I am sure Google, Starlink and Vodafone, those that provide the spaces can perhaps, be levied and provide funds and we advertise this criminal activity that is happening in cyberspace. It is just an idea. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly support the motion that is before Parliament. Thank you, Sir. HON. J. R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I join my fellow colleagues and rise to offer my support to the motion that is before Parliament that Fiji ratifies the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. So much has been said by those who have spoken before me, all supporting, willingness to join the effort that we are trying to discuss in Parliament this afternoon. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did receive a lot of submisions as a Member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. There was plethora of submissions from a wide range of backgrounds, including Government agencies, regional bodies, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), private ICT companies, private individuals, Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit, Legal Practitioners, et cetera, and they all showed their support for Fiji to accede to this Budapest Convention. I would also like to mention here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I was part of the Parliamentary delegation that you led attending the Regional Workshop on Cybercrime at the Tanoa Hotel in Nadi, as alluded to by honourable Naupoto, on 6 th May to 7 th May. During that workshop, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we really learned from experiences across the Pacific on the effect of cybercrime in their various jurisdictions and domain. The outgoing Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Mr. Henry Puna, also briefed the participants about PIFS’s stance about the cybercrime in the region. PIFS has highlighted in its submission that they want the region to be a hard target for cyber criminals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, PIFS in their 2015 Strategy for Blue Pacific Continent in the BOE Declaration, recognises the challenge posed by cyber criminals and the importance of cyber security across the region. I think honourable Koya has touched on the gender analysis. If Fiji decides to accede or ratify the Convention, then we urge that Fiji integrates a gender perspective in the implementation and enforcement of the Convention in our domestic context. This will help us to create effective laws, policies and procedures to efficiently prevent and combat cybercrime. We also urge that Fiji considers other Conventions which offer more protection to women and girls, such as the Convention on Preventing and Combatting Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), to work hand in hand with the Budapest Convention, to ensure protection of our women and girls and the recognition of online gender-based violence as being a violation of a woman’s human right. There were a lot of recommendations that were included in the Committee Report, and I hope that it had all been all spelt out properly by those who have spoken before me. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the threat of cybercrime in our domestic and regional space and our international border, tantamount to the uncontrolled drugs entering our shores. If we are not careful, surely it will ruin our economy and our people. We must act decisively now. We cannot do it alone and we need our international partners and instruments to combat it.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>810 Convention on Cybercrime 22 nd May, 2024 In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the motion before Parliament, and I render my full support that Fiji ratifies and accedes to the Budapest Convention. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, what we have done today is not paying lip service to our international partnership. In this space, we have actually enacted the Cybercrime Act before the ratification. There will be incremental changes in terms of our legislative reform as highlighted - there are a number of other subsequent changes that will be made. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do note the issues that are covered here. What concerns me, when I look at the statistics provided by the Police, is the low number of reported cases. Just allow me, Sir, if I may, to give you examples. For dishonesty - obtaining or dealing with personal financial information, there was only one case in 2019 but none from 2020 to 2023. On unauthorised modification of restricted data held in computer - 32 cases in 2019, but none in 2020 to 2023. On reported cases of traffic in obscene publication which normally occurs there were three cases in 2019, three cases in 2020, two cases in 2021, three cases in 2022 and four cases in 2023. The pattern in this is the same. It is the lack of awareness for members of public to report this matter to the authorities. What we see is that a lot of these are being published online, but they are not pushed to where they supposed to be. For online safety, no report of causing harm by posting electronic communication from 2019 to 2023. For posting an intimate visual recording, only one case in 2021, none from 2019 to 2023. What I urge is, for those members of the public who are listening in and for Members of Parliament, it is our responsibility to inform the members of the public. In part of my consultation awareness, there is a team that normally accompanies me in terms of telling the people. As honourable Koya said, “Yes, we all have a phone, but how to use the phone is what we lack.” I also pay homage to the members of the former Committee who had actually started the work. I have read all through the communications and the brief, indeed, thank you, honourable Naupoto and the Committee, and for the recommendations that is before Parliament. Other than that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we fully endorse the acceding of this Budapest Convention. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to also echo my big vinaka vakalevu to the Committee for bringing this up, and even to the honourable and learned Attorney-General. We did follow up by letter to the honourable Prime Minister through to the honourable and learned honourable Attorney-General, if they could fast-track the Treaty to be endorsed by Parliament. So much has been said, we have been placed on record where we have been asked to accede to this Convention. The mention of the two Protocols that accompany this Convention is another important issue because then, it allows us to interact right across our border to other countries, so this is a cross-border problem and now, we can access through those two Protocols, all the help that we can get from international countries right up to the United States, et cetera.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024 Convention on Cybercrime 811 Again, I am thankful to the fast-tracking of the Treaty to be endorsed by our Parliament through you, honourable and learned Attorney-General. I thank each and every one of you for the endorsement of this Convention. Even though Kiribati has also endorsed it, Tonga is already recognised, being part of the region, apart from Australia and New Zealand, that have endorsed the Treaty. They are accessible to the help of the Council in Europe and that is what we are aiming for. Once we ratify and send our endorsement to the Council in Europe, then everything takes its course from there. Thank you once more for all the hard work by the previous Government in getting the Cyber Act approved - endorsed by Parliament and enacted as well, but this is the most important one. Even for me in attending that workshop, I knew very little about this, almost nothing. I thought it was to do with some outer space thing and then I was surprised in sitting there, most of us who were there - the Senior Deputy Speaker of Vanuatu, also indicated that when he came to the meeting, he could not understand what he was going into, until we met. Then through interaction, we managed to learn a lot of things and I was a bit taken aback because of the time taken to reach the endorsement you have just done quite a while ago. There were so many issues. The Government of the day then, fast-tracked the Cybercrime Act, et cetera, and that is good. But we, in the Opposition - the SODELPA, at that very time, we were suspended from Parliament for six months, that saw to this time length been totally affected and that is why our lack of knowledge of this particular Treaty. I am kind of reiterating this to you, honourable Members, because these are some of the things that came our way, that saw to the delay in the endorsement of this Convention, especially by our very own Parliament. Then now, seeing that this has received support from each and every one of you, or Parliament as a whole, I am so grateful for that because I, and the Secretariat, do not want to be pointed at, that we were delaying this. That is the reason for that letter to the honourable Prime Minister and then to you, Sir, but probably the letter was still coming when your Treaty was pushed forward to be endorsed today. That is all that I wanted to add because this has been a new learning experience for most of us. I only remember quite vividly that when we attended meetings abroad on IPU, et cetera, it was the Leader of the Opposition who took an interest in all these - cybercrime, et cetera. To me, cyberspace and cybercrime are foreign words. I said to myself, “What the hack are we talking about here!” I thought it was to do with some outer space thing. However, when the Senior Deputy Speaker of the Vanuatu Parliament raised in our workshop, “Have you come across some problems? Can you give some examples?” Luckily, I looked towards the honourable Deputy Speaker because she filed a complaint with the Police regarding certain information that was put out in the social media that was so damaging to her. I asked for her forgiveness when I opened my mouth and said that, but she felt at ease again. But the Deputy Speaker of Vanuatu learnt a big lesson there, especially for the two Protocols that are part of this Treaty. It is there, waiting for us to endorse it. Once again, thank you so much and a big vinaka vakalevu to each and every one of you, especially to the Committee and to you, honourable Attorney-General. Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of today’s sitting and I thank you for all your contributions once more. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 5.48 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62</p></body>
