<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>LTA’s Safe Operating System (Question No. 66/2024) HON. N. T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the security measures taken by the Land Transport Authority to ensure its Operating System is safe and protected from possible hacking, tampering and manipulation? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tuinaceva for the question. I rise to provide this august Parliament a response to that question regarding the security measures taken by Land Transport Authority (LTA) to ensure its operation system is safe and protected from possible hacking. Sir, the LTA has, in place, an operating system that is user friendly and provide its essential services and daily operations of the organisation. The use of this system operation helps increase productivity and efficiency, conducts security multiple tasks simultaneously to ease the workflow. Over the years, it has been upgrading this operating systems according to its competencies and to enhance business processes. However, the more developed and advanced as we get in terms of technology, we need to ensure that the risks of manipulation and hacking is prevented or reduced, especially with great impact particularly those who depend on these services for their daily businesses. The LTA system is no exception. To address this issue, Sir, the LTA through its IT Department has implemented the following measures to protect its systems and data from hacking, tampering or manipulation: 1. Network Perimeter Firewalls that scans, and authorizes network data traffic, stops unauthorised any intrusive access into LTA systems and data by blocking or mitigating potential security threats in real time. 2. Anti-virus and Anti-malware software that manages all end-user devices and service systems to detect and remove malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans and spyware from the system. This is backed up by Malservice that monitors all events and alerts, generated 24/7, ensuring proactive and remediation applied as and when necessary. 3. 4. Email security is another big issue where all incoming emails are scanned to protect against malware, ransomware and phishing scams. All emails that are suspicious or present anomalies are blocked or mitigated in terms of securities in real time. Conducting preventative maintenance to regularly apply security patches and updates provided by the operating system to address known vulnerabilities.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>782</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 5. 6. 7. Conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration testing ongoing in terms of the network and the websites. So, a detailed report and remediation is then followed through. Implementing stronger user authentication mechanisms, such as complex password requirements, mandatory changing of passwords at intervals. Conducting access audits to ensure authorised users have access to the appropriate data and systems. The Authority has plans to further enhance its security cautions and evaluate the following tools, such as web application firewalls, security operation center with log management. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the protective measures to the LTA’s operating system, LTA also has in place the following: 1. Policies and Standards of Procedures, governing its business processes in its daily operations. These are reviewed regularly to ensure regulatory compliance and, of course, accommodate any necessary changes and challenges. 2. Audit investigations is an ongoing process, particularly in high risk areas in terms of 3. risk control and mitigation. Reconciliations are carried out regularly in order to ensure accuracy in the financial statements, data, stocks and other data which is provided to the customers. Thank you, Sir. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. Can the honourable Minister confirm that due to system failure, that permits were still being illegally issued when the permit freeze was still in place? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I am not sure whether I can comment on it because currently it is with the courts. So, I prefer not to comment in case it might prejudice the investigation because your question borders on the processes involved which also involves certain staff who have been taken to task at the moment. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to clarify, the question was simple. Can he confirm whether there were permits still illegally issued when the permit freeze was on because of the system? It is a yes or no answer. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- The freeze is currently on and that happened while the freeze was still on, so it happened during the freeze. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in the first part of the question, I think there are a couple of things. You are talking about hacking, tampering and manipulation. In terms of manipulation, can you tell Parliament, if a truck comes in to get weighed and if it is overweight, is it connected to headquarters so that headquarters knows that a particular truck has come in and its overweight and an alarm bell rings? Is it connected yet or not? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have that information with me but what I know is that when the truck comes in, the printout is done there. I will need to verify that and get back to you. Thank you. HON. F. S. KOYA. - In that case, if you do not know, is that not something that leads to</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>783 corruption and should that not be something that you immediately deal with? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU. - Yes, that is a possibility. At the moment, we have budgeted for upgrading all our IT systems so that they are, I suppose, interconnected. That is currently ongoing, and we aim to have those systems interrelated and I suppose talking to each other in the current project. HON. V. LAL. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament what measures are in place to ensure that LTA employees are adequately trained and are aware of the cyber security threats? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU. - Yes, of course, in terms of training, that is an ongoing exercise in all organizations, including LTA. They have also done their own training needs analysis as part of their HR strategy which includes what you have raised. Consultation on Crown Grants and Native Grants (Question No. 67/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs ad and Culture, Heritage, and Arts update Parliament on the consultation iTLTB is undertaking on Crown grants and Native grants? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question posed by honourable Vocea and I thank the honourable Member for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question, let me assure Parliament and the general public, that this consultation is a normal process that has always been carried out by the Reserve Commissioner. When it receives any claimant, it needs to go and carry out consultations - to have a feel on the ground and the truth about the claimants that have been sent to iTLTB. This process was stopped in 2010. I want to assure the general public that this consultation does not affect the current tenant and there is no need to worry.

Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me, first, provide some background. State freehold land originated from either a Crown Grant or a Native Grant title. Some parcels have retained the freehold title and are known as State freehold land, while some have cancelled titles and are now known as State freehold land without title. Crown grant was given the title for land that were sold prior to the Deed of Cession. The sale of these land was validated by the Land Claims Commission of 1876, after the public hearing of individual cases. A total of 1,582 Crown Grants, covering an area of 152,850 hectares, were</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>784</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 registered because of the Commission’s work. The Native Grant is the land that was purchased under the Native Land Acquisition Ordinance 1905, after the then Governor Imthurn reopened the sale of the land. Under that legislation, a total of 206 Native Grants, covering an area of approximately 42,440 hectares, were issued before the land sale was finally stopped. On the need to claim State land for reserve and reversion, before Cession, the sale of iTaukei land was rampant and was not controlled by any central authority. After the Deed of Cession was executed in 1874, the Governor then, Sir Arthur Gordon, discontinued all sale of iTaukei land. Over the years, grievances over the sale of iTaukei land began to surface from iTaukei landowning units. When unsolved, these grievances led to widespread disillusionment and ongoing disputes between landowners, tenants, Government and iTLTB. The iTaukei Lands Commission records revealed that 223 landowning units ( mataqali and tokatoka ) are dependent units that do not own any land and the following are the reasons why they lost their land. • • • • • They were sold and became freehold land. Tribal land were sold by some chiefs without their knowledge and are now classified as freehold through Crown Grant. They were absent during the Land Commission Inquiry. The original landowners were not present to lay their claims at the time of the Native Lands Commission land inquiry held soon after Cession, thus their land were taken up by the State. The 1905 Native Land Ordinance reopened the sale of iTaukei land which is now freehold land known as Native Grant. The sale of land owned by mataqali landowners with a declining population, were aligned and recorded under other landowning units. In 1905, the Native Land Ordinance allowed for acquisition of unused iTaukei land by Government for long-term leasing where some were for 999 years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two legislations used to process the claims are: 1. State Lands Act, under section 8, dealing with reversion, states and I quote: “Where any iTaukei land has been acquired by the State for any public purpose under the provision of the State Acquisition of Lands Act or any other written law, is no longer required for such purposes. The Minister (for Lands) after consultation with Cabinet may, by order, declare such land to be iTaukei land and such declaration shall be recorded in the Unit from which the land was acquired in the register of iTaukei land.” 2. iTaukei Land Trust Act, under section 18, dealing with reservation, states and I quote: “If the Minister (for iTaukei Affairs) is satisfied that land belonging to any mataqali is insufficient for their use, maintenance and support of its members, it shall be lawful for the Minister by proclamation to set aside such State land or land acquired for and on behalf of the iTaukei by purchase as in his opinion may</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>785 be required for the use and maintenance and support of such mataqali.” Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the reversion and reservation processes of State Land under the two legislations I have mentioned. 1. The iTLTB, through the Reserves Commission, carries out consultations with the claimants through formal inquiries and inspection of their iTaukei land holdings. The Commission also gathers other evidence to support the claims of the iTaukei landowners. 2. A report with supporting evidence and recommendations is submitted to the iTLTB Board of Trustees for consideration. 3. Upon approval, the Board resolution is conveyed to the Ministry of Lands for their verification and approval. 4. The Minister for Lands, upon completion of the verification process, will then table a paper before Cabinet. 5. Upon Cabinet approval - ▪ For reservation cases under section 18 of the iTaukei Land Trust Act, the Minister for iTaukei Affairs will publish a proclamation notice by gazette and the claimed land will then become an iTaukei reserve. ▪ For reversion case under section 8 of the State Lands Act, the Minister for Lands will publish an order by gazette and the claimed land will become iTaukei land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reserve seating schedule published by the Fiji Sun on 27 th February, 2024, was to inform the public that the Reserve Commission intended to hold consultations with iTaukei landowning units who had submitted their claims over State freehold land. These claims which had been pending since 2010, naturally resulted in a long list. The Reserve Commission was mobilised to investigate the claims. The reserve sittings commenced on Monday, 11 th March, 2024, and was scheduled to be completed on 22 nd May, 2024. The sittings were to be held in various Vanua - in the province of Tailevu, Rewa, Naitasiri, Serua, Ra, Ba, Nadroga, Lomaiviti, Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove. The sittings were suspended on 9 th April, 2024, to enable a recent Cabinet-mandated Committee on the issue, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, to re-asses the framework and propose to Cabinet the next steps to be taken. Mr. Speaker, Sir, continued work was reported on social media and local dailies which twisted the intention of the Reserve Commission’s hearing on Crown Grant and Native Grant claims. Everything was done above board. The Reserve Commission’s work on this is not new. The Crown Grants and Native Grants have been returned before. As we have already mentioned, the long list of claims was due to Government’s decision in 2010 not to entertain such claims again. That was a gross injustice to the claimants. We have reversed this for justice for the landowners.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>786</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, since I have only one minute, however, I am worried about the poor lessees. What will happen to them? If it is converted into Native land, what will happen? (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Just listen to me! Listen to me! I am explaining something, and you are just jumping. Once the term of the lease expires, then what will happen? On State land when renewal is done, there is no premium charged. So, when it is converted into Native and when you renew the lease, will there be any premium charged on the lands That is what I am worried about. The lessees will suffer, sugar production will go down, and that is what I am worried about. I am asking the honourable Minister to tell this Parliament that once the lease is expired, whether the term of the lease will be given for 99 years and whether they will charge any premium when you convert that into Native lease? That is what I am asking. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the lease expires, that will be determined by the honourable Minister for Lands, who covers the freehold land, in consultation with the iTLTB. As I have already mentioned, for now, there is no need to worry. The Government has set up a Committee, we are looking at the overall picture of the concerns from the public and we will take care of it. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if a land is converted into iTaukei land, how will you then consult with the honourable Minister for Lands when it has already gone to iTaukei Land Trust Board? (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- That is the problem. They have less knowledge about land. I am asking, once a land lease has expired, when it is converted into Native lease, what will then happen? He will not be able to discuss with the honourable Minister for Lands because the land has already gone to the iTaukei Land Trust Board. That is my question which he does not understand. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Oqoo koya na qele sa identify- taki me na lako me qai qele vaka-i-taukei vei ira era sa kerekere tu. E taroga tiko qo o honourable Kirpal, ena vaka evei o ira oya? Esa na mai veisau me qele vaka- i-taukei ka a qele tu mai vakamatanitu. HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Committee’s decision is approved by Cabinet, then it will really be a balance - it will take care of the landowners and those who lease on the land. If that is the case, then we will follow. It has already been transferred as iTaukei land, so it will go through the process at iTLTB. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Kirpal is raising a very valid question. The other element of his question, honourable Minister, is, will premium be paid since it is now Native land? HON. I. VASU.- It is the policy for iTLTB at that time. If they need to pay the premium, then it has to apply to everyone. MR. SPEAKER.- That is where the Government comes in, in paying for premiums of renewal</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>787 of leases and all. I stand to be corrected on that as well. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are speaking about premium, just a question to the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs. The Ministry of Local Government acquired a development lease and a premium was paid at that point in time. I will give a typical example. Land was acquired at Solove, Labasa. The land was acquired, development lease given to Ministry of Local Government, premium was paid to the mataqali by the Government back then and now it is only supposed to be releasing the leases. Now, iTLTB is asking for another premium, when Government actually paid the premium in the first place before acquiring a development lease for this piece of land where the residents are sitting. There are sitting tenants. They are supposed to receive the lease, but they have been asked to pay additional premium of $18,000 before the lease is issued. Why are we requesting for another premium to be paid when Government has already paid a premium before acquiring the development lease? HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just to inform this august Parliament, there is a lot of concern in regards to premium. We have now formed a Committee just to have a look at how the premium is being worked out and we will have to discuss with iTLTB to address the concerns of those who are leasing the land. In regard to the question regarding the one that has already paid the premium by the Ministry of Local Government, I am willing to discuss it with the iTLTB and I might have to come back with it. MR. SPEAKER.- It is Solove, Sir, in Labasa?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. VASU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> The premium was not paid by the Ministry of Local Government but by the Government? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- The Government paid the premium through Ministry of Local Government. A typical example would be Vunivau whereby more than $1 million was paid to the mataqali owners to acquire development lease. Everything is now done, it was just supposed to be distributed with the lease, but now iTLTB stepping in again to tell them to pay another premium because they do not recognise the premium that was paid by the Government to iTLTB back then and now they will have to pay another premium before they receive their proper lease. That is all, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.-Thank you, honourable Maharaj, I am trying to make an attempt to clarify this to the honourable Minister. All the mode of payments that goes regarding Native land either comes through the Ministry of Lands to Native Land or straight to Native Land. I do not know, maybe the system has changed then. Now, you are mentioning the Ministry of Local Government, that is quite news to me, but I stand to be corrected there, but we will take it from there. The honourable Minister has agreed and if you could just write down the particulars of the land - Solove and Vunivau. Oqo e tamani vanua vakaitamera orau ruarua oqo, na vanua vaka Labasa. Ni wawa vakalailai na turaga na Minister, au se dredre mada. Au nanuma de’u sa vakacavara e kea. Anyway, the floor is yours, Sir.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>788</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 (Laughter) HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you do not agree with what iTLTB has provided to you, you can provide a counteroffer. You can explain to them that the Government has already paid the premium, that there is no need for the individual to pay their own. MR. SPEAKER.- Who is to do that, Sir, honourable Maharaj? He is just raising the question.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. VASU.:</span> The tenant, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. D.

Leasehold Market Value (Question No. 68/2024) HON. S. S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources inform Parliament whether the Leasehold Market Value is regulated by any Act or Regulations? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think honourable Kirpal is all firing this afternoon. He has already tried to get you Mr. Speaker, on his sight. (Laughter) The simple answer to a simple question, is whether Leasehold Market Value (LMV) is regulated by an Act or by Regulations, as it is regulated by neither. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as honourable Minister for Lands is aware, most of the State lessees in agricultural land have more than one family living in their house. So, the LMV is a burden and makes it difficult for them to subdivide and get a registered lease because they have to pay 20 percent of the difference in value and also pay the surveyor’s fees and other related costs. My question is, can the honourable Minister for Lands consider that LMV be waived from all the</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>789 rezoning of State land? If not, can it be waived from agriculture land which lessees want to rezone to residential for their own use? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, a good example is the marginal lots. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- That is why we had that conversation during the Business Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I know that the real question was coming behind the question that was on the paper. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member understands very well the origins of how LMV as a feature of State leases originated in 1995. I think you were there. Also, on the other side of Parliament, there are two former Ministers for Lands who, I am sure, throughout their tenure, they would have approved and agreed on the imposition of those fees for payment. I think what it does or the intent behind it is to ensure that when people move the original lease use to a higher yield use, it is at somewhere that the State also gets the benefit. What it is suggesting is, we, the Ministry of Lands understand, and I am sure that he also understands from the time when he was with the Ministry that there is a real need for the State to also capitalize on something that we understand, is going to cause a gain to those who currently hold those leases. When they subdivide, for example, and I have some figures here. When a piece of land that was originally given an agriculture lease is now sought to be rezoned and subdivided into residential, there is a lot of economic gain to the developer. Someone who pays us $35,000 on LMV goes on to earn a lot far more than that, close to three-quarter of a million dollars. There is a strong public policy or reason why we should maintain the LMV, even though it is a policy of the Ministry. It is not on the Act, it is not in the regulations, and it is a strong policy that holds water, and it should be maintained. I think the answer to the honourable Member is that we deal with applications on a case-by- case basis but we often always look towards what is the economic component of that application before the imposition of the 20 percent is left. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Kirpal, I hope you are satisfied with that reply because if I may, many at times it has changed. The laws that we used to base our decisions on at that time when we were both working together, is quite different because for our marginal lots, we allow the relaxation of Town &amp; Country Planning. Instead of paying surveyed lots, we just went for the occupation. We cut one lot into two residential leases and then we give out agreement to leases based on that. But now since the previous Government had decided to go straight into giving out registered leases and will require a proper survey of the land. That is what you have been asking to be taken away - the survey fees, and they are expensive. But, again, the decision in policy making and all of that have changed a lot. What we see out there in Malolo, that is the same thing that I was asking here. The previous Government maintained that it wants to give registered leases. So, by going for registered leases, it is quite expensive. Maybe the previous Government thought that the Government could foot the Bill. But with this present Government that is what has been stated by the honourable Minister for Lands. Thank you.</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>790</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024 We will move on to the next Oral Question. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question has been withdrawn. I have advised the Secretariat that the question has been withdrawn. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- I will take that. You have advised the Secretary-General, on my note, it does not show any change so that is why I raise the question. We will move on to the fifth Oral Question for today. Honourable Members, I have received notification from the honourable Opposition Whip that honourable Ketan Lal has withdrawn his question as well. (Question No. 69/2024 and Question No. 70/2024 were withdrawn) Update – National Minimum Wage Regulations (Question No. 71/2024) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on the approved review of the National Minimum Wage and the 10 sectoral minimum Wages Regulation, including the proposal of new job classifications within the current Wages Regulation? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the National Minimum Wage and the 10 sectoral MinimumWages Regulations including new job classifications which was endorsed by Cabinet on 9 th April, 2024. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minium Wage Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928 (No. 26) which Fiji ratified on 19 th April, 1974, states in Article 1 Part 1, “that members of the International Labour Organization (ILO) that have ratified the Convention are to create or maintain a machinery whereby minimum rates of wages can be fixed for workers employed in certain trades, or parts of trades”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has secured a team of four consultants through an Expression of Interest. (EIO). The lead consultant, Professor Anand Chand, is actually the Acting Associate Dean, Research and Innovations at the Fiji National University, and together with him in the team are: Dr. Janesh Sami, Dr. Jone Lako and Dr. Maureen Karan, who are from USP. The team members are currently undertaking a comprehensive Minimum Wage Review. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the review process, the Ministry through the appointed consultants, ensured that all relevant stakeholders are fully consulted. The team has travelled around Viti Levu and Labasa and has also received written submissions. The team has also consulted the two major social partners - the Fiji Trades Union Congress and the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation, as well as the Chambers of Commerce and the rest of them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the proposal of new job classifications within the current Wage Regulations, the Ministry has appointed 10 wages Councils, together with a common chairperson who will be undertaking the review of the current job classifications.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>22 nd May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>791 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Employment Relations Advisory Board will them meet and make recommendations to the Minister, and the final decision, of course, will be made, together in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Coalition Government took office, the work to review the National Minimum Wage and the 10 Wage Regulations had been part of our commitment from day one. The Ministry will ensure that the due processes are adhered to for a fair and just minimum wage that will benefit all Fijians and the national economy as a whole. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the honourable Minister elaborate on the specific factors and considerations that are being taken into account in the review of the National Minimum Wage? The reason why I am asking this is because in the recent weeks, the honourable Minister of Finance was in Labasa. There were concerns raised by the employers about the $6. I would also like to know whether $6 is in place, is it being reviewed, is it from the Union or from is it the Government?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have stated very clearly ….</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I thought he was only passing a statement:</span> I never heard him, or have you changed it to a question now? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got his question. I can read his body language as well. As I have stated earlier, the process is ongoing now. Consultations are taking place. Submissions are being made by various stakeholders. The Fiji Trades Union Congress has made a statement that they would like the minimum wage to be $6, others have made other submissions. Once all the submissions are considered by the consultants, then the review process will take place from there. Nothing has been determined, that is what I want to advise. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, is there any timeline for this process, or is it going to take a year or something? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, we have earlier stated that the review will be completed and an announcement will be made during the National Budget. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my concern is for the small and medium enterprises. What measures are being taken by the Coalition Government to consider mitigating the impacts of the increase of minimum wages for the small businesses? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, at the expense of repetition, let me state in this august Parliament that consultations are in progress, and SMEs are also being consulted. No stakeholder is being left out. So, all submissions will be considered and then a recommendation will be made by this group of consultants. MR. SPEAKER.- On housekeeping, for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders in respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>792</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>22 nd May, 2024</p></body>
