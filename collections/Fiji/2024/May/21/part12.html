<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Update on the Refurbishment of the Ba Mission Hospital (Question No. 55/2024) HON. P. D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform Parliament on the progress of the refurbishment of the Ba Mission Hospital, for which a grant of $710,801 was allocated in the current financial year? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question. I would like to wish all students, including our students in the Chambers today, a very good first day at school for the second term, and I wish you all well. The Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection, Mr. Speaker, Sir, administers services and programmes aimed at ensuring that senior citizens in Fiji are supported to live a life of dignity, and this includes providing care for the elderly residents at our three Golden Age Homes across the country located in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa. As a brief background, the structural condition of the more than 80 years old Golden Age in Lautoka, has deteriorated significantly and is in urgent need of repair. In light of the above it was decided that the Ba Mission Hospital be renovated to temporarily accommodate the residents and carers, while the Ministry renovates the age-old property. And to this end, a grant of $710,801 was allocated in this financial year for the renovation of the Ba Mission Hospital. However, Mr. Speaker, and for the information of honourable Members, at the beginning of the financial year, the Ministry was advised by the Methodist Church of Fiji who are the owners of the Ba Mission Hospital, that there were alternate plans for the property. So, due to time constraints and the urgency of the project, the Ministry with assistance of the Provincial Administrator (PA) in Ba, worked on identifying an alternative site. Please, note we have explored other alternatives referred by the Board Chairperson of the Home and, unfortunately, those sites were neither available nor suitable for the residents. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry, through PA Ba, now has managed to secure an alternative property, and will be moving the residents and carers to Matanakilagi House which is owned by Ba Provincial Holding Company Limited, and we would like to thank Ba Provincial Holding Company Limited for this partnership. The Ministry has signed this letting agreement from 30 th April this year.</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>696</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, Matanakilagi House needs to be renovated to meet the needs of accommodating our elderly. The renovation works will be undertaken by the Divisional Engineer West (DEW) under the Ministry of Public Works at a cost of $341,835. The Ministry of Finance has approved the diversion of the fund from its initial intention, which is the renovation of the Ba Mission Hospital to the renovation of the Matanakilagi House. At present, the Ministry awaits the request to incur expenditure under RIE for the release of funds to the Divisional Engineer West, who has advised that the refurbishment of Matanakilagi House will take about eight weeks. Once Matanakilagi House is refurbished, the residents and carers will then be moved to allow for works on the restructure of the current site to take place. On that note, I would also like to confirm to this Parliament that consultations are also underway for the restructure of the Golden Age Home in Lautoka. Mr. Speaker, as I conclude my response, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the dedicated members of the Board of Visitors for the Golden Age Homes. Their unwavering commitment and tireless efforts in ensuring the wellbeing and care of our elderly residents do not go unnoticed. A special thanks to Mr. Kanti Punja, Mr. Abinesh Chand, Mrs. Rajneesh Charan, Mr. Vinesh Chandra, Ms. Yvonne Lagilevu. Mr. Selwa Nand, Ms. Shivali Kashyap, Mrs. Marica Rokovada Hallacy and Mr. Rajesh Patel, for their outstanding leadership and service. Your invaluable contribution are truly commendable and have made a significant difference in the lives of our senior citizens. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to our Gold Age Homes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the problem with this Government. They have allocated the money for a particular task, year is about to end, and no action taken on the ground. But when the budget is read, it is made to sound it is so good, everything will happen according to the delivery, but we know the implementation of various things that were stated in the budget has not been realized. MR. SPEAKER.- You have only 30 seconds left. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Therefore, honourable Minister, you were saying that it will take eight weeks to complete. Initially, we were told that people will be moving to St. Thomas, now some other place. How sure are you that this project will be completed within this budget? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for those comments, but I do want to share some history on how the Golden Age Home in Lautoka was handled by the previous Government. It is most unfortunate that at the time when I came in as the Minister, my predecessor had actually given the order for the elderly in the Golden Age Home in Lautoka because it was not inhabitable, to be moved to Labasa. It became very impractical, and the dislocation or displacement of our elderly are to be close to their families, as well as the staff would need to be relocated and moved away from their own homes too in Lautoka to Labasa in Vanualevu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, perhaps, just to shed some light, these things take time and also to look for suitable locations, but it has to be in Lautoka, it has to be in the Ba Province so that families can continue to visit their family members. They need assistance - the medical assistance as well as emotional support. That is why it has taken time, and we are very grateful to the vanua and the people of Ba for letting us use the Matanakilagi House because it has to be fitted properly so that we can take care of our elderly residents. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question here is about the process of allocating funds. In simple project management, there are cycles of project management - initiation,</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>697 implementation and then the close up. My question to you is how and who is responsible in terms of doing the work in which Government has given the funds but there was no clear direction as to what will the funds be utilised for? Allocation has been provided but preliminary work should have been satisfied before the allocation of funds to be given has not taken place. Who is responsible and why was this taken by the Ministry responsible? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition. As I had mentioned, when the allocation was made in the budget, we had already had an MOU with the Methodist Church of Fiji. So, we had gone through the preliminary process to ensure that Ba Mission Hospital was suitable for the relocation. So, we were counting on that relationship that had already been established with the Methodist Church. But it is most unfortunate that they have reneged on this agreement for their own purposes. They have other plans for the property, Mr. Speaker, so we were literally left out in the cold to find another location. It is not easy to find properties in that area or even in the province, especially when it comes to the needs of the elderly because they have to be fitted out specifically and this takes some works that are usually outside of the usual construction. So, it took time to find an alternative location. We scouted a few and then we were able to secure Matanakilagi House. Yes, honourable Leader of the Opposition, we did go through the process when we applied for the funding in the last budget, based on that MOU and agreement with Ba Mission Hospital which also came to Cabinet. Unfortunately, we had to deal with that situation, but we will certainly commit to our elderly in Lautoka that we will not relocate them to locations so far where they are away, like Labasa. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to know from the honourable Minister, given the original purpose for the funds been diverted to something else, in that process of awarding the funds, was a proper tender process utilised? HON. L. D. TABUYA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, when I came into the Ministry, this discussion with the Ba Mission Hospital was going back and forth with the previous Government. In fact, we were told that the Ba Mission Hospital was secured but then the Minister at that time felt and made the decision that they be relocated to Labasa, even though there was already that MOU in place with Ba Mission Hospital. So, coming into the Ministry, that was already in place. So, the process had already been done by the previous Government and my predecessor. The decision that was taken to move them to Labasa, in my opinion, was taken in haste, not considering the circumstances, as well as the emotional circumstances surrounding, even consulting our elderly as well as the staff. As I have said, coming into it we were prepared to work with Ba Mission Hospital as we proceeded but within the number of months on that faith, we applied for the budget but as you know, what happened after that did not happen. HON. J. USAMATE. - The tender process? HON. L. D. TABUYA. – On the relocation to Matanakilagi House? Yes, it is currently underway. The question, of course, on the relocation to Matanakilagi House, as I had mentioned, all project processes are being followed and you can ask that in the next budget, perhaps, if you have any issues.</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>698</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 MR. SPEAKER. – Thank you. That is the last supplementary question, honourable Bala. We will move on to the second Oral Question for today. Sustainable Development Priorities (Question No. 56/2024) HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the Whole of Government approach in achieving the Sustainable Development Priorities? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for his question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this question itself, perhaps, would require a broader Ministerial Statement but very briefly, I want to say that the achievement and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by way of background, when we started with the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) where there were eight goals focused on reducing poverty, providing housing, health and education, environmental sustainability in those 15 years and in anticipation of the end of the MDGs, the United Nations adopted the SDGs and, obviously, most countries including Fiji, signed the United Nations Agenda 2030 in 2015. Of course, for any country, that itself is a Whole of Government approach. No country could achieve the SDGs without having a whole of country approach. The SDGs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, compared to the MDGs are more ambitious. They address a much broader set of concerns and emphasises the links between global goals, national targets and national agenda. So, as part of the Government’s approach, we embrace a very comprehensive approach involving the entire Government and the inter-connected economic, social and environmental pillars of the 2030 agenda necessitate collaboration between different Government ministries. If I could just very quickly lay out the different Ministries that are responsible as focal points to coordinate this whole of Government approach would provide some information for the honourable Members in Parliament with respect to how this is being done. This was demonstrated in our most recent 2023 Voluntary National Review Report which was presented by the honourable Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs at the United Nations. That report was very well received. The focal points for each SDG (17 goals) as compared to 8 under the Millennium Development Goals. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. SDG1 – Eradicating Poverty comes under the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection. SDG2 – Zero Hunger comes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, SDG3 – Health and Well-being comes under Ministry of Health SDG4 – Quality Education comes under Ministry of Education SDG5 – Gender Equality comes under Ministry of Women SDG6 – Clean Water and Sanitation comes under Ministry of Public Works SDG7 – Affordable and Clean Energy comes under Ministry of Public Works SDG8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth comes under Ministry of Finance, SDG9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure comes under Ministry of Trade and Co- operatives. 10. SDG10 - Reduced Inequalities comes under Ministry of Women</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>699 11. SDG11 – Sustainable cities and communities comes under Ministry of Housing and Local Government 12. SDG12 – Responsible consumption and production comes under Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives. 13. SDG13 – Climate Action comes under the Office of the Prime Minister 14. SDG14 – Life Below Water comes under the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry. 15. SDG15 – Life on Land comes under the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry. 16. SDG16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions comes under Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Attorney-General. 17. SDG17 – Partnership for the Goals comes under the Office of the Prime Minister and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in that way, in accordance with the national priorities, I will just also name a few ministries, particularly, the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection is actively involved in sporting programmes that have a goal of reducing poverty. But again, reducing poverty, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a whole of government approach. That is a focal point and that ministry’s mandate is to work with all the other ministries. Then we have the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, Ministry of Health, SDG13 – the importance of climate action. Again, the importance of addressing SDG13 falls under the Office of the Prime Minister and that gives us a lot of synergy, influence and power to be able to promote SDG13 because it reflects the Coalition Government’s highest attention to SDG13. We are very pleased that some of the actions that we have taken over the last 17 months, not only in terms of accessing climate finance and looking at various projects, the influence and the leadership of the Prime Minister has given different ministries a much better influence and leeway in terms of negotiating some of the broader project-based activities under different development goals. The Whole of the Government approach, Mr. Speaker, Sir, emphasizes the collective contribution of all the stakeholders in achieving the SDGs. I could provide the whole list of stakeholders that are engaged. But let me also assure Parliament that the new National Development Plan will itself be a holistic approach to achieving the UN SDG Priorities and each sector of the new National Development Plan will align the Whole of Government commitment to the SDGs for future that is inclusive and prosperous and environmentally responsible. Just in terms of the National Development Plan, the nationwide public consultation was held over 300 locations around the nation with a record number of more than 21,000 people being consulted who had the opportunity to talk about the plan, exchange their ideas and the depth of analysis and collaborative nature of the Government ministries participation in the process, focussing on the SDGs has been quite defining. We are very pleased, and I am sure when the final plan comes out, it will also support this idea of holistic Government approach to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Thank you to honourable Professor Biman Prasad for his speech. Honourable Minister, the UNDP just recently issued a report which we were all quite privy to. This report basically said that the Pacific region and also the rest of the world was not on track to deliver any of the Sustainable Development Goals by the targeted 2030. Now it has been put to 2065 (I think). Have you, honourable Minister to ensure that we are not only doing this so that we do comply but are we doing things at breakneck speed so that we are compliant bearing in mind also that there is a climate change perspective to this and climate change issues are at the forefront for all the Pacific Island countries. I understand that there is a lot of stuff that needs to be attended to but what we want to know is, has this report been an integral part of your thinking....</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>700</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, sorry to be cutting you off the time has....</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Sir, I had 15 seconds left.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> That is my question, I think he understands that.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> No, no, I have not allowed that, the time for him to ask that question has lapsed. So, we will go on to the next one. Any supplementary questions? Please you abide by the time that we have set there. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, very good that we have the framework but implementation, pragmatism in the implementation is what is important. I have served in Committees. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What did you do about that? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- There is only one SDG that all Government ministries sort of concentrated on and that is SDG5. My question is, the cross-cutting issues, particularly handling resilient cities, climate change, et cetera. How is this being handled and how will you ensure that this trickles down to the very lowest level of implementation?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> 16 years, did nothing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> I think that is pretty obvious, Mr. Speaker, that is understood that the implementation and bringing the cross-cutting issues together and putting it in a strategic framework so that all the different Government ministries are able to see where the focus is. It is not always easy to do that but as I said, the National Development Plan is really cutting through different ministries. As we said, the reason why we have 3-year, 5-year and 20-year Development Plans is because we think that there are some basics that needs to be done as quickly as possible and we are looking at three years. Then there are things that immediately beyond basics may take five years or a little bit more. So that is how we are looking at implementation and I agree with the honourable Leader of the Opposition, implementation in anything you do, any project, any plan is critical. On the point that honourable Koya was trying to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of not meeting the targets. That is pretty obvious, again, COVID-19, environmental exigencies, existential threats has disrupted the original UN Agenda in 2015 to actually achieve certain SDGs in a specific period of time. Even the United Nations admits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, throughout the world, no country is actually on track to achieve all the SDGs partly because of COVID-19, partly because of what is happening globally in terms of conflicts and extreme climate events. So, we have to as a country make sure that we prioritise. We cannot have the resources for everything that we do. No country ever has that and so the important thing for us as a Government is to make sure that we put priority. I pointed out certain Ministries - Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women, Poverty and Social Protection and Ministry of Public Works are some key priorities that we have to focus on, even if we do not achieve fully the goals, we are actually making a progress towards it. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament where</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>701 is the National Development Plan which he has just mentioned? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Obviously, the honourable Member has not been listening. It is all over the country. We have said so many times here in Parliament and outside of Parliament that the National Development Plan would be completed by the end of this month. We gave the timeline and it is ridiculous for him to come here and waste Parliament’s time asking a stupid question, when is the plan going to be ready when it is all out there, publicly stated, approved timeline in Parliament. This is the level of questions and debates coming from them. Completely bogus, Mr. Speaker! Dental and Allied Health Professionals Salary Anomalies (Question No. 57/2024) HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament on its plans to review salary anomalies existing among the Dental and Allied Health professionals in the public sector? HON. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has acknowledge that there are existing salary discrepancies affecting healthcare workers employed by the Ministry. Some of these discrepancies have existed and remain uncorrected for many years up until now. The Ministry recognises the importance of addressing these salaries discrepancies. For healthcare workers including the oral health, professional and allied health professionals employed by the Ministry, and these they are very much committed to this process. It is an ongoing process, thus take time and effort and require wide consultation with stakeholders, including the Government agencies. We have started our nursing cadre which the Government had earlier endorsed and likewise we will anticipate other cadres within the healthcare sector to also put in a submission. At the moment, we are looking into the medical imaging technologist which the honourable Member had also raised in the Parliament last session. Sir, the Ministry will continue with the process to ensure that salary issues of its workers, including more than 200 oral health workers and more than 500 allied health practitioners currently in the Ministry are appropriately addressed. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we appreciate the attempt by the Coalition Government to rectify the issues with our nurses, it is concerning to note that the same has not happened to other health workers in the public sector. This is causing dissatisfaction, discomfort and pain, as I may say, among the workforce. My supplementary question to the honourable Minister, can he provide a projected timeline for these changes to happen? HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- As I had alluded to earlier, it is a process whereby we do consultations with relevant agencies such as cadre of the association, including the one which the honourable Member is a member of, but for the time being, we have done that for the nurses, and we are looking into the Radio Imaging Technologists, which the honourable Member has also raised. Again, Sir, it is a process whereby the Ministry, together with our stakeholders - the Ministry of Civil Service and the Ministry of Finance, will have to look into so that we can properly remunerate our healthcare workers. For the time being, it is just about dealing with our long serving staff to ensure that they are well remunerated for their years of service, so that is one of the areas that we are looking into.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>702</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 Again, in terms of the Oral Health and Allied Healthcare workers, as of today, we are discussing with them on their way forward. They will bring their own submission. As a Ministry, we will sit down and discuss with them. As always, we will request the Ministry of Civil Service and the Ministry of Finance to accommodate those requests. Bogus Employment Recruitment Agencies (Question No. 58/2024) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations update Parliament on the action taken by the Ministry in dealing with bogus employment recruitment agencies in Fiji?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for asking the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Ministry, as part of the process stipulated under the Employment Relations Regulations 2008 that actually governs employment agencies, has strengthened the regulatory framework, including the review and update of existing enforcement, compliance, and other regulatory procedures for recruitment agencies, to ensure that they are comprehensive and effective in addressing fraudulent practices. This includes implementing strict licensing requirements for recruitment agencies and a cash bond of $20,000 is part of the requirement as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the requirement also ensures that potential employment agencies applying authorisation will have to provide clear description of the services to be provided to the job seekers and they must also provide police clearance and valid address from where the business will operate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the inspection and compliance process, our Labour Inspectors promptly respond to any report on the operation of any bogus agency. We have, in the past, stopped recruitment agencies that have not been registered here and we have also asked them to go away. The Ministry, as part of the Public Awareness Programme, has continuously been conducting radio talkback shows, as well as media releases, to ensure that our people are not hoodwinked by these unscrupulous agents. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is also working with other enforcement agencies, like the Police Force and the Department of Immigration, to ensure that we have a multi-sectorial approach and provide the right information and guidance to our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind any company or person who wishes to recruit Fijian workers for overseas employment opportunities that they must register with the Ministry of Employment and obtain necessary approval from the Permanent Secretary for Employment before conducting any business of registering, recruiting and deployment of workers for overseas deployment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Ministry responsible for the enforcement and compliance of the Employment Relations Regulations 2008, the Ministry ensures all foreign contracts of service are vetted and attested to by a Labour Officer before workers leave for overseas employment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to protect members of the public from becoming victims of fraudulent activities by illegal recruiters, it is important for them to verify their recruitment authorization before entering into any financial agreement or providing personal details. Members of the public must also</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>703 demand from the recruiting agent their valid authorization certificate from the Permanent Secretary for Employment to ensure that they are engaging with the authorized employment agency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the record, the National Employment Centre (NEC) under the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations is the only center authorized to prepare workers for employment opportunities in Australia under the PALM Scheme, or in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer Work Scheme. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is always available to provide the right advice on overseas employment issues, to register their interest with the registered employment agencies authorized by the Ministry. I thank you, Sir. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his elaborate explanation. While the Minister had explained about the agencies here locally, I just want to ask the honourable Minister if there is a possibility of foreign or foreign employers coming directly and recruit workers in Fiji? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Thank you very much, Sir, and I thank honourable Koroilavesau for that question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the requirement is that they must first register with the Ministry of Employment and there is a $20,000 bond that they have to deposit. We do a thorough background check before we approve any agency that is interested to recruit our workers for overseas employment. We continue to monitor as they recruit and each time they come, they must come through the Ministry and then guided by the Ministry to actually select and recruit. After our pre-departure training, they are able to then deploy. As I have stated earlier, the contract itself has to be attested by us before they depart. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on the number of active agencies that they have with the Ministry, apart from NEC? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I understood clearly, honourable Bala asked whether there are any other agencies, apart from NEC. There is no agency, apart from NEC, that is authorized to register workers who seek employment abroad under the two Schemes. It is only through NEC that they can register. When the recruitment agencies come, they must come through NEC. After our due diligence is done, they are registered and after that, they can recruit. The eight agencies currently approved are: Packleader Pacific Limited; 1. 2. Alpha Pacific Navigation Pte Limited; 3. Pacific Employment Agency; 4. Adventure World Travels Limited; 5. Blue Harbour Recruitment Limited; 6. Manpower Supply and Staffing Limited; 7. 8. Colour Your Life Private Limited. Savenaca’s Services; and Those are the only eight that are authorised and, as I have said earlier, we regularly monitor them when they are around here. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; the bogus employment recruitment agencies in Fiji, you are talking about those that are recruiting Fijians to go and work</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>704</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 overseas? There is the other side of recruiting where you are recruiting overseas workers to come in and work in Fiji. Are they included also in your scrutiny for those that are getting overseas workers? I heard the honourable Minister for Sugar said that those who came and worked for him came under a recruitment agency. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. For those employers who are interested in recruiting workers from abroad to work for them here in Fiji, they go through the Ministry of Immigration. But once the workers are here, they are employed, and it is the duty of our Ministry to ensure that the employers here comply with the minimum standards equal to those that are governing our local employees. Utilisation of Funds for PPP for Housing (Question No. 59/2024) HON. A. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to update Parliament as to how the $2 million allocated in this financial year for Public Private Partnership for Housing has been utilised? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question on the utilisation of the $2 million allocated under Head 50 for this particular project. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to very quickly give you and Parliament a background, this Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiative was actually the brainchild of the FijiFirst Government. I think it was a good thinking to look at prospects of PPP in making sure that there is affordable housing because over the years, the number of increasing informal settlements has just continued. It has not gone down in any way, and the problem is getting bigger and bigger. As a government, our vision is to look at the next 10 years and ensure that we provide affordable housing, that we make more land available and provide a mechanism through which we could increase the supply of houses available for this category of people. The partnership agreement was signed with the International Financial Corporation (IFC), which is an organisation of the World Bank, to provide financial advisory services for the Government and also act as the lead for the project. The idea, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was to earmark six sites - Davuilevu, Nepani, Wainibuku, Raiwaqa in the Central Division, a site in Takakubu, Lautoka, and in Tavua with a total area of 266 acres to develop the first pilot project which is expected to supply around 3,000 housing units which will be climate resilient, green and Category 5 cyclone compliance structures. When we came into Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we looked at the whole proposal. We were, obviously, concerned about the success of PPP. We have PPP in the Health Sector and at some point in time, I will be informing Parliament as to what is going on there and how we intend to take that forward, so Cabinet has already looked at that. We took a very, very careful and considered approach in making sure that we get the right advice and that once the project, although it is a pilot project, it is a significant one that will be done properly. We have looked at models around the country, the tender has already gone globally, the process is at the moment underway and once the technical analysis and the appropriate due diligence is done with respect to the kind of companies or contractors, of course, local contractors are also eligible to do that then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be embarking on that.</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>705 In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a general point, we are also looking at other models to ensure that we address the whole issue of informal settlements. So out of the $2 million allocated for the PPP affordable housing project in the Budget under Head 50, to-date a sum of $859,702 has been utilised from the budgetary provision and that is essentially to accommodate the holding cost of four sites. Obviously, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government will be looking at that. We are expecting that there will be some additional cost, we may not use all the $2 million that has been allocated under Head 50. It will be a very prudent - nahi paisa hai. Honourable Bala is saying, we got the money, but I am saying baut paisa hai. That is where we are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that project. Again, I want to emphasise that the Government is very much focused on making sure that we create opportunities, mechanisms so that we can address the increasing squatters and informal settlements in the country. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister, the $2 million that has been set aside for these projects, is this $2 million just specified for the already identified sites or is it possible to divert for new sites that can be brought in by the private sector as part of the PPP? HON. PROF. B. C PRASAD.- Yes, I think what we are saying is that this is going to be a pilot project. These sites were already identified, and we have focused on those 3,000 housing units and $2 million was allocated to ensure that all the holding costs or any other costs associated with making this project start is there. As I said, we many not use all the $2 million but obviously the answer to your question, honourable Koroilavesau is “yes, we have to look at more because 3,000 is not enough” given the magnitude and the volume that we would require to address all the informal settlements and squatter settlements throughout the country. Repatriation of Chinese Nationals in 2017 (Question No. 60/2024) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament on the repatriation of Chinese nationals from Nadi International Airport in 2017? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in July 2017, a joint operation was conducted involving the Fiji Police Force, Department of Immigration and the People’s Republic of China Police Force. This operation targeted cyber related crimes perpetrated by Chinese nationals in Fiji. The operation was executed under the framework of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1997 and was conducted simultaneously by Chinese officials in countries like Indonesia, China and of the six locations in Fiji. The operation was initiated following a memorandum from the Ministry of Public Security of the People’s Republic of China which was dated July 2017. The memorandum detailed a series of cyber fraud cases linked to criminal syndicate led by a suspect named Mr. Wu Chang. The syndicate had established fake gambling websites leading to significant financial losses for victims, including tragic cases where a victim in Jilin Province committed suicide after being defrauded of over $3.3million Chinese Yuan. Upon the approval of the Chinese request that was made to Fiji and the Police Force, the Chinese delegation of seven police officers arrived in Fiji to assist with the investigations.</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>706</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 The operation on 18 th July, 2017 involved six teams, comprising Fiji Police Officers, Immigration officials, Chinese Police Officers and interpreters from the Chinese Embassy. The operation took place in six occasions within the Nadi area namely, Nakurakura, Naisoso, Bountiful, Votualevu, Legalega and Maigania. This effort led to the apprehension of 77 Chinese nationals involved in the cyber-related crimes. These individuals had arrived in Fiji, we are talking about the 77 people who are alleged to have committed this offence, arrived in Fiji between May and June 2017 on a four-month visitor permit. Investigations revealed that they were operating from rented dwelling houses set up as operations centres to entice victims into fraudulent online batting schemes. Given their actions, the Department of Immigration recommended that these individuals be declared prohibited immigrants under section 13(2)(g) of the Immigration Act 2003. They were placed under house arrest in Legalega and Naisoso pending further action. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that Fiji and China do not have an extradition treaty to-date. However, that repatriation was facilitated under the provisions of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1997, which allows for cooperation between countries in criminal investigations and the enforcement of legal measures. Might I add that we had used similar provisions for repatriation recently to the US on drug related offences and on the current case that involved Mr. Kim from Grace Road, the case being currently pending in the High Court. Mr. Speaker, Sir, subsequently section 9 of the Act enables foreign countries to request assistance in criminal matters and section 133 permits the Attorney-General to authorise search and seizure operations in response to such request. Consequently, detention warrants and removal orders outlined in section 9(2) were issued for these individuals. The breaches of their visitor permit conditions as outlined in section 9(2) and section (64)(1)(k) of the Immigration Act 2003 warranted their repatriation. These measures were necessary to uphold Fiji’s laws and maintain public order at the time. The repatriation process ensured that the 77 Chinese nationals were deported from Nadi International Airport back to their home county. Specialised Training and Resources for Teachers (Question No. 61/2024) HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on what specialist training and resources are being provided to teachers to assist them in dealing with the huge problem of drug possession and drug use prevalent in our schools? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have answered some of these in yesterday’s question, but I would like to take this time to clarify and inform this august House on the important roles and responsibilities that are placed with the teachers. As we know the responsibility of disciplining students in the Ministry of Education is confined only to the school boundaries or school organised activities in the boundaries whereby teachers can monitor students’ actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the students walk out of the school gate this is considered a public space and public area and students’ activities become the responsibility of other Government agencies like the Fiji Police Force or the Ministry of Social Welfare. They usually liaise with the Heads of Schools on student behaviours and the schools will always contact the parents or guardians.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>707 Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned yesterday, the Ministry of Education’s role starts with the Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC) which is the statutory body in the Ministry of Education. They have, over the years, been responsible for the drug demand reduction programmes in schools. This includes the provision of training for teachers on areas in: how to identify the signs of students who may be using or abusing drugs; the type of drugs available in Fiji; its effects, the legal implications; and • • • • we are also helping out students trying to recover from drugs. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we will all agree that the Ministry of Education cannot hold the bull by the horn alone, it needs a united front from the family unit, vanua, government, religious organisations and civil society to restrain the drug problem. Since 2010, the SAAC has been providing training to teachers in schools and these trainings have been intensified with the support of the Police Drug Unit and Ministry of Health. This joint effort has resulted in having 1,960 teachers from the nine education districts who attended these organised trainings. These trainings also include the support mechanism available in school to assist the student who are showing signs of being addicted to drugs and the positive step towards recovery. The drug recovery plan also include the support that parents, teachers and friends will provide to the student. The Police Drug Unit now called the Police Narcotics Bureau facilitated an in-depth training sessions with the teachers on all aspect of drugs and substances - the drug effects, signs and symptoms, legislation, handling of drugs, reporting and referral. The Fiji Police Force Blue Light Programme which empowers students is also a platform for our students to share and take responsibility and consequences of their decision. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this training, these trained teachers conduct awareness during professional development through school staff meeting sessions, sharing the strategies in curbing the use and sale of drugs in their respective schools and mechanisms to actively listen and help students with drug symptoms. HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable Minister for his response. The data or information provided by the Substance Abuse Advisory Council is quite alarming, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last three years. In 2021, there were 2,200 cases reported in schools. In 2022, there were 2,800 cases and last year 3,500 cases. It is a fight that the honourable Minister cannot fight alone, and it calls for our unified effort, not only by the Government but also the people in the community. My question is, are our children safe in their schools? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only say that the Ministry of Education is providing a safe environment, the best as it can with all the support and necessary facilitation from other relevant agencies. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, as you rightfully pointed out, and I think honourable Naivalurua also did say that, it requires a concerted effort on all interested parties. My question is relative to the parents because this begins at home. In terms of the training being given to teachers, is there a concerted effort on the part of the Ministry to engage with each parent teacher association, to ensure that the parents are well-informed about the hazards, et cetera, that exist in schools and about the drug use and how it can be dealt with at home? Because the discipline needs to start at home. Is there an effort to engage with the parent teacher association at every school?</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>708</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member. As I have said, on processes within the Ministry, there is always engagement of parents and parental consent when students are identified to be in possession of drugs. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Honourable Minister, I do agree that the drug issue is everyone’s issue and it is corroding the future of our country. With the trainings you have spoken of that has been given to 1,960 teachers, is there any provision for the school management and the teachers to be equipped with the drug testing kits? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was a very good question by the honourable Member, given the task at hand that has been expected from the teachers to provide proper teaching methodology to the students and imparting knowledge, these are some additional areas that probably might be considered by the Ministry in discussion with the relevant stakeholders such as the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Defence to ensure that we are not putting ourselves at risk, especially the teachers, for conducting this extra or additional responsibilities. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn the Parliament now for lunch and we will resume at 2.30p.m. The Parliament adjourned at 12.33 p.m.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>709 The Parliament resumed at 2.37 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we move on to the second stage of questioning, that is, on the Written Questions, please, join me in welcoming another lot of Year 10 students from Yat Sen Secondary School. Welcome to your Parliament and I hope that the proceedings will give you a better idea of how your Parliament works. We look forward to more visits such as this as it enables us to, kind of, come to grips with what sort of interest it generates to the younger part of our population, that is, the school children. We would like to encourage more visits, so the more visits you make, the more you will learn about this very important aspect of our country where democracy exists - how it makes laws, how it changes and amends laws and how it even repeals laws. So, welcome, and I hope you enjoy your visit here this afternoon. Justices of Peace (Question No. 62/2024) HON. L. S.
