VAKALALABURE. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that Parliament debates the Review of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018–2019 which was tabled on 17 th April, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU. - Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE. - Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, as the Member moving the motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Review Report of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018–2019. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in July of last year and I wish to proceed directly in reiterating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in this Report. To being with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were a few issues identified which the Committee noted and those are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. The high staff turnover in comparison to 2018, 2019 – todate. Low budget allocation for the reported year in which in turn constraints parliamentary work. Lack of awareness of the powers and authority of Parliament and its Committees by civil servants. Lack of full digitization of its Standing Committees. Significant number of bills stated for the reported year that stands at 88.5 percent and as a comparative, 99 percent for the year 2023 that were enacted under the Standing Order 51. The Committee notes that Parliament has considered the inclusive participation of communities at all levels through the medium of broadcasting and further notes the lack of information supplied with respect to the gender composition within the two Divisions. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lack of information on gender hinders the ability of the Standing Committee to scrutinize the report from a gender perspective as required by the Standing Orders of Parliament under Section 110(2). However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of these issues were addressed and clarified by the Department and any information on this can be attained or retrieved in the Committee’s report.</p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>744 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now go straight into the recommendations put forth by the Committee for the consideration of this august Parliament and these are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The Committee recommends the timely submission of Annual Reports. The Committee recommends that a Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) be conducted for the Department given that the last JEE was conducted in the reported year. The Committee further recommends the upgrading of IT systems and full digitization of Committee sittings. The Committee further recommends that the Standing Orders be amended to review the use of Standing Order 51 by referring it to a specific sub-committee. The Committee recommends that the Department ensure that there is formal SDG compliant component in all future reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Department in tabling a substantive response to the Committee’s review report as set out in Section 121(6) of the Standing Orders of Parliament.</p><h4>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to present this Report</h4><p>and I ask the honourable Members to take note of this Report. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. For the information of honourable Members, I have a list here of speakers and they will be speaking in the following order: 1. Hon. K. K. Lal; 2. Hon. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 3. Hon. M. D. Bulitavu; 4. Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the report and to provide my contribution. I commend the Committee, this Report was tabled in April, and we can see that we now have fully fledged report here for debate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the immediate attention and collective action that we need to focus on is the consistency of staff turnovers. The report highlights the pertinent issue of staff turnover from 2018, 2019 to present. High turnover rates are 6.01:40 to the efficiency and continuity of Parliamentary operations. They lead to loss of institutional knowledge, decreased productivity and increased training costs. Sustainability in staffing is crucial for maintaining the effective functioning of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other area I would like speak on is the lack of awareness or the powers and authority of Parliament and its Committees by civil servant. Not only civil servants but I think we need to focus on creating more awareness for our younger generation. We look forward to the Women’s Parliament and in previous sessions, I recommended to Parliament that we try and get a Youth Parliament as well. The younger generation are keen to be part of how the democratic or legislature process of the country is currently being handled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about Parliament, we talk about freedom of speech, freedom of MPs doing our work. Recently there was a case where honourable Member Rinesh made some opinions on social media and he was bullied by one of the Ministers. The young people are talking</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 745 about this, Sir, how much freedom do they have to provide an opinion with respect to Parliament. We are talking about Parliament report, we should have the freedom that citizens of Fiji should be given the right to give their opinion and not be bullied. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now see that Parliament is fully digitalized. I understand there was a extensive amount of funding allocated which was $4.6 million (I do not know the exact details where this funding was allocated) but we are still facing some technical issues and I hope our very talented IT officers can get down to the issues and solve that. Last think I want to speak on, the most important one which we have been debating all these while when Bills come with Standing Order 51. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights the significant number of Bills enacted under Standing Order 51 with a notable increase from 88.5 percent in the reported year to 99 percent in 2023. While this indicates a high legislative activity, it also raises the concerns about thoroughness of the legislative process. The expedited procedures of Standing Order 51 should not be compromised, the quality of scrutiny and debate is carried out. Mr. Speaker, Sir, previous Oppositions were all about going to the consultation process, but now when they are in Government, some of them are in Government… MR. SPEAKER.- Were you there, honourable Member? HON. K. K. LAL.- I was not part of the previous Opposition but I did research and went on and checked some of the Hansard Reports. Some of these honourable Members were talking about consultation but now they are doing the opposite when they are in Government. The people of Fiji are watching, they will hold us accountable for the words and the for the sentences we use in Parliament. With those words I have nothing more to add but all I have to say is we need a Youth Parliament. There are young people who are out there who see some of us speaking, some of us engaging, debating and they want to become future parliamentarians as well but they need this learning ground which is the Youth Parliament. I request the Government to increase the budget for Parliament (maybe the honourable Minister for Finance if he is listening to me) please increase the budget for Parliament and also if you can engage some money for the Youth Parliament. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute and support the motion that is currently being debated in this august Parliament. I first of all would like to pay my respect to a member of the staff that we lost earlier in the month. He has been a very loyal servant of the People in Parliament of Fiji, may his soul rest in peace. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been described that it is the People’s House, Parliament is the people’s House, the highest Court of the land. This august Parliament is the third arm of Government, it carries a constitutional responsibility to make laws, and to hold accountable the Executive and the Judiciary in a balancing act required by and for the separation of powers. As I reported in the morning, Sir, my delegation and I had visited the Speaker of the House of Commons last week. It was a very happy visit and as I stated this morning that Mr. Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons was only too willing to render his assistance to strengthen this Parliament. I hope that in the not too distant future you will have a delegation going out to visit the House of Commons, particularly to visit Malborough House again. The root of the constitutional changes that had happened to Fiji.</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>746 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st May, 2024 Returning to the Report before Parliament, Sir, I want to firstly commend the Standing Committee for their Report. For latter half of the period under review, I was the Leader of the loyal Opposition in this august Parliament. Allow me, Sir, to acknowledge you as the honourable Speaker, the Secretary-General to Parliament and all the staff of the Legislature for the long hours of dedicated service rendered to the nation. I am aware few staff have also passed on since Parliament was re-established in 2014 after its last sitting in 2006 and I recognise the often-difficult environment the Secretariat operated in. I must also commend, Sir, the new Standing Orders issued in July 2023 which is now serving Parliament very well. I now turn to the Report and recommendations made therein. At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to express my concern at the length of time taken to review this Report, it has been eight months. This seems unusually long when no public consultation were held by the Committee or is perhaps due to the delay in responses to queries made by the Committee. I also note that the Report ruled the limited number of Committee sitting days. Perhaps in future, Sir, all reports being reviewed by the Standing Committees of Parliament should be open for public comments. In this way, we parliamentarians and all agencies funded from the appropriations approved by Parliament, should know the views of the people on how their taxes have been used. All annual reports are now in digital format, so they may be simply emailed out to citizens and organisations who, perhaps, sign up to be on the Parliament email distribution list, and they can make oral or written submissions to the Standing Committees. Recommendation 1 Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the recommendation for the timely submission of the Annual Reports. This is a legal requirement breached by the consistent delay across the whole of Government in submitting Annual Reports. The Financial Management Act requires Annual Reports to be tabled to Parliament promptly and the failure to comply was evident when I was the Leader of the Opposition where we debating reports from 2007 and some Ministries and agencies had not submitted Annual Reports since 2013. Perhaps, it was due to no sittings between 2006 and 2014. This is a sad state of affairs and continues today, and I continue to urge Ministers to ensure their Ministries and any Commissions and statutory bodies under their portfolio must report promptly to Parliament as required by the Financial Management Act 2004. Recommendation 2 For another job evaluation exercise, as there continues to be a high turnover in the Parliament Secretariat. Perhaps, it is time to consider bonding or having a retention package so that we can get a return of investments made by Government in their development and training. For those who proceed on study leave with pay, that the Secretary-General considers bonding them for a certain period of time after they come back and those who undertake trainings, conferences and workshops whether in Fiji or overseas, to be similarly bonded or encouraged to stay on. While we do not want to stunt career progression of civil servants, Government must take steps to safeguard the investments made by taxpayers in civil servants to, at least, benefit on the knowledge and development gained for some time before they are released. Other people are</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 747 harvesting our human resource development programme, Sir. As Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service and Parliament, I find it commendable that international agencies, regional agencies, NGOs and Embassies find our civil servants to be exceptional additions to their workforce. However, as Head of Government and Minister responsible for the Civil Service, this is a consideration to be made across the Service. Recommendation 3 Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has been implemented with the upgrade of the IT system and digitisation of Committee sittings. Recommendation 4 Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the review of the Standing Orders, in particular, the use of Standing Order 51, the review has already been carried out last year. I feel, Sir, that I must discuss Standing Order 51 in some detail, given the protests from the loyal Opposition to its use in the Bills tabled yesterday. As you are aware, as a former Cabinet Minister yourself, Standing Order 51 has always existed in the Standing Orders in some format. This is to allow Government of the day to fast-track urgent legislations, where consultation is not possible, in an emergency or where extensive consultations have already been carried out. I believe, Sir, that the extensive use of Standing Order 51 - the initial part of the revival of our legislation, we were probably coming out of a period when there was no legislation carried out in Parliament. Bills were coming out of a period of legislating by Decree. I remember that very well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1987, I ruled by Decree from September to December of that year. I passed 25 Decrees. My first one was saying that we are now Republic and then my last one – Decree No. 25, I said that I am no longer the Leader of this Republic. I handed over leadership to His Excellency the President and asked him to get a new Constitution, get a new Prime Minister and get us moving forward. So, when we were going through that period, when we had to use Standing Order 51, it was perhaps, that we were just coming out of the era when we ruled by Decree. Recommendation5 These are pretty much in order, and I support them. On Recommendation 5, I propose that this requirement apply to the Annual Reports from the Ministries, Departments, Commissions, Statutory Bodies and Public Enterprises. I hope, Sir, that my comments will be taken as constructive and in the interest of the nation. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this debate and I commend the motion to Parliament. May we continue to work collaboratively for the betterment of Fiji, and I support the motion, Sir. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a short contribution to the motion that is before Parliament and that is the Review Report for Parliament for 2018 to 2019.</p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>748 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st May, 2024 Most of the issues that are covered in the key findings of our Report has been covered by previous speakers - the honourable Prime Minister and also honourable Ketan Lal and some will be covered by the honourable Minister of Finance. But I hope it is not boring, given that all those participating in this particular debate are from Vanua Levu and this is the Parliament of Fiji and you being the Speaker, Sir. I hope it will not be biased. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we thank the Secretary-General and your Office, Sir, for responding to our recommendations. We have received it, it has come in a very timely manner and also at a time when we are debating it at the moment. Also, the response from Fiji Parliament in terms of the Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE), as also recommended, I think the Parliament has assured the Committee that there will be a comprehensive assessment to the current roles and also some structural changes in the organisation’s structural reform that will be taken. It will ensure the improvements in the organisation and also ensure that a Job Evaluation is conducted with its greatest possible level accuracy and efficacy. The assurance in terms of recommendation for IT upgrade in the Chamber and also in the Committee rooms will also be prioritised. I thank Parliament for responding to the Committee in a very timely manner. Also, the assurance from the honourable Prime Minister that this will follow suit for the other Ministries as well when Parliament makes recommendations that the Standing Orders are complied with in terms of the 14 days and 21days for the responses to come back because it helps the Committee in making improvements in other future reports that it will deliberate on. On the issue of Standing Order 51, I think a lot has been said by the honourable Prime Minister. We all will agree that any Government of the day will always use Standing Order 51 to fast-track Bills. It was used before and used again now, but there is always argument from the Opposition to suggest that it has been overused. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the statistics that were there, what we found in our deliberations as a Committee, given the higher number of Bills that were coming under Standing Order 51 and also the role of the Standing Orders Committee to deliberate on Bills, when suggested an amendment to the Standing Orders, I think this is not appropriate forum to discuss it but there is a Standing Orders Committee that is there under the Standing Orders in which you, Mr. Speaker, is the Chairperson, probably the Committee was suggesting a discretion to be with you, Sir, in terms of approving a particular Bill, whether it should go through Standing Order 51 rather than going to Committee of the Whole, given the high statistics we have seen in the Committee while we deliberating. Again, as we move forward, probably more Bills will be coming. I have seen some Bills coming this week, and looking forward to other Bills that will be referred to the Committee this week and yet to be tabled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the Committee has seen is the allocation of more funding to Parliament. That is quite urgent - increasing the Committee work and also more staff could be recruited in which it will need more funding. I hope the honourable Minister of Finance who will speak after me, will also assure us, given that we are yet to come to the Budget, that probably the request from the Standing Committee can be taken on board. From what the Committee has found in a few cases that when Parliament makes its submission to the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economy before, most of the time the full submission is not taken on board. So, I hope that we show special preference to our Parliament and</p><div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 749 also that it is prioritised because it is the house of the people. Those are some of the things that the Committee has noted and I have also been assured by the honourable Prime Minister that in terms of civil servants and the authority of Parliament, that that is something that we all need to take part in, especially Government Ministers, in encouraging their civil servants or Permanent Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, that they need to appear before the Standing Committees when communication comes to them, given that certain powers that are with Standing Committees are equivalent to the powers of the High Court. Standing Committees can also summon people and also compel documents, but we do not want to exercise those powers. We want to build that relationship with civil servants so that they do not fear the Parliamentary Standing Committee for any submission. But, again, there needs to be some awareness in this particular area on the Powers of Parliament and also on how civil servants can work with Members of Parliament, especially on the information and they are the ones who will be implementing the policies. At the end of the day, it comes in the form of annual report and that will be deliberated by the Standing Committee. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Members who have spoken before me. Let me begin by saying that I feel this Parliament is now a much happier place to come to and I feel that as a group of legislators, we are now doing our work without fear and uncertainty. I feel very good about it - good about the environment, good about the feeling of bipartisanship, despite at times some bitter and acrimonious debates. For that Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank you for your wise counsel, guidance and reliable leadership. In addition to that, I also want to say that the honourable Prime Minister himself, within the Government and within this side of the Parliament, has always provided a leadership direction that brings about bipartisanship that feels that you like to come to Parliament. I can say this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the eight years that I was in Opposition, sometimes I actually did not feel like coming to Parliament. I am very happy that, that is a past, and we are moving forward as a real democratic Parliament. In the 2023-2024 Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Parliament was allocated $16.2 million, compared to $8.6 million for the 2022-2023 financial year. No doubt the increase in the allocation by over $7.6 million has been prudently utilised by Parliament. The other very important point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to the budget and under your guidance and leadership, that too has come to fruition. In fact, Sir, you would recall that after 2014 Elections, in 2015, the formula for funding political parties, funding Members of Parliament for the duties that they undertake as legislators was unilaterally chained, and particularly the Opposition suffered in a big way. I am happy that under your leadership and under our Government, we have ensured that the political parties, their officers and also the budget allocation for the Members in terms of the allowances is adequate for them to undertake their duties. The increase in this year’s budget as you would know that it has allowed Parliament to increase its awareness programmes including the Standing Committee meetings, the preparation of the 2024 – 2025 Budget. We want to ensure that the IT systems and the full digitization of the Committee meetings are also undertaken. We know that the Fiji Parliament is mainstreaming gender issues in its legislative processes and oversight functions including in its corporate policy.</p><div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div><p>750 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 21 st May, 2024 I know that Fiji Parliament has also plans to translate Hansard into vernacular – Vosa vaka Viti and Hindi and translation into braille will also be an enormous undertaking by the Fijian Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very pleased to say that under your leadership, the Parliament has engaged translators to provide translation from vernacular to English during Parliament sittings. This is very well appreciated and accepted by everyone in the country that after a long time, we have the ability or environment to actually use our vernacular language to make our points as we see sometimes being done. A sum of $4.4. million was allocated in the 2023–2024 Budget, in supporting Parliament’s community strategy with the purchase of multi-language captioning system that will enable Parliament to be a more inclusive and increase citizen engagement in the three languages that will be televised and livestreamed on the internet. I know that the digitization of the is still in progress. I am sure that this will be completed in a very short period of time, perhaps in the next few months. I just wanted to also say that between 2018 and 2023-2024, a total of $61,526,389 has been allocated to Parliament; the highest being in the current budget of $16.2 million. The Financial Management Act under section 37(a) of 2004, all independent officers including the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji is expected to be adequately resourced and independently provided resources so that the Legislature can do its work without any hinderance from anywhere. We are very pleased that the budget that was allocated in the 2023-2024 Budget has allowed the Parliament, as an independent body, to achieve those objectives which support the practice of democracy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say this to my Opposition colleagues and to all those who have a view about Government, we may not agree on the performance of the Government, on how the Government has done in the last 17 to 18 months, but one thing Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all can agree that we now have an air of freedom, we now have a practice of democracy …. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … we have a Parliament where legislators can feel free and can talk to each other; this is the feedback. I have to be very honest to say this. When we go around, when you talk to the business community, they actually take the queue from Parliament, they look at your leadership and many people have come to me, not just people in Fiji, internationally, our development partners and they highly appreciate the fact that under your leadership, under the leadership of the Prime Minister and this Government. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- There is now a practice of democracy and all the indicators, the recent Freedom House Index, puts us up there. The removal of the draconian Media Decree, all these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has allowed Parliament to be the beacon of democracy. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under your leadership is a temple of democracy and that is the biggest change that we have seen in the last 18 months.</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 751 HON.

PRASAD.:</span> I want to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your leadership and thank the Secretary-General to Parliament, all the staff of Parliament for taking on a new day and a new practice of Parliament in this country and a new practice of democracy. Long live democracy in this country. HON. RATU R. S. S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to thank the honourable Members for their input with regards to the motion before Parliament. I also join them, thanking your good self, Sir and your Office, the Office of the Secretary-General and all the staff in Parliament for facilitating whatever it is for honourable Members and also the Members of the Committee. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Koya we still keep our fingers cross on the budget. Question put. Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of our sitting today. I thank you so much for all your contributions, patience and understanding as well in trying to get through whatever we have had in our Order of the Day. I thank you all for that and Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow morning at 9.30. The Parliament adjourned at 6.33 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75</p></body>
