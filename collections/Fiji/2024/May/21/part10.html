<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking interest in the workings of your Parliament. Year 10 Students &amp; Teachers – Yat Sen Secondary School Honourable Members, today we are joined by the Year 10 students and teachers of Yat Sen Secondary School. Vinaka vakalevu, welcome to your Parliament and I hope that the proceedings this morning will give you some idea of how your Parliament works. Parliament relies on you children, we need more astute ladies to be here representing the people of our country in Parliament. So, you being here is not new, you have your former colleagues in here, some may be Members of Parliament, others are members of the Secretariat, those that run the affairs for the Parliamentarians in our Parliament. Vinaka vakalevu for making the effort. Uncorrected Daily Hansard - Delay For the information of honourable Members, the Uncorrected Hansard Report for yesterday’s sitting will be circulated as soon as it is finalised. You may be wondering, honourable Members, as for the $4.4 million upgrade in our IT, nothing like this will crop up again. I was a bit taken this morning when informed this happened yesterday and was fixed by 5.00 p.m. yesterday. I told them, “$4.4 million must be worth the investment,” otherwise it is just like the IT people, they are so far ahead, they communicate with people abroad, up in the air and everywhere, but for simple things like this when it suffers a glitch like that if I may borrow that word, then it makes us ponder again</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 whether is this worth the investment? But I promise honourable Members that the Secretariat will really look into this seriously so as to ensure matters like this do not arise again.</p></body>
