<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following honourable Ministers have given</p><h4>notice to make Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:</h4><p>1. Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 2. Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; and 3. Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. Honourable Members, once again, let me remind you that Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes. Yesterday I was following very closely on the notification of the timing on the walls and even to the Deputy Prime Minister, honourable Professor Biman Prasad, he stuck to the time and that is an achievement. (Laughter) When the Statement has been made, the usual comment by the honourable Leader of the</p><h4>Opposition or his designate will then be given five minutes for those replies.</h4><p>Recent Visit to the United Kingdom HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament. I also greet those who are listening in or watching us on livestream, and I reiterate the words of welcome to the student who are visiting Parliament this morning. I see my late sister’s daughter leading the group and her daughter probably in the group too. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Ni sa bula vinaka. I also thank those who may be listening in by radio this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a Ministerial Statement about my recent visit to the United Kingdom. In late 2023, Sir, I received an invitation, or the Government received an invitation, it was a very well worded invitation that did not say very much. It said that His Majesty the King was inviting the Prime Minister of Fiji to visit. So, we waited for the Government representative in Fiji, the British High Commission to give us more details about the invitation. Only last month we received confirmation that His Majesty was inviting me to have an audience with him in the palace. I accepted the invitation with great humility knowing that a King’s invitation or request is a subject’s command and those who have had military training would understand, “Your wish is my command.” The relationship with the United Kingdom, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is deeply intertwined in our modern history. Most of the students who are here with us are history students, also enshrined in our laws, conventions and our institutions, a history that we share in part with those in England at this time. It is a history that teaches us numerous lessons in Government, governance, leadership and life that embodies the balance between tradition and modernity, transitioning from one generation to the next, amidst the complexities around the changing environment we live in.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>681 The visit commenced with a call on His Majesty, King Charles III at Buckingham Palace on 7 th May, 2024. It might be interesting to note if our honourable Minister for Home Affairs is aware that they have changed the Crown that is used by the King and all the badges of rank of the British Military. It has gone back to what used to be commonly called the “Georgian Crown” and they have moved away from the Edwardian Crown that Her Late Majesty had used. That is all part of history also for our visitors this morning. True to the respectability of the monarch, the reception was very warm and dignified. I conveyed to her the greetings of the people, the chiefs and the Government of Fiji. When I visited the honourable Speaker of Commons, I also conveyed your greetings, Mr. Speaker, Sir. These relationships were established in 1874 when the chiefs of Fiji ceded their authority and sovereignty to Her Majesty Queen Victoria on 10 th October that year. In our exchange, the words were profound and emanated from a deep sense of affection and a deep and treasured place within the Crown’s reservoir of goodwill for a nation under its realm. We used to be under the realm, we now are under the Commonwealth, but we still maintain that very cordial relationship with the Crown. I took the opportunity to present my apologies again to His Majesty for my actions in 1987, as I had done to Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II when I visited her in 1998. That action resulted in our expulsion from the Commonwealth. Our withdrawal from the realm was at my declaration of Fiji as a Republic on 7 th October, 1987, and with that he wished for Fiji to return to the realm, as Her Late Majesty had told me and as His Majesty said to me last week, “Let it be the will of the people.” The same was also expressed to me by the post-King of Nepal when I visited him the Sunday following the Wednesday when the people trashed and conquered the Palace and took selfies on the throne. I asked him, “Would you be willing to return as the King of Nepal?” He said to me, “General sahab, let it be the will of the people.” Our conversation revisited an earlier meeting which I had with the Her Majesty. In noble magnanimity, His Majesty’s acceptance was truly humbling, his acceptance of my apologies. Being a guest of His Majesty at a Garden Party at Buckingham Palace two days later, we also extended and continued our cordial exchanges. It was embarrassing because the presentation line was about two in front of me, I was two rows behind, he broke the rank he was going through, went through the second one and came to me at the back in the third row and said hello and moved on. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my delegation also met with the Right Honourable Lord Benyon, the Minister of State for Climate, Environment and Energy and we focussed on our collective efforts to arrest the downward spiral of the climate crisis and sparing no effort in doing all that we can do to ensure human security. The meeting with the Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr, Lindsay Hoyle focussed on the role of the House, as you had reiterated this morning in your address to the visiting students. The role of the House on national governance and systems to ensure law making and the voice of the people are heard unhindered and sustained. Therein lies the fundamental principle and demonstration of what democracy is all about. The eagerness with which the Office of the Speaker offered its support for Fiji’s Parliament in particular, and democracy as a whole, is truly heartening. Day 3 started with a call, at Whitehall, on the Secretary of Defence, the Right Honourable Grant Shapps. Defence co-operation with external armed forces are also being reviewed and guided by the recent UK Integrated Review Refresh 2023. As a result of the review, the British Government recognises the need to forge stronger bonds in the Indo-Pacific region among other growing important focus in other regions.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>682</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 The fact that the Secretary of Defence had served in the Royal Green Jackets, the parent Regiment or the founding regiment of that was the King’s Royal Rifle Corps before it became the Royal Green Jackets and now the Rifle Brigade. It is where we inherited our rifle green and penny red colours - the regiment colours of the RFMF. Another history lesson for our students here this morning. There are prospects for increasing cooperation on this front and which this Government would like to take up. In our exchange, it is very interesting that we live in a world that is getting smaller. My Company Commander when I was Company 2IC of A Company 1FIR here was Major John Bennett from the Royal Green Jackets. He went back and commanded that Battalion when he was on active service in Northern Ireland and he must have met with some of our students who had come out of Sandhurst at that time. John Bennett went back from here and became a Battalion Commander there and the Secretary of Defence served under Major John Bennett during that time in the military in UK. The meeting with the Secretary of Defence was followed up on Day 4 with a visit to the Military Training Camp at Aldershot in Hampshire. Aldershot is known as the home of the British Army which currently has 2,000 active personnel from Fiji. On arrival at Aldershot, we were met and received in the traditional ceremony of welcome from our countrymen who are serving in the Army. Close by, there was also a training camp which had restricted entry and I was allowed in where the Ukrainian soldiers were training in the UK. I was told that the Ukrainian soldiers will be training there, and I was surprised that before we went to the range, I was taken to a tent and I saw a tanoa and a group of Fijian soldiers in British uniform, waiting to present the sevusevu. When the young man brought a cup up to me, I saw his face and asked him quietly, “what is your name”? He looked around rather embarrassed and told me, “ O au o Toni”, and I told those who were with me that he is my father’s namesake. It was a moment of pride for me to see our very own countrymen who are trainers in the joint warfare facility in that restricted access camp. Seeing civilian Ukrainian women participating as interpreters on the training lines was a reminder that this is their fight, a national fight for survival. In the war that is going on, it is back to the 1 st World War style of fight intense warfare again where the Ukrainians dug in because they cannot go anywhere else. It is their line of defence which is their front line and also their international boundary. Life expectancy in the front line measured in terms of hours, and not days, months or years. That visit was followed by a call on the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, the Right- Honourable Patricia Scotland, at the historic Marlborough House. Marlborough House, honourable Members, and visiting students, was where they carried out the constitutional conferences that gave rise to our first constitution and the independence of Fiji. The meeting focused on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) which is to be held later this year in Samoa. We also discussed the mandate and activities of the Commonwealth Secretariat in assisting Member States on a whole range of programmes as they require and needed. The Commonwealth currently has three programmes running in Fiji. The Commonwealth needs our imagination, our creativity and our cooperation. For a small team at the Secretariat, there is a lot that they are shouldering on our behalf. We have a small team of Fiji citizens in the Commonwealth Secretariat, and we were very proud to see them.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>683 The next stop for my delegation, Sir, after that was the visit to the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Mr. Arsenio Antonio Dominguez Velasco. We heard of IMO's efforts in transitioning the shipping and maritime sector to be climate resilient while remaining commercially efficient and profitable in the emerging operating environment. As maritime States, this is of utmost importance to Fiji as we also endeavour to rebuild our ports, our shipbuilding, our slipway and maintenance capabilities, not only for our own sake, but also for the region. Being accorded a briefing at the MI6 Headquarters of the British Intelligence Service, provided deeper understanding of the situations and the scenarios the British Government and her Allies are confronted with and which they are trying to manage. The MI6 Briefing was an opportunity to share common experiences and insights with the Officials who were there. These can only be referred to as - 1. 2. 3. investments in our common goals for accountable government; protection of the dignity of humankind; and our shared responsibility in ensuring that evil has no place in our midst, while decency, peace and security are promoted and sustained. The sharing of my concept for the Pacific as an "Ocean of Peace" found fertile ground there at MI6 also in England. On Day 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had a meeting at Whitehall with the Secretary for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, Lord Cameron. I made a mistake of putting my hand out calling, “Hello David”, he was the former Prime Minister. Then someone behind me said, “Lord Cameron.”. Oh, Hello, Lord Cameron. The meeting acknowledged the deep historical relations between our two countries. We looked into opportunities for furthering the relationship and our joint responsibilities as members of the Commonwealth in ensuring we remain strong and relevant. I had made the same mistake at the COP28 when I met Tony Blair. I said, “hello Tony”. The guy next to me said, “Sir Anthony”. “Oh! I am sorry, Hello Sir Anthony.” There was focus on common challenges that we are facing and they are – • • • • • • • the rise in autocracy; growing disregard for the international rules-based order; vulnerability of the global supply chain; the increase in transnational organized crime; illicit trafficking in people, drugs and goods (our newspaper is full of these accounts everyday); the place of development assistance; and need to be guided by the will of the people, among others. There is recognition that the international environment is complex and perhaps, heading in the wrong direction, and if we allow it, it can get even worse. The openness and willingness of the British Government to come to our assistance as needed, was very reassuring. As with other development partners, we do our part first before we reach out to our friends where help is needed.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>684</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 Clearly Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is much work ahead emanating from that visit. At the official level, there was also a meeting with the Officials of the British Department of Trade, where the focus was on trade relations, particularly the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), Fiji’s products and British market requirements and processes. A follow up meeting is on the horizon and there is an opportunity to dovetail this with CHOGM. Mr. Speaker, there are over 20,000 Fijian Nationals living in the United Kingdom. Of that 20,000, over 2,000 serve as active members of the British Armed Forces. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission I will hand this Statement to the Hansard Reporters where we can all have access to them as my time has run out. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister on the Statement that he has given on the visit that he has paid to the United Kingdom. We are very glad to hear of all the various visits that he made. I was particularly struck with the rapport that he struck up with King Charles III in their visit because I can recall back in 2019 when we were in London with the former Prime Minister, we also visited him at that time with the invitation to be here at the 50 th Anniversary of our Independence. It was unfortunate at that time, COVID-19 came, so it was not able to happen. So, I think that rapport and the relationship that he has expressed has been there for a long time between our two nations. It is good to think back on history, but it is also important to realise that the history that we have talked about a lot of the times is the embellished history. Sometimes there are also the history that needs to be taught. There are other parts of history that are not spoken about at length, and we know that this is something that we also need to cherish. We can talk about the things that happened to the hill tribes of Fiji, et cetera. These are the kind of things that are not covered in our full history, and I think it is important too for the children that are here to understand that sometimes, the history books that you read today do not tell you the full history of what transpired in our country. And that is something that I hope the Ministry of Education and others can look into because we really need to understand where we came from as a country, what the forces are because the things that impact on us today are the forces of what has happened in the past and they have their ramifications over the generations. But it is upon us as people today to look into acting on those things. I would just like to pick on some of the issues that the honourable Prime Minister spoke about. I am very appreciative of the fact that they talked about with Lord Bennet, if I am correct, on the issue of climate change and we know that this is something that is important for us. I think one of the recent COPS that was held in the United Kingdom recently where His Majesty the King was involved in all of that. I am glad to hear that the notion of ‘sparing no effort’ came through. I am glad to hear that because that is something that is very important for us, especially when we talk about climate change. The former Prime Minister used to talk about the differences between large countries when they talk to us in person or when they come to the Pacific and we meet them in international conferences. Sometimes, what they talk about begins to change and they look at their own interest. So, I am thankful that that expression came about. He used to refer to some of them at some time as the ‘coalition of the selfish’ when it came to look at the interest of small island nations. But I am the glad that, that has been talked about there.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>685 I note, again, the expression by the honourable Prime Minister on what he had talked about the Oceans of Peace, and I am glad to hear this. I had expressed some concern on this earlier on this year, about Oceans of Peace and how it manifests in our approach to conflicts in other countries. We also consider at the moment about some of the things that are taking place in New Caledonia. We are a bit of concerned about our people there, so maybe the Prime Minister might be wanting to prepare a Ministerial Statement on how we will be dealing with that particular situation. I was interested to hear whether there was any discussion on the visa free entry into the United Kingdom, but it seems that that it did not take place. The other thing I am very glad to hear about is the visit to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the emphasis on Maritime Safety Security especially the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership. I think this is very important for us. We need to show that we have reduced our emissions in our shipping in the Pacific but we have old fleets. I think the amount of money that is being talked about in this project is $500 million and we hope the Government can continue to work very closely with the IMO to get that money into place so we can upgrade our ships. We know we have had a lot of problems with shipping in our country and we are in a better state than a lot of those other countries. We look forward to the IMO regional office being established in Fiji, it will allow field level engagement, technical cooperation and allow us to express our wishes to them to work with them, so we can also as small island nations also try to decarbonize our shipping fleets. It is a big, big task but we have to go there, we have to show the world if we are moving, asking you to do something for climate change by reducing emissions here in the Pacific, we will also work on that but we need the assistance, and I thank the honourable Prime Minister for the visits and we look forward to being able to move this Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership forward for the benefit of the shipping of decarbonizing for shipping fleets in the Pacific. Duke of Edinburgh International Awards Programme HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, students at the public gallery, viewers who are watching through television broadcasting live from the comfort zone. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today with great pride to address this esteemed Parliament regarding a momentous occasion that transpired just days ago. On Wednesday, 15th May, 2024, the Ministry of Youth and Sports had the distinct honour of investing ten outstanding youths as Gold Awardees for the Duke of Edinburgh Awards programme at the State House. The auspicious occasion was officiated by His Excellency the President of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere. His presence and support further underscores the significance of this achievement and serves as a source of inspiration for our young awardees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Duke of Edinburgh Awards programme founded by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh in 1956 has been a beacon of excellence, character development and service for countless young individuals across the globe. It is a programme deeply rooted in the principles of self-improvement, community engagement and personal growth. The programme has a rich history in Fiji, dating back to the 1960s however, since 1999, this only marks the third Gold Award event recorded bringing the number to a total of 77 Gold Awardees nationally. Since its inception, the programme has empowered thousands of young Fijians to explore their potential, develop essential life skills and contribute positively to society. Participants between the ages of 15 years to 24 years engage in a variety of activities across four key areas: service, skills, physical recreation and adventurous journey. These experiences foster</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>686</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 personal growth, self-reliance and a sense of responsibility. The programme is implemented mostly in schools and in youth clubs. On Achievements, in recognising the efforts of the 10 youths and investing them into the Gold level is a privilege as it exemplifies the very essence of this prestigious programme. They have demonstrated unwavering commitment, resilience and a spirit of adventure through their journey which culminated in achieving the highest accolade, the Gold Award. Each of these remarkable individuals have traversed a challenging and transformative path, encompassing four key components: volunteering, physical fitness, skills development and adventurous journey. Their dedication to these pillars reflect not only their personal ambition but also their profound sense of duty to their communities and society at large. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the achievements of these 10 youths are not merely a testament to their individual capabilities but also a reflection of our nation's commitment to nurturing the next generation of leaders, innovators and global citizens. As custodians of their potential, it is incumbent upon us to provide unwavering support and encouragement as they embark on the next chapter of their journey. From 2021 to 2023, a total of 1,120 participants registered for the Duke of Edinburgh International Award (DEIA). Among them we have: • • • 463 participants successfully graduated at the Bronze level. 115 participants achieved the Silver Award. 77 participants received the Prestigious Gold Award. The progress has been slow given that the Ministry was officially granted an official operating license in 2017 to implement the DEIA programme in Fiji. The progress was further impacted by COVID 19 pandemic due to the restrictions put in place. With the Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the realm of volunteering, our Gold Awardees have selflessly dedicated hundreds of hours to various initiatives ranging from environmental conservation projects to mentoring disadvantaged youth. Their altruism and compassion have left an indelible mark on those they serve, inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. Moreover, their commitment to physical recreation has not only fostered personal well-being but has also promoted a culture of health and vitality within their communities. Whether through sports, dance, or outdoor activities, these individuals have embodied the importance of an active lifestyle and its positive impact on both physical and mental health. Equally impressive is their pursuit of skills development, as they have honed talents ranging from Culinary Arts to Digital Literacy. Through continuous learning and skill-building, our Gold Awardees have equipped themselves with the tools necessary to thrive in an ever-evolving world, while also contributing their expertise to the betterment of society. Furthermore, the adventurous journeys undertaken by these trailblazers have not only tested their physical endurance but have also cultivated invaluable life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving. From traversing rugged terrain to navigating unchartered waters, they have embraced the spirit of adventure with courage and determination. Implementation: Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the programme’s effectiveness, the Ministry plans to establish a dedicated team that will focus on:</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>687 1. Proper implementation - We will provide the guidance and support to schools, clubs and participants to ensure consistent and high quality implementation. 2. Monitoring and evaluation - Rigorous monitoring and evaluation mechanisms will help us assess impacts, identify areas for improvement and celebrate success. 3. Addressing unreachable areas - We recognise that some regions may face challenges in accessing the programme. Our team will explore innovative solutions to bridge these gaps. Furthermore, the Ministry of Youth and Sports is committed to expanding the reach of Duke of Edinburgh International Award programme as part of its Strategic Plan as we recognise the transformative impact it can have on our youth. To realise the full potential of this programme, the Ministry will focus on the following: 1. 2. Inclusion in schools - We are actively working with the Ministry of Education to integrate the programme into schools across Fiji. By doing so, we aim to provide every student with the opportunity to participate and grow. Inclusion in youth clubs - We encourage more youth clubs to take ownership of the programme. These clubs serve as hubs for personal development, mentorship and community engagement. 3. Collaboration with key Ministries and stakeholders - Our vision extends beyond individual participation. We seek to collaborate with other Ministries and stakeholders to reach a wider spectrum of youth, aged 15 years to 24 years. Together, we can create a holistic approach to youth development. 4. Boys Scouts and Girl Guides – In alignment with our commitment to youth development, the Ministry of Youth and Sports is mandated to support the Boys Scouts and Girl Guides. These esteemed organisations share many core values with the Duke of Edinburgh Awards programmes, such as leadership, community and personal development. We recognise the complementary roles these programmes play in fostering well-rounded individuals who are prepared to meet the challenges of tomorrow. To this end, the Ministry, as part of its Strategic Plan, will work closely with these organisations to strengthen the Boys Scouts and Girl Guides programme across the nation. This plan includes sourcing funding for training and resources, enhancing collaboration between these organisations and schools and promoting greater participation through public awareness campaigns. By bolstering these programmes, we aim to provide a comprehensive support system for our youth, ensuring that they have ample opportunities to develop their skills, building character and serve their communities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we celebrate the achievements of our Gold awardees, let us also reaffirm our commitment to nurturing the potential of all our young people through diverse and enriching programmes. By investing in their growth and development, we are laying the foundation for a brighter and more prosperous future for our nation. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that there is a great interest in the DEIA Programme, as seen through the steady increase in the number of participants enrolling in the programme for the last three years. We would greatly need an increase in resources to strengthen this programme and realise its full potential. The high number of Bronze graduates indicates successful engagement at the entry level and the smaller cohort of silver and gold awardees reflects the Programme’s challenging nature, emphasizing quality over quantity.</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>688</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, last but not least, I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to each of our Gold Awardees for their exceptional accomplishments and commendable dedication to the ideals of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Programme. To our stakeholders, parents and the staff of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and Ministry of Education, for their unwavering commitment towards the development of youth in Fiji. May these achievements serve as a source of inspiration to all young people across our nation, reminding them that with perseverance, dedication, and a spirit of service, anything is possible. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his Statement on this very wonderful programme the Duke of Edinburgh Awards. At the outset, I join him in offering our congratulations to the Gold Awardees of this programme. The programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also cut around the idea that not all learnings happen inside the classroom. It can also happen outside the classroom and those four categories – Service, Skills, Physical Recreation and Adventurous Journey, in some way, moves that learning outside from the classroom setting. I usually teach the Duke of Edinburgh and I think it was more on the skill set - it was on safety of life at sea. It is a wonderful programme and if you look at the four categories - Service, Skills, Physical Recreation and Adventurous Journey, we can be creative enough and set up a programme where you have a little bit of each, for example. In that programme, we would get the students who are part of it, teach them how to inflate a life raft if they are on a ship, how to ride the life raft if it turns over, how to send SOS messages in different ways that you can attract attention, how to fire flairs if you find them inside. It was quite interesting and the students that came in and were part of this programme had a little bit of both. They were enhancing their skills - a bit of adventure, we would take them out to sea, et cetera. I think in progressing it forward and advertising it so the kids who get into it create those programmes that have a little bit of each. Also, I think that Fiji as a maritime nation, skill set that really targets where they live. I am sure if we ask the students who would want to go down and do all those – inflate a life raft, how do you put on a life jacket, how do you swim, how do you help someone who is struggling out at sea with a life jacket, I am sure they would raise their hands and say, “yes, I would want to go and do it”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also think that there is an age group. So, you start the programme in school and then you leave school at about 19 years. In some cases, they do not continue, but because the programme caters from 14 years to 24 years, if we can keep track of them and push them into a club may be, then they can continue and be a gold awardee in the end. A wonderful achievement for those who had done that. I think also, Mr. Speaker, that it is worth thinking about is the funding to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. They need money in order to run this programme. Also, they can partner with outside organisations, such as the Fiji Navy, for example, if they want to run that programme. There needs to be funding also so that they can be able to run that programme. I thank the Ministry for continuing with that. I wish the programme well and I wish all the students, those who are here, those who are listening well. It is a wonderful opportunity to pick up and join and be part of the Duke of Edinburgh Award.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>689 MR.

S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of this august Parliament, I welcome the students from Yat Sen School who are seated in the gallery and members of the public who are joining us virtually through the livestream media; good morning to you all. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my topic this morning is on the Transformative Changes in the Judiciary, Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Office of Legal Aid. The integrity and effectiveness of a judicial system is paramount to the health of our democracy and wellbeing of our society. The Judicial Department, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Legal Aid Commission are the pillars that uphold justice, ensure the rule of law and provide access to legal resources for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministerial Statement this morning will focus on the current status, the achievements, the areas necessitating improvements in the following institutions - the Judicial Department, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Legal Aid Commission. At the same time, I will also provide a comparative analysis of the leadership and progress within these institutions over the past 16 years, highlighting the transformative changes brought about under the Coalition Government. The Judicial Department includes the Judiciary, Magistracy and the various Tribunals namely, the Small Claims Tribunal and the Court support staff. The Chief Justice looks after the Judiciary, the Chief Magistrate oversees the Magistracy and the Small Claims Tribunal, while the Chief Registrar manages the Court support staff while also serving as the Department’s Chief Accounting Officer. The Judicial Department has branches across Fiji with its main office in Suva, and they also have an office in Lautoka and Labasa. Suva is the home of Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, while the High Courts are also looked in Suva, Labasa and Lautoka. The High Court convenes in each of these three main centres. There are 36 established Magistrates Courts with further scheduled island sittings occurred during the year. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the previous Government, this was not the case. In fact, the structure heavily relied on expatriate Judicial Officers, resulting in increased costs due to allowance, gratuity and travel expenses. Mr. Speaker Sir, a great number of visiting Judges for the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal were Sri Lankans. This led to high travel costs. Fortunately, when the Coalition Government came into power, we prioritised localization, significantly increasing the number of local Judicial Officers from 27 to 50, thereby reducing dependency on expatriates and associated costs. Under the previous Administration, the Judicial workforce included 55 officers. These were 27 local Judges and 28 expatriates. We have further expanded this and we shift to include 59 officers with a strong focus on local appointments. As a result, we now have 50 local officers and nine expatriates serving in key positions. This shift promotes sustainability and, of course, reduces costs. The total number of established staff has increased from 852 to 886, showcasing a commitment to strengthening the Judicial capacity.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>691 Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of Judges from Australia and New Zealand has reduced travel costs by one-third. I am proud to say that we have increased the frequency of Supreme Court sittings from three to four sessions, and the Court of Appeal sittings from four to five sessions with back-to-back sittings, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our Judicial processes. These advancements underscore our commitment to building a resilient and sustainable judicial system that effectively addresses the evolving needs of our nation. Through these efforts, we are fostering a more just, equitable and accessible legal system for all Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a critical area of improvement in case management. Under the previous Government, the number of pending cases was alarmingly high. There were 26,162 pending cases in total - 13,586 pending cases in the Central/Eastern Division; 10,402 pending cases in the Western Division alone; and 2,174 pending cases in the Northern Division. Since the Coalition Government came in, these numbers have significantly decreased by 9, 221. There are 10,675 pending cases in the Central/Eastern Division; 4,758 pending cases in the Western Division; and 1,520 cases in the Northern Division, so 16,941 pending cases in total. This improvement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because of enhanced case management meetings and the Chief Justice’s direct engagement with all Courts nationwide. The budget of the Judicial Department has been notably increased from $47,152,415 to $50,448,711 under the Coalition Government. This increase has facilitated various capital projects, including the construction of the new Court complexes and the refurbishment of existing facilities to better serve the needs of our citizens. In the pipeline for the 2024-2025 Budget are several noteworthy projects, as follows: 1. We are embarking on the extension of the Nadi Court – one of the busiest courts in Fiji, a crucial step in expanding the judicial capacity in that region. 2. We are proud to announce the construction of a new Lautoka Court complex which will provide modern facilities to support the administration of justice. In 2012, there was a ceremony for the construction of the Lautoka complex. Until today, there has been no action, so we have implemented it. 3. We are moving forward with the establishment of a new court complex in key locations across the country. This include the Savusavu Court complex, Keiyasi Court, Dreketi Court and the Veiuto Court. These new facilities will not only improve access to justice, but also ensure that our judicial processes are conducted in a state-of-the-art environment. In addition to these constructions, we also continue our efforts to upgrade existing court complexes. This includes ongoing work at the Ba Court Complex which will be opened at the end of the year and the Lautoka Tagimoucia Court. These upgrades are essential in modernizing our infrastructure and improving the quality of service we provide to the public. I am pleased to announce plans for the establishment of the High Court 12 and High Court 13 at Government Buildings. These additions will further strengthen the Judiciary and ensure that justice is accessible to all. Shifting our focus – I would like to shed light on some of the systematic issues encountered by the office of Director of Public Prosecution during the previous Government’s tenure. Mr. Speaker, Sir, imagine a scenario where fairness is merely a concept, where advancement is an elusive</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>692</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 dream and where bureaucracy reigns supreme. These were the reality faced by our prosecutors. The unequal workload distribution among prosecutors, some were burdened with more case that they could not handle while others had their desk gathering dust. How can justice prevail when the scales are so clearly tipped, I asked. The shifting management culture that unshackled the aspirations of our local prosecutors. They were held back, unable to rise beyond the Principal Legal Officer level. Where is the encouragement for growth and excellence in such an environment? The Human Resources Department, far removed from the courtroom, seizes control of the prosecutorial duties. How can those unfamiliar with the law understand the complexities of our work? It is an insult to our profession. Imagine the despair of prosecutors toiling away in neglected workspaces, devoid of care and respect they deserve. How can we expect dedication and passion where the very spaces in which they work are disregarded? These issues created a toxic and unhealthy work environment, affecting morale and productivity. Since the Coalition Government came into power, we have transformed and revitalized the ODPP. A change in leadership and management has brought renewed strength, vitality and courage to the work lives of the prosecutors. Even amid a stagnant budget for the past four years, they have shown remarkable resilience. Now, they are advocating for a $2 million boost in the 2025 budget to finance the establishment of new specialized units, additional staff positions and enhanced training programmes. For office renovations and strategic planning, the neglected conditions in divisional offices have been addressed. Its Nadi office completed renovations in October 2023 with modern facilities costing $73,755. The Lautoka office renovations are ongoing with a budget of $116,000, Labasa office renovations began in May 2024, moving to a higher floor to prevent flooding with a budget of $49,500. A comprehensive strategic plan developed with senior officers will be launched in June. The training programme has been revamped to include external stakeholder engagement and overseas opportunities, addressing current crime trends. Funded by external sources, the training covers cybercrime, child development, asset recovery and leadership. Since 2023, 14 prosecutors have attended overseas training with significant national training events scheduled. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us acknowledge the indispensable role of the Legal Aid Commission. The Legal Aid Commission stands as a beacon of hope for those who cannot afford legal representation. It provides invaluable services, including legal advice, representation in court and assistance across family, criminal and civil domains. The Legal Aid Commission embarked on a transformative journey, spearheading initiatives to enhance accountability, transparency and service accessibility. Restructuring its organisational framework through compilation of its annual report from 2018 to 2023 and the review of key policies. These include the Finance Manual 2022, Financial Policy (Fixed Assets Management Policy), Transport Policy, Human Resources Policy and Procedural Manual 2023, implemented in March of last year following extensive consultation. The Commission aimed to streamline processes, develop career pathways and foster internal growth. This overhaul was important to meet the evolving needs of its clientele and ensure operational efficiency.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>693 The Commission embarked on a digital transformation journey integrating modern tools for streamline operation enhance service delivery. Additionally, strategic partnership and exchange programmes with Pacific Island countries underscore the Commission’s commitment to regional collaboration and knowledge sharing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share comprehensive update on the transformative initiatives taken by the Legal Aid Commission. These efforts are designed to enhance accountability, transparency, service delivery and access to justice for all Fijians. The Commission has strengthened its accountability and transparency through compilation of its Annual Report and of course all the policies of the Commission. In December 2023, the Legal Aid Commission launched a new Strategic Plan for 2023 to 2026, it was developed through an extensive consultation process. This plan focuses on client service, collaboration with the justice system, organisational sustainability and fostering a positive culture within the Legal Aid Commission. The Legal Aid Commission has initiated exchange programme with Pacific Island countries as exemplified by the MOU with the Solomon Islands Public Prosecution Office, similar agreements with PNG, Vanuatu and Kiribati are forthcoming. The Commission has improved accessibility to Legal Aid services by enhancing this office accessibility for persons with special needs. These includes the relocation of the Conflict Unit and the Navua Office and securing a new, more accessible space for the Nausori Office. To streamline service delivery the Commission has simplified the Legal Aid Commission representation application from 16 pages to just four pages ensuring it is use of friendly and also decentralised and digitised civil litigation procedures. The launch of the Legal Awareness Programmes at secondary schools reaching 6,346 students from Year 13 to Year 17 across 17 high schools. This proactive approach in crime prevention will be further supported by the upcoming MOU with the Ministry of Education. On 1 st May, 2024, the Legal Aid Commission has streamlined the types of civil contest measure they handle focussing on the specific area such as eviction, the SET appeals, enforcement proceedings and others to ensure efficient use of the time and limited resources. Of July 2023 they conducted a first workshops for lawyers especially dealing with child representation, in family and domestic violence matters, in collaboration with the Judiciary. The team at the Commission are holding regular consultation with key stakeholders to improve service delivery and efficiency including meeting the Judiciary, Statutory Bodies, NGOs such as Fiji Women’s Rights Movement for gender sensitization training. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these initiatives marks given progress for the Legal Aid Commission. We are committed to continuing our efforts, to ensure justice and legal representation for all Fijians, overcoming challenges, assisting opportunities to build a fairer and more accessible legal system. As we look to the future, let us remain steadfast in our dedication to justice, equality and the rule of law. Together, we will build a justice team that only upholds the high standards of integrity and fairness but also serve as a pillar of strength and hope for all citizens. Our journey towards a more just society continues and with unwavering resolve, we will achieve our vision of a Judiciary that truly reflects the values and aspirations of our nation.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>694</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for their response. Honourable Members, this is another batch of students, Years 11,12 and 13 (if I am right) from Yat Sen Secondary School once more, welcome students. We are humbly honoured to welcoming you to your Parliament. This is the People’s Parliament and this is where we make laws, we change and amend laws and repeal laws as well and even treaties. That is our core functions. We hope to see that you are encouraged more and hope to see you in probably a couple of years’ time, sitting amongst us or sitting amongst the honourable Members here, participating in serving your country. Thank you very much for taking the opportunity. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver a response, in response to the honourable Attorney-General’s Ministerial Statement this morning. From the outset, it is a desperate attempt by the honourable Attorney-General to save his job. He has not been performing in the last few months, 17 months in the Government. He is trying to make a comparative analysis of what the previous government has done in the last 16 years. It is just a poor attempt from the honourable Attorney-General. All the improvements that he had talked about this morning, in terms of Judiciary, Legal Aid and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution are just continuing works of what the FijiFirst Government has done in the last few years. He just needs to take it forward. It was useless to come to Parliament and try to run down the previous administration. I think he has to learn from what the honourable Prime Minister told us yesterday, that he visited the former Prime Minister in prison. I think it is all about compassionate leadership and moving forward. You should not be stuck in the past if you really want to make some improvements in the portfolios that you have been given. Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the FijiFirst Government, legal access through the Legal Aid Commission, I think the FijiFirst Government had developed Legal Aid Commission. It was unprecedented. It opened up offices in Nabouwalu, Taveuni and in areas where people can access. Last December, the honourable Attorney-General had a workshop trying to open up offices in Lomaiviti, Rotuma and other places. It is good for legal access. He had talked about other areas in Dreketi, we also welcome that. His speech today was comparing speed and quality. While the FijiFirst was there, there was quality. If you bring speed in to delivering and clearing the backlog in our cases, you just have to visit the prison. He is also the Minister responsible for Corrections. Just visit our Remand Centre, people are still waiting for appeals and dates. That shows our Corrections Centre in Suva is overcrowded, even convicted criminals in the prison waiting for two years to get an appeal date. These are some of the things that the honourable Attorney- General needs to look into. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the FijiFirst Government, the Office of the DPP developed a Serious Fraud Unit, Human Trafficking Unit, Child Protection Division and it also developed to separated legal and administrative work. Those are the developments that have been done, you just need to take it forward, honourable Attorney-General and stop trying to compare the performance of the past government with what you need to do. You need to focus on what needs to be done. I think some of their appointments too have been brought in the limelight that had been inconsistent with the 2013 Constitution. I will not lament on that because I cannot talk about the issues that are before the courts. I think Cabinet has already asked for an interpretation and I hope that those things will be brought to be consistent with the Constitution. I hope that when the interpretation comes out, the honourable Attorney-General still keeps</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>695 his job. Hearing from what the people are saying in the social media and mainstream media, they are talking about the weaknesses and the poor performance of the Coalition Government. You should take this on board because it will help improve the work that you need to do. As I have said, the previous Government has done a lot for the nation, for the Judiciary, for Legal Aid Commission and the Courts and access to justice. The Coalition Government just needs to take it forward and stop trying to run down the previous government. That is all I have to respond to the honourable Attorney-General this morning, and I hope he grows up and stops acting like a child when he comes to this honourable Parliament. (Laughter)</p></body>
