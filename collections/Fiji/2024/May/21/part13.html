<body><h3>METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES BILL 2024</h3><p>METEOROLOGICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL SERVICES BILL 2024 HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: That the - (a) Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 (Bill No. 03/2024), be considered by Parliament without delay; (b) Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; (c) Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other committee of Parliament; and (d) Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 23 rd May, 2024, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.:</span> I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Meteorological and Hydrological Bill 2024 seeks to establish and recognise the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services, and empowers the Director of Meteorological Services to carry out his or her duties in the most effective manner - having practical provisions of weather forecast and promotion of public sector private engagement in the delivery of weather services in Fiji. At the moment, there is no established legal provisions with regulating meteorological and hydrological services in Fiji. This proposed legislation aims to outline the establishment and responsibilities of the Fiji Meteorological and Hydrological Services which is currently the Fiji Meteorological Service. This service may, in future, be established as a body corporate responsible for providing meteorological and hydrological services and carrying out functions just outlined in the Bill. It provides for the effective and efficient provision of meteorological and hydrological services in order to contribute to a sustainable economic development, protection of livelihoods and property for meteorological and hydrological disasters and hazards. In addition, the proposed Bill also encapsulates the important contribution of Fiji Meteorological Services towards the Nadi Flight Information Region and in provision of aviation</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 711 services to selected aerodromes in the Southwest Pacific. The Bill also recognises Fiji’s leading role in the region by providing weather forecasts and warnings to many of these smaller island countries in the Pacific. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of historical information, the first recorded observation in Fiji in terms of weather was by a volunteer by the name of Robert Fung in Delainasau, Bua, in 1871. Between 1876 and 1890, additional volunteers recorded the amount of rainfall at various locations, including Qarawalu, Waimanu, Wainunu, Suva, Nausori, Rakiraki, Ba, Lautoka and Labasa. In 1939, the Defence Conference designated Suva as a site of offering weather services in the Pacific region, marking the start of air temperature observations in Fiji. The South Pacific Air Transport Council (SPATC) was founded in 1946 to oversee civil aviation activities in the Pacific region. The Meteorological Office in Nadi was founded by SPATC and functioned as a branch of the New Zealand Meteorological Services. Its main purpose was to write weather services and assist in civil aviation requirements. In 1940, a Meteorological Office was set up as a section of the Royal New Zealand Air Force and the goal was to provide aviation weather forecasts to Military Aircrafts at Laucala Bay. Forecasting operations in Laucala Bay ceased in 1947 and merged with the Meteorological Office in Nadi, downscaling operations to collection quality control and archival of records for service observations. Following independence in 1970, Fiji took over the role of regional aviation from SPATC. The Meteorological Service was established in July 1975 and took over the responsibility of providing forecasts to the marine and public sectors as part of its expanded services. The Fijian Government acquired the ownership of SPATC assets in July 1979, and managed the services provided by SPATC in Fiji. In 1980, Fiji become a member of the World Meteorological Organisation. In 1982, Mr. Ram Krishna was selected as the inaugural Director of the Meteorological Services. In 1996, the Meteorological Services was designated as the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for the Southwest Pacific region to issue marine forecasts and warnings for the high seas or international waters. Sir, the RSMC in Nadi is one of the only six centres globally which provides essential tropical cyclone related information, including the naming of tropical cyclones and the related alerts and warnings. In 2012, for the responsibility of part forecasting was moved from the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Water Authority of Fiji to the Fiji Meteorological Service, a department within the then Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services. Discussions have taken place with various organisations and institutions such as the World Meteorological Organization, World Bank, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, National Disaster Management Office, Fiji National University, University of Fiji, Red Cross, Energy Fiji Limited, Fiji Hotel Association and the various ministries. The proposed Bill is also part of the policy reforms as recommended by international institutions, such as World Bank to enable a more efficient and effective development partnership and also in terms of looking into the future financing, especially accessing of climate financing. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be brief. We understand what is in the Bill, but what we do not understand is the urgency. Nothing in here that is contained in the Bill says</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>712 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 21 st May, 2024 that there is an absolute urgency that it needs to go through Standing Order 51. Once again, we have heard quite a lot from the other side, I know they will turn around and say, “Oh, you used to do it.” But you complained about it when we did it, so why are you doing it? The point here is that there are particular provisions, first of all there is no reason. Second of all, most importantly, they are the ones who turned around and told us that we go through this consultative exercise when these Bills are taking place. So, why should it not go to a Committee? Most importantly, Sir, also there are three objectives that are put into this particular Bill into clause 3, and one is the effective and efficient delivery of the service; two, which is important is actually promoting public and private engagement. Again, this would be a provision that would require a Committee to have a look at it because there is public and private engagement in this. Most of all, there is a provision in here, which I am sure we will argue about when it is actually on the floor, is that it is now going to be an offence for any other person unauthorised who is going to issue a weather report. That is my current understanding after a quick cursory glance of it. If you put all those things into perspective, I think it is only unfair to the general public and to all of those who do weather reports and to the people who may want to engage privately in this that it is actually, properly and thoroughly vetted through the Committee before it comes back to Parliament. Otherwise, I do not know what the reason could be. I cannot see for the life of me in here a reason that says that it has to be shot through quickly so we can actually get this amendment. There is a gap, of course, they said that there were no regulations before, all the more reason that it be thoroughly vetted before a Committee. It is not too late for them to put it back just like they did with the Heritage Bill. We ask that the Government have a good look at it because there are provisions that they put in there themselves that would mean that there would need to be proper deliberation through the Committee and a consultative exercise with the general public in Fiji and those who are involved in it. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that particular clause that I am actually talking states and I quote: “7(1) Any person who issues a weather warning or alert, including a flood alert or causes the warning or alert to be issued without prior authorisation of the Director in consultation with the Minister, commits an offence.” There are quite a few people around Fiji who do issue weather reports that a lot of people of Fiji rely on. All of those things need to be thoroughly vetted. We are against it going through Standing Order 51. We understand the content of the Bill, and the Bill proper is actually being argued, but against it going to Standing Order 51 suggests that we take it back to the Committee for it to be deliberated properly. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to contribute to the motion before Parliament, particularly, again on the use of Standing Order 51. We have nothing against the Bill, and we know how important it is, but there are few good reasons as to why we would urge the Government to reconsider having this Bill to go through Standing Order 51. For me, in looking at the Bill, it has included not only the Meteorological Services but the Hydrological Services as well. I will link this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the National Disaster Management Act which probably will be coming as well this week and the history behind the Hydrological Unit that is now under Meteorological Services. This Hydrological Unit, Sir, used to be with then the Public Works Department before the establishment of Water Authority of Fiji.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 713 When Water Authority of Fiji came into existence, Sir, they shifted this Hydrological Unit to Water Authority of Fiji, but this is what happened, and this is why I am urging the Government to look at the passage in which this Bill will come through. I have seen in the sitting calendar that we have another sitting in August, another sitting in September, sitting in October and, of course, one in November as well. So, probably we can still, if they still prefer to bring it under Standing Order 51 like yesterday, probably just put a timeline to it but go through the Committee. Let me go back to what I was going to explain, Mr. Speaker, Sir. TC Evans was in December 2012, that was a big learning for us, and this is why the role of the Meteorological Unit is so important. What happened during TC Evans, there was heavy rainfall up in the highlands but very light showers in the Nadi area. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nadi Riverbank, the critical level is around 6 metres. So, what happened during TC Evans, the Meteorological Unit was giving the weather information. It was interpreted at National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and we gave the advisories but without the specific input of the Hydrological Unit. This resulted in the death of a man at the Nadi back road because this is what happened, Sir. While Nadi was safe, I was at the NDMO that early morning from 3’oclock, water level was around 2 metres and then all of a sudden, every hour it is rising by about a metre each – three metres, 4 metres, 5 metres and we were wondering because of what was happening in Nadi, we could not come to a conclusion as to why the rapid increase or rise in the water level. The investigations after the death, Mr. Speaker, Sir, found out that the highlands, the rainfall was going at between 60 millimetres to 90 millimetres per hour. That is the new norm. The rainfall pattern in Fiji has changed significantly and without the input of the Hydrological Unit, Fiji Meteorological Services was just giving the weather forecast, NDMO was interpreting the weather forecast and giving the advisories without the input of the Hydrological Unit, it resulted in the death and that was why it was shifted out of WAF so that they can be co-located with the Meteorological Services but they have very specific functions to perform, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is why I am requesting, give us time because we need to relate this with the NDMO Act that is coming soon as well. We have been consulted. I have been consulted too about the NDMO Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason why I am urging Government to please consider this to be put before the Committee is because of the role of the Meteorological Office in the Paris Agreement, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). I advised you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we went to Tonga on the signs in Fiji is handled by the Meteorological Office. He is the focal point, the Director Meteorological. We need to look at that given the role of IPCC in the climate change and we have our Climate Act which probably we need to look at it as well so that we can come up with a better approach when it comes to the final contents of the Bill. Again, nothing against what we have, we know the need but, of course, based on these two issues, I would urge Government to please consider this to be brought before the Committee and we can bring it back say in September or October but at least put it through the Committee so that we can tie up all these issues so that we can be relevant and it is not only about now, but it is about the future as well. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to first of all congratulate the honourable Minister for bringing this Bill into Parliament and to Cabinet and the fact that it has come to Parliament. A lot of hard work has gone to it, through the work of the staff at the Fiji Meteorological including the assistance of the World Meteorological Organisations in its initial drafting. I congratulate all the members of the staff there, Teri Atalifo, Misa Funaki they are no longer with us and the current management for bringing it through because it was great that we have finally got to this stage.</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>714 Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 21 st May, 2024 There are a lot of things in this Bill that I endorse but there are also issues here that we really have to look at carefully and I think the honourable Minister has talked about the number of consultations they have done. Those consultations were done amongst stakeholders at the executive level but in a Bill like this which is talking about establishing a new organisation that runs on its own, I think it needs to be also considered at the legislative level by the representatives of the people. The representatives of the people are in Parliament, they have to have an opportunity through the Committees, this is the operational arm of Parliament to look as some of the issues that have been raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and a few others. Some of the issues that the honourable Koya has raised some of the other issues, the other one that we have here is of course, the idea has been for it to be a standalone orgnisation that is able to charge fees for its services, which is to my mind is a good idea. I think it needs to be thoroughly scrutinized at the level of the legislature itself and that thorough scrutiny is done by the Committees of Parliament. Now, I will encourage the Government to reconsider this and as the honourable Leader of the Opposition has stated to allow sometime to get the Committees to have a look at it, to call the people that we need to call, to listen to alternative views and then to come up with its recommendation to Parliament. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is not worth to highlight before Parliament. There was a Bill in 2016 and it lapsed, no action taken by the FijiFirst Government. In 2022 there was a draft, Coalition came in, sees all the issues, addressed it, consulted with the officers and we bring it to Parliament. There are only 12 simple provisions. What happens, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the powers of meteorology is drawn from various legislation. Ideally for one who works in that office, they would like a legislation on it. They want to take ownership, that is the simple reason. There was an issue raised in terms of offence, yes that is the reason why it is not in the Act, it is in the Regulations. There have been issues, deliberated with the officers what has happened in the past and obviously the same officers that they consulted, the same officers we are consulting. For the past weeks we have been consulting, there have been collaboration between the office of the Director NDMO and the honourable Minister. The people need this, the Meteorological Office needs it, we need to move this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2060 is a long time, we are now in 2024. I support this Bill. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to some of the concerns raised, the Standing Orders, of course, is an ongoing debate and it is a provision there which we will continue to utilise but in a responsible and pragmatic way. Unlike in the past, it was used irresponsibly and, of course, we see the data there and how many Bills they have passed using that. We will move forward in that using it in a pragmatic and responsible way. In terms of the issue of public private engagement, that is there as an option, and that is something we need to move forward with in terms of the current environment within, in relation to development partners which are not probably Government’s but also in the private sector in terms of making investments and returns of investments. That is also well covered in terms of formulation of MOAs, MOUs, which, of course, will be thoroughly scrutinised through the systems in the Executive, such as Cabinet sub-committees, et cetera. The weather reports and the concern about the fines, the provision is there for the Minister to have further regulations. We will not be surprising everyone who is just making an announcement about the weather because that is what they are implying and that would be addressed that way. Regarding the concerns about the coordination and operations, we have consulted, as mentioned by the honourable Attorney-General.</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>715 The NDMO, the Hydrological Services and where it could be best placed, thank you to the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his insights and, of course, that is taken into account when we are looking into the operational part of this. There was mention of Meteorological Services to be standalone. Yes, the Bill will give us an option, moving forward, whether it becomes fully standalone or statutory but, at least, we are taking the first step towards that. It also molds well into the current environment in terms of our engagement with our international development partners. Question put. Vote cast Ayes Noes - - 28 23 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members and students from Yat Sen Secondary School, you will notice that the results were thrown up there and this is something that is fairly new, not really new but we have been having this for quite some time now. The result of our voting is quickly tabulated on the screens in front of you so as help us understand better on how the voting is done. In this case, the motion is carried.</p></body>
