<body><h3>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF SUGAR 2016-2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3><p>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF SUGAR 2016-2020 ANNUAL REPORTS HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Ministry of Sugar 2016–2017, 2017–2018, 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 17 th April, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as a background, the Ministry of Sugar has an important role in Fiji’s economy through the formulation and implementation of Government key policies in the Sugarcane Industry, at the same time monitor their implementation of the Sugarcane Industry Reforms. It consults and ensures harmony within the Sugar Industry by bringing the stakeholders to work together. This includes the Fiji Sugar Corporation, Sugar Cane Growers Council, Sugar Industry Tribunal, Sugar Cane Growers Fund, Sugar Research Institute of Fiji, South Pacific Fertilizers and landlords such as the iTLTB and Lands Department. Key highlights: Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the years under review, the Committee noted that few highlights of the Ministry of Sugar: 1. Provision of Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance to enhance cane planting to increase cane production. 2. Weedicide subsidy provided to cane growers to subsidise weedicide cost of diuron, amine, glyphosate and valpar. 3. Cane Access Road, assistance were provided to improve cane access road transportation infrastructure to enhance efficient delivery of cane to the mills and reduce stand-over cane. Fertilizer Subsidy, initiative to subsidise fertiliser cost for farmers at $14.09 per bag until 2016 and 2017, was $25.59 from 2017 to 2018 and $60 from April 2022. 4. 5. Assistance to farmers; provision of grants to farmers for securing land and to establish cane farms. As part of the Committee’s findings and recommendations, the Committee had highlighted the following: 1. The Committee noted that the Sugar Industry faced a shortage of skilled labour during the periods under review because of step migration from rural to urban areas while others moved to overseas or venture into non-sugar agricultural farming and some sugarcane farmers either abandoned or sold their farms as they are too old to continue farming and their children had opted for white collar job in urban areas or move overseas. The Committee recommends that the Ministry of Sugar Industry engage in comprehensive dialogue with stakeholders in the sugar sector to address the structural issues affecting the industry, particularly land lease issues, acute shortage of labour, excessive burning of cane and the Cane Payment System. 2. The Committee noted that the Annual Reports presented by the Ministry of Sugar lacked essential data during the periods under review which would enable the</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>734 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 21 st May, 2024 Committee to make more informed recommendations. The Ministry of Sugar needs to set a key target of achieving two million tonnes of sugarcane to breakeven. The Committee recommends the Ministry of Sugar to develop relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) collectively with respective organisations within the Sugar sector to achieve the target. 3. The Committee noted that transporting cane through rails would be far more cost effective than through trucks which required more fuel. It would also relieve road congestion and damage caused by cane trucks. The Committee recommends that the Ministry of Sugar work with the Ministry of Finance to explore the establishment of a multi-purpose railway system to cater for cane cartage and other goods and services. With that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and I have in front of me the list of speakers. They will speak in the following order: 1. Hon. S. Nand; 2. Hon. Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry; 3. Hon. A. A. Maharaj; and 4. Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Report being discussed. Before I start, I would like to urge honourable Members on the Government side to note that it is almost 18 months since they have been in power so, please, takes some ownership of the issues and stop blaming the previous Government for your inability to deliver. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the recommendations recommended by the Committee was that the Ministry of Sugar Industry to engage in comprehensive dialogue with the stakeholders in sugar sectors to address structural issues affecting the industry, particularly land lease issues, actual shortage of labour, excessive burning of cane and Cane Payment System. However, it fails to include Mill efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reliably told that the average TCTS for the last season was around 11 tonnes. Will the Minister be able to explain this? This is very poor and it is the direct result of inefficient extraction under his leadership. Processing delays and mill breakdowns is, obviously, a contributing factor. Improving milling infrastructure and optimizing process efficiency is crucial to reduce TCTS and improving overall sugar production. One of the problems, Mr. Speaker, Sir, encountered by our farmers is limited access to resources. Cane farmers often lack access to resources, such as farm capital and technology. This limits their ability to invest in modern farming techniques, leading to lower productivity. Land tenure issues continue to top the list. Infrastructure on the farm, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a major challenge. This includes farm loads and farm bridges and overuse or underuse of fertilizers. A lot of our farmers are not aware of the soil PH on their farm, thus are not sure of how much fertilizer is needed on the farm.</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 735 Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change is another factor. Another problem faced by the farmers in the Sugar Industry is the aging farmers. It is difficult to attract the young generation to get into sugarcane farming. Attracting young farmers to sugarcane farming can be a challenging factor and is crucial for the sustainability and future of the industry. However, this can be done if you: • • • • • Provide educational and training programmes for our young generation on how to work smart on the farms, not work hard. Provide financial support and incentives. I believe this Government is already providing some of these, but I request them to enhance the programme. Assist our farmers in getting land leases secured. Security of land will encourage them to invest on the farm. Continue to encourage and assist in the introduction of technology on the farm. This will greatly reduce the dependency on hired labour on the farm. Provide opportunities for mentoring and networking to our farmers, especially to the younger generation. This networking provides a continuous learning opportunity for our farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, cane farming, like any other commercial farming, is a business. The objective of the business is to make money. Are the cane farmers making money? Is the honourable Minister aware of how much it costs to produce a tonne of cane? If not, I urge him to get his people to do that. Typical cost for a farmer includes; land preparation, seed materials, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, machinery, transportation, other miscellaneous costs like, land lease, and labour. Not only the paid labour which the honourable Minister is so often proud of in getting labourers from Bangladesh, but the man hours, the farmer and the farmers’ family put into the farm. These all needs to be factored in. A farmer merely makes $10 to $20 a tonne of cane, so a farmer who produces around 300 tonnes of cane gets paid between $3,000 and $6,000 a year - that too, after six months. I urge all our cane farmers who are listening to, please, continue doing cane farming but, please, diversify. If you diversify or intercrop, then only you can make money. They need to start cultivating other crops, together with sugarcane. Doing this, will mitigate any risks associated with loss of income due to poor yield. It will also provide them with additional income for sustainability. Diversification or inter-cropping also improve the soil health and will reduce the dependency on fertilizer. Farmers will be able to value add to their diversified crops to get extra income, like maize flour from the maize. Please, work smart, farm smart, diversify and get that extra income that your farm needs. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to carry out a whole of industry inquiry. All agencies responsible for the production of sugar in Fiji need to be strategically looked at and improvements identified. It has to be a holistic approach. Individually looking at the farmers or the miller will not work. All the industries, the sectors and all the stakeholders involved in the production of sugarcane in Fiji needs to be holistically looked at and recommended to improve production. With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, firstly, I would like to talk about TCTS, as it was mentioned.</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>736 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 21 st May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, there was a stakeholder’s meeting last week in Lautoka where almost 200 people right from the Sugar Cane Growers Council, farmers, Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), you name it, attended. One of the things that we were concerned about is the very high TCTS in the Mills. It is not because of the mill inefficiency, but it is because of the sucrose content when the cane is out there. That is why the extraction of sugar is not coming out right. So, we have to come back and plant varieties of cane that has more sucrose content. Mr. Speaker, I support this Report. I had earlier mentioned in Parliament that the Report is from 2016 to 2020. We are in 2024. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- It is going to come:</span></p><p>What I am saying is, why are we trying to flog a dead horse here with this Report? So, I urge the Committee to come out as fast as possible and scrutinise all the current Annual Reports - 2021, 2022 and 2023, and bring it to us as soon as possible. Mr. Speaker, firstly, I would like to commend my hardworking staff at the Ministry of Sugar Industry for putting together these four years Annual Report under review. In the same period, my Ministry has also tabled 2016 to 2020 Annual Reports of Fiji Sugar Corporation, Sugarcane Growers Fund, Sugarcane Growers Council and Sugar Research Institute of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, from when the Ministry was established until todate, the responsibilities of the Ministry have significantly increased without any relative increase in the number of staff in the Ministry. The Ministry’s budget has increased over time, with more capital programmes to support the sugar industry, coordinated by the Ministry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the review of 2016-2017 and 2019-2020, a total of $281 million was allocated to the Ministry. Approximately 98 percent of this amount was allocated for grants to support the sugar industry, while only 2 percent was the Ministry’s operational expense which also included salaries and wages for the 10 staff who were employed by the Ministry. This is an indication of the maximum utilization of funds to benefit the cane growers and the sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, in this financial year (2023-2024), a total of 13 capital programmes were approved by the Government to support the sugar industry with the total capital grant of $44.5 million. The Funds Programme aims to increase the cane production through farm mechanisation, cane planting assistance, subsidising input cost, upgrading cane access roads and assisting the new farmers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time ever, the Ministry has introduced two new programmes which are the Farmer’s Incentive and Support for Manual Harvesting and Farmers Incentive which is a direct reward to cane growers who have increased their tonnage of cane where the grower has directly received $5 per tonne on the increase of cane harvesting. Manual Harvesting Programme supported those growers that hired labors had to harvest again manually and the Ministry has paid $1 per tonne of the manual harvested cane direct to the grower. A total of 4,924 farmers received a payment under the Farmers Incentive Programme while 8,336 farmers were paid under the Manual Harvesting Programme. We are exploring all avenues to increase the cane production and sustain the sugar industry.</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 737 Mr. Speaker, Sir, our sugar industry is confronted with wide issues of socio-economic and environmental forces. These challenges must be well understood in order to appreciate the level of performance of the industry. We have set targets in sugar production to be achieved and we are waiting through these challenges to achieve our targets. Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite these challenges my Ministry in collaboration with the Government is trying all its efforts to re-establish a platform for the industry to grow and sustain itself as it was during its glory days before. A Committee was established to look into the land issues on the land expiry of leases and non-proclamation of leased, agricultural land and renewal of leases. For this financial year, a total of $2 million was allocated to assist those growers wishing to renew their leases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are thankful for the support through the government of India. Recently, a technical assessment team from India had visited our sugar mills and inspected the railway network to ascertain the scope of repairing works required. This visit is in line with the industry’s plan of fixing the railway system in Fiji, preparing the sugar mill and reconstruction of the Rakiraki sugar mill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know whose grand idea was in the previous government to dismantle and take away the Rakiraki Sugar Mill.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Cyclone Winston:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Cyclone Winston only damaged and there was a cost for repairing of $10 million. That is because of your doing, if we had to put a new mill, a brand-new mill will cost $215 million.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.:</span> So, do it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- We will do it:</span> The blunder you made, because of that, this country had to spend $215 million. Mr. Speaker, Sir, proper planning and strategic realignment of the efforts to bolster the industry is ongoing. In collaboration with the stakeholders the industry has provided targets and goals with the relevant policies as the industry submission should be reviewed in the National Development Plan. Based on the targets, all sugar institutions should provide a plan of action to achieve the broad targets of the sugar industry. We will continue consulting with the international partners and the sugar producing countries to identify areas of strengthening growth of a sugar industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting and I must highlight in this august Parliament that my Ministry takes pride in supporting our female cane growers. Through a new farmer’s programme, we have been assisting female individuals who wish to pursue cane farming. As to-date, we have 61 registered and active female cane growers here. There are some highly successful female cane growers who are producing more than 300 tonnes of cane, they own cane lorries and other machineries. Recently, for the first time we have also sent four male farmers to India to receive training for their capacity building. Mr. Speaker, Sir, mechanisation and cane production is a way to move forward to achieve economies of scale in the sugar industry. This is what other countries have adopted to mechanise all operations for the sugar supply chain including venturing into artificial intelligence to bring efficiency and tackle labor challenges. A total of $0.5 million was allocated by the Government to support the acquisition of machineries and technologies that will support cane production. With this funding the Ministry in collaboration with FSC is acquiring planting machines, fertilizer machines, weedicide applicators and exploring drones to be brought to Fiji. The work is progressing on setting</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>738 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 21 st May, 2024 up a GIS system to digitize farms that will support monitoring of field activities and enhance efficiency. Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour shortages and reduced cane planting remains a notable issue of the sugar industry nevertheless the solution to address these issues remains within our beloved nation. We are exporting labour imports from Bangladesh and further updates to be provided as we progress. The sugar industry has been and will continue to contribute immensely towards economic growth and development of nation building. The sector is imploring to landowners with vacant land to joint-venture with FSC and plant cane on a large commercial scale on vacant lands. This is a successful story of a landowning unit joint venture with FSC. Based on these remarks, I therefore, support this motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as requested, I would like to speak in Hindi.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- You may do so. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Requesting if time can be stopped while honourable Members are wearing their headphones:</span> Aaj hum log ke samaksh mei jon report hum log ke paas hai, bahut important hai ki ee report ke baare mein hindi mei baat kari, kahe ki kaafi kisan logan aisan hai jon hindi samjhe. Aur bahut aisan cheez logan hai jon hum log ke samjhaye mei easy padi agar hum hindi mei aaj baat karega aur kisan log ke samjhe mein easy padi. Ee jon ganna ke mantralay hai, ee koi chhota mantralay nahi hai aur chhota industry nahi hai. Iske baare mein hum log 1970 se baat karta hai, aur ee aisan ek industry hai jon dheere dheere neeche jaye. Agar maan jaye toh ee baat Minister bhi sake agree kare ki Fiji mei khali 40 percent aisan farmers hai jon 100 tonne se kamti ganna nikale, aur kareeban 60 percent aisan kisan logan hai jon lagbhag 150 tonne se kamti ganna nikale. Over time, ee cheez dheere dheere kamti hote gaye hai. Hum log previous government ke, SDL government ke, SVT government ke aur FIjiFirst government ke blame kare mei koi fayda nahi hai ab. Jon fundamental issues hai hum log ke uu sab address kare ke padi. Aur jon issues logan hai, jayse ki, hum batai: Abhi people log ganna kahe boye, kahe ki uu log ke ghar usme hai. Agar ganna boyla band kar din, uu log ke ghar ukhaad ke jaye ke par jayi. FijiFirst ek policy leke aais raha jaha pe people logan ganna nahi sake boye jon log ke ladkan overseas chal din hai, jon log ke ladkan master-teacher ban gayin hai. Jon log ab kisaani nahi maange kare ganna ke khet mei, uu log sake apan jameen surrender kar ke at least TLTB uu log ke ¼ acre residential lease de dai. Agar Minister sake uu cheez pe emphasise kare ki ee la policy abhi le kaha gayis hai, kahe ki andhruni jagah jaao jaha pe ganna bowaye hai, kaafi jagah pe aaj kal ek admi aur aurat khali bachin hai jon ganna kaat ke bhare hai gaadi mei. Uu log lorry mei nahi sake bhare, kahe ki labour nahi mile hai. Aur pahaad pe ganna bowaye hai toh iske karan se uu log mechanical harvester nahi sake use kare. Ee ek reason hai ki kon karan se hum log mangta raha industrial hemp introduce kare. Mehnat kamti raheta, paisa jaada raheta. Abhi mehnat jaada hoy gaye hai, paisa kamti hoy gaye hai. Agar koi 100 tonne ganna boye hai, agar hum log uu log ke $100 fir de laga, $10,000 paisa hoye hai. Hum log ke timepe jab hum log fixed guaranteed price deta raha, $85 deta raha, uu time fir khali $8,500 hota raha. Ganna boye ke cost itna high hoy gayis hai ki agar $5,000 cost nikaal do, ek kisaan $3,500 ek saal me apan ghar kaese chalayi. Agar hum bolta $3,500 ek tonne ganna ke agar bota hai, toh 60 percent kisaan logan toh 150 tonne khali ganna boye hai. Toh uu log ke $3500,100 tonne ganna agar bota hai toh 60 percent kisaan logan 150 tonne khali ganna boye hai. Toh uu log ke lagbhag ek saal mei gire se gire $5000 ya $6000 paisa mili. Jab cheez ke mahengai itna upar jaaye hai, sab cheez ke daam badhe hai, $6000 mei hum log kaese sakta expect kare ki dui parani apan ghar chalaiye. Aaj kal ke duniya mein $6000 paisa kuch nahi hai.</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 739 Mr. Speaker, Sir, hum log ke honourable Minister, last Parliament sitting mein batais raha ki ganna ke chinni ke global market price abhi $2000 hai. Abhi batais $2000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, TCF, TCTS ratio agar abhi jaese uu batais hai, 1:11. Agar 1:11 se calculate karega, ek tonne ganna ke daam $181 aawe. Aaj ke jon ratio aap bataye hai uske anusar $181 awawe. Usmei se agar 30 percent jon miller cost hai, uu la nikaal do, jon ki $54.54 hoi, fir bhi $127 aawe. Honourable Minister last crushing season mei dis raha $92. Hum log ka jaane ki jon $36 ke short fall hai, uu paisa kaha gayis. Hum log ke time pe jab $55 chini ke daam raha, usmei se agar 30 percent nikaalo $16.50, $38.50 aata raha. Hum log uske $46.50 se top up kar ke $85 deta raha. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Interjects (inaudible) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Sun lo, sun lo, hindi mei samjhata hai, sun lo thora! Yahi toh problem hai sunta nahi hai tum. Mr. Speaker, Sir, hum log $46.50 top up kar ke $85 deta raha. Jonchi ek baar ya do baar COVID-19 ke baad mei hum log bataye raha jon industrial cost hai, $2.50 jab hum log minus kara raha uu time, toh Opposition kitna halla karis raha ee Parliament mein, $2.50 ke liye, aur ee jon $36 ke shortfall hai, uu maange honourable Minister bhi justify kare- $36 kaha aur $2.50 kaha. Mr. Speaker, Sir, jab yahi cheez hum hindi mei people log ke explain kara, toh ek political party batais ki hum Hindustani mei people log ke mislead kara. Hindustani bhasha nahi hai, Hindustani jaat hai. Hindustan se jon aawe uu log ke Hindustani bola jaaye hai. Bharat se ayega bhartiye boliye, Pakistan se aayega Pakistani boliye, Hindustani ke bhasha hindi hai, utna samjhe ke chahi. Aur utna nahi samajh paain. Lately abhi konchi bhaye hai, hum log honourable Members logan hai, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Dui honourable Members log ke aage ek party ke general secretary hum log ke idiot bolis, ki hum log idiot hai. Rakiraki mei bolis. Agar honourable Prasad waha par raheta, uske naitrik mein hum janta hai ki ee baat nahi hota. Uu leader nahi hon deta aisan baat, agar koi bolta fir uu maafi lewaye leta, kahe ki uske party mein kuch jan hai jon maafi maange mei bahut maahir hoy gayin hai. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, shame on the honourable Members who were sitting there. ki uu log kuch nahi bolin. Ek Member ke toh fir bhi hum kuch nahi bolega. Honourable Agni Deo Singh hum aapke aaja bolta hai, aapke pota ke waha pe idiot bola gaye, aap kuch nahi bola.

PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not come into Parliament to hear this kind of stupidity. As the saying goes, ‘One cannot fix stupidity all the time’. It is actually quite hypocritical for honourable Maharaj to mislead Parliament and mislead the growers of this country, and to quite ironically make a point that he wanted to speak in Hindi. These were the very people sitting in the Opposition who were part of a Government, part of a political party, and part of an agenda to destroy our languages. It is this Government under this honourable Prime Minister, under your leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are allowed to speak in our vernacular languages. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They all have posted here. When he had an opportunity to support, he is talking about language. He does not even know. Someone said that he was talking about Hindustani, Pakistani and Afghanistan. Instead of saying Afghan, he said Afghanistani. There is no such word as Afghanistani in the video or somewhere. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is desperation. I know he made a video, and I will tell you why he was misleading about the price. He does not know how the sugar price per tonne of cane based on the international price of sugar, based on the 70-30 formula, based on the industry cost, based on the net proceeds, the final cane payment is decided. He got it completely wrong. Someone showed me a video. He was like a little primary school teacher in a video, trying to put the formula. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- He was like a primary school teacher explaining to the children. When primary school teachers teach the kids, they actually do it right. They put the right formula, they make sure that the addition is right, the formula is right and the subtraction is right. He was putting these formulas without understanding … HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, a Point of Order – Standing Order 74(1)(a). It says, and I quote: “Any member may only raise a point of order if - (a) there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.” Mr. Speaker, the honourable Member has discriminated primary a schoolteachers. However, honourable Maharaj had explained in his video or to the citizens of Fiji that you cannot compare it to our primary school teachers. They are working hard to teach our young people. You cannot discriminate like that.</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 741 MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Minister. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- As I have said, Mr. Speaker, one cannot fix stupidity and that is a good example. All I was saying is that our primary school teachers, Mr. Speaker, can explain better than what honourable Maharaj was trying to explain in a video. That is what I am saying, Sir. This is the level of hypocrisy. I know, Mr. Speaker, he got it all completely wrong. He has put out his video. He is trying, he is weaving, doing this and trying to get something out of it, and he is thinking that by speaking in Hindi and, again, lying about the formulae, about how the final cane payment is decided. Let me just also say, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister for Sugar had explained it very well in a very positive way. What are some of the things that we, as Government, are doing? In the last Budget, we provided $49.7 million expenditure, of which $44.5 million just went into capital expenditure. If you look at the incentives that we provided, in fact, there are 13 programmes in the Ministry that provide direct support to farmers in the industry, of which eight major ones include; manual harvesting, sugarcane development farmers assistance, cane cartage, fertilizer subsidy, Sugar Stabilisation Fund, new farmers lease and premium assistance, and on top of those - in addition to that $2 million allocation, the Government, under the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, recently approved another additional $1.2 million to pay the premium for 218 agricultural farmers. The Government, Mr. Speaker, for the first time after so many years has taken the problems in the sugar industry head on. They talk about the history. Honourable Nand was talking about diversification. But let me just remind him; in 2006 before the coup, European Union had provided almost $350 million and that was the first phase. The three components of the programme was for alternative livelihood, one was to fix the mills and one was to fix the farm level production efficiency of the sugarcane. We lost millions and millions of dollars because of the coup, and also because there was a promise that the elections will be held in 2009 which never was held and the 1997 Constitution was abrogated. Then, Mr. Speaker, we had TC Winston and the Rakiraki Mill that the honourable Minister talked about all the technical assessments after the destruction of their Mill showed that all Government had to do was put in $5 million to fix the Mill at that time. They did not, because I do not know what kind of ideas they had. When I asked the former Prime Minister in this Parliament, “what are you doing about cane leases in Seaqaqa where the farmers were struggling to pay their premiums?” He was the Chairman of iTLTB for so many years. Then they were in Government, but they did nothing. It is this Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir that is now very clearly addressing the issues. We started the taskforce involving the Ministry of Lands, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, iTLTB, Ministry of Sugar and the Ministry of Agriculture. That taskforce itself, Sir has been able to provide recommendations to fix the industry. Honourable Nand was talking about cane farmers’ income. What the honourable Minister said very clearly is that the incentives that are there is to increase the level of production. He said a farmer producing 300 tonnes or 400 tonnes will get $5,000 or $6,000 income.</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>742 Review Report-Ministry of Sugar 2016-2020 Annual Reports 21 st May, 2024 At the last price, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a 300 tonne farmer or a 400 tonne producer will get $36,000, if you take 60 percent of the cost.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

MAHARAJ.- How many of them? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is the point, but they just do not understand what the honourable Minister said, that we are trying to raise the level of production, Mr. Speaker. So, my advice to honourable Maharaj is, he can now feel comfortable and we are very happy that he can speak in Hindi in this Parliament, and I invite them to speak more in Hindi and I will, next time, respond to them in Hindi. I will respond to them very well in Hindi. Honourable Bala speaks better Hindi, he will understand what it means because that is what they detested. He is now talking about Indian farmers, Indo-Fijian farmers, because that was what they were doing when they were sitting on this side. When we were sitting on that side, any time we talked about the iTaukei problem, any time we discussed issues, it was seen as anti-Indian. So, in his own speech, Mr. Speaker, in Hindi was designed to create that impression. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Your time is up, Sir. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the final point I wanted to make. That is the impression he created but he has failed miserably, and they will fail again and again to promote that kind of nonsense. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we noted the various issues that has been brought about by honourable Members, relating to the industry - aging farmers, infrastructure… (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.:</span> …land leases, et cetera.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, these challenges need to be addressed effectively if some semblance of turnaround can be contemplated. If the trend remains unchecked, then the decline in production for both, sugarcane and raw sugar would lead to a non-viable and a non-sustainable industry. Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the approximate 50,000 hectares of sugarcane land allocated for contract in order to supply Mills, only about 24,000 are utilized for actual sugarcane production, even</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Review Report-Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 743 allowing for land surveying, the discrepancy cannot be explained by non-lease renewal. It is the inability for farmers to earn sustainable livelihood and I think this is one of the main reasons why we need to be relooking at the industry. Low productivity, in some cases, abandonment of sugarcane funds was being driven by the low income that the farmer’s gained. Evidence suggests that the main reason for declining productivity is the lack of financial viability without any Government support. I would like to thank the honourable members for their contribution, and I do support the motion before Parliament. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
