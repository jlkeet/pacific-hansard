<body><h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THERATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMINC FRAMEWORK</h3><p>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMINC FRAMEWORK HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving this opportunity to speak on the motion. After COVID-19, the Global Trade Landscape, consumers and businesses all faced numerous challenges. We all witnessed geopolitical tension which is still continuing globally but we have just recently seen the tension in New Caledonia, disruption to the supply chain which pushed the prices and as a small country we had no say. We could do nothing about it. We were takers in this game. Shortages of labour globally which created movement of workers across the nations and high inflation rate and of course high cost of living. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is designed to tackle these global challenges that require coordinated effort and when we talk about supply chain issues, definitely a single country cannot work against multinationals who are very powerful and they have lot more money and lot more clout to do what they want to do internationally. The IPEF aims to enhance economic ties and cooperation across the Indo-Pacific region to ensure sustainable economic growth, environmental stewardship and fair market practises. Mr. Speaker, Sir, my reasons for supporting this motion are many but I will dwell into few areas only. The Indo-Pacific region is a critical hub for global trade and economic activities. The countries that are involved or you can say the pioneers of developing this particular framework or engaged in producing this framework are USA and many other countries that join later on like India, Japan, Australia and Singapore. They are the powerhouse for innovation, no doubt about that. By participating in the IPEF, Fiji can have access to new opportunities for trade and investment that can lead to economic growth and can also contribute to improving the quality of life for our people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Clean Economy Agreement within the IPEF will assist nations to address the urgent challenges of climate change. Fiji has been a champion of climate change. This is another opportunity for us to look at the innovative practices and how we can utilise this within our nation.</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>728 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 21 st May, 2024 This Agreement encourages countries to adopt renewable energy. We already have our National Energy Policy and in that Policy, we are talking about achieving 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. Reducing carbon emission and investing in green technology which is the new way forward for industries. The Clean Economy Agreement will promote sustainable practices which industries need to adopt. We have heard from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation not too long ago about the Aviation Industry is moving towards the use of clean and green fuel. These initiatives not only protect our planet, but also open up new avenues for economic growth and job creation in emerging green sectors. We have also heard from the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry on the establishment of an ethanol plant in Rakiraki. These are all helping towards achieving the clean green environment. However, the question would be for honourable Singh whether we have enough cane to produce ethanol; that is another matter for discussion at a later time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fair Economy Agreement is the foundation of the IPEF, ensuring fair labour practices and promoting gender equality and inclusivity in the workplace which is extremely crucial. The Fair Economy Agreement aims to build a more just and inclusive economic landscape. We all know the exploitation of cheap labour in making designer goods which are later sold at exorbitant prices, and we hope that, at least, this Agreement will create a level playing field for the signatories. The IPEF will foster stronger strategic partnership when it comes to addressing common challenges such as cyber security, tax administration, addressing corruption, or even diffusing geo- political tension through dialogue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by embracing this framework, Fiji will commit to building a future that is economically robust, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable, with an opportunity to work together for the prosperity and wellbeing of our future generations and above all, this particular Agreement will also assist Fiji in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, thank you for this opportunity and I support the motion before Parliament. I also wish the honourable Minister all the best. I know he is in a hurry to go to Singapore, you have our blessings, and thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said from both sides of Parliament. We cannot underestimate the true value of this and I acknowledge the contribution from the other side. It expresses the sentiment of this Parliament and the people of Fiji. Sir, I endorse, Sir, the ratification of the Treaty. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will keep it brief as well. Again, this is very, very important for Fiji and this is an opportunity that we need to seize, given the benefits that this will bring to us. Again, let me assure the honourable Minister that we have had very good discussions with the team, and again, we will continue to offer our assistance where it is needed and, of course, the experience and the expertise that we have on this side of Parliament as well. That is still on offer, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On the Global Supply Chain that has been ratified already in November last year, again, this is very, very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You would recall that in the recent IPU Meeting on the presentation by WHO, as they are doing the Pandemic Treaty in Geneva, I do not know how far that</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 729 has progressed but the Ministry of Health was there, Sir, and this is one of the main issues - supply chain. We encountered a lot of difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. I know for the fact that there was an incident in which we sought the assistance of the Australian Government when the reactants that were needed in the lab were channelled to another country. However, we are thankful to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia, Senator Marise Payne, who assisted us. Again, going back to honourable Professor Prasad’s response to the questions today, although this is an Agreement but going back to SDG 17, the partnership for the goals, this is very important for us as small countries. Again, I keep referring to the vulnerability of Small Islands Developing States. Now, there is going to be a meeting in Antigua and Barbuda, there is a lot of questions about multilateralism but now that we are signing with the big boys in this IPEF Agreement, this will be very, very good for us, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will just probably touch on Pillar 3 – Clean Economy Agreement. We had some very good discussions, honourable Minister, with the Permanent Secretary, particularly on the issue of the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement which is a largely non-binding economic framework that supports the efforts of IPEF countries in achieving their respective climate goals. It aims to accelerate the deployment of clean technologies and facilitate investment. Of course, the objectives of it, I will not go into the details but in the discussions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we clearly explained to the team why it is crafted as such, because I linked that to the Paris Agreement Article 2.2 which reads: “This Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities, in the light of different national circumstances.” This is where this Agreement is linked to the Paris Agreement. This is one of the issues that will be continuously raised, particularly when it comes to big economies. I know India’s position, this is because of the common but differentiated responsibilities. On one extreme, they are far ahead in terms of development but on the other extreme, there are still people in rural India who need electricity, there are still people in rural India who need other forms of development, including environmental issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why the common but differentiated responsibilities will always be linked to most of these Agreements post-2015 Paris Agreement. But there are opportunities for us in this, particularly our access to technology and the best practices. This is something, honourable Minister, that we also had some very good discussions with the team. At the Intercontinental Resort, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have talked about how the Chinese Chief Negotiator gave his advice to Fiji about our approaches to such negotiations. We have a big list, but we will have to prioritise. I think what is important for Fiji as well is the scoping - the details, because as I stated, the Chinese will say, “Oh, you talk a lot but where is your plan?” When we are working on this as the operationalisation of this Agreement when it comes into force, hopefully, because this is under the Biden Administration, that is a big question mark as well because of the Election that is coming up. But, hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that does not stop us from making the necessary arrangements, particularly when we want to go to our partners, we must</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>730 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 21 st May, 2024 have our lists ready, even to the extent, if we have to ask for people who will need to help us in terms of drafting our requests, and do the technical scoping, it will be very, very important for us. One thing that we also discussed with the technical team, Sir, when it comes to private sector participation, particularly in climate-related issues, one thing that is the lacking in the Pacific is scale. This is probably something that Fiji needs to consider, because what will attract private investors is economy of scale. This is why we established the Pacific Hub under the climate change when we were in the Presidency of COP, so that when it comes to scoping of projects, when it comes to enticing private sector investments in the climate space projects, they will be after the economy of scale, and this is something we have already discussed. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by our colleagues, we wish the Ministry all the very best and we acknowledge the hardworking staff in the Ministry. For us, we really need to look at our capacity issues. We are thankful to the UN agencies that are helping us when it comes to the limitation in our capacities. Hopefully, apart from trade and the benefits, we will access new technology, new innovations and it will lift us to another level, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the statements that have already been given also in this Parliament during the course of Parliament this week. We support the motion. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to support Fiji’s participation in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The decision in Parliament to ratify the - Overarching Agreement, the Clean Economy Agreement and the Fair Economy Agreement. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said in this Parliament and I suppose, I would be repeating a lot of the good contributions that had been made before me, including that of the honourable Prime Minister, in terms of this very important Agreement for Fiji. What I will do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just contextualise what IPEF could potentially mean for Fiji and, more importantly, what is being done to actually get some of the benefits out of these Agreements. Mr. Speaker, at 12 o’clock today, I excused myself to go to a lunch with about 14 US Businessman, who have come to Fiji to attend the infrastructure meeting that is held in Nadi over the next two days. That is a direct result of IPEF Agreement. Sir, this Agreement from what I can see is not just a lot of words on a piece of paper, as most of these Agreements are. What I can see is that amongst the members, there is a lot of activity that is already happening. Billions and billions of dollars have been signed in terms of Agreements between countries to actually activate respective economies. From that perspective, we thank the previous Government, the former Prime Minister and honourable Koya, for tapping me on the shoulder when I first got into office and reminded me to have a look at this Agreement because it is very good for Fiji. Sir, I can say that this Agreement is geared towards action. It is geared towards actually getting things done, and that is quite different from some of the trade agreements or some of the other Agreements that we see around the place. Basically, the structure of Agreement has been explained. The Agreement is quite unusual, Sir, because it has four pillars and then an over-arching Agreement that monitors the four pillars. Because of the speed with which the negotiation was happening, there was a decision taken to come to the respective governments after the negotiation of certain pillars which is why we agreed collectively on the supply chain pillar. We now have a Clean Economy Agreement and also the Fair Economy Agreement Pillars in front of us. This is why the Agreement has come in this manner.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 731 Sir, one of the other things that is going to be very beneficial for Fiji is particularly from my perspective as the honourable Minister for Trade is that part of the mandate that I saw when I got into this role is to try and really genuinely diversify the Fiji economy and actually leverage every single opportunity that we have to actually deliver a diversified economy. Some can argue, Sir, that even the Google Investment is probably one of the early harvests of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. It has gotten visibility in Washington, from that alone through Fiji, the whole Pacific will be transformed in terms of technology and access. Mr. Speaker, Sir, each single Pacific country I believe will have a second cable into their countries creating redundancy across the Pacific. So, that again, Sir, this is why I am saying this Agreement is not like other Agreements. It actually has teeth and is starting to gain momentum. We have big ambitions on Climate Change, Sir. This Agreement actually positions us to actually start seeking opportunities for access to finance, technical assistance, capacity building to allow us to implement renewable energy projects and develop the necessary expertise. In fact, Mr. Speaker, there is the Singapore meeting that I referred to earlier is the inaugural Clean Economy in the national forum which is going to be held in Singapore in early June. I invite honourable Premila Kumar if she would like to attend as well. Sir, this is why I am saying this Agreement is important. The most important thing to note is that the investment forum has asked for a list of projects from the Pacific. It includes seven large infrastructure related projects in Rural Electrification, Landfill Hydro Energy, Waterways Treatment, Green Marine Transportation, Blue Shipping for possible farming amounting to about $300 million in terms of potential investment. So, this is again some of the things that are coming out from this Agreement. In addition to that, Sir, they also have asked us to submit applications for SMEs that will have climate focus our businesses. So, there is a list of 24 SMEs that we have put together and they will be part of the list that has already gone to Singapore. I am hopeful that we can at least get some investment attraction from these opportunities. As mentioned by the honourable Members on both sides, the fair economy component of this Agreement is very important, Sir. As we move forward it will be very important that we ensure that transparency in terms of tax administration and other necessary legal frameworks are there to in order to attract investment to Fiji. One of the things also, Sir, that will ultimately, I am hoping will result out of that is that it will actually raise the standards in terms of all our current regulatory frameworks. We will actually start to move into the sphere of the larger countries. Sir, if that happens in terms of investment perception, Fiji becomes a different kind of preposition in terms of the global playfield. That again is another significant reason why this Agreement is very important to the country. Finally, it goes without saying that there needs to be acknowledgement as well on the Trade Ministry and the team in the Trade Office. As correctly mentioned by honourable Koya they are a very young team but they fight like hell when it comes to Fiji. To be honest, Sir, one of the things that have come out from this whole negotiation is Fiji holds its own when it comes to trade negotiations. We do not hold back, a lot of the benefits and disagreement particularly the technical assistance and technical cooperation is due to Fiji’s vocal push to get these things in and pushing the small country perspective.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>732 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 21 st May, 2024 On that basis I thank the team in the Ministry and the Permanent Secretary for all their hard work and we should be proud, and I am glad that I will go to Singapore and say that this was a bipartisan agreement and will not only a one-sided Agreement. In the years to come, I am hoping that the IPEF Agreement will certainly set the platform for the building of the economic architecture in Fiji and also ensuring that we do achieve an economy that is diversified and can address the needs of all our people.
