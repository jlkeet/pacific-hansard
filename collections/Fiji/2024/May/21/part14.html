<body><h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3><h4>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move: Under Standing Order 6, that so much of Standing Order 130(2) to (4) is suspended so as to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to move his motion on the approval of an international Treaty without referring it to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, on the motion being referred to, that Parliament approves that Fiji signs and ratifies the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF): 1. 2. 3. Overarching Agreement; Clean Economy Agreement; and Fair Economy Agreement. Sir, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a United States led initiative with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malayasia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Fiji is the only Pacific Island country that was invited and joined the 14 Member Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) for prosperity which was launched in May 2022. The negotiation of the four pillars of the IPEF commenced after the Ministers agreed to the scope in November 2022 and was considered that an extremely fast pace. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that the IPEF partners announce the substantial conclusion</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>716</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 of the negotiations of Pillar 2 – Supply Chain Agreement, in May 2023. HON. F. S. KOYA.- In assistance to the honourable Minister, Sir, I think he has forgotten that this is the suspension motion, not the actual motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Yes, so that is why I am coming to an end.</p><p>(Laughter)</p><h4>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, that is why we have to suspend, I still have 18 minutes.</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Minister, are you coming to it now? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, Sir. Given the importance of these agreements and the IPEF, that we approve the suspension motion in order to consider this. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. The motion, as rightly put by honourable Koya, is the suspension motion. But the honourable Minister was right in saying he was just getting to it and then he rounded off there by going on to the suspension motion. Let me remind you, on the suspension. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the suspension, that is why I am having the Standing Order with me. Just seeking clarification, is it about suspending beyond 4.30 p.m. or is it about suspending the motion? Yes, it is about suspending the motion for the honourable Attorney-General to move the motion. It is not about 4.30 p.m. MR. SPEAKER.- That is housekeeping.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Yes, that is housekeeping, it is not yet.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- That is part of my work. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Yes, I will be talking about suspension of Standing Order 130, as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I read Standing Order 130 that states, and I quote: “(2) The Attorney-General must give notice of a motion for the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to review a treaty. The notice must be accompanied by a - (a) copy of the treaty; and (b) written analysis that includes the following information- (i) a summary of the treaty; (ii) the requirements for its implementation within a signatory State; and (iii) a statement of the impact of the treaty on Fiji. (3) At the time appointed under Standing Order 34 for motions for which notice has been given, the Speaker must, without debate, refer the treaty and the analysis to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for consideration and review,</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>717 and the Standing Committee on the Foreign Affairs and Defence may table a report in Parliament not later than 30 days after the treaty has been referred to it. (4) The Attorney-General may move a motion that the treaty be approved by Parliament if the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence – (a) tables a report on the treaty; or (b) does not table a report on the treaty within the required 30 day period referred to in clause (3).” This is what we are actually seeking in here by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to be suspended. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been hearing a lot about Standing Order 51, that we have been bringing Bills under Standing Order 51, and they have been scrutinising us and telling us all about the Bills. (Hon. M. S. N. Kamikamica interjects)</p><h4>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I have 20 minutes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.</h4><p>We were being blamed for bringing this under Standing Order 51. We accepted it, we were bringing Bills under Standing Order 51 and we never denied it. There were urgencies, so we brought it. Now, they are doing it. They have actually taken a step further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to fast- track the Treaties. Why are we doing this for the Treaties? I agree this is not the first time, this is the second time. The first time when they actually made this blunder, we thought they will consider it when bringing the second Treaty. Now, it is becoming a regular task for them to bring in Treaties, suspend Standing Order 130 and expedite ratifying the Treaty. What is this? Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a procedure in place for Treaties. What is the urgency for bringing in the Treaties? MR. SPEAKER.- I am giving you the time to finish.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> You people are not talking to each other, that is the problem.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I am giving you time to finish, honourable Maharaj, and then I will reply. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- What we actually fail to understand, Mr. Speaker, what is the urgency of bringing this treaty in such a manner? We know they have got 100 percent of their Bills under Standing Order 51, even new Ministers introducing Bills are doing so under Standing Order 51. They are the same Ministers who have been objecting to the of Standing Order 51 all this while and now as I am suggesting, they have gone further to bring treaties. (Honourable Member interjects) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Honourable Minister, the vide is recording, you are now caught on video.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>718</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, our concern over here is that we should refer treaties to Committees and if it was this urgent, we actually had a Parliament sitting in April. They could have actually brought the treaty in April, given it to the Standing Committee, the Standing Committee would actually produce a report within 30 days in this Parliament sitting and we could have actually debated and ratified the treaty.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the reason why the suspension motion:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- If it is so urgent it can still be referred to the Standing Committee and we can have a Special Parliamentary sitting to ratify the treaty:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Talk to your leader:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> That is the clarification I would like to seek and oppose suspending of Standing Order 130. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the issue raised by honourable Maharaj, he is seeking that he highlighted SO130(2). May I ask that you read the motion that is before you very quickly and clearly. You better understand what the Government is trying to address here. That is the very core of this motion. It is a suspension of clauses 130(2) and (4) so as to the allow honourable Attorney-General to then go to that. So, they are going around it avoiding subclauses (2) and (4) by going straight to what then will be brought in by the learned Attorney-General. I hope I have clarified that because you are seeking clarification and you have quoted sub-clause (2); that s suspended now. (Hon. A. A. Maharaj interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- No. You raised that issue.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- You quoted sub:</span> clause (2) and that is what I am trying to help you with in clarifying that. The very motion that is before us now is the suspension of Standing Order 130(2) and (4). HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- And that is what we do not agreed to, Mr. Speaker, of suspending those and not sending the treaty to the Committee. That is our stand from the Opposition. MR. SPEAKER.- It is both in Subclauses (2) and (4).</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- We are suspending it so we do not refer it to the Committees as you rightly quoted:</span> So, suspension is there now. Anything else? Any other comments? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, perhaps the other side of Parliament are not talking to each other.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> Sir, let me explain. This treaty is the best thing that has ever</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>719 happened for this country. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Their Prime Minister actually approved getting involved in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. What they are suggesting is that we delay the process of getting this done. Our Ministry, because of the respect we have for that side of Parliament which they never gave according to honourable Tabuya, consulted the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Koya. I think it is about three hours to advice on what we are trying to achieve. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), I am not joking, Sir, is a significant agreement for Fiji. I am going to Singapore, the intent is to deliver the instruments in Singapore as the first country that is going to ratify the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. It has been vetted fully by the Solicitor-General’s Office together with 14 other legal officers in the world. (Chorus of interjections) HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- What value can you provide? My suggestion, Sir, is I ask the Opposition, we agreed, the same process was followed with one pillar, Pillar 2 on supply chain and we are doing the same thing again and for some reason they have changed their minds. I suppose we will have to put it to vote, but I was hoping, Sir, that we do this on a bipartisan basis because this is good for Fiji. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need to clarify the Opposition’s position on this. Let me assure the honourable Minister that we are communicating. This is a matter of procedure, do not take the Opposition for granted. That is the point. HON. J. USAMATE.- Yeah!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We know how important this is for Fiji:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Stop grandstanding:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> We are not opposing this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but as a matter of procedure because this is an abuse…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> No, it is not.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> … of what is laid out in the Standing Orders because they will make it as a precedent based on the agreement that we did before. Let me just tell the honourable Minister, we communicated with the staff and we communicated with the Opposition in the caucus, we agreed that this will be raised but we still support it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is our position and that has not changed but do not take the Opposition for granted; that is the point Mr. Speaker, Sir. We have been there and gone through this. This IPEF was initiated by us, we were there and we know how important it is. We have given the assurance to the officials that we will support it but what is coming from the Opposition is about the process because this is supposed to go through the Committees. It is supposed to go through the Committee and we are trying to help you so that the ratification can take place as planned but of course it is a matter of procedure. You have no business to talk about the Opposition, we are here to handle the Opposition matters but we are here to look at the big picture and that is what we will stand for.</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>720 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 21 st May, 2024720 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is actually disrespectful for the honourable Leader of the Opposition to raise the issue again when you clearly clarified that the suspension motion was to go beyond the procedures. The suspension motion is itself a procedure of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and you allowed that in the Business Committee. The motion was moved by the honourable Minister, despite that, we had honourable Maharaj going over and over and again talking about the procedure when the suspension motion allows them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you also have additional powers under Standing Order 20 to make this decision and you rightfully and correctly clarified. I do not see why there is any fuss on that. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the suspension, I think it has been explained to honourable Maharaj and I thank you, Sir, for that explanation. It is just a matter of reading that motion or hearing what I said to move that Standing Order 130(2) to (4) be suspended so that we can move forward with this. I was trying to explain the rationale on why we need this, but they shouted me down, if I had finished that then probably there would have a better understanding. This is a critical issue at the moment in terms of this framework which we need to conclude and the timing too is very important. That is why the Standing Order are made out this way so that we cater for situations such as what we are facing now because we need to sign this framework early next month. I am sure that the Opposition know the benefits of this to the country, at least they are smiling now, they are not angry… (Laughter) We can move forward, we continue to move forward as one. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, so much has been said, differences of views and opinions as well but Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
