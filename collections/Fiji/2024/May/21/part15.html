<body><h3>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK</h3><p>RATIFICATION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that Parliament approves that Fiji signs and ratifies the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF): (a) (b) (c) the Overarching Agreement; the Clean Economy Agreement; and the Fair Economy Agreement.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- We are becoming a merry go round now. (Laughter) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a United States-led initiative. It was launched in 2022 with its founding members including Australia, Brunei</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 721 Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The IPEF comprise four pillars of co-operation amongst its partners. Pillar 1 focuses on Trade, Pillar 2 on Supply Chain, Pillar 3 on a Clean Economy and Pillar 4 on a Fair Economy. Last year, Parliament unanimously approved the ratification of the Agreement relating to Supply Chain Resilience which was negotiated under Pillar II (Supply Chain). This Agreement, the first of IPEF Agreement to take effect, came into force on February this year, marking a significant milestone of Fiji’s economic and strategic partnerships with Indo-Pacific region. Recently, IPEF negotiators have successfully concluded agreements on Pillar III (Clean Economy) and Pillar IV (Fair Economy), along with overarching agreement to ensure a sustainable framework for future ministerial level cooperation among IPEF partners. Each of these IPEF Agreements presented to Parliament has been meticulously negotiated to align with our national interests and a broader vision of a prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific region. We have an overarching agreement, formally called the Agreement on IPEF, which sets forth a clear and structured approach to achieving the objectives of IPEF. It does this by establishing a governing body - the IPEF Council, that is composed of ministerial-level representatives from each Party, responsible for overseeing the implementation and coordination of the IPEF agreements. This IPEF Council is tasked with considering the collective operational matters, proposing new agreements and discussing amendments with decisions made by consensus. The overarching agreement also establishes a Joint Commission which comprises of representatives from parties to specific subject agreements, overseeing the implementation of those agreements. We have next the IPEF Agreement relating to Clean Economy under Pillar III of the IPEF for ratification. This Agreement marks a crucial step towards promoting a sustainable future for Fiji and our regional partners. Allow me to summarize its key elements and the substantial benefits it will bring to our nation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement, although largely non-binding, provides an economic framework aimed at supporting the climate goals of participating countries. It focusses on accelerating the deployment of clean technologies and facilitating investments. Under this Agreement, the IPEF partners, including Fiji, will collaborate on the following three issues: 1. 2. 3. research and development of clean energy technologies; commercialisation and deployment of these technologies to ensure they are accessible and affordable; and building infrastructure that supports de-carbonisation efforts. This Agreement emphasises the importance of investing in climate-friendly projects, partnering with the private sector to leverage market opportunities in the clean economy, and creating quality job opportunities through industrialization.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>722 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 21 st May, 2024 To support these initiatives, this Agreement offers financing options, technical assistance and capacity building measures. The United States has also introduced complementary initiatives such as the Global Climate Fund and the Catalytic Capital Fund. For Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Agreement presents opportunities to advance clean energy technologies, attract investments to build climate resilience, and supports sustainable economic growth. Moreover, this Agreement establishes an annual IPEF Investor Forum. The inaugural forum will be hosted by Singapore on 5 th to 6 th June, 2024 (next month), providing a platform for investors to connect and share ideas. Honourable Members, the IPEF Clean Economy Agreement is a vital tool for Fiji’s development and our global climate commitments. Ratifying this Agreement will enable significant advancements in our clean energy sector, attract essential investments and above all, enhances our economic resilience. Finally, honourable Members, we have the Agreement relating to a Fair Economy under Pillar IV. This Agreement is a pivotal step towards enhancing transparency, combating corruption and fostering a fair economic environment within our region. Let me outline the key components and anticipated benefits of this Agreement for Fiji. The IPEF Economy Agreement is dedicated to combating corruption, enhancing tax administration and transparency, and fostering corporation among partner countries. This Agreement prioritises anti-corruption initiatives, transparency in tax matters and capacity building efforts to establish a transparent and predictable trade and investment environment. This Agreement has three main areas: 1. 2. 3. Preventing and combating corruptions and related to financial crimes Improving tax administration and transparency; and Co-operation, information sharing and capacity building. Through collaboration on these issues, we will create a more transparent and predictable trade and investment environment across our economies. Honourable Members, the IPEF Fair Economy Agreement offers Fiji a significant opportunity to enhance our economic framework, atttract investments and promote sustainable growth. This Agreement aligns with our commitment to transparency, fairness and good governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ratification of the IPEF Agreements will mark a significant milestone in Fiji’s commitment to regional co-operation and sustainable development. It will also demonstrate our strong commitment to the shared goals of prosperity and stability within the Indo-Pacific region. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move that Parliament approves that Fiji ratifies the tabled IPEF Agreements. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I have a list of speakers in front of me from the honourable Whips, as follows: 1. Hon. F. S. Koya; 2. Hon. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 723 3. Hon. P. D. Kumar; 4. Hon. Attorney-General and Minister for Justice; 5. Hon. I. B. Seruiratu; and 6. Hon. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am very happy to hear that the honourable Attorney-</p><p>General was distracted by us rather than him saying, ‘destructed by us, Sir’. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is quite a momentous occasion for all Fijians because as rightfully pointed out by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, this is an important milestone for Fiji that we need to get it through. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IPEF Agreement which we all know when it started, et cetera, and the trials and tribulations that they have actually gone through to get to this stage, aims to establish some very high standard commitments with respect to the four Pillars. As spelt out by the honourable Attorney-General, IPEF actually covers four Pillars and we must remember right from the outset that it is not actually a Free Trade agreement. But it is a stepping stone and a starting, I think, for many things to happen in the future, especially for Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important things that people forget, and I think everyone needs to be reminded, is that all of these 14 members tantamount to 40 percent of the global GDP, Sir, and that is 28 percent of the global goods and services trade. So, you have got some fairly high- powered people and countries that are actually part and parcel of IPEF. We are the only SIDS country that sits at the front table when we were invited from the beginning, so we should be very proud of the fact that we, Fiji, is a part and parcel of that particular 14 countries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand also how the negotiations have gone on, we have kept a track on and I think if I remember correctly, right at the outset, beginning of post-election, I had a quick word with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications to say, “please, keep an eye on this because it is very important for Fiji.” He has done so, and I thank the honourable Minister for all the hard work that is going on, especially the hard work that is being done by the Trade Team at the Ministry of Trade. I know they have worked very long hours to get through this. It has been literally done at a great neck speed because the USA has insisted, and I understand the level of travel that he has had to go through to actually get all of these things done. This is one of the reasons why we were asking for your Ministry to get more money so that you get all of these done. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were quite a lot of negotiations around the world with respect to all the four Pillars that has actually happened. The first Pillar that was alluded to was on Supply Chain Agreement in the States in May 2023. Pillar II has also been signed now by the 14 IPEF Partners. Basically, Sir, there is another portion to it which is the Overarching Agreement that also exists which looks at establishing the IPEF Council and a Joint Council and formalising the partnership between the 14 countries. There is a Clean Economy Agreement which was also mentioned. The main objective of that is to accelerate clean energy transitions in scale and reduce the cost of innovative technologies. All of these also bodes well for Fiji in terms of the diversification that we talk about in terms of wanting</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>724 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 21 st May, 2024 to make sure that we reach the milestones that we do in terms of SDGs. So, it has many, many tentacles to it that reaches different parts of our economy, different parts of our plans and different parts of our development. As I have said, and I cannot say this enough, and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has pointed out that this is such an important Agreement to Fiji and we are wholeheartedly supporting it. The other issue is with respect to the Fair Economy Agreement. With that particular portion, Sir, this actually focusses on preventing and combatting corruption, improving tax administration and transparency and promoting cooperation amongst the partner countries. I had pointed out yesterday, Sir, this was one of the reasons why such an institution of FICAC is so important to this particular Agreement. They keep an eye on it, they want to check with respect to our corruption, et cetera, the tax administration we have had for many years and I had a quick conversation with the honourable Minister of Finance today regarding the situation with the European Union and us being blacklisted. We are still blacklisted in the EU, so it becomes a huge obstacle. This is a phenomenal and fantastic steppingstone for us for bigger and better things with respect to this particular economic framework. All the necessary steps have also been taking place. I understand all the legal framework, the legal scrubbing, and this is actually for a trade agreement is being run in record time. We have had assistance also, I think, from consultants, et cetera, but our team, I know, and a massive, massive congratulations to the team at the Trade Unit. They have done really, really well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be said that these are a bunch of young people, very young Fijians who have been part and parcel of this particular negotiations. I know for a fact that we have had consultations with the Solicitor-General’s Office, the Office of the Attorney-General, FICAC, et cetera, in terms of the negotiations and the legal scrubbing that actually has to go on, the stakeholder consultations had been wide and varied, so all of these things and all the Ministries have been consulted on this. We have had consultations with the lawyers, accountants and also the UNDP. Basically, when the honourable Minister went the last time, I know he was very well armed with respect to ensuring that all the consultative processes had taken place. One of the most important part of this particular IPEF infrastructure, Sir, and I am sure the honourable Minister will explain, is that we also get to a stage where there is support being given to particular infrastructure projects and these projects could mean some rural infrastructure projects, funding support, whether it is to do with garbage refuse, whether it is to do with Water Authority, whether it is to do with zero carbon, et cetera. As I said, it has many tentacles that touches every part of every Fijian’s lives. There are many hydro projects, so projects that may come out of this and it is being wholeheartedly supported. There is a Climate Tech Trek also that exists within it. I understand the Ministry has submitted quite a few projects onto that particular site where they may get assistance. I think someone already has begun. There are some female entrepreneurs who were ready to be assisted, but I am not sure how far that has gone, but that was from the private sector. It is not just the Governments that were involved in this, some of the large US tech companies are actually part and parcel of it. They provide training, et cetera, for many of our SMEs that want to be a part of it. Mr. Speaker, that is a bit of a background on it, what people must realise is as I said right from the beginning, this is massively beneficial for Fiji and this is why you saw me stand up and second the motion and support this. We know that this is very important and the way forward in this,</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>21 st May, 2024 Ratification of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework 725 following the substantive conclusion of the agreement, upon the conclusion of this legal review of this Agreement, IPEF members are undertaking their domestic processes, we will have to do so also for signature ratification, et cetera. I understand it has been scheduled for the 5 th and 6 th June in Singapore. In this regard actually we are wholeheartedly supporting the Minister going across to ensure that the ratification process take place. Mr. Speaker, the framework is a significant step also in our regional cooperation. It promotes our economic prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and it actually enhances Fiji’s international standing. You can be assured, Sir, that every person that actually goes there feels extremely proud because we are a massive company, the only Small Island Developing State that was invited to sit at the front table to do this work. It is a big tick for Fiji. This agreement will continue to dedicate and advancing the economic interest of prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region for all of us. Well wishes to the honourable Minister for the ratification process. We are wholeheartedly supporting this. I know there are one or two other speakers from this side who want to support it. Best wishes to you, honourable Minister and full support from our side. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion that is before Parliament and also to thank the honourable Koya for seconding the motion. It is obvious that he is the only one qualified to second this motion as he had done a lot of work in the initiation of the work that has led to us debating this motion before us today. On 23 rd May, 2022, leaders from 14 Indo-Pacific countries announced the start of talks towards launching negotiations on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. Fiji fully supports the vision of a greener global economy, as articulated under IPEF. That aligns with the 2050 Strategy for the Bule Pacific Continent, emphasising the need for nations to coexist peacefully and to collaborate on trans-boundary issues, including climate change. To realise this vision and respond to climate change, substantial investment in infrastructure and innovation is imperative. Our firsthand experience with the effects of the climate crisis underscores the urgent need for coordinated action. Investment in resilient trade-related infrastructure, such as the Trans-Pacific Submarine Cables being installed by Google is crucial for our economic growth and regional economic integration. The agreements forged and partnerships established through IPEF are pivotal to enhancing our integration into the global economy and advancing the goals of the Blue Pacific Continent. The IPEF Agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises the different levels of economic development and capacity constraints of IPEF member countries and makes technical assistance and capacity building an integral part of IPEF. The Ministerial Statement that honourable Koya delivered also acknowledge and seek to address the challenges linked with maritime connectivity which is also critical to Fiji. I acknowledge, honourable Faiyaz Koya for his participation in the formulation of Ministerial Statements in September 2022 in Los Angeles, USA. I acknowledge the efforts of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade honourable Manoa Kamikamica in taking up the mantle and continuing IPEF negotiations over the last 17 months. Some do not agree with acknowledging the work of previous governments but that is a short-sighted view because the duty of each successive government is to build on the achievements of previous governments - after all, none of us will rule forever. As Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, upon invitation from President Joe Biden, I joined the APEC Summit held in San Francisco in November 2023. At that meeting, IPEF partners</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>726</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>21 st May, 2024 announced the substantial conclusion of negotiations on the Clean Economy Agreement, Fair Economy Agreement and the Over-arching Agreement for IPEF. The first IPEC agreement on Supply Chain was negotiated in May 2023. Together with IPEC partners, Fiji signed the IPEC Supply Chain Agreement in November 2023 after it was unanimously approved by this august Parliament in September 2023. The motion before Parliament today relates to the Over-arching Trade Agreement for IPEF, and the other two pillars on Clean Economy Agreement and the Fair Economy Agreement. To formalise the partnership and ensure that a durable structure exists for future cooperation at the Ministerial level, the IPEF Partners negotiated an overarching agreement on the IPEF. That overarching agreement establishes an IPEF Council and Joint Commission. The IPEF Council will consider matters affecting the collective operation of the agreements as well as considering the possibility of adding new members or new agreements. The Joint Commission will monitor work under the agreements to identify ways to reduce duplication and potential conflicts and enable work between or across those agreements. To ensure the effective implementation of IPEF initiatives, Fiji will establish a special Implementation Body at the national level, involving both private and public sector stakeholders. The Implementation Body will then commence preparatory work to fully participate under the IPEF Agreements, including through private sector engagement and proper planning for the utilisation of technical assistance and capacity building activities provided under the Treaty. In conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ratification of the Overarching IPEF Agreement, the Clean Economy Agreement and the Fair Economy Agreements are timely and imperative. We find ourselves at a juncture where adapting to changing circumstances and ensuring the effectiveness of policies is of paramount importance. As we navigate the complexities of open market trade policies, escalating maintenance costs, and the profound economic impact of COVID-19, it becomes evident that our trade criteria must evolve to better serve, not only our nation as a whole but our partners and stakeholders who play a huge role in ensuring our success. I invite all honorable Members to support and engage constructively in this process, as we must together ensure that our trade policies remain responsive, inclusive, fair, and sustainable, serving the best interests of our beloved nation and its people. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to the Parliament. May we continue to work collaboratively for the betterment of Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- I must apologise that we never offered you the, these are two new ones for your information. It was sighted by honourable Naupoto during our trip to Australia. So, we had them made help few honourable Member in delivering their speeches. It is just lying there. Maybe we have been having a change of our Orderlies on this side since the passing of Lemeki. Again, vinaka vakalevu and before I offer the floor to honourable Premila Kumar, can I just do some housekeeping here and this is another suspension. (Laughter)</p></body>
