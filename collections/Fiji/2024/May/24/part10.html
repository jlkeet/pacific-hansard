<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for the week and also those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. Year 8 Students and Teachers – Marist Brothers Primary School Honourable Members, this morning, we are joined by the final lot of Teachers and Year 8 Students of Marist Brothers Primary School, and also the Under18 Rugby Team from Bucalevu Secondary School. Sitting amongst the Marist Brothers Primary School Students is one of my grandchildren, Pita Mawi. Welcome to your Parliament. His Excellency the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China Honourable Members, I also welcome His Excellency the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China and she is accompanied by the Third Secretary, Dr. Angela Li. We welcome you warmly to the Parliament of Fiji. Thank you for your presence and making the effort to come and witness for yourselves how our Parliamentarians conduct themselves. At times, they behave like children too and are at each other’s throat, debating. Children, this is where laws are made - laws are enacted, laws are amended, and laws are repealed as well. That is the core function of the honourable Members here. There are 55 of us, including the honourable Prime Minister who is sitting amongst us, sometimes everyday, when we sit and conduct our meeting. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I also welcome the two groups from the two Schools and remind the students from Bucalevu that when I was there, the oldest boy was under 14</p><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>905 years. From 1958-1961 so when you go back to school, know that someone from that school can end up sitting here or here.</p></body>
