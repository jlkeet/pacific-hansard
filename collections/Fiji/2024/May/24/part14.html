<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister, SDG 11 is about sustainable cities and communities and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister gave us a long statement the other day about how Government is approaching the implementation of SDGs. Additional to the SDGs, the Environmental Management Act also specifically has clauses on solid waste and liquid waste. While you are providing details about how solid waste are being handled, there is a big problem that we face in our communities and, particularly, in our towns and cities on liquid waste. My question is, how are you addressing this issue and, of course, how are you also, in collaboration with other stakeholders, looking at ways to address the concerns? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition is a very valid one and it is something that the Ministry is currently considering. Waste disposal is really a big issue right now in Fiji, not only within the Municipalities, I think all over our country.</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>929 The Ministry is currently reviewing the system that we have to ensure that we address all these areas. We are even having consultations with the Department of Environment, as well as other stakeholders, even with the civil society organisations, on how we can better manage this issue because if you look at it, there is no central body or authority that manages the issue of the waste management in Fiji. That is something that we are seriously considering and with Cabinet approval, it is something that we are also going to consider, to ensure that we take into consideration all the different types of waste - green waste, also waste from factories, including liquid waste, Sir. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- A follow up question, to the honourable Minister, Sir. He just mentioned that there are Municipalities and Councils that have money and, therefore, that money is used to provide that service in the rural areas. My question to you is, why are you using ratepayers’ money to provide services in an area where households are not paying any rates to the Council? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Member for her question. In fact, the issue of these bigger Municipalities subsiding or offering services to the extended boundary is something that took place during the previous Government’s time. Even those are the questions that were asked by ratepayers; why do we have to subsidise or pay services for those who are not within our Municipalities?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It was subsidised by the Government:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. K. NALUMISA.:</span> So that is something that we are also looking at now and we are also going to consider that, may be reviewing so that we transfer this back to Government to look after the provision of services or financing of services to areas that are outside the boundaries of these Municipalities. Foreshore Development Lease Processes (Question No. 94/2024) HON. S. S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources inform Parliament on the requirements and procedures used by the Ministry to issue 5-Year Foreshore Development leases? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I echo the sentiments of Parliament in congratulating Suva Grammar School for their 60 plus four years anniversary that they are going to be celebrating tomorrow. Many years ago, I think, over two decades ago, I hunted down a lioness, so I am now part of the pride there, Sir. (Laughter) The ladies from Ruku ni veidakua are also in yellow today and they acknowledge the contribution of Suva Grammar to national life, but you will see that the RKS boys are also wearing their distinct tie. You can see the yellow is part of it, they are also honouring Suva Grammar School’s 60 plus four years of anniversary. Mr. Speaker, to begin with, I would like to just probably highlight some of the developments that happen in our foreshores which necessitates the leases and licences that are issued to it. They include tourism businesses, foreshore development lease, jetties when it becomes necessary to construct, wet leases in our mangroves and marine conservations, for example, the one that we</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>930</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 presently have in Naitauba Island and, of course, where there is a need to have filming consent, such as the shooting of the “Survivor” Series and “The Love Island”. There are six main steps in the process of applying for foreshore lease or licence, with a meagre application fee of $30. I think it is time to review that because of the extent of economic capital that is usually driven into these sorts of projects. Step 1, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, of course, the acceptance and the vetting of the application and the checklist. I am sure the honourable Kirpal would know and would have already seen. This information is readily available on the public portal of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources. Step 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, involves the consultation and consent of customary fishing rights owners. This is a responsibility of the applicant to ensure that they go out and obtain the necessary waiver from those who enjoy the fishing rights over the foreshore that they have applied for. The consent waiver of fishing rights is then checked against the records that is held by the iTaukei Land and Fisheries Commission, commonly known as the Veitarogi Vanua, and once 60 percent of that is confirmed, then that particular step is satisfied. Step 3, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the applicant for this foreshore development is required to submit a determination screening of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the development from the Department of Environment. Step 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the determination of compensation sum for loss of customary fishing rights. This is the process where the Director of Lands requests the Director of Fisheries to provide a quotation on the total logistics and cost necessary for the team to conduct a fisheries survey and to compile a report, determining the quantum that might be due to the iTaukei Land and Fisheries Commission that has registered the customary fishing rights to the custodians. That payment is made into a trust account once that step is completed. Step 5, Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon completion of all the Steps 1, 2,3, and 4, a submission is then made to the Minister for Lands, requesting approval for publication in the Gazette to publish a public notice as mandated under section 21(2) of the State Lands Act. The second publication in the government Gazette is followed by 30 days objection period where members of the public, and this provides the check and balance within the system, they are invited to submit objections to the Office of the Minister for Lands should they wish to do so. At the end of the objection period, all objections are collated and submitted to my office, and that would also include the final brief from the Director of Lands and his team. Step 6, of course, is the decision-making step where the Minister, if he or she says that the development would infringe more on public rights to the access of the foreshore, they have an opportunity to appeal against that decision. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the developers are unable to complete their development within that five year term because once they get a lease, then they seek finance from financial institutions. My question to the honourable Minister is, whether the Lands Department screen or check the financial status of a developer because most of the time we have seen that when the developer gets a lease, he then seeks loan from financial institutions? The second question will be whether the foreshore development lease can be sold? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much. He is already in breach of the Standing Orders. He is asking two questions in one question. He should know very well that</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>931 he is entitled only to one question. So, I will answer only the first one. MR. SPEAKER.- We have just gone through Standing Orders review, that is why he is so informative now, and as a lawyer, he is telling you that you have breached Standing Order. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at times, these sorts of ambitious foreshore development does surpass the five years. I have not had that experience and I am sure honourable Kirpal can ask the experience of the previous two Ministers of Lands, they have had experiences such as that, but I am sure that it does happen because there are some developments that do, of course, run past the five years. However, what I think is central to determining whether you should renew the development lease is to see how far the work has progressed. If no work has progressed and if you look at the financial viability of the company or the developer and you are not satisfied that they can push the development further, then of course the Minister has every right not to renew it. But if there is substantial work that has been done on the ground, there is promises in the completion of the development. There is funds available, there are construction material that is also able to complete the work, then of course, it brings a huge economic benefit to the country and also to the locality. Those, I think, are the ones that the Minister would approve to have an extension of their development. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in terms of foreshore leases, a lot of the times when Fisheries Impact Assessments are being done with respect to the compensation to the landowners or the owners of the qoliqoli at that particular time, the experience from before tells us that not always does the landowning unit accept the valuations, et cetera and the work that has been done by the Ministry of Fisheries, and they object to it. My question is, do you have an alternative channel of people who do Fisheries Impact Assessments that can assist the Ministry of Lands, or is it strictly only the Ministry of Fisheries that does Fisheries Impact Assessments? Remember Sir, there are landowners that object to the Ministry of Fisheries doing it for reasons best known to themselves. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can only speak of my experience in the past 17 months. It is only been with the Director of Fisheries and I have not had any experience where Qoliqoli owners have not been satisfied with the quantum that have been levied by the Director of Fisheries. MR. SPEAKER.- I want to adjourn Parliament now and before doing so, I would like to thank the former students of Suva Grammar School for coming in numbers to today’s Sitting. A big vinaka vakalevu to you. I just can recall when the primary school was up here somewhere and the boarding school for boys was still operating from where we were told yesterday by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs. That building is now going to be known as the Fiji Arts Gallery, is it honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. VASU.:</span> Sir, it is the Fiji Arts Council.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> It was the old boarding school for boys, that was Grammar. It is a history of the development of even Suva. They are moving down to Veiuto, you still exist as a very well- planned development, the roads, et cetera, and for you to come in and grace our Parliament, we are so blessed and so happy. Once again, we wish you well in your celebration. Vinaka vakalevu. The Parliament is now adjourned for lunch, and we will resume when the bell is sounded. The Parliament adjourned at 12.42 p.m.</p><div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div><p>932</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 The Parliament resumed at 2.35 p.m. Initiatives to Promote Economic Diversification (Question No. 95/2024) HON. T. N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on what initiatives the Ministry is undertaking to promote economic diversification? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the very good question raised by honourable Tunabuna, and before I do response, I was in a deep thought when I was listening to the words of the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, on the discussion that happened with regards to a challenge that is in front of us. The word I thought about was ‘boldness’.’ With what is happening in our country, it requires is to be bold - bold in the effort to address the challenge of drugs, as well as in our endeavour to rebuild the architecture of the Fijian economy. Thus, hopefully, my answer today will shed some light on where your Government is headed, in terms of its desire to diversify the economy in Fiji. There are so many things to talk about, I will just pick on a few, hopefully, to give an idea to the honourable Members of this august Parliament and to the people of Fiji of where we are headed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for far too long, talks of economic diversification have existed, without much action taken. The Ministry which I lead has taken it upon itself to undertake concrete initiatives to expand and diversify our Fijian economy. We have established a Commercial Agriculture Taskforce to support the diversification and expansion, specifically, focusing on attractive investors into the agricultural sector and, hopefully, aquaculture as well. Recently, I led a delegation to the inaugural Fiji-North America Business Mission, which was held in Canada and the USA. The delegation consisted of Government agencies, the private sector and some of our very own exporters. At that Business Mission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Water formerly announced that they are exploring commercial agricultural opportunities to Fiji. They also have made an announcement in the papers over the last few days, and this had been made possible by the close collaboration between Fiji Water, the Wonderful Company, the Commercial Agriculture Taskforce and the honourable Prime Minister, as they explore the revitalisation of agricultural commodities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to say that this announcement can potentially be a game changer for Fiji in commercial agriculture. On the back of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can also advise that there is another investor seriously looking at commercial agriculture and they are currently based in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and are already in discussions with Fijian Holdings Limited and Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF). Another thing that I thought I would share when talking about commercial agriculture, for those of you who may have noticed, just recently, FNPF and the Bank of the South Pacific (BSP) joined forces and are now joint shareholders in a company called Future Farms Pte Limited. That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a signal to the rest of Fiji that two of our largest institutional investors are serious about commercial agriculture in Fiji. And for those of us who can remember, when FNPF decided to start investing in tourism, the results are also shown for us to see in what happened many moons ago. I think the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation will</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>933 remember when that actually happened. Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on, we are also genuinely working on building our kava industry through the established Kava Taskforce, which is being led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways. It should come as no secret that the kava industry is anticipated to be a billion-dollar industry in the future. This was also confirmed by various actors in the kava sector in the United States, whom I had met along the margins of the recent Fiji-North American Business Mission. During the mission in California, we heard firsthand from kava importers, distributors and members of the different kava groups who promote and sell kava, the potential that exists in kava. With kava evolving from being a commercial ceremonial drink to the development of different ways to drink kava and have niche kava products, we need to develop and strengthen standards, the legislative framework to protect our kava industry and strengthen the quality of kava exported from Fiji. We need to ensure the right legislative framework is in place, and which is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are pursuing the Kava Bill and hope this will move things forward. Apart from kava, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a bit of focus going on in noni, ginger, turmeric, mahogany, and fisheries potential, as part of our desire to diversify and, Sir, it will probably surprise you that the noni industry, globally, is about US$2 billion, and there is some more potential. Turning to the Nutraceutical and Traditional Medicine Industry, with the rapid growth of globalisation, we need to be innovative with our approaches to generate new opportunities for our economy. To this end, we are also trying to further develop our nutraceutical and traditional medicine industry, including medicinal cannabis. We are leading a Cabinet-mandated taskforce which is exploring the establishment of medicinal cannabis in Fiji, and with the support of the Australian Government, a feasibility study has been undertaken and I will be reporting back to Cabinet soon on the results and, therefrom, hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can start developing the legislation to actually start this industry. In terms of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said quite a bit in the last few days of ICT, suffice to say that with the entry of Google and Starlink, we have a major potential in the ICT industry in our country. At lunch, the honourable Attorney General introduced me to a couple who are currently doing good work in Levuka and they are IT experts. They have only but reaffirmed my expectation that there is massive potential for our country and for the Pacific for that matter, in the ICT. Just for some additional information, Google is going to invest about $200 million in Fiji to create its own data centre. This will create that pathway that we all expect, that will happen in the ICT sector. Of course, as I have mentioned, education is key. The Government has already partnered with USP in trying to look at developing the ICT sector, and I hope to expand more on that in the near future. Sir, the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Industry is another of those industries that is starting to gain momentum. It was 3,000 people before COVID, it is now at around about 8,000 people, and these are some of the things that we are focussing on, Mr. Speaker, in trying to deliver a diversified Fijian economy. Of course, we are also focusing on trade agreements. We have talked about and ratified the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Agreement. We are in discussions on Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus with the Australian Government and also closely looking at the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) as well, Sir, in terms of what that can do for Fiji.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>934</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 Finally, Sir, there is a big commitment in the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) sector and cooperatives. I feel that if we actually develop some of these sectors well, we will put the country in a very good footing in terms of economic diversification. Sir, I also welcome the comments made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. He was keen to, sort of, see how he could get involved in terms of agriculture and also sugar, and I think, hopefully, with the brief time that I have had, I have shared with Parliament and honourable Members of this Chamber, some of the serious efforts that are going in, to ensure that our economy is genuinely diversified which will create jobs and get more taxes to be able to battle some of the challenges that we have, as mentioned by the honourable Minister for Home Affairs. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Very quickly, honourable Minister, I think you have heard all of these before but your neighbour and brother, the Deputy Prime Minister, will support this, in terms of diversification, and I spoke about this morning. One of the areas that Fiji could really benefit out of is sustainable aviation fuel. I think it helps the sugar industry to get a better price for our sugar by producing more ethanol. Is this an area, honourable Minister, that you will be concentrating on heavily to ensure that we actually get into that particular space? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is interesting that you mentioned that, honourable Koya. Again, I have been reaching out to various consultants just to get some contacts on various industries. I met two gentlemen from well-known authorities in terms of sugar and what they said to me was, “A sugar industry based on global prices alone is not sustainable”. So, to your point around developing value-add products, such as ethanol, to be able to assist with aviation fuel and other products, or other value-added potential, is worthwhile pursued, we certainly support it and we will actually try and do our best to work with the honourable Minister for Sugar to see what can be done. The consultants also did tell me that in some parts of the world, sugar is looked at as an energy source, not as a sweetener of food. When you think about it that way, you do understand that there is a lot of other potentials in the sugar industry, and we are certainly going to ensure that, that is pursued as well, as part of the economic diversification strategy. HON. F. S. KOYA.- A quick follow-up, Mr. Speaker, if I may, in view of what you have just said and in view of what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation and I witnessed, the European Union (EU) has entirely backed Africa with respect to this, and they forgot about the rest of the Pacific. So, will we be engaging with our development partners to seek assistance that can put us in this space quicker and sooner than we anticipated? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- I did mention it in terms of the Trade Agreements, that we are seriously looking at signing up to the interim Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU and I think once that is signed, it will make some of the conversations around sustainable aviation fuel a lot more easier from our development partners’ side. I hope to bring to Cabinet very soon the justification around why we should join ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) and as you know, Sir, even in terms of PAFCO, it is uneconomical for them to export to the EU because of the 35 percent tariff that is currently imposed because we are not a signatory to AIPA. Once we unlock AIPA, I feel that some of the things that you have mentioned will be very doable.</p><h4>MR. CHAIRMAN.- There being no further supplementary questions.

J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources inform Parliament on all Groundwater projects that were to be drilled and reticulated in both, large and small islands in the 2023-2024 financial year, to include the following information - (a) (b) (c) the budget of each project; the date each project was or is scheduled to be completed; and the percentage completion of each project?
