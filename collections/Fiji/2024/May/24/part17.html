<body><h3>REVIEW OF SALARIES AND ALLOWANCE –MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND EXECUTIVE OFFICE</h3><p>REVIEW OF SALARIES AND ALLOWANCE – MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND EXECUTIVE OFFICE HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Wednesday, 22 nd May, 2024, and sections 3, 12 and 13 of the Parliamentary Remunerations Act 2014, I move: That Parliament debates and approves the recommendations in the Report of the Special Committee on Emoluments which was tabled on Wednesday, 22 nd May, 2024, and that this determination to take effect from 1 st August, 2024 and expire on 31 st December, 2024.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity to elaborate on the Committee’s Report and the recommendations contained in the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to reiterate in this Parliament that the Special Committee on Emoluments was formed, firstly, by a resolution of Parliament on Wednesday, 12 th July, 2023 and that was resolved unanimously. As I had alluded to during the tabling of the Emolument’s Committee Report on Wednesday, 22 nd May, 2024, due to the non-inclusion of other Offices such as the Office of the President and Office of the Speaker, as well as the review of the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989, an amendment motion was later moved to rectify the anomalies that were previously not included and, again, this was unanimously passed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned, a second motion for the review of all the Offices mentioned above was moved by the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament, seconded,</p><div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 953 and debated and passed as a resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023. As all honourable Members are aware, during the tabling of the Emoluments Committee Report, the motion was seconded by the Committee Member from the Opposition because this was a bipartisan Report and all Members of the Committee had discussed this together and came up with a final decision, following the discussions and the recommendation from the independent consultant. The independent consultant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an experienced former Parliamentarian from abroad and was hired by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), through the Parliament Support Project, to assist the Emoluments Committee to do an independent analysis and comparisons between the Fijian Parliament and other jurisdictions. The Emoluments Committee met on several occasions and looked at the relevant laws, as well as the report from the consultant, before coming to its final decision. The Committee also listened to the submissions provided by different political parties represented in Parliament and called for briefing as well from the Pensions Office for the Members of Parliament (MPs) who are based at the honourable Prime Minister’s Office. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now go into the Report, and I will explain, discuss and address some of the decisions taken by the Committee which is as follows. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the discussions or the recommendations on the salaries: 1. 2. 3. Salary of the President The current salary is $130,000 and the Committee endorsed from the Consultant’s recommendation that it be $185,000 non-taxable. The Head of State, we believe, deserves a salary that reflects the post, which is both, ceremonial and has legal decision-making authority. Salary of the Prime Minister The current salary at $328,750, is now being reduced to $320,000. I apologise, honourable Prime Minister. The reduction from the previous salary by 2.5 percent is in comparison to the salary of the Chief Justice. Both posts are Heads of Branches of Government – both Judiciary and Executive and have the full authority and responsibility to manage and deliver programming. Salary of Ministers Currently, we have four Ministers that sit on a different band of salary. The Minister of Finance or the Minister for Economy as stated in the Act, earns $235,000. The Ministers for Education, Health and Infrastructure earn $200,000. The remaining Ministers earn $185,000. The Consultant recommended that all Ministers earn a salary of $200,000 and these posts have the capacity to make legally binding decisions and are fully autonomous in their decision-making. It is important to note that this was considered by the Committee, that even some of our Permanent Secretaries are earning more than the Ministers in our Ministries. My Permanent Secretary earns $190,000 and I have been on a reduced salary for the past three years to $148,000. Other Permanent Secretaries range from $190,000 to $250,000 - a quarter of a million dollars that the Permanent Secretaries earn more than their Ministers. 4. Salary of Assistant Ministers The Assistant Ministers currently earn $90,000 and it has been recommended and endorsed that they earn $120,000, an increase of $30,000. The Assistant Ministers engaged with the highest and second highest civil servants in their respective Ministries, therefore, they should</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>954 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 5. 6. 7. receive a salary commensurate. Of course, as you compare it to Permanent Secretaries, it is still quite low. This is what was recommended, and we have endorsed it. Salary of Speaker Currently sits on $150,000. It has been recommended and endorsed to earn $220,000. The Speaker is the Head of the Legislative Branch of Government and, therefore, the role is important, and the salary should reflect the gravitas of the post. Salary of the Leader of the Opposition Currently earns $120,000. We have endorsed that he earns $200,000. This is a constitutional office, and he also acts as the Shadow Prime Minister while representing Fiji in international platforms, along with the Speaker and the Prime Minister. Salary of Members of Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently they earn $50,000. We have recommended and endorsed that they earn $95,000. Of course, this is almost a double in salary. It is important to note that the last review of Members of Parliament salary was in 2014, which is now 10 years later. This has not been done for 10 years. Each of these posts involve a significant level of autonomy in decision-making and each has the requirement for legal and policy analysis, and general management skills. Fiji is an open constituency, therefore, all the members who were sworn in as MPs have added responsibilities which is allowed to them to be other office holders, for example, in their own political parties. So, it comes with responsibilities as well to their constituents. On to the allowances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allowances that is currently in the Act for the President so all of those positions, I will be referring to the United Nations Daily Subsistence Allowance (UNDSA). UNDSA x 50 percent + $300 for the Office of the President. Again, we have seen because of the position that the President holds and the international engagements that he engages in with other Heads of State around the world, we have increased it to 150 percent and remained the $300 incidental. The honourable Prime Minister (my apologies again, Sir) currently he is on the UNDSA x 250 percent + $600 daily allowance and this has been massively reduced. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to UNDSA x 200 percent and no daily incidentals. The Ministers have all been reduced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the Act says UNDSA x 200 percent + $500, it has now been slashed to UNDSA x 150 percent. The Assistant Ministers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has also been reduced. They are currently on UNDSA x 100 percent + $300, which is now being reduced to more than half - UNDSA x 125 percent. The honourable Speaker is currently on UNDSA x 100 percent + $300 and, again, for being the Head of Legislature, honourable Speaker, with your engagements globally, this has been increased to UNDSA x 200 percent + $300 incidental. The honourable Leader of the Opposition is the same as the Ministers; UNDSA x 150 percent. Members of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were at UNDSA x 100 percent + $200 incidental daily. This has now been recommended and endorsed at UNDSA x 125 percent only, so no daily incidentals.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 955 There are some additional benefits that are being proposed here. For the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers, the provision of a tax and duty free purchase of a vehicle. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this benefit was in place prior to 2007 and should be reinstated, given the amount of travel incurred in our role, as well as the eligibility would be one vehicle per term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation about Government Quarters in Suva, the Ministers and Assistant Ministers is recommended to have access to Government Quarters in Suva as a form of accommodation at the same rate as civil servants because according to the Ministry of Finance’s Offices Accommodation Unit, officers in the Civil Service stationed temporarily in Suva can access Government Quarters at 10 percent of the market rate. The same benefit should be available to Ministers and Assistant Ministers if they wish to utilise this form of temporary accommodation in Suva. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Speaker of Parliament, as well as the Leader of the Opposition, it is recommended and endorsed that official residency be available for both officers. Prior to 2007, there was an official residence for the Speaker of Parliament, and this should be reinstated. In many jurisdictions in the Commonwealth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it provides an official residence for the Leader of the Opposition and this benefit should be extended to the Leader of the Opposition here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the MPs’ travel and Committee sitting allowance, the status quo remains, there is no change to that. However, the only change is to the accommodation allowance because of the impracticality of the 30 kilometre radius, where it is a 30 kilometres radius in a straight line. We have recommended and it has been endorsed that this 30 kilometres apply by the most direct route by road, but if you are being accommodated outside of your normal place of residence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the constituency allowance of $15,000 allocated to each MP where currently, it is $10,000 a year, it is recommended and endorsed that the full amount be given to MPs in order to carry out their constituency work. The initial idea and thought was that the political parties needed funding in order to also operate but as we all know, this allocation is being covered in the yearly budget of $325,000 per Party and, therefore, this allocation is to go to MPs to be able to have the freedom and the autonomy to decide how they go about their constituency work, so to give the full $15,000. Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, medical and life insurance does not exist, but this should be a benefit not only offered to the Civil Service, but should be extended to all MPs as well, given the duties required for your post and the high risk related to extended travel. If an MP wishes to continue to make premium payments on any life insurance policy after you leave office, then that option is available. But this coverage is a maximum of $100,000. Maternity leave, Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently does not exist, but Parliament should establish a system for maternity leave. This is to entice more women to seek elected office, and this should be given in line with the national system for such benefits. Mr. Speaker, Sir, gadgets that are given to MPs at the beginning of their term to enable them to do their work, it is endorsed that Members are entitled to keep the provided gadgets after the end of the Parliament term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are allowances now recommended for office holders within Parliament. It is recommended and endorsed that the Deputy Speaker of Parliament receive an annual allowance of $15,000, because it is a significant role in the parliamentary office, for the Deputy Speaker presides in the absence of the Speaker.</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>956 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 It is also proposed that the Leader of the Government in Parliament receive an annual allowance of $7,000. The Leader of the Government in Parliament is a key player in organising and coordinating the business of Government for any parliamentary sitting and in other parliamentary events. The Leader of the Government in Parliament also has the procedural role during sitting days, and also in important parliamentary days, such as the Opening of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is endorsed that the Party Whips be given $5,000 allowance annually. This particular position is significant in the daily functioning and during Parliament sitting, and also for organising the Members for any parliamentary duties. The Deputy Whip, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been endorsed to receive a $3,000 yearly allowance. The Deputy Whip assists the Whips in fulfilling their roles and duties. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now go on to the review of the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act 1989. Since July 2018, there have not been any substantial changes to this Act. The Committee, through its deliberations, recommended that there should be amendments made to the Act, as to align with the evolving economic status and social practice of the country. The Committee has collectively made the following recommendations, and we support the recommendations by the Consultant in this report: Eligibility for the Maximum Years of Service Currently, it sits at 15 years. This has now been changed or reduced to 12 years. This is because the terms of Parliament now stand at four years. So, instead of the five years in the previous Governments, so that was three terms, it is now four years, so 12 years is consistent. Double Dipping Issue In the Act, it is not clear as to whether or not an MP who retires or leaves Parliament, receives an allowance and then subsequently, when they get re-elected can collect the allowance while also holding that post. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have revised the Act to prevent an MP who, returns to Service in Parliament, from receiving that allowance while currently serving. Severe Disability There is no provision, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for anyone holding that has a severe disability, who becomes severely disabled before reaching the age of 55 years, to apply for and receive the full allowance. And we are recommending that the new Act should allow that former MPs with severe disability to receive full allowance prior to 55 years of age. Ineligibility for Conviction Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act is unclear as to whether or not a former MP who is eligible for this allowance would be entitled if they were to serve a sentence for bribery, corruption, or such a conviction, will make the former member ineligible permanently. A secondary question is whether or not a conviction for bribery or corruption should be linked to the member’s work as an elected official, or if any conviction, no matter the relevance to the elected post, is enough to make a former member ineligible for allowance? Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been recommended that if the former MP is convicted of bribery or corruption related to their time as an MP, then they will lose the retirement allowance permanently.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 957 Otherwise, they lose the allowance while they serve their sentence. So, this needs to be clarified and something to be discussed further. Spousal Eligibility Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act is clear, only a person who was a spouse to a member while they were elected is eligible for the reduced rate of allowance after the member’s death. However, if the member remarries after retiring and the first spouse pre-deceases the member, should the second, or third, or fourth, or fifth spouse have a right to a portion of the allowance? Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no change to the current rules. Allowing second or post-MP’s spouses to receive an allowance will create an unnecessary level of anxiety and complexity to the allocation of allowances. Spouses who were married to an MP when the MP was serving in office are entitled to a constructive trust and, therefore, some of the allowance earned by the MP. Administrator for Retirement Allowances Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act defines the Administrator as the Secretary to Cabinet, or some other person appointed by the Prime Minister. However, as the allowance is for MPs and most elected officials, should the Administrator be a staff person of Parliament? Recommending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we revise the Act to designate the Secretary-General to Parliament as the Administrator of Retirement Allowance. Qualifying Salary Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the current Act, the salary that is the basis for calculating the retirement allowance is the salary the MP was receiving in their final year of elected office. This can result in an MP who has had a larger income, for example, for being a Minister or Leader of the Opposition, and then reverts back to a singular role as an MP, their allowance is calculated, if they exit Parliament, based on the salary of an MP, as this was the last salary. As I had mentioned, it is not based on the highest salary received by the MP, which has an impact on the final calculation of the retirement allowance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are proposing that the new Act should calculate the annual salary for allowance purposes based on an average of the three best years of the higher salary in which the former Member earned. Retroactivity Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the Act has two application dates - the original from 1989 which states that the allowance is only eligible to a member who has been an MP since 1970 and has attained four years of service. The Act was amended in 2016 to reflect the new 2013 Constitution in which MPs elected under that Constitution may only serve three years and six months for the completion of one term in office. If the formula or other aspects of retirement allowance are amended, should the Act apply to those who are already receiving an allowance, or only to those who will receive their retirement allowance in the future under a new scheme? Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our recommendation that any retroactive application of legislation is considered bad form. In this case, all new provisions should apply to those who are currently sitting MPs, and any subsequent elected MPs, moving forward from the date of the promulgation of the new Act. Re-drafting Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned, this is quite an old Act. Since that time, the format and quality of legal drafting have evolved, and the question we ask was, does the Act need to be fully re-</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>958 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 written to reflect these new drafting standards and to make the Act more easily interpreted and understood by beneficiaries? It is our recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we draft a completely new Act. Allowance as a Source of Income Currently, the Act is silent as to whether or not the retirement allowance assigned to a former MP or person who held a qualifying post is considered ‘income’ for purposes of using such an allowance to secure debt or a loan by the former MP. Now, de facto, the allowance is not considered income and, therefore, is not assignable, except for specific exceptions, and cannot be used as collateral or security for a loan or other debt instrument. It should also be noted that the allowance is tax free, according to the Act and, thus, is not considered income for tax purposes. This needs to be clarified in the Act, Mr. Speaker, it needs to be specified that the retirement allowance is not income and cannot be assigned or a lien placed upon it, except as related to debts owed to the State, or for settling a divorce, or to provide child support. Eligibility for Qualifying Posts Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the remuneration scheme for MPs is amended to separate salaries for MPs from additional salaries for Ministers, Assistant Ministers and other leadership posts in Parliament, should the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Act apply to only MPs and the salary attained as an MP? If so, what additional allowance, if any, should be allocated for those who assume such leadership posts in Government and Parliament, in addition to their MP duties? Mr. Speaker, assuming that the remuneration scheme is amended to have all MPs receive an MP salary, and those who take on leadership posts to receive a separate allowance for that work, it is recommended that the new Act only apply to MPs, Leader of the Opposition and Speaker. Eligibility for Minimum Time Served Mr. Speaker, the Act allows for two separate minimum levels of service for those who hold a qualifying post. For those who serve from 1970 to December 2006, the minimum year of service is four years, equivalent to one term. For those elected after 2014, the minimum time served to be eligible for an allowance is three years and six months, equivalent to one term. Mr. Speaker, Sir, should a former MP be eligible for an allowance who may have served for a period shorter than that term – they have come in for a month, for a day, for a year, what should apply? We are recommending, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the new Act should state that any MP who has served in Parliament for any amount of time should be eligible to the retirement allowance. Eligibility – Maximum Time Served Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already mentioned that it is 12 years, instead of 15 years, and I had stated why. Eligibility Age at Retirement Mr. Speaker, this was quite a sore point and I know this was for younger MPs who are under 40 when they came into Parliament. The Act allows for a full allowance when you have attained 55 and for those from 40 to 55, you have a pro-rated basis. Mr. Speaker, the Committee is recommending that it should reflect a broader scope of who is eligible for retirement allowance. So, an MP over 55 years receives the full amount. Any MP between 40 years and 55 years has a pro-rated allowance, and any MP under the age of 40 years receives 3.33 percent less than the age category of 40 years to 55 years. So, they are receiving something, it is not</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 959 a full amount because we acknowledge the workable years left when you are younger. Independent Review Process Mr. Speaker, we also recommend that there be an independent review process, moving forward. We recommend that an Independent Remuneration and Allowances Tribunal be established to make the determinations with regards to MP benefits and salary. Allowance Formula Mr. Speaker, the current formula is quite complicated. I finally grasped it, so we need to simply it. But we are recommending that the formula to be calculated for the allowance for an MP, as follows – 1/12 years x average annual salary based on the best three years, the highest salaries you received, by the number of years of services as an MP. So, simplifying the formula to be calculated. Mr. Speaker, the Committee agreed that these issues be raised because these are pertinent for honourable Members. I want to also state here that the 20 percent pay cut on all honourable Members that was imposed during COVID-19 is still not restored. So, all these salaries that I have mentioned that are currently under the Act, they are all reduced by 20 percent, and we have been receiving that for the last three years. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recommend that that be restored also. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members of the Committee, I want to thank our Members. I now request all honourable Members to support the motion and adopt and approve the recommendations in the Report of the Special Committee on Emoluments which was tabled on Wednesday, 22 nd May, 2024. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate. HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have not prepared anything to say and only to raise my complaints. I know, everyone was going up. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had some exchanges in the media, as well as the social media, and some members of my Party have been pretty vocal and urging me, and I assured them as Minister responsible for Parliament that I would be guided by my oath which I swore on Christmas Eve 2022. I remind those who are pointing fingers at me and saying that it is not the right time and why am I doing it when I am in Parliament. My oath, Mr. Speaker, Sir is very simple. I, Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka, being appointed as Prime Minister, swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Republic of Fiji. And that I will obey, observe, uphold and maintain the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and all other laws of Fiji, and I solemnly and sincerely promise to uphold my office with honour, dignity and integrity; to be a true and faithful counsellor; not to divulge any secret matter; and I will devote myself the wellbeing of the Republic of Fiji and all Fijians; to protect and promote their rights and well and truly serve the Republic of Fiji and the Office of Prime Minister. So, those who are in my Party who have been pointing fingers at me and urging me not to do anything, it is not for the Party, I am speaking on behalf of the people of Fiji and all of us are people of Fiji. I am glad that my salary is reduced because I can vote with a free conscience on this one, that I am not looking after my own interest, and I urge all honourable Members to do likewise. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu, Sir. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute to the motion before us. We know how important and, of course, how sensitive it is as well. But before I go into the motion itself,</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>960 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 I wish to remember the late Pastor Vuli Waqa, I think he had his funeral today, he was well known in athletics, and we do convey our deep condolence and sympathy to the family. In contributing, I also declare my interest. I have two, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because this affects me and, perhaps, I will speak on behalf of all the Parliamentarians on this side because it affects them as well. I do declare my interest before I proceed further. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said in the social media, comments by political parties who are not in this Parliament and, of course, other stakeholders who have an interest in this issue. That is why I stand here, on behalf of the Parliamentarians of the FijiFirst Party, to also share our thoughts on this issue. As I have stated from the very beginning, Sir, this is not an easy matter to discuss because it affects us. But at the same time, let us be fair and let us be honest on ourselves as well and I would like to speak on behalf of my Members, particularly, given what we have experienced while we were in Government and, of course, now, in the Opposition. Perhaps, I do not only speak here now, being in the Opposition, but I speak on behalf of Parliamentarians who will come after us, either on that side of Parliament or this side of Parliament because elections will determine which side of Parliament we will sit on and the benefits that do come with it. We live in a benefit-oriented society, that is a fact. Of course, it is critical that we look at it not only for now, but also for the future. Not only Parliament, but Government as we have always discussed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has to be seen as an equal employment opportunity provider and, of course, an employer of choice for all Fijians. I hope that the conditions and the environment that is created here will, somehow, set the standard in order for us to entice well-qualified professional people out there in our communities, in the private sector and in the public sector, who have aspirations to be an honourable Member in the future, and this is something that we need to look into as we are deliberating on this issue. We know for a fact that some have to make sacrifices, on both sides of Parliament, coming from a better job, better conditions, better pay, but being patriotic and passionate about serving for the country, most of us do join this august Parliament as Members of Parliament, but the fact also remains that we are all human beings. We are all part of our community. We have needs, we have wants, some have mortgages, we have relatives, we have our commitments to our churches, and these are all facts of life. I remember very well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the advice that you gave me when I first joined Parliament in 2014 when every now and then, so many people are queuing up here. You gave me a very good advice that I will not forget because people do come expecting a lot from you when you come with that beautiful suit, entering this Parliament, and they know that you have a deep pocket. That is a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, when we are making our contribution, we are considering those issues. Very briefly, we are just fulfilling the process of Parliament, that is what we have done. It was moved in July 2023. It was again discussed with another motion from the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament in September last year. We are completing that process, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance specifically stated then and I will not read the Daily Hansard that I have here before me, based on the system that was used previously, I do not want to bring that up, let us put it to a Committee, bring independent consultants and in the end, as he specifically stated, it will come back into Parliament and we will vote for it, and</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 961 that is exactly what we are doing today. It was initiated by Government for whatever reasons, for whatever motives behind it, it was an initiative of Government. So where do we stand now? I wish to raise that question to Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are just simply completing the process and the continuation of that process will depend on the decisions that we will make today. I thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection and also Chairperson of the Committee for the submission. I have been briefed by our Members of the Committee as well. It is unfortunate that perhaps, not all the discussions involved during the deliberations is in the Report and that is where perhaps, listening to her concluding remarks, if continuing discussions and negotiations on some of the pertinent issues that still have not been resolved will continue, that is something that we will forward to. But there were some issues as well that we raised, we understand the democratic process, but it was put to vote, et cetera. We lost out on the vote since, but it is for fairness sake and transparency, it would have been good, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if all the deliberations, the discussions and the decisions are reflected in the Report because we are concerned, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before this debate takes place today, information is already out in the social media. We are concerned, that is not fair, Sir. It was a decision of Government, all the Parties on the other side are part of Government, we in here are also part of the institution in here, but only FijiFirst Party’s contribution in the Committee was out there in the public media. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise here my disappointment and I also wish to raise my concern. It is unfair, Sir. It has been pulled out, again, perhaps by the National Federation Party. As I have stated this is your initiative, this is the process that we are completing. It is unfair when our proposals were only put up as if all the decisions in terms of salary, allowances, et cetera, all came from FijiFirst. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise that issue. I am disappointed and I am concerned because that should not happen. Where is the confidentiality of the processes that we have. It is out in the public, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that to me is very concerning.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is part of the Report:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will talk on our submission because it was out there in the media. This is why I chose to speak. I was not comfortable because, as I have stated, I have declared my interest, but I have to speak on behalf of our Parliamentarians. We did a very thorough research before we took our presentation to the Committee. Whether the independent consultant considered that or benchmarked from it, that was entirely up to the Committee and the consultant, and I thank our Members who were involved in our research. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had some discussions about the Office of the Opposition and the things that need to be addressed in that, but I will go back to the issue. We prepared well before we went to the Committee, as required by the process. We were all to make submissions. The NFP had their submission, People’s Alliance had their submission, SODELPA had their submission and so did we. We made our submission, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not talk about that in detail, we looked at all the other jurisdictions, but the most important thing out of the submission is the base salary for an MP. We discussed that</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>962 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 in Australia, Sir, because in other jurisdictions, you start from the base salary of an MP. Then the other responsibilities are added on to you as an MP, and then the terms and conditions and the benefits come with it. So that is where we should all start off and that is where we also came in, in terms of our recommendations - the base salary for an MP. As I have stated, I am not only speaking now as being here in the Opposition, because come 2026, you will be here on this side of Parliament. In terms of fairness, that is where we should all start from, and then we looked at other jurisdictions. From there, Assistant Ministers and then Ministers, and then the honourable Prime Minister. In some jurisdictions, they have special salary packages as well for Deputy Prime Ministers, but in our case, that is where we started from - the base salary for our MPs. I will not repeat what the honourable Chairperson and the Leader of the Committee has already highlighted about the salaries, allowances and other benefits, like tax, and quarters access, but let me say here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, when it was done, we looked at the salary and the other benefits. But now, a lot has been added into this because in terms of housing, you are given a reasonable salary, so then you can look after your housing, your medical, other bills and, of course, communications where we are given all these gadgets. But that was how it was worked out previously. As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and this is why it would only be fair if the other comments from the other side can also be heard in here and that is why I was insisting that their contributions in the Committee be also included in the Report because that is how we will gauge and be able to judge how the Committee and the independent consultant came up with their final decisions and, of course, the recommendations that are here before us, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the independent consultant, I am told that he was the same one used by UNDP when the Parliament Remunerations Act was drafted way back in 2014. So, in terms of the Report of the Committee, I would say that it is credible because it has gone through the process that was agreed to in the September sitting last year and, of course, that has come back now into Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question that we have now is, are we going to accept this Report that was initiated by Government? The question of timing has been raised. However, the other question that I would also raise with the honourable Minister of Finance is, how is the Ministry going to implement, subject to the decision of this Parliament today, the recommendations that are in the Report? Are we going to continue to discuss further on some of the recommendations that are here? So, do we have the funds for this, Mr. Speaker, Sir? As I have always stated, the bottom line is growing the economy. We are still waiting, and I am still waiting, but I am told that the recommendations of the Economic Review Report has come out today, as we are gearing up towards the sitting of Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, let me just go back to the submission that we made, particularly on the base salary for MPs. That is, perhaps, what I call a decision that will be strategic as we move forward from here. I know that the honourable Minister for Education experienced this in his three months as an ordinary MP - from a Cabinet post to an ordinary MP, that is what I am talking about because we, on this side are the only MPs who are not Ministers. All on the other side are Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the basics and the strategic decision that we must take today is, the base salary for all MPs. Of course, Sir, we look forward to the decision and the guidance of Government on this motion that is before Parliament.</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 963 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try and be brief but before I actually speak about the motion itself and the position that the National Federation Party (NFP) took in terms of our submission, I just want to remind the honourable Leader of the Opposition that he is, sort of, wishy-washy in saying that it is a Government’s initiative. I think the initiative came from Parliament and the Opposition Members also agreed that the best way to move forward is to look at an independent Emoluments Committee to address this issue. On the issue of FijiFirst or NFP’s submission getting covered by the media, in fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s information, the submissions of all the Parties were part of the Report and the moment any report is tabled in Parliament, it is a public document. The media covered NFP’s position, FijiFirst’s position, it was part of the report. (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was part of the report:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, now, when the report is out there, any report that goes on that table, is immediately a public document which included all Party submissions. Therefore, the media picked up all the submissions in the social media, including NFP as well. What is wrong with putting your submission and our submission? We put our submission, we put their submission, they want to hide their submission from the public? (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- That is what they are saying. It was about transparency and accountability. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not get round this and ask, “Who put it there? Why?” Everyone’s submission is there, it is part of the report, it is a public document. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- No! (Hon. P. D. Kumar interjects) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- It is not a crime for NFP people to pick up FijiFirst’s submission and put it out there, or NFP’s. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Shame on you! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- And I want to thank the honourable Prime Minister for his contribution about conscience. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I want to say is, on behalf of the five Members of the National Federation Party who are in this Chambers, we made the Party’s submission, and the submission went through the Party’s Management Board and the Working Committee, and that submission was a directive by the Party.</p><h4>When the report was presented to Parliament 48 hours ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we said very</h4><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>964 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 clearly that the content of the Report is noted, and the debate on the Report will be at a future sitting of Parliament. We looked at the content of the Report, Sir, and we were going to take that Report back to our Management Board and our Working Committee to be able to take a position as far as the Report is concerned and the recommendations in the Report. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Committee was formed in Parliament, I said that I want to quit, but that does not mean that the Parliamentary Emolument’s Committee itself will make an assessment because the principle is that we cannot determine our own salaries and allowances. The idea, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, was to get an independent consultant and, in fact, an independent consultant committee, perhaps, should have made the recommendations to the Emoluments Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as our Party’s constitution is concerned, we cannot meet the requirements of the Party’s constitution section 63(1) and subsection (h) and (i) of the 2013 Constitution because if the Party provides a directive - the Party Management Board and the Working Committee, we cannot go against that until we go back and get their direction. What we are saying is that, of course, we can argue about the increases, the relativity, and I am happy that my salary is going down, but that is another issue. Therefore, we cannot support the recommendations in the Report as it is because we have to go back to our Party, to our Management Board and to our Working Committee, to make the decision. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our position on this matter is in accordance with the directive of the Party and, as I have outlined, this should not, in any way, be construed or misinterpreted in terms of our position and as support to the honourable Prime Minister and to the Coalition Government. As I have said, and let me repeat this, the honourable Leader of the Opposition cannot shy away from the fact that what he was trying to imply was that this was the Government’s initiative, this was the Parliament’s initiative, this was the Opposition’s initiative…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Yes, of course.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> …and Parties made their submission. And when the report</p><h4>was presented to this Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was a good process.</h4><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Once the report is made public in Parliament, you expect debate to be on that, and that is our position, Sir. We can argue about the merits and demerits, and I heard what the honourable Leader of the Opposition said. When we were sitting in the Opposition for eight years, the salaries and the decisions that were made in 2014 before the first sitting of Parliament was made by a decree. That was the last decree, which set the salaries of the Ministers, the Prime Minister, the allowances and for the Opposition. When we had another committee of that Parliament looking at the allowances, et cetera, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would recall, that we took a different position and we actually voted against the increase in allowances in 2016. That is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our position and we, at this point in time, cannot support the recommendations of the Report or the Report itself. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to give a short contribution. I thank you for allowing me to speak on this motion and as one of the Committee Members, the only thing</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 965 that I would like to raise here and which I was not in consensus with when it came to the Committee as well (unfortunately, that was not reflected in the Report) is the pension issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been representing the youth because I entered Parliament at the age of 30 years. I am into my third term now and I am 40 years old. I think it is discrimination against the youth who are categorised and would not be getting the full pension just because they entered Parliament at a younger age. We do understand that they have a good number of years to go if they retire from Parliament, but that does not mean that we do not give them the full benefit of what someone can attain after coming into Parliament after the age of 55 years. So, as a youth representative for the past 10 years in Parliament and as a youth MP in this august Parliament, I think it is an injustice, and that is something that needs to be reconsidered. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request honourable Members in this Parliament and because most of them sitting here are above the age of 55 years, please, let us not discriminate our youth but entice them to come to Parliament. On pro-rata basis, it is not worthwhile because the amount of time and devotion, the amount of work they do for the four years they are in Parliament is the same as any other Member of any age category sitting in this Chamber. I have that reservation and I will go along with that reservation. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- I will just leave the message delivered by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, and he said and I quote, “this reflects the Opposition” because the report is there, the report is out too. It is, perhaps, better if I just give the floor to the Madam Chairperson for her right of reply. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members, including the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition for their contributions. At this point, I just want to highlight as I had stated in my presentation, that there are certain aspects of the Retirement Allowances Act that we have endorsed that does need further discussion, if we were to make changes to the Act. So, that is something that can be considered that has been stated by honourable Maharaj. As I reiterate, your concept about having a prorated amount, it is just like in any other workplace, in fact, if you leave other workplace for civil service and other places, you do not get anything, you will wait until you are 55 years. So, if we are trying to apply the principles of equal opportunity employment in Parliament, then we should adhere to the principles of retirement and the need to have a secure future for those that are over 55 years, and you cannot make that comparison really if you are younger because of the workable years. That is how retirement is calculated, that is where the independent consultant came from when he did the independent assessment, and that is how the Committee agreed to it that, that should be the case. But other than that, like I said, there are features that I have mentioned in the Retirement Allowances Act that requires further discussion but they would require the changes to the Act. So, we can discuss that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an entire Parliament. Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to take this time, again, to thank the Parliament staff for their hard work, as always, supporting the work of the Committee. I think it is often understated, but at this point, I do want to say, “vinaka vakalevu”. Thank you very much for your support to the work that was done by the Committee. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- When we finish with the process that is now before us, then I will seek your indulgence, honourable Members, some of my experiences in the past review of allowances, we differ a lot, I even wrote to the former Speaker on that as the President of the Party. But having this Report</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>966 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 here before us now, Parliament will now vote on the motion. Question put. Votes cast - 40 Ayes Noes - 7 Abstained - 5 Motion agreed to. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as indicated by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics, he wants to take this back to their Management Board, as probably directed in their Party constitution. In the increase of the allowance when FijiFirst was still ruling then, the Committee chaired by one businessman and former MP from Nadi, Mr. Sanjeet Patel, delivered their report in this august Parliament. I was not in Parliament then because I was suspended, but we were sitting in our office – the SODELPA Headquarters - myself, even the present Prime Minister, and a few other Party stalwarts, when we were told that that was the result of what transpired in this august Parliament. They voted in favour of the increase. The very same thing is coming out of the papers now, honourable Leader of the Opposition. The timing is not right and everything, we are still suffering, we have just come out of the woods, and we are not fully out of the woods yet, and the debt level was increasing, we raised all those in our protest letter to my predecessor and leading the SODELPA then, as the Leader of the Opposition was Ro Teimumu Kepa and the Whip was Mr. Tikotikoca. It came, but no reply was given to our protest letter. So, it was time for me to rejoin Parliament. I came in, joined Parliament and the allowances then were so high. Then there was shortage of Members in the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, so I was asked. They all looked at me and said, “You are not part of any Standing Committee, might as well take this up”, so I took it up. In attending the Standing Committee on Public Accounts meeting for the first time, I was given my cheque. When I looked at it, I was so astonished. It this real? Honourable Bulitavu told me, “Yes, that is real, Sir.” Our going into and be part of this Committee and accepting the new allowances, which we were against, this saw to the demise of our Party. Not really demise of the Party, it is still alive, but some of us had to leave because the injury was there. You people were against this, now you are reaping the benefit of what we had agreed to. Those were the words floated around here. It was $2,000 plus in a week, that is huge, but that is it. As the honourable Leader of the Opposition said, this is the process that we have here. No matter how you want to style it, how you want to do it, this is how we do it. When I protested and said, “I am the President of the Party and I do not like it”, they did not want to take heed of what I was complaining about because the Leader of the Opposition then and the Members of the Caucus decided on things that happened in this august Parliament. Again, after reading the papers this morning, I was quite shocked as well because of the innuendo that was going in and out from this side, the National Federation Party was making some comments with a picture of the Deputy Speaker on it, but that was picked up from the Report because the Report has gone out. No matter how you want to do it as well, the Report has gone out. You will</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 967 say that there is quite a lot of leakages here but no, leakages happen all the time. Even the honourable Prime Minister is sometimes shocked because the leakage comes from Cabinet Office to us outside of the Cabinet Office. So, this is an old problem that exists within us because we are just human beings. We can be sitting here and agreeing to something, yet we disagree when we go out. I told the honourable Leader of the Opposition, “Whilst you are still a Member of Government and an MP, do a lot of savings whilst you are still there because the day you finish from Parliament, you walk the streets tomorrow, no one will give a damn about you.” This is in all honesty, and that is why the honourable Leader of the Opposition was saying for you to do your savings and keep it aside. The honourable Minister for Education came up with some ideas on his own, he forgot about us, but we learnt that he is doing this - he did some extra deductions to his FNPF, and we all followed suit. That is our only savings. Your FNPF as an MP, that is your savings. Unless you want to take it, that is your choice, but to rely on whatever income you get in the bank in trying to visit your constituency where you will be subjected to all kinds of kerekere, you just have to fork it out from your own pocket. By the time you finish, you do not have anything with you. We even went further. This is from the former Minister for Education when he told me one day, “I will be your campaign manager”. I said, “No, I do not want to go into politics because my father and grandmother were both politicians here”. We have learnt a big lesson. We just look at the material things. There was none. The car is a very old car. There was no house in the urban area, only in the village, but they serve their community well. Honourable Members, that is all we are here for. We are here to serve, but when opportunities like this arises, for me, in listening intently to the honourable Chairperson, I was taken aback when she apologised twice to the honourable Prime Minister when they reduced his pay and allowances. Maybe, that was his decision or his plan, I do not know, but it has come to light now. We can only hear and talk about that when we are provided with that kind of information. It is finished now. The complaints will keep on coming until the cows come home, but they are not here to serve. When we go out, you are expected to do a lot. The honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection just mentioned that the Girmit Festival that they undertook recently, quite a lot of donations mostly came from donors who are willing to give. Otherwise, my poor honourable colleague would have suffered a lot if she had to dig from her own pocket. Honourable Members, the rest of the questions that were raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition have been answered briefly by the Chairperson. It can be an ongoing exercise and that is for you to decide. The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance has decided that it is a Party’s decision. So, there is 44, and we will just have to go along with that. That is the decision you have made, honourable Members, whether it is strategic or whatever, that is the decision you have made. Now, the issue raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, again, do we have the ability to pay and when will this kick in? That is for the Government to decide. We are not going to be making decisions here, no, only in the Budget, it will be brought before us here. This one here is a separate one. We have been hearing lately about the Corrections Service (Amendment) Bill 2024 that was presented by the honourable Attorney-General. He talked about the very thing that we are addressing here - an increase in their pay, increase in their uniform, there are so many things that were addressed.</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>968</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 The Fiji Water people went on strike in Nadi and they received some 26 percent or something. The honourable Minister for Labour knows that very well. This is an ongoing thing; it will never end. That is all that I want to share with you, honourable Members. I am sorry and I must apologise, on behalf of the Secretariat, there is no tea being prepared, no dinner being prepared, and we work so hard to try and keep abreast with the changing decisions being we made from the Government’s side - do this, wait for this, and that is why we had to send the flying Minute across at midday today, to ensure that we comply with the time requirement, et cetera. Once again, thank you very much.</p></body>
