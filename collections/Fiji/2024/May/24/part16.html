<body><h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3><h4>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO. F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, under Standing Order 6, I move: That so much of Standing Order 34 be suspended so as to allow the Chairperson of the Special Committee on Emoluments to move her motion today.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. AV.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as indicated in Standing Order 6(1), and I quote: “A Standing Order may be suspended in whole or in part only by leave of Parliament. That l results in Standing Order 6(2), and I quote: “…which will result in the suspending of a Standing Order in whole or in part, must not be moved except with the Speaker’s permission…” We have done that.</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>952 Review of Salaries &amp; Allowance – MPs and Executive Office 24 th May, 2024 Then Standing Order 6(3) and (4) states, I quote: (3) “No amendment to a suspension motion may be moved and no debate is allowed on it. (4) If Parliament grants leave on a suspension motion, the Standing Order concerned is suspended.” That is what we are putting into effect in order to suspend Standing Order 34, which specifically guides us on Parliament business. When you look at Standing Order 34 in terms of the motions, they are either moved under Clause(1)(n) where it states: “motions moved by members of the Business Committee that relate to sittings and Parliament business”, or under Clause 1(o): “motions for which notice has been given”, or under Clause2(a): “the Business Committee determines otherwise”, and that was the case in terms of the motion I am moving today. Thank you. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments to add.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to:</span></p></body>
