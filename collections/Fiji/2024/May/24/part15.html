<body><h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3><h4>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with a 10 minute response by the Minister responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate. I now call upon honourable Koya to deliver his End of the Week Statement. Transparency, Accountability and Judicial Independence HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to give my End of Week Statement on Transparency, Accountability and Judicial Independence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the interpretation of the law is a must and must be met with sound understanding of the law and, especially, in an unbiased manner to basically ensure that the integrity of the judiciary is upheld, Sir. Why I say this, Sir, is that we need to understand this particular concept so that we can ensure if anything is untoward and it is rectified quickly, and from what we have heard in this past week, it would seem to me that the honourable Attorney-General and the Government is working to further building the integrity of Government and the Judiciary. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to quickly talk about transparency, accountability and judicial independence, as I have said, as I feel this is something that needs to be said so that the people of Fiji can understand the importance of how it affects their daily lives. Allow me first to explain one of the pillars, Sir, and I will be succinct. In terms of transparency, this talks about the accessibility and openness of Government. This allows everyone the ability to see what the Government does and is doing and that the law and their rights are being upheld, and this is very important as it will build trust between the people and Government, and it also prevents corruption. In terms of accountability, the Government has to be held accountable for their actions at all times. Both, elected and non-elected people of Government, have a responsibility to explain their decisions and actions to the people of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This powerful tool is used to keep public officials</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>936 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 in check, and also used to prevent the abuse of power. It is also important to build the people’s trust in Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In terms of Judicial independence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is very important because it is there to maintain the independence from the two arms of Government. Judicial independence is vital for the upholding of justice and the rule of law, to ensure that cases are decided fairly and the constitutionally protected rights of the people of Fiji are intact. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may quote the honourable Attorney-General this past Thursday where he said, “the integrity and effectiveness of a judicial system is paramount to the health of our democracy and the wellbeing of our society”. Let me build on this, Sir. The essence of democracy lies in its transparency and accountability and those in power with respect to the people that they serve. Transparency and accountability is actually demanded by law, and our democracy needs to ensure that the three arms of Government remain completely independent. We cannot allow for the blaring of the lines for any reason, even especially if it is politically motivated, or for any other reason. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last 12 months or more, maybe about 17 months, crime in Fiji has skyrocketed. No one is putting a blame on anyone, but it has skyrocketed. So, it is actually good to hear that the honourable Minister for Justice, along with the Judiciary has worked to expand the Courts - the Nadi Court, the new Lautoka Complex and established new court complexes around Fiji, to empower the Judiciary to expedite the backlog of cases. With the rise of the use of methamphetamine in Fiji, we can only expect that there will be a plethora of cases that will clog the Judiciary in months to come. As we all know, the honourable Minister for Home Affairs is actually working very hard to ensure that the Police are empowered to ensure that all those are those people who break the law are brought to justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to remind the honourable Minister to, please, remember that some of the planned refurbishments and constructions that were put on hold, were put on hold because we went through a pandemic, and that was COVID. It was not through any other reason, it was not through laxity, and I am not sure how much of that is falling on deaf ears. Projects were put on hold because our nation came to a standstill, and we needed to divert funds. When you look at these things, you have to put it into perspective. There was a lot that could not be done. We had the country to look after, and all of those such projects were put on hold. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for any democracy, especially like ours, for it to stand tall, we need to understand the concept of legal precedence, and this needs to be maintained at the highest level. It is precedent that ensures that cases are decided in a similar way that will lead to a stronger and more predictable legal system. It is this that sets the tone for our Judiciary, and it will help the people of Fiji better understand the potential legal consequences of their actions. Therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir, one must be very wary that precedent is something that you do not play with, as it will have a major role to play when it comes to the doctrine of stare decisis and the erosion of this particular doctrine in Fiji is a bit of a worrying trend, Sir. It undermines the core principle of law and the predictability of legal interpretation in the country. To have a strong and fair Judiciary, we need to ensure that consistency is adhered to and will promote consistency in the application of the law. Where would it be abiding precedent or a persuasive precedent, we must understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that precedent plays a vital role in legal systems and other things as we do in this Parliament. We have followed a lot of precedents that you, being a very senior member, have told us about it, and we have followed, Sir. It promotes</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 End of Week Statements 937 predictability, confidence, consistency and efficiency in the entire legal system. With respect to transparency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not just in the Judiciary but in Government itself as a whole, people need to understand that Government is a representative of the people and for the people. What we do in this august Parliament, Sir, what transpires in a Ministry and what happens in the Judiciary, is the right of that person or people to know. Most of these, sometimes, is taken care of by a lot of gazettes. It is a bit worrying that sometimes we do not get to see the gazettes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do have a lot to get through. The media also plays a key role to holding governments accountable and to ensure transparency. Only yesterday, we saw that some media outlets were bringing something up that was tabled, and it was only half sent out. That is not fair, that is not very unbiased. These particular outlets are bringing up something that was tabled and it is causing much debate in the nation. We will debate it today, Sir, and I am sure it will lead to robust debate, but we must understand that unbiased reporting is a must, where true accountability and transparency can flourish. Do not put something out just as a piece and half read it, and say, blame someone about it. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! HON. F. S. KOYA.- In fact that particular report that I am talking about, Sir, had independence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is alarming that when people are unhappy, they use the media to push their narrative, and even have stories sidelined because it exposes the half-truth about their narrative that they are pushing. One thing I do hope, Mr. Speaker, is that editors and publishers will push their reporters to start doing this and follow-up on stories. If it is an ongoing story, to build on the story, not just report on just one part or part of it. When you look at it from a global perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, different countries are at different stages in terms of transparency, accountability and judicial independence. Some countries, like Finland and New Zealand, are often cited as examples of countries with high levels of transparency and accountability. On the other hand, there are countries where those principles are constantly under threat due to various aspects. It is important for us to learn from the successes and failures of other countries and adapt those lessons to us in Fiji, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing, maintaining transparency, accountability and judicial independence is not without challenges. This can range, as I have said earlier, from corruption to lack of resources, political interference and lack of public awareness about people’s rights. To overcome these challenges, it is important to strengthen the institutions that uphold these principles. We need to promote education and awareness about the importance of these principles to the public. It is important that everyone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is held accountable, and it is paramount that people understand that accountability is the key to a strong and fair judiciary, and a government. Mr. Speaker Sir, as a citizen of this country, it is our right to have access to information because we are free and in an independent country, and that is the quote from Thomas Jefferson and should reverberate in everyone’s mind. This is so true; it is our right to have access to information and it is important that Government ensures that they are transparent in all that they do, but at the same time, as the great Nelson Mandela said, “the time has come to accept in our hearts and minds that with freedom comes with responsibilities”. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>938 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very important topic and I share the sentiments of honourable Koya that, indeed, transparency and accountability are noble principles for any democratic nation to uphold and promote. However, you are measured by what you do, not by what you preach but what you actually do. Mr. Speaker, Sir, two weeks ago, I was invited by the Fiji Media Association on the International Press Freedom Day. I was a bit surprised or probably shocked when it was revealed to me that I was the first Cabinet Minister to be invited to their function after 16 years. That means there was no media freedom in Fiji in the last 16 years. This Government brought light. This morning, we are talking about an issue that is concerning us. Why? Because people have the freedom to say it. Gone are the days where people were suppressed with fear. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you do not have to look far but look at this august Parliament. I look at my colleague, the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, the former Director for Legal Aid Commission. Apparently, on a working day, he took a walk from his office across the street, a court case was going on, and he stood there with other members of the public. As he stood by, he did not realise that he was standing opposite the Suvavou House where the Office of the Attorney- General is, he spoke to a few people and later on, because of what was going on, he heard a yaqona session at Level 5, his contract was not renewed soon thereafter. There were many others, Sir, I am one of them who is a living testimony. On 19 th April, 2020, I made a decision in Nadi and on the same night, the decision was asked to be brought to Suva to be heard in the appeal at 2.00 p.m. and at 10.00 a.m. my predecessor criticised me. I did not complain, I moved on. At that time, I did not realise that I will end up here. “Let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream.” People can now see that organisations operate on their own - independently, and that is important. I have another story, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of a former DPP who is a Sri Lankan National, as she was celebrating her birthday on a Friday, there was a knock on the door, “Lata, you are to leave the country the very next day.” That also happened to the former Chief Registrar, also a Sri Lankan national, so both ladies. Imagine if you are foreigner and a woman, and you face such circumstances. She was removed. Guess, who replaced her? Mohammed Saneem. The question I ask is this, why was Saneem appointed when there were more matured senior lawyers than him? Why? Does he have any connection with the Attorney-General? Was he destined to go and be the PS for Justice, and later become the Supervisor of Elections? They can come here and say things, but there are examples. History speaks for themselves, the people of this country and the whole world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was enlightened when I read Mr. Mick Beddoes comment last week in the papers, “Finally, we can see justice. You are never given an opportunity to explain when your contract is not renewed. We have now extended the contract of the Judicial Officers to five years from three years, so that we give them the security of tenure, so that they are not afraid when they are giving judgments. Did we intervene when we are not happy with the Court’s decision? No! I have to constantly remind myself, and I remember what I had said in the first Cabinet meeting, “our legacy will be to follow the due process”. That is the legacy. It is going slowly but we will end up there. Yes, I agree, there is a lot of work to be done. Mr. Speaker, Sir just before I sit down, I note that the other side was talking about accountability. Section 121 of the Constitution talks about the Accountability and Transparency Commission. Where is the Commission? We are now in 2024. All you have to do is set up a legislation, and we are in the process of doing so, Sir. (Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 End of Week Statements 939 HON. S. D. TURAGA.- We are! Where is the Commission?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You will complete it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> In Chapter 8 - Accountability. Where is the Code of Conduct that you drafted and submitted here in Parliament? Because it scrutinises the work of Parliamentarians? Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can come here and complain, but you are measured by what you do. I do not appear in the Fiji Law Society and lecture every lawyer, no, I do not. I respect them. HON. J. USAMATE.- I, I, I – I this, I that! (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- You listen! (Hon. K. K. Lal interjects) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- I am humbled, I am from Lomaiviti. Yes, I am proud to be from Lomaiviti. (Laughter) There is a lot of work to be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We must acknowledge that our country had gone through dark ages. As a lawyer, as a parent, for those in prison, for those graduates from Police and Correction Commissioners, we know that the system was toxic and it needed to be changed and that change came about on 24 th December, 2022. We are grateful. As I have said, we are thankful to the God Almighty. Turaga na Kalou, vinaka vakalevu na nomuni rogoca na nodra masu na lewenivanua o Viti, me vanua ena valuta na veika dredre. E taro tiko na Turaga na i Talatala; na cava na i tavi ni Lotu? Me vakararamataka na vanua. Na cava na i tavi ni Vanua? Me vakarorogo na Lotu. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our collective responsibility - all of us, wherever you go, to practice and promote transparency and to speak against drugs. Much has been said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I would like to thank Parliament. As shared by you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and by the honourable Prime Minister, there is some change. Yes, the wind of change is coming. We are thankful that we can actually take the time to ponder and discuss the national issues in a more pragmatic and practical way and create a new Fiji. Financial Assistance to Resource Owners HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, allow me to deliver my End of Week Statement in the iTaukei language.

HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank honourable Tuiwailevu for briefing Parliament about the resource owners and MSME investment bank now being implemented by Fijian Holdings Limited through Merchant Finance. The objective of the establishment of the resource owners and SME investment bank in Fiji is to significantly increase the wealth and participation of iTaukei and resource owners in economic activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Invexa Business Solutions was engaged in September 2023 and the final version of the report was endorsed by the FHL Board at the end of March this year. It has since been presented to me, and as had alluded to by honourable Tuiwailevu, I will submit the report to Cabinet. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conclusion of the Feasibility Studies is that there is a strong case for the resource owners and MSME investment bank and that Merchant Finance Limited is the right vehicle to set up a new resource owners and MSME dedicated division to achieve the objectives of significantly increasing the wealth and participation of iTaukei and resource owners in economic activities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, aligned to the feasibility studies, Merchant Finance has started the implementation of the dedicated resource owners’ division with the creation of a new team called Vanua Finance. The sole purpose of this team is making finance accessible to more iTaukei and resource owners’ businesses. Merchant Finance have also started their focus on the MSME by creating a new gender-based financing team called the Marama Finance. The sole purpose of this team is to make financing more accessible to women-owned businesses. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Vanua Finance team will be fully operational in June 2024 and will start off by using existing Merchant Finance products to serve resource owners. New products, especially for resource owners, will be rolled out to the market over the next three months to six months to manage the resource owners’ current demand for financing. Merchant Finance have already started focusing on resource owners, especially those planning to do land subdivision and have built a strong portfolio. The list is expected to grow as the Vanua Finance team spends more time with the resource owners. Merchant Finance has approved funding for three subdivision projects in the last month and more to be approved in the coming month. The Marama Finance team will be fully operational in June 2024. More gender specific products will be rolled out to the market over the next three to six months. Mr. Speaker, Sir, holistic approach is required to improve the livelihood of success for MSMEs and resource owners’ business. Capacity building is one aspect, and we also need to address monitoring and reporting functions. The Provincial Council Office, through the Roko Tui, the Mata ni Tikina and the Turaga Ni Koro will be tasked with additional responsibilities of monitoring and reporting of iTaukei and resource owners’ businesses in their own districts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Centre for Appropriate Technology and Development (CATD) in</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>942 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 Nadave will be enhanced to provide capacity building for resource owners running businesses, and also for the Provincial Office and their delegates. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the iTaukei Administration which has commenced will ensure that the appropriate infrastructure is put in place for them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude and as alluded by honourable Tuiwailevu, our Solesolevaki Framework ensures that the public and the private sector collaborate, and we will continue to embed this in our work because we need to improve the economic contributions of the iTaukei to our national economy. Vinaka vakalevu, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Rising Cases of Suicide in Fiji HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, life is a journey of self-discovery, a journey where we seek to find a purpose, a purpose where we were destined for. There will be good days and there will be bad days. There will be days where we will win, and then there will be days where we will not win. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it all comes down to how we take our failures. Many learn from them, and many are suppressed by their own failures. Mr. Speaker, Sir, failures and resentment take a toll on our mental health. Mental health is a state of successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people and the ability to adapt to change to cope with adversity. You never know who might be the people who are affected, who are suffering, because they are emotionally unstable, who are hallucinating and hearing voices in their own heads, who are having dark thoughts and those who have anxiety and panic attacks. People who experience depression and mental illness are more likely to suicide and this is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there should be more talk and more dialogue to normalise that these issues exist in our societies, especially for younger generations who have been victims to suicides. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it can be stated that globalisation is creating a significant toll on mental health worldwide. I would like to share some of the case studies that have been sent by various people in Fiji to me or some of the ways they have felt neglected, disappointed at a disadvantage, depressed, and even been the victims of domestic violence. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first case is where this person says, “I grew up feeling that I was neglected by my parents. I felt like I was not their favourite child. Now, that I am a parent myself, I am not repeating the same mistakes my parents made.” But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a two-way street over here. Cases of children facing neglect from an early age, there can be various reasons but on the other hand, parenting is not an easy task and no parent graduates with a degree to become a parent. Some things are done well, and some are not. The second case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is where a 65-year-old lady shares with me, “We did everything for our children, coming from an average family. But now, at this old age, they do not even call us or visit us”. Sir, parents and children share a very beautiful relationship, and we need to realise that both the sides need to communicate with each other and communicate to understand and clear misunderstandings. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other case is where a child gets bullied in school and gets into fights and does other wrong things in peer pressure. There are people who can relate where they have been bullied in schools, universities and in their workplaces.</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 End of Week Statements 943 Another case here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is where a youth shares with me, “My parents had high academic expectations from me. I got scolded at and beaten if I did not score the highest in my class. I wanted to do marine biology, but I was forced to become an engineer. I hate my job. I wake up every day and I have to go and do what I am not passionate about. I feel like I am dying from inside.” Sir, one thing to note, is that an increasing factor in youth suicide in Fiji seems to be parental expectations for academic achievement and students feeling that they have failed their parents if they do not succeed, as this was stated by the Ministry of Health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other case is the ability to endure toxic relationships and be victims of domestic violence. A lady shares with me and says, “I have endured domestic violence up to the fifth year of my love marriage. I have two kids. Sometimes I want to kill myself, but then, I cannot leave my children with this drunkard. I have tried leaving, but he would not let me. I have frustration boiling in within me and, honestly, it feels like a disease. It feels like I am being eaten from inside”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other case here is where a youth shares with me that she started dating in her first year of university. After seven months, her partner changed. She said, “He became really possessive and aggressive. I could not talk to anyone, not even to my own friends, or my brothers and sisters. When I left him, he would blackmail me for our personal and private photos, and I could not sleep for days. I felt helpless, ashamed and fearful. I could not even study. He would stop me in public or come and scream my name outside my hostel”. The last case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is where someone has shared with me and said, “I was internally broken. I thought getting into a relationship would fix me, and at the end of the new relationship, I broke him, and I made a hero into a villain.” So, if in doubt, is it important to check it out and the best approach is to communicate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 700,000 cases recorded globally. It is the youth between 15 years to 29 years, who have been the victims of cases the most. Fiji has a worryingly high case of suicide cases and in Fiji, the youngest person who committed suicide was a seven-year-old child. So, it is a worrying factor for the younger generations of our country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the helplines available today are – Empower Pacific 24/7 Counselling Helpline 5626; 1. 2. National Crisis Toll Free line; 3. Suicide Prevention 1543; 4. Child Helpline Fiji 1325; 5. Fiji National Domestic Violence Helpline 156; and 6. Lifeline Fiji 1543. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell these people, “All of you even have the numbers of us Members of Parliament, reach out, call us, because your problem is our problem, and through collective action, we will be able to combat this.” Even though mental health is a significant part of our life, it is considered taboo to openly talk about. I urge all honourable Members of Parliament to be strong advocates for mental wellbeing and endorse prevention mechanisms. We have to lead by example, and it is only through collective action, we can achieve this. I shared my views with the honourable Minister for Health earlier this week on this matter, and I am hopeful that there is a multi-sectoral approach from Government and a change of mindset in our society, which is key to make mental wellbeing and suicide prevention a high priority on Fiji’s</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>944 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 health agenda. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell the younger generation and the people who are suffering from high stress, depression, mental health issues and suicidal tendencies, that it is a matter of perception. When faced with a problem, challenge and stress, I would like to share in this august Parliament what a teacher once told me in high school, who said, “Rinesh, be so prepared that the problem is afraid to be addressed by you”, and that has stuck with me, Mr. Speaker, Sir. One must remember that carbon, under high pressure, turns into diamond. There is always a way and impossible is nothing, but giving up on yourself and your life is not one. Be ambitious, but not be overly ambitious. Burnouts will wear you out and slow you down. Small consistent steps are necessary for success, but I would say, if one finds being successful is easy, remaining successful is the ability to deal with stress, pressure and how one adapts to situations and challenges. When it comes to relationships, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the virtue of patience is important and communicating to understand. At times, when someone is not understanding something, usually when I try to explain something to my Mum, I have to explain it to her in a way that she understands. So, one can try and communicate in a way that other members absorb or take in that information. To the younger generations, do not be carried away by the likes, comments and shares you get on social media. Social appreciation does not really mean those people are really for you. If you want to know who stands by you, see that on a bad or rainy day. The greatest wealth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is having a healthy body, peaceful mind and the right people in your life. Rest, reset, restart, refocus as many times as you need, but ending your life is not a solution and our young people are being victims to this societal issue, Sir. So, indulge yourself with nature, start backyard farming and gardening, have pets, communicate with your loved ones and develop good habits of working out and getting seven to eight hours of sleep everyday, as these are some of the best long-term solutions for a healthier mind and life. With that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am looking forward to hearing the honourable Minister’s response and initiatives. Vinaka. HON. DR. RATU A. R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the End of the Week Statement by honourable Sharma on the topic of Rising Cases of Suicide in Fiji. It is, indeed, a good topic to discuss, especially within the walls of Parliamentary Chambers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, ‘Creating Hope Through Action’ was the triennial theme for the World Suicide Prevention Day for the last three years, and it is commemorated on 10 th September every year. The theme is a reminder that suicide is preventable, not inevitable, and it inspire the belief that our actions, no matter how big or small, can provide hope and positive directions to those who are struggling with suicidal thoughts. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)’s ‘ LIVE LIFE: An Implementation Guide for Suicide Prevention in Countries ’, any death by suicide is a deeply sad occasion. It is extremely painful for the close family members and friends left behind who cannot understand why it happened. Inevitably, their sadness is multiplied as they ask themselves, “What could they have done to prevent the untimely death”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, WHO estimates that 700,000 persons die by suicide each year globally, as</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 End of Week Statements 945 alluded to by honourable Sharma, and 77 percent all suicide occur in low middle income countries. Suicide is the fourth leading course of death amongst 15 year old to 29 year old worldwide and each one is a strategy with a far reaching impact of families, friends and communities. At the global front, reducing the global suicide mortality rate by one-third by 2030 is both, an indicator and a target - the only one for the mental health under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and, indeed, WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030. Current assessment suggests that the world is not on track to reach the 2030 suicide reduction target. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the WHO is encouraging countries to take action to prevent suicide through a comprehensive national suicide prevention strategy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, the suicide and attempted suicide statistics gathered by the Fiji Police Force in the last six years from 2016 to 2021, revealed a total of 1,476 suicide and attempted cases and deaths, an average of 2013 cases per year, with about half the number leading to deaths. The highest number of suicide and attempted suicide cases were recorded in 2019 with 244 cases, and the Western Division recorded the most cases every year for the last six years. We cannot and must not ignore suicide. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services has placed suicide prevention high on its agenda and it is committed to transforming its efforts to implement effective actions to prevent suicide. These efforts are aligned to the SDG targets and the WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for reducing the global suicide mortality rate. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has implemented several measures to address and prevent suicide, reflecting a comprehensive and community-based approach to mental health and suicide prevention. One is on policy and strategies. Existing high level policy, such as Mental Health Act 2010, the Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Policy 2015 and hospital-based counselling standards, guide the national efforts in addressing mental health issues and suicide prevention in Fiji. These policies aim to create its supportive environment where mental health is openly discussed and addressed. The Ministry will be reviewing and updating these policies to address the ever-changing mental health landscapes in Fiji. On governance and collaboration, the National Committee on the Prevention of Suicide which is chaired by the Minister for Health and Medical Services provides the platform for high level multi- stakeholder’s collaboration with community stakeholders, interest groups and Government. This collaboration helps to address stigma related to mental health and promotes transparency to an open discussion about suicide and its prevention. The National Mental Health Team, under the Wellness and NCD Division within the Ministry, plays a pivotal role in promoting mental health wellness and training healthcare professionals. They have trained nearly 1,000 nurses and doctors, and more than 500 Civil Servants and members of the civil society organisations across the country on suicide prevention strategies and mental health, focussing on promoting positive coping mechanisms and health seeking behaviours. On Crisis Helplines, as alluded also by honourable Sharma, there are several toll free helplines that have been developed and are now available for those in need of psychological support, including the Lifeline Fiji 1543, Child Help Line Fiji 1325, Empower Pacific 24/7 Counselling Helpline 5626. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we could not have done this without the continuous support of our CSOs and Community Programmes. A number of CSO, such as Empower Pacific, Lifeline Fiji, Mending Minds Foundation, Building Innate Resilience Through Hearts (BIRTH) Fiji, Psychiatric Survivors</p><div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div><p>946 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 Association, Medical Services Pacific, Fiji Cancer Society and Diabetes Fiji work closely with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services in focusing and supporting the identification of individuals at risk, increasing help-seeking behaviour and ensuring access to effective mental healthcare and other supportive services. They also emphasise post-intervention support, reducing access to means of suicide, enhancing life skills, resilience and promoting social connectedness. On awareness and education, annual events, like the World Suicide Prevention Day, the Mental Health Day and the Mental Health Month help raise awareness about suicide and mental health issues. On Health Promoting Schools (HPS), one of the pillars of HPS Policy is the Mental Health Pillar and this allows the focus on good mental health practices in schools. On the Substance Abuse and Advisory Council (SAAC) under the Ministry of Education and established under the Substance Abuse Advisory Council Act 1998, it provides the framework for targeting interventions with regards to substances in learning environments and promoting substance free learning environment. On capacity building and accreditation, the Ministry has worked closely with our training institutions, in particular, the Fiji National University (FNU), in the training of our health workers in the field of psychiatry and mental health. The University has delivered many mental health courses that help to build the capacity of our healthcare workers and recently started to offer the Postgraduate Master of Medicine in Psychiatry Degree, which is a significant achievement by the University. Sir, one cannot forget to mention St. Giles - our national referral hospital for mental health disorders. The St. Giles Hospital works in coordination with three Stress Management Wards in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa, and other hospitals at primary healthcare centres for early detection and appropriate intervention for patients visiting any health facilities. Sir, this coordinated action also helps patients who are recovering after a suicidal attempt, in terms of finding possible causes of the attempt and addressing it appropriately so as to prevent any future attempts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these measures reflect Fiji’s commitment in tackling suicide through a multi-faceted approach, simply means that more people should know about it, talk about it and do something about it. The new theme for the World Suicide Prevention Day for the next three years from 2024 to 2026 is ‘Change the Narrative is a call to action to “Start the Conversation”’. With targeted mental health strategies, good health promotions, well-trained health workforce and a thorough effective community engagement, we can improve suicide awareness, breakdown the stigma and begin to reduce the rate of suicide in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would like to highlight my experience as a young doctor, straight after graduating and into internship. So, internship period is a period where you are tested to witness and experience attempted suicide patients who are calling for help after they have deliberately burned themselves or ingested some harmful chemicals. Sir, it is a sight no one wants to see. Therefore, I urge all honourable Members of this august Parliament and those who are listening that suicide prevention is a responsibility for all of us here in Fiji. Vinaka vakalevu. MR. SPEAKER.- Vinaka vakalevu, honourable Minister for Health. I must apologise for announcing honourable Tabuya’s name because that appeared on my speaking notes.</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 End of Week Statements 947 Girmit Commemoration 2024 HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and all those who are watching today’s proceedings; sab ko mera Pranam, ni sa bula vinaka saka. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to commemorate the arrival of 60,553 indentured labourers between 1879 and 1916, the Coalition Government has declared Girmit Day as national holiday. This year, we organised a Girmit Mela in Lautoka from 11 th May-13th May at Fiji Girmit Centre. The theme of this year’s Girmit commemoration was the ‘Journey of Girmit Descendants in Building a New Fiji’, acknowledging the journey of descendants in different fields of work and the influence on the fabric of our society. The programme was organised by Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry under the leadership of the honourable Minister and Permanent Secretary, Mr. Yogesh Karan, and his staff. I was asked to Chair the Programme’s Committee to support their staff and Working Committee based in the West. Taking the national programme to the Western Division was significant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as many descendants of Girmityas settled in the West, to restart their lives after the end of the Girmit era. After completing their indenture, many could not go back to India for many, many different reasons. Those who chose to stay could access land from the Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) company but they were restricted on what they could plant. Mr. Speaker, as a result, many of the settlers negotiated with chiefs to gain or access land for farming. We learned through a Girmitya elder who resided in Vuda that Na Momo na Tui Vuda, allowed many settlers to access land in early 1900s. In the writings, we also found that Girmityas who made Fiji their home had learnt the language and protocols well and had developed strong ties with the landowners. It was important to acknowledge the custodians of the land before we begin the Girmit programme. On Friday evening of 10 th May, we organised our vakavinavinaka ceremony to honour and thank the chiefs, and Bose ni Momo was represented by the Tui Nawaka, Ratu Joeli Bulu; the Taukei Navo, Ratu Meli Saukuru; Taukei Vidilo, Ratu Viliame Bouwalu; and the Matanivanua nodra na Turaga na Tui Naviti, Sikeli Molase. It was a beautiful event where, after the formal ceremony, a talanoa allowed for interaction. We ended the evening with a meal and entertainment, a meke brought by Tui Nawaka, South Indian dance and National Youth Band was present, that provided entertainment in all three languages. Mr. Speaker, Sir, those who understand our culture and tradition will know that we treat our guests with deep respect, and we seek forgiveness at the end of any such event in case we have erred in any way, that may have offended them or made them uncomfortable. When we hold prayers in our culture, our priests tells us to seek forgiveness of our parents and community at large in case we have hurt them, either intentionally or unintentionally. That is our tradition, Mr. Speaker, Sir. And our matanivanua, Mr. Sundressan Chetty from Tavua, also offered his apology during the closure of the ceremony. The proceedings have been aired on various national TV channels, including the Fiji Government Facebook page. This event has been misinterpreted, deliberately or otherwise, as a national apology, on behalf of descendants of Girmityas. I have seen a rambling Facebook post by honourable Koya and similar comments by some of his colleagues, that I had led a national apology on behalf of indentured labourers seeking forgiveness from the chiefs in a matanigasau ceremony.</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>948 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 This is false for the reasons I have just stated. Why do some politicians become fearful and insecure when there is any interaction between the two ethnic groups, where we try to look at and do things differently, and begin a deeper process of communication? At times, we are ridiculed and told we are naive and unrealistic, even that we are selling out our ethnic community. Why is that, Mr. Speaker, Sir? And it is also so interesting that these attacks have all been heaped on a woman leader. I was no more or less responsible for these events than others, including the honourable Minister for Multi- Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry. But it appears that it is easier just to attack a woman MP, perhaps so she can be blamed for showing weakness. I am disgusted that honourable Members of this Parliament instigated mass cyber-bullying with their deliberate lies. It is little wonder that women do not want to stand for politics in our country Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had a government that for 16 years, said nothing about ethnic relations. Its policy was to ignore ethnic differences and simply say, “we are all Fijians”. We were not allowed even to know the ethnic background of our population, Sir. This was a shortsighted and ignorant policy. In every country in the world, there are people of different ethnic groups. Many of these countries do multiculturalism well. They understand the importance of celebrating diversity and communicating with each other about our different languages, customs and cultures, to improve understanding. Commemorating national days like, Girmit and Ratu Sukuna, allows us this opportunity. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important for those of us in the minority to recognise and acknowledge all that have been done for us by the majority community. Something many descendants of Girmityas may not think about is that the vanua and Chiefs have a generous heart. They call us ‘ vasu ’ in their own context. A vasu is someone from maternal links and have no restrictions in observing protocols. Yes, there have been times of tension, deep racism and distress we cannot deny this, nor should we forget the painful lessons such experiences have taught us. Our history is marred by political upheavals of the last 37 years. But it is also important that we remember that for more than a century, our ancestors have lived here through the support of the people of the land. One has to read ‘ Fiji - A Love Story ’ by the late former Ambassador Ajay Singh, who wrote how his grandmother was helped by a Fijian Chief of Ra when she was in distress. Listen to the story of businessman, Ben Naidu, when his grandfather was nursed by women from Sawaieke in Gau and nurtured for 10 years by an iTaukei family before being returned to his own. Read the narratives of the rescue of Syria wreck and you will discover the political history of the last 40 years, does not define our relationships, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is important that as we honour our Girmitiyas, we also honour the relationships and support they received in settling in Fiji. It is time we look forward with excitement and anticipation about what our new political environment can offer us in exploration of each other’s ethnic identities, our language, our culture and customs. Only in this way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can we truly become one nation. I am proud of the initiatives of our Government in this space. It is a real shame that there are honourable Members in this Parliament who use misinformation and bigotry to try and derail these. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by all and sundry, who am I to represent Indo-Fijian people in what I say and do. During the mayhem of 2000, I was one of the few</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024 End of Week Statements 949 who went to most of the areas impacted, and I also took the time to understand the different ethnic tensions over the last 20 years. So, I say to those whose ill-informed criticisms try to drive a wedge between our communities, learn your history. To air your insecurities and hate, find other avenues rather than ethnic relations. Mr Speaker, Sir, the three-day Girmit event at Lautoka’s Girmit Centre was a very well attended and a great success. Many young and older artists from different part of the West showcase their drama, folk songs, poetry and participated in sports that was organised. A carnival atmosphere was created by many local artists and musicians from India through the courtesy of the Indian Government. I wish to thank honourable Minister for Youth and Sports and his Band that coloured the events with their Hindi numbers they learnt within a few days. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express gratitude to His Excellency the President of Fiji, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, for gracing the occasion. It was an emotional moment for many recipients of Girmit descendants’ awards, including Mata Gangmma Ji from Solovi in Nadi, who is 108 years old. I wish to thank the Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers who were present most of the days of the event. I wish to acknowledge the honourable Assistant Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management, for officiating in Labasa events, and honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government, for officiating at Savusavu events, the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs, the sugar secor, all artist, exhibitors, sponsors, media organisations and all those who participated in the event, including various Government Departments, Archives and the Fiji Museum, who all worked hard to make the event a great success. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have much to do to make multiculturism in Fiji not just the norm, but a force for good and a way to capitalise our natural development, and I urge every MP and every citizen of our country to be generous in spirit and to support us as we embark on a new path for ethnic relations in Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) MR. SPEAKER.- You listen to me. I am going to…. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much for giving me the chance to address Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Wait! I have not given you the floor. (Laughter) That is the problem of them continuing with their running commentary. I have not given you the floor yet. I was about to address you, but anyway, since you have stood up, I will give you the floor now. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am the last speaker, I suppose. Honourable Bulitavu is saying, “just be short and sweet’. But I love to say one thing, despite my extending invitation to the Opposition to come to the all the celebrations, no one turned up. HON. K. K. LAL.- You gave the wrong invitation!</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>950 End of Week Statements 24 th May, 2024 (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one alphabetical error does not mean your name</p><h4>changes. Anyway, look, if they keep on interjecting, I will take long, I will take 20 minutes.</h4><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the End of the Week Statement by honourable Kiran on the update and the significance of the recently celebrated National Girmit Day that was held for the three days from 11 th May, 2024 to 13 th May, 2024. The three-day event was held at the Lautoka Girmit Centre, while the two half-day events was organised at Subrail Park in Labasa and Savusavu. At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to confirm that the National Girmit Day event this year was very successful, and this was attested by honourable Kiran earlier. (Honourable Opposition Member interjects) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Keep quiet! When a senior person speaks, keep quite! (Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason for the successful event are numerous. Firstly, the event was led by a very capable person, the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, who was the Chairperson of this event. With the vast experience she has in managing the projects and events, the honourable Assistant Minister provided majestic leadership, guidance and a direct involvement in the planning, organising and executing of the three- day event in Lautoka. Despite her busy schedule, she took her valuable time to prioritise this event. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Ministry, I wish to thank her wholeheartedly for leading the success of this event, given that the Ministry of Mult-Ethnic is a relatively new ministry with limited staff. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second reason of the success was the role of the hardworking committee members, who were set up prior to the event in Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu. The Lautoka committee was led by Mr. Selva Nadan, the Savusavu committee was led by Mr. Shankar Singh and the Labasa committee was led by Mr. Vinesh Prasad. These gentlemen worked tirelessly with the committee members to ensure that everything was ready before the event proper. All the committee members dedicated their time on a volunteer basis, and I was amazed by their dedication and commitment. On the same note, I wish to thank the volunteers who helped us in making this event successful in the three locations of Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu. The other reason of success, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the service provided by the National Archives, which allowed the Girmit descendants in the Western Division to identify their ancestry in India. There is a very popular site and I wish to thank the National Archives for providing this service. Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the event, the younger generation of the Girmit descendants were able to see the artifacts and jewellery that were brought from India. The Ministry of Agriculture displayed spices, cooking utensils, crops and farming tools that were introduced by the Girmit descendants. The Ministry of Forestry showcased some of the plants that were introduced by the Girmityas, and this was another reason for the success of the Girmit event, and I am grateful for both Ministries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the patrons witnessed a great performance by around 60 artists related to</p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>951 Girmit both, local artists and artists from India. I wish to thank the Indian Government for bringing them over to Fiji, especially for the Girmit event. In both, Labasa and Savusavu, there were 20 items from the different local groups that performed various items on Girmit, and I wish to pay my gratitude to them. The patrons also witnessed some great performance by the National Youth Band where we witnessed iTaukei youngsters singing beautiful Hindi songs. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this attracted a good crowd. I wish to thank the Ministry of Youth for this stage performance, and I would like to see them perform more in my Ministry’s social cohesion events in the future. The highlight of the Girmit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the awards that were bestowed to the Girmit descendants of 80 years and above by our President, His Excellency Ratu Viliame Maivalili Katonivere, who was the Chief Guest on Monday, 13 th May, 2024. That was an emotional moment for the recipients and family members. I am sure the honourable Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection will agree with this. I wish to thank His Excellency for his time to be the Chief Guest. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to state that the funds for this year’s Girmit Day event in Lautoka, Suva, Labasa and Savusavu has been well accounted for by my Ministry. I wish to clearly inform this Parliament that no funds were disbursed to any individual or organisation prior to the event, and all financial and procurement rules of the Government were followed, including the requirements for three quotations.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> That is the way to go, honourable Minister.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J.

Vinaka. MR. SPEAKER.- For the information of honourable Members, I received notification from the Chairperson of the Special Committee on Emoluments to move a motion pertaining to the Committee’s Report which was tabled on Wednesday, 22 nd May, 2024.
