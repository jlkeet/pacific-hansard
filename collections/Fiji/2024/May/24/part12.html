<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Cane Supply in Rakiraki (Question No. 88/2024)</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>906</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 HON. A. A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament on how the supply of cane in the Rakiraki area will be increased? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer honourable Maharaj, I would like to make some comments on what the honourable Leader of the Opposition said last night in regards to Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) and the staff attitude, what has been happening and why there is a decrease in the sugar industry’s cane. You are right, the attitude of staff and FSC over the last 10 years or so, have resulted in the farmers having to run to the workers rather than the workers going to the farmers and advising them. That is the only observation that I have seen. I have warned the FSC workers and said, “If you are slack on your work, just go home. Give the job to someone else”. I will give you an example of a Sector Clerk in Wailevu, who never visited the farmers. He was sitting in the office all the time. One day, the farmer re-planted his cane, he requested the Sector Officer to go and survey his farm so that there could be a claim, but the Clerk never turned up. So, the farmer made a video of his farm and complained against the Sector Clerk, and he forwarded it to me. I immediately forwarded that to the FSC CEO and said, “This is what the Sector Clerk is doing.” I told him, “You either fire him or I will fire you.” (Laughter) So that Sector Clerk got out of the office. That is the type of attitude I am taking about. (Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- So, I wholeheartedly take your advice, honourable Leader of the Opposition. As I have said, I am a‘no nonsense’ Minister. I got hands-on job. Honourable Premila Kumar complimented the sugar industry, supported the motion but, unfortunately, when I was replying, she was not in the Chamber. I do not know why, but if she wants to support me, she should be here.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Just answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Listen to me! I am coming to that, I have got plenty time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P. D. KUMAR.:</span> What are your saying?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- I am just simply saying that you were not here when I was replying:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Yesterday, when I was talking about the sugar price, honourable Bala was complaining. Why were you complaining?</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>907 HON. P. K. BALA.- Who was complaining?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- You were complaining last night:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.- My answer is coming:</span> Now, listen, to what I am going to say. Honourable Maharaj, you question me about Ra. The honourable Member sitting next to you is from Ra.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Yes, I am coming to that. Honourable Ratu Niudamu is a high Chief of Ra. He actually asked me; “Honourable Minister, how can we get together and increase the production in Ra?” A Chief like him from that side, he is offering to assist the Government on how we can increase production.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Answer the question:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Yes, I am coming to that! (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question asked by honourable Maharaj regarding the measures taken to increase the supply of cane in the Rakiraki area. We, as Coalition Government, recognise the crucial role that the sugar industry has in our economy, particularly in supporting the livelihoods of many families in Rakiraki and beyond. To address the challenge of sugarcane supply in this area, we are implementing a multifaceted strategy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on our current data, the total area registered for cane cultivation across the four sectors in the Penang Mill area is approximately 8,142 hectares. However, only 34 percent (2,729.3 hectares) of this land is currently under cultivation, resulting in a production of only 141,520 tonnes of cane last year. Therefore, Mr. Speaker Sir, there is significant potential to boost production in the Rakiraki cane belt as it was in the good days until after 2016. If we can increase the cultivation area to, at least, 60 percent of the total available area, we could produce approximately 250,000 tonnes of cane, and this was achieved in the past years. To boost production, our initial focus will be on both, Ellington 1 and Ellington2 Sectors, where less than 20 percent of registered land is currently under active cultivation. Re-engaging inactive producers, Mr. Speaker Sir, is a primary strategy. Many farmers who have ceased sugarcane cultivation need encouragement and support to return to farming, which is essential for increasing the overall productivity of the Mill. We have introduced various incentives and programmes aimed at encouraging existing farmers to expand their cane cultivation and attracting new farmers to the industry. These incentives include grants for planting sugarcane, subsidies for fertilizers, a $5 tonne incentive for improving production, manual labour harvesting support, provision of farming equipment and improved cane varieties that promise higher yields.</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>908</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 Recognising that adequate infrastructure is vital for efficient farming, we are investing in improving access roads to cane farms and upgrading drainage systems to mitigate the impacts of adverse weather conditions. This infrastructure support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will enable farmers to cultivate and harvest cane more effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are enhancing our Agriculture Extension Services to provide farmers with an up-to-date knowledge and best practices in farming. These include training on the modern agricultural techniques, pest and disease management, soil fertility management, et cetera. These services by the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) and FSC are designed to increase productivity and sustainability in cane farming. Engaging the youth in farming through the formation of small cooperatives is another strategy to increase cane production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF will train young farmers, particularly, the iTaukei, in best management practices, ensuring they will be well equipped to manage and cultivate sugarcane effectively. The Government is working with financial institutions, especially the Sugar Cane Growers Fund (SCGF) to facilitate easy access to credit for the cane farmers. By providing low interest loans and financial products tailored to the needs of the cane farmers, we aim to remove the financial barriers that prevent farmers from investing in their farms and expanding production. Mr. Speaker, Sir, our collaboration with SRIF will focus on developing new cane varieties that are more resilient to climate change and disease while offering higher yields. The ongoing research and development efforts ensure that our farmers have access to the best possible resources to increase cane supply. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to highlight a significant issue, the farmers have faced immense challenges since the removal of the Penang Mill in Rakiraki in 2016. It is disheartening to note that reinstating this Mill will require just over $5 million at the time. However, due to the irresponsible decision- making by the then Government, this Mill was sold as scrap. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. C. J. SINGH.- We are now bearing the cost of the decision by providing the farmers with a cartage cost of $5 million plus a year. Over the last seven years, we have already bled $30 million for their ignorance, and we will continue to burden them. This is a glaring example of the wastefulness of the previous Administration. Nonetheless, we are moving strategically to eliminate this recurring cost and convert it to an investment that will benefit the taxpayers in the long run, instead of catering to the incapable decisions of the FijiFirst Government. The investment of the building of a new mill in Penang will, no doubt, reward our investment, attract new and young farmers, particularly our resource owners, and enhance other economic activities in Rakiraki and Tavua again. We expect this investment to operate efficiently enough that the debt incurred to build a new mill will be self-sustaining in the long run. In fact, we anticipate that this will be a game changer for our economy. Our Coalition Government has been ardently advocating for the establishment of a new mill in Rakiraki to replace the one dismantled by the previous Administration, which deeply hurt our farmers and shattered their confidence in no time.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>909 (Chorus of interjections)</p><h4>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Listen! If you have questions, then listen to my answers.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> A Point of Order, Sir. Standing Order 60 on the relevance. I would just like to get a clarification. Two days ago, the honourable Minister gave some figures that it is $7 million to cart sugarcane from Rakiraki to Ba. He actually stated that the cost on that particular day was not $5 million. Within two days, the honourable Minister is giving two different figures. Can the honourable Minister, please, clarify because it seems that his figures are coming out of thin air and not from the staff of the Ministry? How come it was $7 million two days ago and today, it has come down to $5 million? MR. SPEAKER. - Well, let me rule on that point of order. Rakiraki is quite some distance away and as the crow flies, that is a different mileage altogether but if you follow the road, probably it is much longer. That is why his figures are different. What is going on, because if you follow the road …. Anyway, thank you, honourable Maharaj. Honourable Minister, you may resume your seat you have completed your time. (Laughter) HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, thank you for your response. Specifically with respect to Rakiraki and this new mill that you have been talking about for months on end, you have heard the honourable Deputy Prime Minister talking about Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and the production of ethanol. Honourable Minister, can you tell us, will Rakiraki be also a centre and are you incorporating the plan to produce ethanol out of that new Mill? In terms of that, how are you going to achieve that increase that you have spoken about with respect to sugarcane production, going on to include the production of ethanol with respect to sustainable aviation fuels? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Our plan is this, honourable Koya, the ethanol plant will be constructed in Ba. MR. SPEAKER.- Will you address me, Sir. HON. C. J. SINGH.- I apologise, Sir. The ethanol plant will be done in Ba because when the Rakiraki Mill is done, we will have to bring in molasses and sugar out of Rakiraki Mill and Lautoka Mill into Ba Mill. So that will be the center of the ethanol plant, but the Rakiraki Mill which will be established will have a refinery together with it. So, we will have a refinery in Rakiraki because as you know, honourable Koya, we are exporting all our raw sugar overseas and then we are importing white sugar back to Fiji. So Rakiraki Mill will have a full scale …. (Honourable Member interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Who is questioning me? Question me properly.</p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, they do not know about sugar, they will not ask about sugar. All I am saying is, I will answer you. Our plans are very intact, it is going to happen, it is not a match box project. It is a big project, and we are currently negotiating with both, India and China, to build a mill and we will see which is the best option and, thereafter, we will take it to Cabinet.</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>910</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, another supplementary question; due to TC Winston and the closure of Penang Sugar Mill, a lot of cane farmers stopped doing cane farming and they diversified to other crops. My question to the honourable Minister is, what incentives are there to bring these farmers back to sugarcane farming? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, well, as I have said, in the last Budget, we had 13 different programmes and in the next Budget, we will have another seven new programmes which will focus on Rakiraki itself and the farmers in that area. So, just wait for a while and we will rebuild. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Thank you honourable Minister for Sugar for your nice answer. My supplementary question is, as you have already promised the Rakiraki farmers, when will the construction of the Rakiraki Sugar Mill start? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have just said, it is not a matchbox project, but a project that has to be well-designed. Currently, we are talking to the suppliers. They will give us a proper price, then we will come back to the FijiFirst Party to take a bipartisan approval, and then we will start. It will not start now but will definitely finish before the end of our term. HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, much has been said about the Rakiraki Sugar Mill. What is the total tonnage of cane that we get from Rakiraki Mill? Sir, I have a follow-up question on the basis of his answer. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Can you repeat the question, please, because honestly, I cannot see you and I cannot hear you. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, can we have some provision for breathalyser here.</p><p>(Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, is someone driving? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order. That question implies when he is asking the question, do you need a breathalyser or referring to the word ‘breathalyser’, which is imputing improper motives. MR. SPEAKER.- I have corrected him on that one, honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament because no one is driving here. So, honourable Minister, do you want to reply to that supplementary question? HON. C. J. SINGH.- What was the question? HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament what is the total tonnage of cane that we get from the Rakiraki Mill? Then, I also have a follow up question. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, we are getting about 140,000 tonnes out of Rakiraki but we are expecting that with the new mill to be there, we should be having about 3,000 tonnes of cane per day. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Do you mean, having it after five years?</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>911</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> Well, look, I was not here.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Hold on, hold on!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.:</span> So, what I am saying is, the answer is 140,000 tonnes.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> That is enough, Sir. What is your follow-up question? HON. P. K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, is that enough tonnage to build the Rakiraki Mill? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what I am saying, we have to increase the tonnage, and the Mill will take two years to be built. So, from now onwards, we have to encourage the farmers, including the children and fellow members of the mataqali, to start growing more sugarcane so that we can have sufficient sugarcane for the Rakiraki Mill in two years’ time. Aviation Industry - Growth in Tourism Sector (Question No. 89/2024) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation update Parliament on the key activities that the Aviation Industry is undertaking to support growth in the tourism sector? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to answer the question asked by honourable Vocea, regarding the actions the Aviation Industry is undertaking to bolster growth in the tourism sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, some highlights on the key activities, include the following: 1. Infrastructure Development As part of our 10-year National Development Plan, we are investing in upgrading our airport infrastructure to handle increased air traffic and reduce congestion. This includes, the expansion of terminals, upgrading of runways and improvement of air navigation aids. (a) Nadi Airport Fiji Airports is undertaking a comprehensive expansion and modernisation of Nadi Airport. Key projects include: (i) Expanding the Departure Lounge with new VIP and bus lounges, additional waiting areas and reconfigured zones, all phased to minimise disruptions. (ii) By year-end, there will be – new off-gate aprons for more aircraft parking; ongoing pavement maintenance; planning for a transit hotel, retail building and new car park; • • • • Gates 1-3 will be relocated between 2025 and 2028, with new gates added in 2029; • Upgrades include new aerobridges by 2026;</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>912</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 • Advanced check-in systems with biometric integration by December 2024; and a new CT scan-based baggage handling system by 2026. • (iii) A solar PV farm will increase power capacity in phases to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The Airport will also introduce – • • electric vehicles and charging stations; as well as new fire trucks and enhanced training facilities, along with upgraded communication, navigation and surveillance systems to meet international standards. (b) Nausori Airport (2024-2033) (i) Fiji Airports is currently carrying out conceptual designs for the refurbishment of existing terminal to maximise efficiency and enable better passenger experience. In addition to that, Fiji Airports will continue to work with Government on the required funding to develop a new international terminal wing, as long-term expansion plan. (ii) Fiji Airports is considering the creation of Nausori General Aviation Precinct and a taxiway to boost its commercial revenue, as well as free-up space at the Nadi Airport. (iii) The Landside Master Plan, which is currently on tender stage, will guide the commercial development in Nausori. (c) Outer Island Projects Fiji Airports is actively involved in several development initiatives for the outer islands. They have awarded Flame Tree Development Fiji Ltd with a FJ$10 million contract to carry out pavement maintenance on five Airports - Labasa, Rotuma, Savusavu, Lakeba and Matei. This contract, awarded in April 2024, after a rigorous tender process, is part of ongoing maintenance efforts funded by Fiji Airports. Additionally, construction for the Labasa Terminal will begin in mid-2024 at its current location, with plans to acquire adjacent land for a larger terminal in the future. (d) World Bank Project – Fiji Tourism Development Programme in Vanua Levu I have briefed Parliament on the World Bank Project, Mr. Speaker. Fiji Airports is supporting the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation in upgrading Savusavu and Labasa Airports as part of the World Bank-funded Fiji Tourism Development Programme in Vanua Levu. Phase I, spanning six years, involves building a new terminal at the current site to serve passengers for the next five years. A larger terminal, with expanded capacity and parking, will be constructed on a new site near the Airport, pending World Bank assistance. Concurrently, a feasibility study for a new domestic airport in Savusavu will be conducted. (e) Remote Tower Systems - Outer Islands Funded by the World Bank, the implementation of remote tower systems for outer islands, like Labasa, will utilise advanced technology, including high-resolution cameras, sensors, microphones and a local processing system, to provide</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>913 comprehensive flight information. This initiative aims to enhance the operational capabilities and safety of these remote airports. (f) Matei Airport Future plans for Matei Airport, along with other smaller outer island airports, involve constructing modular-type passenger terminal buildings with Government assistance, as these airports are owned by the Government and managed by Fiji Airports. A concept design for extending the Matei Airport runway has been developed, requiring land acquisition around the airport. As I have stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to land the ATR in Matei. (g) Proposed Yasawa Island Airport There is proposed development of luxury resorts around the Yasawa-i-rara, Blue Lagoon area and Nacula area. At the latest count, there are about 10, and the Government is committed to this endeavour and is currently examining all feasible alternatives to foster the construction of an airport and corresponding facilities to support these investments. This initiative aligns with Government’s strategic objectives to distribute the advantages of tourism across the archipelago. Fleet Modernisation Our national airline has a very young fleet and doing a wonderful job internationally, but we need to upgrade/replace the local equipment being used domestically. The reason, Mr. Speaker, is that our national airline has reported some impressive results, and this augurs well for aviation and the future of our tourism industry. Regulatory Reforms We are modernising our aviation safety and security legislation, to ensure it is in line with ICAO’s requirements and fit for purpose. Safety Enhancement Initiatives Also, with ICAO, and I had highlighted this week about the liberalization of our aviation policy as stated. This is part of what you face today if you want to go into markets, like the USA. 2. 3. 4. 5. Open Skies Policy But I want to emphasise that when we talk about Open Skies Policy, it will be considered on a case-by-case basis bilaterally. So, there should be no fear of our national airline being threatened by some of the big boys internationally. Mr. Speaker, Sir, these initiatives, coupled with our strong national oversight system compliant with ICAO standards, are aimed at ensuring that our aviation industry remains safe, reliable and efficient, thereby, supporting the growth of our tourism sector. We remain committed to overcoming the challenges we face and leveraging the opportunities that lie ahead to bolster growth in the tourism sector. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the terminal in Labasa is important, no doubt, there is a long-term goal and should be achieved for the betterment of the people of Labasa and Vanua Levu as a whole. The immediate remedy that is required is to reduce air fares from Suva to Labasa and from Nadi to Labasa. What is the honourable Minister doing in order to bring the air fares down? Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will give an example, I was trying to book my mother’s flight over the weekend. It was costing me around $700 return, compared to previously when it was offered at $65 one way. What is the</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>914</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 honourable Minister doing to reduce the air fares between Suva-Labasa and Labasa-Nadi? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, operating an airline is a business and the laws of supply and demand apply. Airlines have a yield system in place, so a yield system is whereby you book at a certain time, you pay a certain fare. When you book last, you can be paying the highest rate in the system. (Honourable Members interject) MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- That is the reality of the game today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but looking at the bigger picture, he scoffed at the World Bank Development Programme for Vanua Levu. When you uplift Vanua Levu and you uplift tourism in Vanua Levu, there will be volume traffic, there will be frequencies and the air fare will come down. So, do not scoff like you did, honourable Maharaj, about this initiative. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister; in terms of the Fiji Link services to Vanua Levu and to Nadi, can Fiji Link and Fiji Airways ensure that there are planes available? There are mechanical problems and if you move forward, this could frustrate many tourists, given that flights are cancelled in the last minute due to mechanical problems. That has been an ongoing issue in the last six months. How can we ensure that we have a proper aircraft servicing the people, so they are not affected if they have a connecting flight from Nadi to overseas and they are told at the very last minute that the plane from Nausori is not coming to Labasa? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the problem with our people on the other side is their selective hearing. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- I did highlight in my delivery that we are replacing the old equipment used locally. HON. P. K. BALA.- When? HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- We are going to replace them. As I have said, Fiji airways has a very young fleet internationally but locally, they will be replacing the old equipment. It will not become an issue once we replace the old equipment, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do have quite a remarkable record now on on-time departure and arrival. For Labasa, the day will come very soon when you check in your bag in Labasa and you can pick it up in London if you are going to London. That is happening, Sir, it will be international check-in. (Chorus of interjections) HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the way forward for aviation in Vanua Levu. You can check-in your bag in Vanua Levu and you pick it up where you are going - London or whatever. Vinaka.</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>915 30 Million Tree Planting Programme (Question No. 90/2024) HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry inform Parliament on the total number of trees planted to-date under the 30 million Tree Planting Programme which targets reforestation and climate change mitigation? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister for Fisheries, I notice you have been planting a lot of trees in Lomaiviti. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by honourable Koroilavesau. Thank you, honourable Member, for your question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in January 2019, the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years Programme was officially inaugurated. This tree planting initiative is part of Fiji's green economy recovery from the ongoing impacts of climate change and the impacts of COVID 19. Additionally, Fiji's tree planting initiative is contributing towards meeting our international commitments under the REDD+ initiative that was initiated in 2009 and the World Bank's Emission Reduction Programme signed in 2021 to remove and reduce emission. Furthermore, the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years initiative is part of Fiji's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) where countries set targets for mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions that cause climate change and for adapting to climate impacts. The reforestation of degraded forest through this tree planting is an attempt to utilise degraded forests to address broad thematic areas of need, including carbon stock enhancement, connecting forest corridors, coastal restoration, food security, flood mitigation stabilisation of riparian systems, catchment restoration, enrichment planting, community woodlots and industrial planting. MR. SPEAKER.- Sir, honourable Koroilavesau asked the number of trees you have planted so far, Sir. We have been informed about that. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will elaborate more on this to let them understand the reality. I will come to that, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Can you explain a bit more?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> I have to elaborate on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p>Since the start of the Programme in January 2019, more than 19.1 million trees have been planted, including almost a million mangroves, on more than 17,200 hectares of land across Fiji. This means that we have planted approximately 64 percent of our target with 36 percent yet to be achieved, which is 10.9 million trees. A further breakdown of trees across the various Provinces can be provided, if required. The approximate number of trees planted by Province included Ba Province planting the most with almost 5.8 million, followed by Nadroga with almost 4.2 million, Bua with 3.9 million, Ra with almost 2 million, Macuata with 1.2 million, Tailevu at 0.6 million, Rewa at 0.5 million and Cakaudrove</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>916</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 at 0.49 million. Others include - Naitasiri with 267,000; Serua with 127,000, Namosi with 73,000, Lomaiviti with 22,000; Lau with 37,000; Kadavu with 4,000 and Rotuma with 40 trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the 19.1 million trees planted, pine makes up about 14.9 million, mahogany at 776,000; mangroves at approximately 931,000; sandalwood about 17,000 and others, which include native trees, fruit trees and teak which is about 2.5 million. The numbers achieved are a positive testament of the diligent work being carried out by my Ministry with the support of our communities and our partners - Fiji Pine Limited, Fiji Pine Trust and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Ltd, as well as the people of Fiji. However, we also acknowledge that there are challenges that we continue to face, associated with activities aimed at reforesting degraded landscapes, particularly in relation to the relatively lower survival rate of certain species in specific sites. Mr. Speaker, Sir, many factors affect the growth of seedlings including, drought, fires, animals and flooding, as well as the suitability of certain species to different sites. The Ministry has also assisted vulnerable areas in relation to the above factors with the erection of fences, construction of fire breaks and proper land preparation. In the past, research work carried out by the Department of Forestry had focused mainly on improving the growth of our two major plantation species - pine and mahogany, contributing to their current success. But it is not only these species that are vital to the achievement of our goals, it is also the implementation of the tree planting programme, such as the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years initiative. The Research Division of the Ministry has been undertaking site specific research studies, focusing on species with higher mortality, to ensure improvement in the survival rates, moving forward. That is why our Research Division has established permanent sample plots to monitor the growth of each species and their survival, to help determine which species to plant at different sites in the future, and the actions required to improve the survival of the planted trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also revised our Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Guidelines to provide our monitoring team the ability to trace back the survival and mortality rates to activities, such as seed collection and associated treatments. Moreover, our team on the ground is also increasing their focus on the beating up of seedlings and planting new seedlings in the areas that did not survive under the initial round of tree planting. Additionally, we need to ensure that communities are able to take ownership of the developments, especially the tree planting initiative. If communities take ownership and look after the trees planted on their particular land, then survival rate could be greatly increased. Ultimately, these initiatives will help us improve our future survival rates, therefore, the achievement of our goal in restoring degraded landscape. Based on the improvements planned, I am confident that we will meet or even exceed the target of 3 million trees in 15 years, helping to restore forestry ecosystem, supporting socio-economic development, and positively contributing to the achievements of Fiji’s international commitments. I wish to thank the people of Fiji for their continued support in assisting my Ministry towards the tree planting efforts. I also have a table of the Provinces that have been planted. If they want, I can also hand it over to them. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we all realise how important the RED+</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>917 Programme is to us and the fact that we have already planted 19.1 million trees, I think, according to the honourable Minister. The question to the honourable Minister, of that 19.1 million trees that are being planted, is there a particular portion that has already been designated for carbon trading or has the work going on with respect to that particular part of what we have been discussing earlier on regarding carbon trading? Has any portion of that 19 million been designated for or being looked at in terms of being designated for carbon trading? MR. SPEAKER.- It depends on how old the trees are, honourable Minister. The figures you are quoting, maybe they are just one year old or something. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I think carbon trading is coming after that initiative and we are working on it right now. MR. SPEAKER.- Not even that young.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Sa dina:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> They are still young, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> According to the honourable Minister, it is still young so they really cannot…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- .. approve the carbon trading:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, that is why I said ‘designated for’. Is he looking at a particular area where we know we can utilise in terms of designating it for carbon trading so that the landowners or whoever is responsible for that is aware that they actually have an asset so they can use? MR. SPEAKER.- Qo me sa vakagalalataki tu me baleta na ka ni carbon trading.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, later on, we are looking into that when they grow into that size.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> What size?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- We cannot do it now because it is a bit too small:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> What size you are talking about, big size? HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this programme, it was aimed at helping resource landowners. Basically, the landowners used to establish their own nurseries and sell it back to Government for the replanting programme. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if that programme is still continuing?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Sir, it still continues until today.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Still on and still continues, that is the wholesome answer.</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>918</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Minister, there is an over reliance now on plantations - pine and mahogany. We have lost most of our indigenous species. So, in that replanting programme, can you please clarify the level of efforts on bringing back our indigenous species and of course, the future plan as well? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, through this initiative, we are also including our indigenous species all around the country. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Seruiratu, are you satisfied with that reply? Planting the indigenous species all over the country. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- The follow on question from here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because when you talked about it, one is for timber purposes and for our food security as well. Breadfruit and all those, come under this classification. So, if the honourable Minister can be more specific. That is why I asked, where is the focus and what are the future plans because forestry is important for biodiversity as well? Thank you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> I will respond to that question later, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Why? You tell me why you want to refer to it later? You do not have the answers with you, that is all.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.:</span> Yes, Sir, I do not.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for the answers that he has given to the questions. I noticed that the major reason for the 30 million trees over 15 years was for biodiversity, maintaining our forest cover. One of the things that I have noticed recently during our site visit is that a stock of raw material going into sawmills, our timber industry, is declining and there is a look now to replace that. We have traditionally relied on to species that grow faster that can be harvested faster as well, and there are some works going on in Vanualevu on Eucalyptus and Acacia. While we are doing this replanting, the Ministry of Forestry also looked into planting species that might be available faster for harvest for those sawmillers who are now facing severe shortage of raw materials into the sawmills. It is happening now, and it is going to worsen in a few years’ time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the failure before is, we put the wrong plant in the wrong soil texture and now we are doing it the right way. We are putting the right trees in the right place where they can grow much faster and to be utilised in other species. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. K. BALA.- I think the bipartisan is really working in this Parliament because the last time, the honourable Minister provided us with some supplementary questions to this side of Parliament. I will have to check whether he has given this time or not, but it is good that the bipartisan is really working in this Parliament. (Laughter) Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have just heard from the honourable Minister that the previous programme is being continued. Is there any specific region that have seen significant progress? Thank you.</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>919 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Vocea, you will confuse him a lot. (Laughter) Do you want to respond to that question, Honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, can he repeat the question, please.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K. BALA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we have just heard what the honourable Minister said, that the previous programme has been continued by your Ministry. So, is there any specific region that has seen significant progress? HON. K. V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in Nayarabale in Vanualevu, there is a place there and also Saqani. MR.

Ni bula vinaka, welcome to your Parliament. It has been a while, and we enjoy your presence today. I understand you have been going through a very busy time in celebrating your coming together, your reunion and we welcome you. We understand that Suva Grammar School is a great school, I think we have former students here as well and we wish you well in your celebrations. Vinaka vakalevu. Border Security Actions (Question No. 91/2024) HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament what actions have been taken or are planned to be taken to ensure border security, given the recent influx in criminal activities and illegal border entries? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question. In response to that question regarding the actions that have been taken, or plan to ensure border security amidst the reported criminal activities and illegal border entries, I am providing Parliament with the following update: 1. National Border Security Upgrade Framework Government has developed a comprehensive framework to enhance border security, incorporating a coordinated approach among all key stakeholders. This will facilitate seamless information sharing and risk intelligence exchange. 2. Automation of Passenger Arrival Cards (PAC) We are introducing a digital PAC system, allowing travellers to submit information electronically before arrival. This will improve efficiency, reduce clearance times and enhance surveillance capability. 3. Advance Passenger Information This is in collaboration with the United Nations Office of Counter Terrorism. We are implementing systems to collect real-time passenger data, and this will help prevent the entry of inadmissible individuals. 4. Maritime Security Strategy We are in the process of developing a robust maritime security strategy to protect our maritime domain. This involves co-operation among maritime agencies and to detect and disrupt illegal activities effectively. 5. Issue of addressing fake recruitment companies in Fiji We are also aware of the recent surge in fake recruitment companies exploiting the current labour shortage in Fiji to bring people into the country illegally. To combat this, we have intensified our efforts to identify and shut down this problem of operations. We are working closely with international partners and local agencies to track and prosecute those who are responsible. Additionally, we have launched public awareness campaigns to</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>921 educate potential job seekers about the risk of fake recruitment schemes and to encourage them to verify the legitimacy of these recruitment agencies. Now, these initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once approved by Cabinet, will significantly bolster our border security, ensuring Fiji is well prepared to address both, traditional and non-traditional security threats. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his answer to the question in which the scourge of drugs, et cetera, criminal activities and illegal border entries that we are actually speaking about currently, all have an impact on our major earning industry. I have seen, as of this morning, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has ensured that a statement was given with respect to a New Zealand TV investigative series which has gone way off the radar with respect to making comments about Fiji. Honourable Minister, in the interest of all of us because this is something of concern to all of us, will you be issuing a statement? I understand they did interview you, actually condemning that particular report that has come out of New Zealand from a very mischievous reporter. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for the supplementary question. I think there has been much talk about the Dreaver report, as well as the 60 Minutes that came before them. Let me say that I appreciate Ms. Dreaver’s reporting that brings to light our Fijian drug situation, and this is not something that I am shying away from because this is speaking about the real issues that affect us. However, I think that maybe in many places, some of the information that she has shared through that programme, are being particularly exaggerated. On the same token, I think she may have also been misled by a lot of people in that particular report. I would like to say though, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Fiji is a safe destination. Our Government is secure, we have institutions that are in place that look after the security of not only Fijians, but also those who are visitors to our shores. We have independent institutions that are in place that protect their rights, if they are here as our guests, as well as for our locals. We also have systems that are in place that ensure that justice is served where it is needed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst to a certain extent, I am very concerned about some of the inaccuracies in the statements that Barbara Dreaver had stated, I appreciate the fact that she has continued to raise this issue, something that we are working at, as a country, but let me assure Fiji and our people, as well as for those who would like to visit our shores, that it is safe to come here. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- I thank the honourable Minister for that response. Drugs is the topic of the hour right now in Fiji, and they are saying about the zombie state and all the mess that is created by drugs. My question is, do we have drug cartels or criminal organisations here in Fiji that control the promotion and distribution of narcotic drugs? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for his supplementary question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drug situation in Fiji, as we understand it, is controlled, not only by people who come from abroad and bring drugs here for the ones that come from abroad, there are also those who are involved in these operations in Fiji and this has been going on for a while, as I have earlier stated. We, as a government and as a whole nation, are doing our best at this stage with the resources that we have to curtail this, and bring these people to justice. I have always acknowledged that drug is a social problem. The responsibility of the curtailment of drugs is the responsibility of everyone. When children take drugs, in the first instance,</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>922</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 it is their parents. We cannot blame anyone else for that. Then there is the rest of the society, then the Government, the lotu the vanua - we are all responsible for this. It is part of our responsibility that if you know people who deal with drugs in Fiji, then you must report them. We cannot condone these actions if we do not report them. We must report them, and the police must act on this. That is why, Mr. Speaker, Cabinet will approve this week, the new Narcotic Drug Strategy, as well as the Narcotic Bureau, which gives special powers to Government to deal with this. We must not have any mercy for these people - those who do this business, to kill our people and our children. I ask the public out there to, please, help every other member of this beautiful place and nation to help cure us of this problem that we have. We must not condone anyone who deals with illicit drug activities. That is not good for anyone in Fiji. MR. SPEAKER.- Maybe, I did not hear you properly, honourable Minister, on the thrust of the question that was provided by honourable Naisa. Are there cartels? Was that the question you are raising? Are they here in Fiji? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, we know that people are dealing in drugs in groups, whether we call them cartels or not, it is another issue. There are intelligence reports that suggest that there are groups of people who deal in this matter across the Fijian society and that is the proper word to use for them. But I would like to assure you that these are the people who we need to bring to justice, and they are the ones who are controlling these operations here. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is on the two areas that are being asked - the criminal activities and illegal border entries. On criminal activities, honourable Minister, this is just the lack of presence of police in our towns and cities. One of the biggest deterrent is when people see police out there, and I ask if you can get the police to go out there and be present. The second one on illegal entries which include both, personnel and contraband. I think you talked about the illegal entry of personnel. But for contraband, we know that ships are the high-risk carriers for contraband, compared to aircrafts because aircrafts cannot stop in mid-air and change cargo, but ships can. Aircrafts are tracked from point A to point B, but ships are not. Have you, for the time being, increased your port boarding and search operations where all the ships are coming in, local that you go in, board and search for illegal contraband? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, the question about police, I agree with you. Police must step up its activities, and I think this is the point that we continually remind the police that their presence is essential to providing confidence to the people. Government will continue to resource the police to be able to do that. I am looking forward to the appointment of the new Commissioner of Police, who, I hope, is going to make sure that they reset the directions for the police, including looking at the issue of their increased presence within our community. In terms of ship boarding, Mr. Speaker, some weeks back, I opened the Ship Boarding School that is run by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Togalevu. This is one of the areas where we will build our capacity on to be able to go out there and board the ships that we suspect. Also, with the arrival of the new vessels, I am glad that the Republic of Fiji Navy Ship, RFNS Puamau, added to the fleet, will be able to have a better maritime surveillance, better control and a better outlook out there in the sea, in our maritime zone, and also do boarding operations for</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>923 suspected either illegal fishing or some other transnational crime happening in the high seas. Thank you. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, with the high level of engagement that we have with our development partners, have we been able to secure more and more equipment, et cetera, at our border agencies, to ensure that they are not as porous as some may seem, and at the forefront, is obviously our airports? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, in terms of immigration and the systems at the border, I have spoken a little bit about some of the initiatives that we do. But in terms of enhancing the capabilities that we have at the border, we are working, in particular, with the Australian Immigration Department through the Ministry of Home Affairs, particularly in the different areas of capability that we need to have as a modern airport or as an area, or capabilities that are used throughout other airports in the world in terms of cameras, et cetera. I could name the whole thing for you, but suffice to say right now, we are working with our partners, particularly the Australians, in the areas of Home Affairs to help us build security around the frontlines, especially at the airport. HON. V. NATH.- Thank you, honourable Minister for your answers. Knowing that a lot of illegal activities happen in the Bligh Water and at sea and we know that Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) has very advanced tools, how are you utilising the tools, like the Automatic Identification System (AIS), to get the global positioning of the ships or yachts that enter our waters? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I thank the honourable Member for his question. That responsibility in terms of tracking yachts out there in the sea, is presently done by the Navy. They actually have a great system out there which is the AIS, and I would encourage every Member to go down there. You will see that they keep track, almost on real time, of the ships that are out there in the sea. This information is then shared with the rest of Government that deal in maritime security, including FRCS, FIMSA and Ministry of Fisheries. I would encourage every MP to go down there and take a look, at your own free time. Thank you. HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a follow up question. I thank the International Maritime Organization, the former Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, that we were able to secure those machines that MSAF has. It is an advanced system. I remember that there was a dialogue between Police, Navy and MSAF, to collaborate and use the joint equipment so that they can identify the position of these yachts. Is it still in talks, honourable Minister, the AIS system that I am talking about? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I think down at the Navy, they actually have this capability which literally looks at everything out there in the water. Then they use to coordinate the national effort to then go and look at it, also integrating air assets to go out and have a look. I am not quite familiar with that asset that is with MSAF, but I can tell you for sure that with the operations room down at the Navy, you can see every boat out there in the water. That is if they do not turn off their beacon, I think. Of course, it is illegal, if you turn off your beacon. That was how we tracked the drugs that were caught in Lautoka. We started monitoring this ship when it left Mexico in South America.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- It is not only drugs but human trafficking too:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Member, do address the Chair. You are making a running commentary with the honourable Minister. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, we all know that these drugs have probably gone to another level now. If we start talking about chemsex and bluetooth, how bad is that in the country</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>924</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 right now, honourable Minister? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I am always, not very emotional, but becomes very sentimental when it comes to drugs in this Parliament because there was a lot of discussions in the past revolving around this issue but I do not want to remain in the past. I am absolutely sure, Sir. I think the honourable Minister for Health has spoken very well about the issue of chemsex and also bluetooth. I am not an expert in that. I hear of stories when people gather and do these things - the young people who indulge in drugs and then go on and do these things at night. As far as I am concerned, I think the previous explanations by the expert is adequate enough. I think the more important thing is that we must realise that our children are doing this and that we must try to do everything to stop it. HON. P. K. RAVUNAWA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister. We are talking about all the new systems that are foreign to us, that come with glitches and other issues. We have a system in our nation - vanua, lotu and the Government. Will the honourable Minister consider the role of faith-based organisations in creating social awareness and willing to support them in this cause? HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the excellent question. The vanua and the lotu are at the centre of the fight against drugs. We are talking to them we are dialoguing with them and one of the last major ones that we had was held in the Fiji National University last week. I think I have even suggested to Government that Government must subsidise or it must fund the Church and the Vanua’s efforts to deal with drugs where it is appropriate because this is a problem, I have admitted in the past, cannot be dealt by Government alone. So, we need the help of the Vanua and we need the support of faith-based organisations and civil society organisations in the whole of our nation to deal with this. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the question is concerned definitely, faith-based organisations, na Vanua, na Lotu, ena vukea na cakacaka ‘qo. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in the same interview, there is this gentleman that is talking about the Pacific being used as a buffer zone between the target markets, Australia and New Zealand, which is basically saying that these people have intelligence - when the drugs is coming and then allows it to come into the Pacific, we deal with it here, before it goes into those markets. I know that the Forum is coming up. I agree with you that drugs cannot only be dealt with by Government, the Vanua, Lotu, but it has to be dealt with regionally also because it is trans-border. Perhaps, in the next Forum, the honourable Prime Minister is going to attend, where we can bring up this issue and tell these bigger countries, “Look, do not use us as a buffer zone. Try and get the drug before it hits the Pacific.” I think it is begging the honourable Prime Minister to take it up and we be a regional voice. I see he is laughing, and I know he will take it up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his statement, and that is acknowledged. I want to assure Parliament that our international partners are helping us in many ways to do this. But for the problem that we have, I think we should take every possible opportunity to indulge and stick with our partners about how they can help us more for the problem that we currently face. I thank you for that statement. MR. SPEAKER.- All I want to add to the exchanges that have been going around is that, we even have this problem in my village in Taveuni - that far. I have been hearing this global positioning</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>925 thing that you attach with the yachts and the boats, but a big load of drugs ended up in Nadi. It has come through that far to reach Nadi and imagine the ones that they sell in other places, like my village in Somosomo, Taveuni, they have all these are there. How it got there, that baffles me. We play our part in the Vanua. But what more could we do if we cannot even take the laws into our own hands? But we rely on the people that take care of the laws, but they keep pointing fingers. The putting of food on the table has affected this, poverty, and then unemployment and then the whole works and you remember these are villagers. That is all I want to add to this and, please, let us all join forces together in this one. We need to see that we work hand in hand on this and try and address this big problem that we are having now. The statistics and the data that was provided in Parliament on schools by the honourable Minister for Education, that was quite surprising that this has reached our school children. They become, what has been termed by the honourable Minister for Women, mules or something. They are being pushed around and moving these drugs but I hope good sense will prevail here and we will join hands in this. The country, as a whole, needs to tackle this big problem. External Review Committee (Question No.92/2024) HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the activities and findings of the External Review Committee appointed by the Higher Education Commission in November 2023 to assess Fiji’s Universities? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in response to the question by the honourable Member, the preparatory groundwork has been completed in terms of the work of the External Review Committee and they are ready to start the consultation with universities, as mandated in the Higher Education Act 2008. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister for Education is in regards to the appointment of the Review Committee. The appointment was done on 3 rd November, 2023. Does that appointment still stands or has it been revoked? I have been reliably informed that the appointment has been revoked. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- You have already answered your question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is already aware of the answer that will be coming from this end. Qo vaka e taro kila tale tiko mai. According, to the statement that you have made in this Parliament on 22 nd November, 2023, the Higher Education Commission took the initiative on and re-did the advertisement, calling for expression of interest, and they have made the appointment of the new External Review Committee. HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with the honourable Minister for Education that I suggested to the honourable Minister to re-look at the composition of the Review Committee. My question is, although the appointment lasted for a very short period of time, it must have come at a cost. What is the total cost incurred from that mistake? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a former HR Director of the Ministry of Education who is asking the question. He is aware of the appointment process that has been undertaken. The appointment that was done initially, there was no cost involved or incurred in terms of the External Review Committee that was appointed.</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>926</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, now that you have got a new team or new set of Committee established, by when do you expect the report to be out? We have already lost quite a bit of time in appointing committees rather than getting the committees to do their work. By when do you expect the report to be out? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the Committee, as mandated in the Act, usually takes a cycle of five years to seven years. The University of the South Pacific is the only University that was reviewed in 2019, so University of Fiji and Fiji National University have not been put through this process of review. The concerns that have been raised from students, parents and guardians whom their students have attended these Universities are many in terms of relevancy of the courses, duration of the courses, accessibility of the courses and the cost of attending the Universities. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the fifth year that guarantees and is mandated to have this University come under review because the last one was in 2019. They will be completing this review towards 30 th October, 2024. Because of the changes due to the concerns that were raised by the honourable Member, the initial deadline that was mentioned in this Parliament has been reviewed. Now, it is 30 th October, 2024. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for the replies to his questions. If I am approached, I may decide to do the EOI because it is more transparent. My question is, what sort of advice was given to him earlier on that led to the appointment of the initial set of committee members without going through the transparent processes of the EOI? What sort of advice was offered to him that led to the decision which was apparently a mistake? MR. SPEAKER.- I think that is a pretty difficult question to raise because you are asking about what sort of advice was given, but I leave it to the honourable Minister. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Sir, as I have earlier advised, the appointment was done according to the Higher Education Commission as per the decisions of the Higher Education Commissioners. Waste Management Operations (Question No. 93/2024) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the Nasinu Town Council, taking ownership of their waste management operations from Suva Municipal Council? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the honourable Member for asking the question. That is a very important question because I think this week, there were some issues, there were some comments made about garbage collection around Nasinu Town. Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a brief background on the garbage collection services at Nasinu Town boundaries, in the past, there were a lot of issues regarding solid waste collection by the residents of Nasinu, as well as the ratepayers. There was an initiative that started in 2020 where the Suva City Council came on board, there was an agreement signed between Suva City Council and Nasinu Town Council for the Suva City Council to take over garbage collection services around Nasinu Town areas.</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>24 th May, 2024</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>927 With that, there were five garbage trucks, three open trucks and a backhoe which is still owned by Nasinu Town Council but used by Suva City Council. When Suva City Council did garbage collection and they engaged a total of 25 staff to assist them in their collection of solid waste around Nasinu Town areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, now, the Council to Council have come to an agreement that there is a need to separate their services because the initial agreement is now going to expire in July 2024. For August, 2024, it is expected that Nasinu Town Council will take over the collection of rubbish within its own Municipality. We need to also understand that Nasinu is a big area. Currently, there is a total of about 11,252 rateable properties, as well as about 17 informal settlements, with 1,317 households. So, in total, Nasinu Town Council has to service an area which has 12,569 properties and a population of around 65,000. Within the Nasinu Town boundary, there are seven wards and iit is now the responsibility of the Special Administrators. I have faith in the Special Administrators who are going to take this on board and also come up with new strategies on improving the solid waste management services around Nasinu Town areas. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. L. S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister a supplementary question; you are talking about waste collection, can you clarify waste collection in the different delegated boundaries, please? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, each Municipal Council within Fiji is responsible for collection and disposal of solid waste within their municipal boundaries, including peri-urban as well as rural areas. The collection of waste in delegated areas is subsidised by the Fijian Government. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this started in 2018, whereby all the 13 Municipal Councils were given the responsibility to collect kitchen waste from the extended boundaries, usually managed by the Rural Local Authority. For the current financial year, $2.25 million has been granted to support those Municipal Councils that were not in a financial position to fully cover hard and green waste collection costs. What is happening right now is Municipal Councils have extended their services to those areas like Nausori is now looking after Korovou, Lami is also now looking after Navua, Savusavu Town Council is now looking after Nabouwalu areas, and the Government is going to continue with subsiding these costs to ensure that we collect rubbish from all these areas by the respective municipalities. MR. SPEAKER.- Who is looking after Lami, honourable Minister?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Lami Town Council has now extended its services to Navua:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- It is clearer now. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, it needs to be clarified. I recall the honourable Deputy Prime Minister making a statement and asking; whose idea was this to transfer the trucks to Suva City Council? Mr. Speaker, Sir, shared services is very much legal within the law, and this was the first time we were trying to look at waste management as essential as water and electricity. The idea was to form a waste management company, owned by these three Municipalities so that they can combine their resources together and provide a thorough and a better efficient services. But, of course, the process started, unfortunately, we had COVID-19, and you know what all happened after that.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>928</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>24 th May, 2024 Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is, that in the last Budget, there was a reduction of $1.5 million for the services to be provided to the rural areas. How has that reduction affected the service collection? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reduction in the grant actually does not affect the services provided by Municipal Councils because if you look at bigger Councils like Suva and Lautoka, they have sufficient funds to support delegated areas. It is the smaller Councils where the Government comes in and assist the provision of services, especially the garbage collection services, which is an essential service. The medium and smaller Councils do not have the means or the income to support these services. Currently, with the cut in budget, that reduction is only to cater for those medium to smaller Councils that do not have the financial means to manage these services. MR. SPEAKER.- I just make this quicker announcement, honourable Members. As a matter of housekeeping and for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders, with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move the suspension motion.</p></body>
