L. RABUKA.- Madam Secretary-General, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public who may be watching us via television and livestream or listening to their radios. Ni sa bula vinaka and a very good morning to you all. Madam Secretary-General, I rise in accordance with Standing Order 17(4) to propose the name of Mr. Justice Filimone Jitoko as the new Speaker to preside over this august House. Mr. Justice Jitoko was born on 3rd October, 1949, in Kabara, Lau, to his parents, Mr. Isireli Rarawa and Mrs. Leba Wainise. He is a proud husband of Mrs. Elina Senirewa Jitoko, and they are doting parents of two sons and two daughters. From his humble beginnings at a District School in Kabara, and later attending Ratu Kadavulevu School and Queen Victoria School, Mr. Justice Jitoko has become a distinguished Pacific Jurist, a diplomat and an academic. He is an outstanding son of Fiji. A keen sportsman, he was a member of the Fiji Secondary Schools Rugby Team in 1969. Prior to that, he captained the Queen Victorian School First XV Rugby Team, as well as the school cricket, hockey and athletics team. Mr. Justice Jitoko read law at the Victoria University of Wellington from 1972 to 1976. While there, he was a member of the cricket and rugby team of the University. He was admitted to the New Zealand Bar and the Bar of the High Court of Fiji in 1978. He has had a storied legal career as a State Law Officer, rising to the position of Solicitor- General and later, stints as Resident Magistrate and Puisne Judge of the High Court of Fiji. Mr. Justice Jitoko also served as the Legal Advisor to the Bose Levu Vakaturaga from 1988 to1994. The apex of his professional career, most recently, is as President of the Fiji Court of Appeal and prior to that, as Chief Justice of the Republic of Nauru. As a Diplomat, Madam Secretary-General, he served as Fiji’s Ambassador to the Court of St. James in the United Kingdom and also was accredited to the Holy See, Denmark and Israel. He also served as Counsellor at our Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York and at our Embassy to the United States in Washington D. C. As a senior and trustworthy civil servant, Mr. Justice Jitoko served as Secretary to Cabinet. He also briefly joined Academia as a Senior Lecturer at the School of Islands and Oceans as well as the School of Law in the University of the South Pacific.</p><div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div><p>2212 Election of the Speaker of the Republic of Fiji 12 th Nov., 2024 On Community Service, Madam Secretary-General, another significant highlight is Mr. Justice Jitoko’s fiduciary service to his vanua and community in giving back to the nation. Mr. Justice Jitoko has served as Chairman of the Kabara Development Corporation from 1992 to 1996, as well as the Ratu Mara Education Trust Board. He had also served as Governor on the Adi Cakobau School Board of Governors and President of Fiji Cricket Association as well as the Queen Victoria School Old Boy’s Club. In conclusion, Madam Secretary-General, Mr. Justice Jitoko as an eminent Jurist, illustrious Diplomat, senior Civil Servant and Academic, is well regarded and well respected. I have, no doubt, that his sense of fairness and commitment to uphold the parliamentary democracy in this land at all times will make him an excellent holder of this High Office. He will bring outstanding leadership, communication and strategic thinking credentials and gravitas to the Office of the Speaker in guiding parliamentary debate and ensuring that the people of this nation participate in their governance. The Coalition Government has an ambitious and intricate legislative agenda and his brilliant qualities as a Jurist will ensure that Parliament make laws that are user-friendly, coherent and navigable. As Lord Bingham had said, the law should be, and I quote: “accessible and so far as possible intelligible, clear and predictable.” Mr. Justice Jitoko’s distinguished national, regional and international service as an outstanding Jurist, illustrious Diplomat and Academic makes him eminently suitable to take the Chair as Speaker of this august House. Therefore, Madam Secretary-General, I commend his name to the House for election as our Speaker. SECRETARY-GENERAL.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his nomination. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Secretary-General, I move: That Mr. Ruveni Nadalo do take the Chair of Parliament as Speaker. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Secretary-General, I as a stand-alone and Independent Member of Parliament, second the name of Mr. Ruveni Nadalo to be the Speaker of Parliament. SECRETARY-GENERAL.- I now invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition to give a brief account of the nominee’s credentials. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Secretary-General, I rise in accordance with Standing Order 17(4) as well and as the Leader of the Opposition, I have announced our nomination for Speaker of Parliament, Mr. Ruveni Nadalo, who was a former Deputy Speaker of Parliament as well during the term of Parliament from 2014 to 2018. Honourable Members, Mr. Ruveni Nadalo is a proud son of Batiri, Malomalo, Nadroga to the late Isikeli Nadalo. A long serving member of the National Federation Party, who inspired Mr. Nadalo’s interest in politics at a very tender age and Mr. Nadalo was raised in one of the most politically active families in Fiji then and grew up instilled in the values of public service and commitment to serving the interest of the people of Fiji. His late father left behind a legacy as a champion for multiracial representation and regional interest which profound the influence of Mr. Nadalo in his approach to leadership. He is also a distinguished leader in the vanua, particularly in his tikina of Malomalo in Nadroga, and has also served as the Chairman of the Nadroga/Navosa Provincial Council from the years 2019 to 2022. He has demonstrated during his term as Deputy Speaker of Parliament the capability to handle parliamentary affairs. He has also during his term as</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>12 th Nov., 2024 Election of the Speaker of the Republic of Fiji 2213 a parliamentarian served as a Member of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, on the Business Committee, the House Committee, and as Deputy Speaker was also chair of the Privileges Committee. His experience as Deputy Speaker helped him to acquire a deeper understanding of the procedures of Parliament, the capacity to preside over the passage of legislation and the ability to oversee debates in an impartial and effective manner. His suitability of a Speaker, therefore, is unquestionable. He has also had various international engagements in serving under those capacities and this has put him in good stand to assume the position of Speaker. In nominating Mr. Nadalo, we are very confident that he will not only continue the kind of leadership of Speakers before him, but also raise the level of service that Fiji requires of this critical position. Mr. Nadalo is committed to fostering a culture of respect and inclusivity in Parliament and will lead Parliament with integrity and wisdom.
