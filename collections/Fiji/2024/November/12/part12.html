<body><h3>SECRETARY-GENERAL.-</h3><h4>SECRETARY-GENERAL.-</h4><p>Votes cast: Mr. Justice Filimone Jitoko Mr. Ruveni Nadalo - 34 - 15 Pursuant to Section 77 of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and Standing Order 17(10), I hereby declare Mr. Justice Filimone Jitoko as Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Acclamation) I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament and the honourable Viliame Naupoto to escort honourable Filimone Jitoko to the table to take the Oath of Allegiance and of Office. [Honourable Filimone Jitoko escorted and sworn in as the Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji and takes his seat in the Chamber.] (Acclamation) MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Attorney-General, honourable Ministers and Members of Parliament, distinguished guests in the public gallery and those tuning in to the television broadcast and livestream.</p><p>12 th Nov., 2024 Election of the Speaker of the Republic of Fiji 2215 As your newly elected Speaker, first and foremost, I give thanks to the Almighty God for this great honour bestowed on me, for His blessings and favour. Second, my sincere appreciation to the honourable Prime Minister for nominating me and having the trust in me to carry the duties and responsibilities that come with this high Office. Third, I sincerely thank the honourable Members of this Parliament for the confidence you have placed on me to serve in this august assembly as your Speaker. I am deeply humbled for by trust that you have bestowed on me, and I take all these responsibilities with the hope that I will be able to follow in the footsteps of the illustrious previous occupants of this Chair. I intend to listen to and to work with each one of you to continue the work of my venerable predecessor Na Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau in transforming our Parliament to be an effective and efficient instrument in serving our people and our beloved nation. I recognise and pay tribute to the indigenous Fijians, the iTaukei, and the owners of this land, Tui Suva, and the vanua on which this Parliament of Fiji is situated for their generosity and charity in allowing us to build, reside and to meet on this soil. Honourable Members, allow me to congratulate you for the progress you have achieved in your service to the people of Fiji in the last two years of the life of this Parliament. Please, allow me also to take this occasion to recognise the support and the backing provided by my family for me, and like all our families, they have remained pillars of strength and our never- ending sources of support and inspiration to each of us to do good for this nation. For me, I thank my family sincerely for their unwavering support, knowing that I will now be spending just a little bit more time in this Chamber and its precincts. In my humble view, the seat I am now occupying is one that is entrusted with the highest level of responsibility. It requires a vigilant devotion to the rules and principles of parliamentary democracy, guided by the three basic tenets namely that all members have equal rights and privileges as well as obligations; that the will of the majority prevails and must be carried out; and finally, the rights of the minority must be preserved. This position also in addition requires a progressive outlook to always constantly look for solutions and sustainable pathways to strengthen democracy in Fiji. I am not and have never been a politician and this environment I now find myself in is, while new, I consider it a challenge, but the basic rules of dispensing justice as was the objective in my previous calling, equally applies here. Finally, with this appointment, I now would have served in all the three branches of government - the Executive dealing with the enforcement of the law, the Judiciary dealing with the interpretation of the law, and now the Legislature, the supreme law making authority of this land. I could not have asked and wished for a more fulfilling life of almost 50 years of my public service to my beloved country. May God bless us all. In the famous words of our revered statesman Ratu Sir Lala Vanayaliyali Sukuna: “Floreat Viti”. May God bless Fiji. Thank you, honourable Members.</p><h4>Adjournment</h4><p>12 th Nov., 2024</p></body>
