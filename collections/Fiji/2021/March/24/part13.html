</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I move that:</p>
<p><span>Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Fiji  Independent 

Commission  Against  Corruption  Annual  Report  2014  and  2015  which  was  abled  on  15th 

May, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I now invite the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law</p>
<p><span>and Human Rights to speak on his motion.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker, I take this  opportunity  as  the  Member  moving  the 

motion to make a small contribution on the Committees Report on the Review of Fiji Independent 

Commission Against Corruption Annual Report 2014 and 2015. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, by way of a brief background the two mentioned Annual Reports were referred 

to  the  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  Committee  of  the  last  term  of  the  Parliament  and  then 

reinstated in this new Parliament and referred to the current Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 

Human Rights. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee which I am the Chairperson of, thoroughly deliberated on the Annual Report 

and  the  findings  by  the  previous  Committee,  which  highlighted  a  few  pertinent  matters that  were 

discussed with the representative of FICAC.  Some of these pertinent matters include; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The awareness programme of FICAC and its effectiveness; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The process of investigation and the various forms of complaints that come under the 

</span><span>ambit of FICAC; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>FICAC policy and structure with respect to the protection of whistle-blowers; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(4)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>FICAC human resources and its ability to provide the necessary services and certain 

discrepancies in the financial statement of the report; 

</span></p>
<p><span>The committee deliberated on the discussion held with the FICAC representative and noted 

that this discussion were beneficial to the review since it has provided specific clarification on the 

issues that had been identified.  It also reveal the tremendous work being carried out by FICAC and 

the future plans being put in place; 

</span></p>
<p><span>If I may Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to provide a few brief points on this discussion that 

</span><span>were carried out with the representative of FICAC as noted from the Review document appended 

</span><span>and uploaded with the committee report.  The numerous issues highlighted by the Committee were

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>adequately  responded  to.    It  was  encouraging  to  note  that  FICAC’s  work  involves  remedies  and 

redress  for  corruption-affected  members  of  the  public  and  its  work  towards  the  prevention  of 

corruption.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally,  legislations  and  policy  that  govern  the  Commission’s  work  also  provides 

adequate  protection  for  whistle-blowers.    Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  in  terms  of  the  financial 

anomalies highlighted, the Committee acknowledges and appreciates the clarification provided by 

the Commission where, amongst other things, it was highlighted that the Commission had acted upon 

the recommendation by the Auditor-General in 2013 to accept and adopt the International Financial 

Reporting Standard (IFRS) for small and  medium entities.  The Commission has also transitioned 

from semi-accruals to cash basis accounting to full accrual as per the IFRS for SME’s.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee also noted the deliberations on the principles of gender equality 

and shares the sentiments by the previous Committee, appreciating the fact that there was a gap in 

placing emphasis on such requirements when the Annual Report was drafted and initially tabled in 

Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With those few remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity, to make a short 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate.  </span><span>Vinaka. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Chairperson for his motion:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate.  I give the floor to the Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tikoduadua, you have the floor Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before 

I make a brief observation on the review report of the consolidated reports of the Fiji Independence 

Commission Against Corruption.  I wish to comment on what the Honourable Minister Koya said 

last night while speaking on the Legislature review report of 2014-2015. 

</span></p>
<p><span>He  said  in  response  to  the  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  who  had  outlined  how  the 

parliamentary office funding formula was changed at the end of 2014, that the old NFP survived on 

far less funding.  Assumptions, Honourable Minister Koya is the mother of all ills, literally having a 

stranglehold on our beloved nation despite the so-called womb that he has been harping about for the 

past two days.   

</span></p>
<p><span>What the Honourable Leader of the NFP emphasised was the change in formula of funding, 

</span><span>not its monetary value.  He said quite clearly that there should have been an established sum topped 

up by the size of the Party.  Of course, as the largest Party, FijiFirst would have received more, and 

that would have been fair because the base level of financial resourcing would have been in place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is  not about 32, 27, 21 on three Members of Parliament but 

fairplay.   If the same thing, as we heard last evening from the Honourable Minister, is applied to the 

salaries of Cabinet Ministers, then Ministers before 2006 were getting $100,000 less than what the 

current Cabinet Ministers were getting until the 20 percent cut last April, but it is still substantially 

much more.  So, please Honourable Minister, compare apples with apples.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the report that is being debated, I note that the Committee 

has no issues to raise on the Annual Reports of FICAC for the years 2014 and 2015.  The Committee 

made this assessment because it did not have the scope to critically examine activities and legislative 

</span><span>provisions in respect of FICAC post 2015, thereby, confining itself to the two reports.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="65">Page 65</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>907 

</span></p>
<p><span>No doubt, it is examining other reports of records of FICAC tabled in Parliament, but, Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  five  to  seven  years  ahead  of  the  reports  that  were  reviewed.    The  Deputy 

Commissioner  who  authorised  these  reports  is  no  longer  there  and  FICAC  has  a  new  Deputy 

Commissioner.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  may  recall  that  in  May  2019,  by  way  of  an  amendment  Bill  under 

Standing Order 51, the Honourable Attorney-General, who happens to be the Minister responsible 

for FICAC, got Parliament to approve changes to the Principle Act, which was a Decree established 

in FICAC in April, 2007.  The changes were in respect of appointments of FICAC Commissioner 

and  Deputy  Commissioner.    Of  course,  the  reason  given  was  to regularise  the  appointments  with 

other independent officers, like the Director of Public Prosecution.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  President  is  the  appointing  authority,  following  recommendations  by  the  Judicial 

Services Commission in consultation with the Honourable Attorney-General.  One thought then, in 

the  way  the  Bill  was  worded,  that  both  the  Commissioner  and  Deputy  Commissioner  would  be 

persons qualified to hold a Judicial Office either a Magistrate or a Judge.  Parliament was informed 

by  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  that  this  was  not  the  case.    As  I  said,  we  have  a  Deputy 

Commissioner and since the inception of FICAC, through a promulgation, we have always heard of 

</span><span>a Deputy Commissioner, no Commissioner.  Perhaps, the Acting Honourable Attorney- General can 

</span><span>clarify why this is and has been the case.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact that FICAC was created in  April 2007, was in view to justify the 

logical claim of the </span><span>coup </span><span>being necessary to stop corruption or a clean-up campaign.   Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, 14 years later, we all know what has been cleaned up and it is not corruption.  Because only last 

month we were told by the Honourable Attorney- General that the Opposition could not grasp the 

seriousness  of  corruption  and  he  justified  the  creation  of  this  separate  division  of  the  Court to  be 

known as the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court of Fiji.   What does it tell us?   

</span></p>
<p><span>The only answer is, corruption is on the rise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC or no FICAC.  Last 

night, I accessed the FICAC website.  The statistics at the bottom of the webpage are startling to say 

the  least,  in  terms  of  FICAC’s  role  as  preventing  corruption  and  successfully  prosecuting  those 

accused  of  such  crimes.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  these  statistics  on  FICAC  webpage  shows  the 

following:  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>complaints received - 67,417;  

cases investigated - 1,570;  

</span><span>individuals charged -366; and  

</span><span>individuals convicted -116.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This shows that the success rate of FICAC is abysmal.  It is 0.2 percent success rate in terms 

of  conviction  and  number  of  complaints  received,  and  31  percent  compared  to  the  number  of 

individuals charged.  We need to know the reasons for this, because it clearly shows that more than 

97  percent of  complaints  received  by  FICAC,  are  not  investigated,  as they  must  be  frivolous  and 

baseless.  Only 2.32 percent of complaints or 1,570 complaints were investigated.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  FICAC is also authorised to deal with complaints lodged by the Supervisor 

</span><span>of Elections in respect of alleged breaches of electoral and Political Parties, a Registration, Conduct 

Funding and Disclosures  Act.  Three cases that come to mind are those of the  former SODELPA 

Whip, Ratu Isoa Tikoca, former SODELPA Leader, Sitiveni Rabuka and the Minister for Agriculture.  

All three were acquitted, but it must have cost thousands of dollars to hire lawyers to defend that, not 

</span><span>to mention psychological trauma associated with factors hanging over their heads.

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the outcome of these cases necessitate FICAC to relook at its role as the policing 

authority following referral to it of cases by the Supervisor of Elections (SOE).  The FICAC needs 

to clearly define what action constitutes breach of laws and what is frivolous.  If the same standards 

are applied by the SOE and FICAC for political parties and MPs that are applied to the civil service, 

permanent  secretaries,  heads  of  departments  and  even  ministers  under  the  doctrine  of  ministerial 

responsibility, many of them would be charged and hauled to court for all the anomalies that we have 

been debating while reviewing the audit reports. Thankfully, it is not the case and those responsible 

are given time to correct their errors. This is not accorded to political parties who are slapped with 

suspensions, threats of deregistration and referred to FICAC.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Essentially,  Mr.  Speaker,  independent  institutions  like  FICAC  must  not  be  used  as  an 

oppressive tool by any Government and not report to any Government minister except the President, 

in my view. I thank you, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Tikoduadua for his contribution to the debate:</span> I</p>
<p><span>now give the floor to the Honourable Mosese Bulitavu. You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. M.D. BULITAVU.:</span> Thank you, Honourable Speaker, Sir. I rise to make a very shortcontribution to the Report that is before the House.  First of all, I would like to say it is a bipartisanReport and also a consensus-based Report which Members on both sides of the House agreed to.</p>
<p><span>All  we  have  to  understand  is  that  Section  115  of  the  Constitution  establishes  the  Fiji 

Independent Commission Against Corruption, and Section 115(7) of the Constitution, establishes Fiji 

adopting  the  United  Nations  Convention  Against  Corruption  -  when  Fiji  adopted  that,  probably 

because it had been adopted by United Nations in October, 2003 and entered into force in 2005 - the 

domestication process included the countries that had acceded to that to put the domestic measures 

in terms of the various aspirations and spirit of that Convention.   

</span></p>
<p><span>All countries which were signatories of that particular Convention Against Corruption were 

to take the necessary steps and even parliamentary actions to see that laws, processes and policies in 

place were in line with the international convention.  As rightfully mentioned by the previous speaker, 

there were no issues raised by the Committee, and it did not find any contentious issues in the Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Most  of  the  things  were  clarified  and  if  you  read  the  verbatim  of  the  Committee  on  this 

particular  Report,  you  will  see  the  current  Deputy  Commissioner  of  FICAC,  Mr.  Rashmi  Aslam, 

clarifying the organisation’s structure in terms of appointment of the Deputy Commissioner.   Also 

</span><span>in the case of a vacancy, it becomes an </span><span>ex officio</span><span> status on how they are to report.  We had another 

</span><span>round  of  submissions  by  FICAC  where  the  Legal  Officer,  Mrs.  Naliva,  also  confirmed  to  us  the 

various cases and jurisdiction which falls within the ambit of FICAC - they were focusing only on 

corruption cases and not on non-corruption related issues.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The previous speaker rightly said that the amount of complaints received and data is available 

on the FICAC website - you will see the amount of complaints that is there, cases investigated, those 

that have been charged and convicted but overall, that does not show the performance of FICAC but 

only to see how most of those reports were coming in, you know complaints, but there are processes 

of assessment within FICAC mechanism, where they assess cases independently and whether that is 

to be dealt with them, or they refer it to other authorities to be taken care of because it is not within 

their jurisdiction or ambit. 

</span></p>
<p><span>That is some of the issues, probably it would clear some of the doubts. But again, as Members 

</span><span>of Parliament, and as a member of this Committee, I think the vision of FICAC is to ensure that the 

</span><span>people of Fiji live in a life free of corruption.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="67">Page 67</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>909 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think that should be our duty, as Members of Parliament, as public office holders and also 

public figures, to see that we advocate a community, a nation and also a village wherever we are, a 

constituency which is corruption free.  We must play the lead role in terms of that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  last  sitting  of  Parliament,  we  have  seen  a  special  court  created  to  look  into  anti-

corruption cases, which are to some, it would mean that they will remove the backlog and also the 

increasing cases that are there and the other interpretation but it is already an Act now. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Another issue probably this is just for me to share to us whether it will come up in the future, 

but something for us to note as we are just debating to note the Committee recommendation.   Some 

of  the  other  Bills  probably  are  within  the  Committee  and  some  have  been  tabled  to  Parliament 

awaiting for a date to be debated. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The institution of FICAC, the role is slowly increasing and the ambit is getting wider and the 

jurisdiction  on  some  of  the  laws  that  will  be  currently  passed,  will  be  administered  by  them  on 

prosecution functions. 

</span></p>
<p><span>That is given the wording of the 2013 Constitution, where it says on Section 115(4):  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Without prejudice to subsection (3), the Commission may - 

</span></p>
<p><span>(a)</span><span>
</span><span>(b)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(c)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>investigate, institute and conduct criminal proceedings; 

take over  investigations and  criminal proceedings that fall under  its responsibility and 

functions as prescribed by law, and which may have been initiated by another person or 

authority; and 

discontinue, at any stage before judgement is delivered, criminal proceedings instituted 

or conducted by it”. 

</span></p>
<p><span>If we  look at the evolution of this  institution  in terms of the amendment that took place  in 

June 2016, which has empowered FICAC to enable to investigate and prosecute money laundering 

offences  under  the  procedure  of  Crime  (Amendment)  Act  2004  and  also  the  Electoral  Act  2004 

provides that all election related criminal offence under the Electoral Act will be reported to FICAC. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other role that FICAC will now play as proposed by the Code of Conduct Bill (Bill No. 

33 of 2018) proposed that FICAC will be the prosecuting authority for breaches of provisions of the 

proposed law which is yet to come.  The passing of the Cybercrime Bill 2020 (Bill No. 11 of 2020) 

</span><span>will also empower a person duly authorised by the Commissioner of FICAC to investigate and carry 

</span><span>out functions, as prescribed by law. 

</span></p>
<p><span>But as we go along  in  future, given the evolution of this particular  institution and also the 

power  that  is  vested  in  it,  there  is  a  role  in  Section  115(14)  of  the  Constitution  which  says  that 

Parliament shall ensure that adequate funding and resources are made available to the Commission 

to enable it to independently and effectively exercise its powers and perform its functions and duties.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  is  where  I  am  talking  from,  probably  given  that  the  Bills  are  coming  through  our 

Committee  and  the  ambit  of  FICAC  is  increasing,  probably  more  training  is  needed  to  FICAC 

investigators and the lawyers on the different laws that will be coming under their ambit now and the 

various administrations of the particular law, Cybercrime, Electoral laws not only focused on pure 

anti-corruption offences but it has gone to a wider jurisdiction.  I think that should be considered in 

future on how we resource this particular institution, so that it attains its vision and mission and also 

</span><span>its purposes in the 2013 Constitution.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Sir.

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Bulitavu for his contribution to the debate:</span> I give</p>
<p><span>the floor to the Honourable Nawaikula, you have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> I am sorry, Sir, I am not contributing to this debate.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Tuisawau, you have the floor.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the Standing</p>
<p><span>Committee Report on the Consolidated Review Report on the FICAC Annual Report 2014 and 2015.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the outset, as indicated by the contributors today on this report, it seems that FICAC  is 

now over burden with a lot of cases.  It is an issue which we need to grapple in this House, the over 

burdening  of  FICAC.    The  way  I  see  it,  it  is  affecting  its  operations  and  effectiveness.    The 

Constitution is clear on the role of FICAC in Section 115.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I want to raise in this House the issue of Accountability and Transparency Commission. That 

Commission can complement the work of FICAC in terms of accountability of public officers, which 

is specified in Section 121 and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Sections establishes accountability and transparency commission, shall consist of 

a Chairperson and two other members appointed by the Commission on the advice of the 

Judicial Services Commission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>3.   The Chairperson of the Commission must be a person which qualify to be appointed 

</span></p>
<p><span>as a Judge.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other important section is Section 121(9) and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“A written law shall provide the Commission with the jurisdiction authority and 

powers  to  receive  any  investigate  complaints  against  Permanent  Secretaries  and  all 

persons holding public office including those holding Ministerial offices and also MPs” 

</span></p>
<p><span>The way I see it, it is a specialised area in terms of the public sector, the different laws which 

governed it, including the Finance Act rather than the general, I suppose, mandate given to FICAC. 

That  is  a  suggestion  generally  in  relation  to  section  121  -  Accountability  and  Transparency 

Commission to complement FICAC.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of the 2015 Report itself, Page 58, it is stated that the Commission is controlled by 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Government of Fiji, in accordance with FICA Promulgation 2007.    

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of public perceptions about FICAC today, there seems to be a lack of trust in FICAC 

in terms of its independence and they have stated this in their report that they are controlled by the 

Government  of  Fiji.    The  Committee  asked  them  for  clarification  on  this  and  they  did  make  the 

clarification  that  this  is  in  terms  of  funding,  et  cetera.  But  if  you  look  at  the  FICAC  Decree  or 

Promulgation Act 2007, Section 55says and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span> “Officer of the Commissioner: 

</span></p>
<p><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Commissioner shall be appointed by the President” 

2   and 3 - Hold office 

</span><span>4.  Commissioner other than an acting Commissioner shall not, while he  holds the office of 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Commissioner discharge duties of any other prescribed officer.

</span></p>
<p><span>911 

</span></p>
<p><span>5.  The Commissioner may seek the assistance and input of the Attorney-General.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>In our view, it is a problem because it states that it is independent.  Section 55 which they 

seek the assistance and input of the Attorney-General and our view is that, that puts into question its 

independence.    The  FICAC  response  that  Government  does  not  control  it,  about  the  comment,  it 

merely refers to the fact, as I mentioned, that it is funded by annual grants.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Another point we would like to raise, it is misleading to call FICAC a Commissioner because 

all decisions are made by a single person not a Commission, for example, the Constitutional Officers 

Commission which is the prosecuting authority.  So, it gives FICAC powers of criminal investigation, 

et cetera, yet the Commissioner is appointed by the President on the advice of the Judicial Services 

Commission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is very difficult in reality for the FICAC Commissioner to be independent under the current 

structure.    Even  if  you  look  at  the  evolution  of  FICAC  straight  after  the  2006  coup,  it  was 

unfortunately been used, I suppose to harm political opponents.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Since 2007, the Office of the Attorney-General, has been continuously having consultations 

</span><span>with FICAC, in directing FICAC prosecution and we note that there has  been a lot of those who are 

</span><span>deemed to be political opponents prosecuted; Ms. Imrana Jalal, Mr. Sakiusa Tuisolia, Mr. Sitiveni 

Rabuka and others.  So, there is a concern this is a real perception that FICAC has been used as a tool 

for  political  oppression  and  also  victimisation  and that  is  the  perception  which  is  out there  and  it 

needs to be corrected.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to share a few cases regarding what I am trying to share today. There has been 

cases  where  reports  have  been  made  to  FICAC.    I  shared  one  yesterday,  regarding  the  Water 

Authority of Fiji digger and the time lapsed.  This was reported in 2019 but it came out of  a report 

and discussed by the board in 2017 and we still have to hear how that has progressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of  course,  the  case  involving  a  Government  consultancy  contract  awarded  to  Suva 

Accounting Firm, Aliz Pacific, owned by Dr. Nur Bano Ali. The structure of the new Rewa Dairy, 

the contract of $500,000, no tender was called by the Ministry of Commerce and Trade at that time 

in which the Honourable Khaiyum was the Minister for Commerce.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is a clear breach of Governments Tender process and it was taken to court by Dr. Nur 

Bano Ali of the BDO but the court established appeals and agreed with the High Court when the 

</span><span>Auditor-General was acting in persons of statutory duties and trusted to him in questioning the award 

</span><span>of  the  tender.    Dr.  Nur  Bano  found  that  the  Auditor-Generals  conduct  therefore,  could  not  be 

classified as malicious as claimed by Dr. Nur Bano. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The judges said malice cannot be imputed and awarded cost against Aliz Pacific of $5,000. 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, that was the case which was reported but not pursued by FICAC.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The other one which BDO handled was the salary payments between 2010 and 2013 of the 

Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Attorney-General.  The instructions related to these 

payments should be  made public that these are public  funds and this again, were  in  breach of the 

Finance Act and the people need to know how much have been paid. 

</span></p>
<p><span>These anomalies was revealed in the Auditor-General Report 2014 and has not been resolved, 

despite repeated request from the Public Accounts Committee for acquittals.  Again, it refers to the 

</span><span>same organisation, individuals and FICAC has decided not to pursue it. But in the case of political

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>opponents, for example in the case of Mr. Sitiveni Rabuka just before the Elections in 2018, it was 

reported that he had breached the Electoral Act by making a false declaration on his assets.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again,  this  case  showed  that  this  was  just  a  case  of  political  victimisation  just  before  the 

elections when he was found not guilty.  I am trying to express here some of the cases which creates 

the perception of independence or lack of independence of FICAC.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The other case which we had raised here was QORVIS, the engagement without tender on 

the COP23. Again, this was reported to FICAC, documents provided and there was a breach of the 

procurement, regulations of government where all such contracts should be tendered and that was 

not done. Again, this was not accepted by FICAC.   

</span></p>
<p><span>These  are  just  are  few  I  am  sharing  and  when  we  look  at  these  cases,  we  question  the 

independence of FICAC.  Just recently on the appointment of the Secretary-General to Parliament.  

Sir, FICAC wrote a letter to the Constitutional Offices Commission commenting on the performance 

of the Secretary-General to Parliament, which is not in their mandate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  performance  of  the  Secretary-General  to  Parliament  is  under  the  mandate  of  the  

</span><span>Speaker.  So how come such a letter from FICAC resulted in the non-renewal of her contract?  That 

</span><span>is the question which we need to ask.  Who instigated FICAC to write that letter? 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order:</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Member has been going on for a 

while.  The Report does not contain the cases.  We do not scrutinise the cases dealt with by FICAC.  

We deal with the operations, we scrutinise the operations, their budgetary allocation, et cetera.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The cases that FICAC deals with neither the Committee for Justice, Law and Human Rights, 

nor the Chambers should be discussing it because that is not part of the Report.  We do not scrutinise, 

we have not brought it back to Parliament.  Why is the Honourable Member talking about the cases 

that are before FICAC or FICAC has dealt with those cases?  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- You have made your point:</span> Honourable Member, you have got that?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor:</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Thank  you.    My  contention  is  that  I  am  questioning  the 

independence of FICAC.  That is why I am sharing the cases in order for us to understand the basis 

of  what  I  am  saying  and  that  is  why  I  am  sharing  the  cases.    I  wanted  to  establish  that  I  am  not 

speaking out of thin air, I am sharing the cases and expressing the concern not only of myself but the 

general public generally that FICAC is not independent.  It has been used as a tool of oppression and 

political victimisation from 2006 up to now when it was established by promulgation in 2007. 

</span></p>
<p><span>From  then  till  now,  you  look  at  the  amount  of  Government  opponents  who  have  been 

</span><span>prosecuted under FICAC.  That is only what I am saying.  The last one which I raised questions the 

</span><span>independence of the Constitutional Offices Commission where they accepted that letter from FICAC

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>913 

</span></p>
<p><span>on the performance of the Secretary-General to Parliament, Mrs. Viniana Namosimalua.  They should 

not have accepted that because the person who assess the performance of Secretary-General is the 

Office of the Speaker.  Why did FICAC interfere?   

</span></p>
<p><span>That is  my contention and that is why I am sharing these cases regarding FICAC which  is 

why  I  am  saying  the  Commission  which  should  deal  with  public  officers,  et  cetera  should  be 

established, the Transparency Commission in order to compliment FICAC. That is the reasoning I 

am trying to give today so that Government moves and establishes a Transparency Commission to 

complement FICAC so there is separation between what FICAC is doing and the conduct of public 

officers.  What happened there should be reported to the Transparency Commission for investigation 

because FICAC cannot investigate itself.  That is my contention today, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To conclude I would like to just respond to some issues from the previous debate that there 

</span></p>
<p><span>was a comment regarding the previous debate, that there was a comment regarding….

thing there before.  But it is in section 8 of the Crown Law Act.  It has always been there and it has 

just been transferred to the Constitution.  So that is what I wanted to share today, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

of  the  thing,  just  as  of  today.    It  is  completely  in  contravention  of  the  Standing  Orders.    When

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Do not carry on a conversation between you two, but through the Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Standing  Order  60(1),  states  and  I  quote:  “When  speaking,  members 

must  confine their observations to the subject under consideration.”  I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you 

sometimes let it go, but it has become far too common.  They are trying to cover up their holes that 

have been dug up by us or whatever it is, in that they are in other parts of Parliament and that should 

not be happening, Sir.  That is all that I have to say. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you:</span> Honourable Member, you have the floor.</p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you.  About 99.9 percent of what I contributed was from 

the  Report, related  to the  independence  of  FICAC  and  only  0.5  percent  was  just  responding  to  a 

previous debate, and with that, Sir, I commend the Committee with my contribution today.  Thank 

you. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you:</span> Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to deliberate on the review of this 

</span><span>FICAC 2014 and 2015 Annual Report which is before us.  The Committee noted few matters, such 

</span><span>as awareness programme and its effectiveness, process of investigation and types of complaints that 

came under FICAC, FICAC’s policy on Whistle-blower and the ability of human resources to provide 

services, et cetera.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note that these matters have been adequately clarified and the Standing 

Committee is satisfied with the explanation provided.   Needless to say that matters raised should 

always be taken into consideration when preparing subsequent annual reports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, reading through the 2014 and 2015 Annual  Report, I must say a  lot was 

achieved  by  FICAC.    Over  the  years,  we  have  noticed  that  more  and  more  cases  of  fraud  and 

corruption are being reported by organisations and individuals, particularly, Government Ministries 

and statutory organisations.  Yesterday we heard from Honourable Kuridrani during the debate on 

the  Public  Accounts  Committee  Report  where  he  questioned,  what  action  is  taken  against  public 

servants for mismanagement or abuse of office?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on any mismanagement of funds or abuse of office, and I recall very well 

when the Honourable Attorney-General presented during the Budget debate, he made it very clear 

</span><span>that any abuse of office in any Ministry or statutory authority, the Office of the Auditor-General is 

</span><span>to bring this  matter to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economy, who then reports the 

matter to FICAC.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Nawaikula  and  others  who  made  wild  and  unsubstantiated  comments  in 

Parliament  need  to  understand  how  the  findings  from  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  is 

communicated to FICAC.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear the auditing role is the responsibility of the Auditor-General 

and the  financial oversight role  is that of the Ministry of Economy. Previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

corruption matters were swept under the carpet. The case-in-point is the NBF scam, another example 

is the sale of 150 acres of freehold land once owned by the Savusavu Town Council.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The elected councillors chose to sell prime 80 acres of land for peanuts. The land was bought 

</span><span>by the councillors, their friends and their family members. The Savusavu Town Council also sold off 

</span></p>
<p><a name="73">Page 73</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>915 

</span></p>
<p><span>another six lots of prime foreshore land to a councillor’s wife and to councillors’ friends and relatives. 

This happened during the SVT Government.  

</span></p>
<p><span>What action was taken by the SVT Government then? I must say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, nothing 

was  done.  Savusavu  Town  Council  was  dissolved  and  then  life  as  usual.  Today,  we  cannot  even 

expand the market, bus, taxi, carrier stands in Savusavu because the surrounding properties were sold 

off.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to emphasise corruption was there in the past, corruption will be in the future. 

There  is  no such thing as, corruption will  be gone because corruption  is greediness, so corruption 

will be there but the important question now is, what did the past governments do as compared to 

what this Government has done? 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most important element to deal with corruption 

is the political will and I must say, it is the Honourable Prime Minister who showed and demonstrated 

the political will and it was under his leadership that the FICAC was established in 2007 along with 

</span><span>various  laws.    Let  us  not  forget  that  FICAC  was  also  acceded  to  the  United  Nations  Convention 

</span><span>Against Corruption and the work continues in this area.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  all  know  corruption  is  a  cost to  Government  and to the taxpayers  in 

many different ways. As rightly observed by the Standing Committee, it is very important that the 

general  public  and  organisations  are  adequately  sensitised  on  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of 

whistle-blowers.  This  will  ensure  that  people  do  not  misuse  their  right  to  raise  matters  without 

evidence  and  again,  the  Committee  picked  it  up  correctly  and  Honourable  Tikoduadua  has  just 

mentioned the number of complaints received by FICAC; 67,000.  And then he is saying the success 

rate is just 0.2 percent.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Talk to someone who has handled complaints in the past, you will understand that all forms 

of complaints will come and it is a question of how these complaints are sieved so that you are able 

to identify complaints that are related to abuse of office, mismanagement and so forth. Again, one 

has to look for things like private gain. Did the person gain by approving something or so forth? So 

that element needs to be investigated and understood, but in this case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that 

the fact that 67,000 cases were reported to FICAC is a good sign. The people are aware of FICAC, 

awareness is there and FICAC is doing its job.  They have charged around 366 people.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I would say as the Minister for Local Government, I see corruption at all levels. It is a fact. It 

is there, so do not say that in 2006 what happened was, because of corruption. Yes corruption was 

there but the argument is, nothing was being done about corruption. It is this Government that made 

an institution where people can go and lodge their complaints and provide the evidence. That is the 

difference.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to comment on Honourable Nawaikula’s allegation yesterday 

under  the  protection  of  parliamentary  privileges  that  Ministers  appoint  their  relatives  and  this 

information is only from social media.  I wish and hope that he can simply take those evidence  to 

FICAC and lodge those evidence, rather than raising the matter here just to get attention, for nothing.  

So, Honourable Nawaikula, I hope you can lodge this complaint, please, do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  want  to  talk  about  one  particular  subject  matter  which  HonourableTuisawau raised.  He said, FICAC  is  not very effective, they are  overburdened with  lots of cases.Yes, any organisation that receives complaints will be overburdened because that is the real reason</p>
<p><a name="74">Page 74</a></p>
<p><span>916 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>why they are established.  But it is a matter of conducting the investigation and finding the root cause 

and how those cases can be solved.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In my view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the FICAC is there, it gives people confidence in 

the system and it has become a tagline that if you do something wrong, I will take you to FICAC, I 

will  report  the  matter  to  FICAC,  which  is  extremely  good.    It  acts  as  a  deterrent,  so  we  should 

appreciate the fact that FICAC is there for the public, for officials in private or public sector to report 

such cases, and I said if corruption is there, then obviously the poor lose out more than the rich.  So 

we need to protect the poor and make sure that we are able to eradicate or combat corruption. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee on 

Justice, Law and Human Rights for a thorough review and express my appreciation to FICAC for 

doing a good job which goes to show that the organisation is keeping up to its mission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fighting corruption should be everyone’s duty to support and not just create this perception 

</span></p>
<p><span>that FICAC is not doing its work.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  and  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the</p>
<p><span>Honourable Tanya Waqanika.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. T. WAQANIKA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to this</p>
<p><span>motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard about the inception of the FICAC.  It has been 14 years now, 

we have had two Elections.  I heard about the political will of the Honourable Prime Minister.  It is 

that same will that he can also evoke under his leadership to appoint the Commission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the concerns, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is this, FICAC is not independent.  The perception we 

may argue in here that it is independent, but the perception at large it is not independent.  The reason 

is this: we have heard from the Honourable Tuisawau when he quoted from Section 12(5), of the Act 

which states that the Commissioner may seek the input of the Attorney-General. It is a discretionary 

provision of the Commission to seek the input of the Attorney-General, it is not mandatory. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we all know, for those of us that have worked at the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the 

Attorney-General’s Office is the civil defendant of our nation.  They are also the legal advisor to the 

Government.  One would have thought common sense that if any institution needs to give advice, let 

</span><span>alone assistance, to the FICAC, it would have been the Office of the Director of Prosecution (DPP) 

</span><span>or the Fiji Police, because of the nature of their work. 

</span></p>
<p><span>But  ideally,  Sir,  for  FICAC  to  be  truly  independent,  remove  any  line  Minister  from  the 

structure, because the audited Report that we have before us, we see the line Minister; the Attorney-

General (nothing personal against the Attorney-General), it is the position of the Attorney-General 

that the Commissioner also has to consult. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the Acts says ‘may’, but our Constitution, Sir, and I read from Part B  - Independent 

</span></p>
<p><span>Judicial and Legal Institutions, Section 115(9): 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The Commission shall provide regular updates and advice to the Attorney-General 

</span></p>
<p><span>on any matter relating to its functions and responsibilities.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, that  is  not  a  discretionary  power  and  we  all  know  as the  Honourable  Vuniwaqa  has 

</span><span>stated earlier today, this is the paramount law of our nation so it supersedes the Act.  No matter what 

</span></p>
<p><a name="75">Page 75</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>917 

</span></p>
<p><span>happens,  they  have  to  report.    Even  though  the  Commissioner  or  the  Deputy  Commissioner  is 

appointed by the President, they still have to report, call it what it may, let us call a spade a spade 

and let us speak truth to our words.  The perception of the people and my perception, Sir, FICAC is 

not independent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other reason is this, the Office of the Supervisor of Elections for any complaints on the 

political campaigns or political parties, rightfully so, they refer the complaints to FICAC.  I commend 

the Office for doing that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone of us here have fallen into a complaint rightfully, we should report to them.  Again, 

Sir, the Minister for Elections, I believe, and I stand corrected, is the Honourable Attorney-General.  

The Supervisor of Elections, there is a line of consultation between that Office and the Minister for 

Elections.  Again, we report again to FICAC on any political parties or any political members, there 

is also that line and it is here in the Audit Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The structure is still there to give them teeth, Sir.  I do not care with due respect, Sir, whether 

it is Honourable Attorney-General, whether it is the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, whether 

it is the Honourable Prime Minister, remove that and let that Commission run independently because 

</span><span>that is how it is done in other countries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When  you  talk  about  independence,  you  talk  about  separation  of  powers.    Yesterday  and 

today, I have seen  my  fellow  lawyers waving the Constitution. When we talk about separation of 

powers, again I refer everyone to this - because this is our bible, that is why we are all here.  Chapter 

1(f) and (g) of the Constitution talk about good governance, including the limitation and separation 

of powers.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, Sir, there is no separation of powers, no matter what we say.  I speak from experience 

on the interference that happened to me at Fiji TV.  I will not dwell on that because I have moved on.  

One day, no government will ever stand for ever, it changes.  May not be here, one day whoever is 

on this side of the House and whoever is on that side of the House, will then be saying “You have no 

independence because you are the (Honourable) Attorney-General, (Honourable) Mosese Bulitavu, 

(Honourable)  Lynda  Tabuya,  your  (Honourable)  Attorney-General  is  influencing  FICAC,  rest-

assured when SODELPA comes  in, I will  be the one saying ‘Remove the (Honourable) Attorney-

General from the consultation’.  Let us speak truth to our words, let us be honest, let us have integrity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I agree with Honourable Premila  Kumar, no one condones corruption.  It is what we have 

</span><span>been taught at home, what we have been taught in here, hopefully more of it.  Personally, I am glad 

</span><span>that this  is set up, because the corruption of our nation, the  fact  is, that it has  increased,  it  is sad.  

There is a level of desperation, an increased level of greediness.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Fiji ratified  the UN Convention  Against Corruption  on 14th May, 2008, and 

there were five main areas they mentioned, FICAC is already working on that and I commend FICAC 

for that.  One is on “preventative measures”.  This Government did that, they established FICAC and 

that is one of the measures, you set it up.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The one on “preventative  measures” they talked about enhanced transparency  in  financing 

election campaigns and political parties.  I keep repeating myself, remove the consultation, remove 

the organisation structure where you see the (Honourable) Attorney-General in there.  When you talk 

about transparency, you are talking about efficiency, this is all contention, and we have agreed to this 

- efficiency, transparency and recruitment based on merit.

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I always believe in fighting fair and fighting clean but I can honestly say, with all due respect, 

</span></p>
<p><span>that man did not get it on merit, it is no fault of his and I wish him ‘happy retirement’. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have issues of criminalisation and law enforcement.  This is already in place.  The Audit 

</span></p>
<p><span>Report highlights the types of offences and cases that they prosecute but I commend FICAC for that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Asset recovery: Now in the Domestic  Act, Section 13(d), “A  magistrate or any court shall 

have the power to order the disposal of property with offences in the possession of the Commission 

or any offender as it applies with respect to property in the possession of the court of the Police.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  believe  this  provision  can  be  further  strengthened,  and  perhaps  something  that  the 

Chairperson  can  look  into  when  there  is  another  round  of  consultations,  be  that  as  it  may,  the 

fundamental principles of this Convention was asset recovery because developing nations found out 

that the level of corruption is so high. So, they wanted to ensure that we put in those provisions that 

when corrupt officials are prosecuted wherever they run to anywhere in the world even in Fiji, we 

will recover their assets and whatever financial gain that we make from those assets, goes back to the 

State so it can help whatever new Government comes in.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The other one, Sir, is on International Corporation.  I heard in the House about FICAC being 

</span><span>overburdened. I pray that they are also working with the international counterparts to ensure that the 

technical assistance is given to each other because whichever Government comes into power, I pray 

that you do not use it for your own political gain.  You do not use it just to spite one another. You do 

not do that, you fight clean, fight fair.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is easy for me to speak, it is easy for me to also defend myself because I am a lawyer, but 

I tell  you  what,  when  a  person  is  prosecuted  and  I  know  my  good  friend,  Honourable  Mahendra 

Reddy, is not easy because one is the emotional trauma that comes when you get charged, it is not 

easy.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The other one is paying your lawyers.  I pray that whichever Government comes in, remove 

any Minister and do not use it to spite because one day like I have always said, no government lasts, 

whether it be Soqosoqo Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), Soqosoqo ni Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), 

Fiji Labour Party, FijiFirst, Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA), National Federation Party 

(NFP) - no government lasts. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank the Chairperson of this Standing Committee and its Members.  I hope that whatever 

</span><span>has been mentioned today that you look at enforcing it, strengthening our FICAC and giving them 

</span><span>more teeth.  As one of my former bosses used to tell me, we have a title without teeth.  That is the 

way I see FICAC.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.-  I thank  the Honourable Waqanika for her contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to Honourable Bhatnagar.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  V.K.  BHATNAGAR.:</span> Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  make  a  very  short</p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate this afternoon.   

</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, I acknowledge the work of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 

Rights.  I also would like to thank the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) for 

</span><span>the  2014/2015  Annual  Reports,  and  commend  the  great  work  they  carried  out  to  protect  Fijians 

</span><span>against corruption.

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>919 

</span></p>
<p><span>Alluding  to  what  Honourable  Bulitavu  has  said  that  speaking  about  the  evolution  of  this 

institution.    I  concur  with  you  because  FICAC  has  come  a  long  way  since  its  inception  or  the 

establishment in 2007 in terms of their roles, responsibilities, commitments. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji as a nation and the hub of the Pacific has made great strides in creating 

and  constantly  improving  the  anti-corruption  culture through the  fostering  of  fruitful  partnerships 

with the community and public sector, and the formulation of laws contextualise to suit their climate 

of corruption, which exists in various sectors. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the teams dedication which drives the Commission to administer 

its role with  much conviction.  At this  juncture Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would  like to congratulate the 

Land Transport Authority for becoming the first statutory body to undergo training as part of the “I 

do  not  accept  bribes  campaign”  being  conducted  by  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission  Against 

Corruption (FICAC).   As stated by Mr Levan Bouadze, the resident representative for the UNDP 

Pacific  Office  in  Fiji  and  I  quote,  “the  campaign  is  very  important  in  the  context  of  ensuring 

transparent, accountable and efficient service delivery to all citizens of Fiji”. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I commend FICAC  for the rollout of this awareness campaign as not only does corruption 

</span><span>erode the trust we have in the public sector, but it also places a strain on the country’s resources and 

</span><span>transparency  </span><span>per  se</span><span>.    FICAC  is  committed  to  set  the  foundation  for  good  governance  and  create 

sustainable development for the benefit of all citizens of Fiji and their vision is very much reflected 

in the work they carry out. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank the Commission and its staff for the great work that they continue to do and wish them 

</span></p>
<p><span>the very best for the future.  That is the short contribution Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Bhatnagar for her contribution to the debate:</span> I</p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Honourable Minister Faiyaz Koya.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We have heard quite a few comments with 

respect to  FICAC  and  with  respect to  its  independence,  et  cetera,  but  I  want to  just  comment  by 

reading an excerpt from the 2014 Annual Report which is subject to the Committee’s report.  This is 

actually good information for everyone, Sir, and this is one of the reasons why we have FICAC.  I 

think everyone needs to put this at the front of their mind, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Corruption is a major hindrance to sustainable development and corrosive on the 

</span><span>fabric of our society. Corruption undermines democracy and the rule of law and leads to 

</span><span>human rights violation, distorts markets, erodes quality of life and carries the potential to 

allow organised crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think it is a very important paragraph for everyone to remember exactly why the FICAC is 

here.  FICAC was established Sir, under this blue book the Constitution and I think that again also 

needs to be spelt out with respect to some of the issues that have been raised. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption is not a singular authority that exists 

around the world that deals with corruption.  If you look at many other countries around the world 

there are some that we strive to be like, for example Singapore, which also has its own authority that 

deals with corruption.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We are no different and our Constitution  basically  says, and I want to specifically refer to 

</span><span>some of the issues that have raised and the questions that have been raised regarding the independence 

</span><span>of the Constitution. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that independence of FICAC is actually guaranteed under this Constitution 

just like every other right, whether it is personal right or it is a community right is actually guaranteed 

in that Constitution.  It basically says under 115(6) and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“In the performance of its functions or the exercise of its authority and powers the 

Commission shall be independent and shall not be subject to the direction or control of 

any person or authority except by a court of law or else otherwise prescribed by written 

law”. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, guarantees FICAC’s independence and I do not see any reason why 

anyone should actually doubt that.  Just like every other right of ours is actually guaranteed, we look 

around, we talk about the rights for many things nowadays, and everyone waves this blue book.  It is 

important because this is the Supreme Law of the land.  This takes precedence over everything and 

this is what guarantees FICAC’s independence, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Tikoduadua is actually not here anymore, he made it sound like 

it was some sinister institution,  right throughout the day, right from Monday every institution that 

exists within Government, they make it sound like some sinister thing is behind it.  It is not, Sir, it is 

</span><span>governed by certain rules and it is most definitely, it should not be a label that should be put onto 

</span><span>FICAC.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As I said, the Constitution provides for the independence of FICAC.  Now, with respect to 

and I specifically want to say this, Sir, they are saying that there is interference and its independence 

is questionable because in certain portions of the Act it says that the Honourable Attorney-General 

is actually interfering in the business of FICAC.   I want to say something about that and I think any 

lawyer worth his salt would actually remember this, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Attorney-  General’s  input  with  respect  to  FICAC  is  only  with  respect  to 

finance and general administration.  It is quite clearly spelt out.  It is not by any means whatsoever, 

with respect to investigation or prosecution by FICAC.  That again, is guaranteed through here, Sir, 

it is independent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may also refer to a particular case that was in the Privy Council in 1983, 

and this same particular rule regarding the independence is actually applied to the DPP’s Office and 

also other independent bodies, and there was a famous case in the Privy Council in 1983, which was 

the Attorney-General of Fiji versus the DPP.   And there it was held that finance and administrative 

</span><span>guideline does not undermine independence, Sir. That is very important for us to remember, and I 

</span><span>keep saying this over and over, Sir, let us get the facts correct.  Let us do our research before we 

make any statement.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There  is  extra  independence  obviously,  apart  from  this  particular  court  case,  in  the  2013 

Constitution.    Parliament  must  ensure that  FICAC  has  adequate  funding.    Does that  mean  we  are 

interfering?  No, Sir.  That is  financial  independence.  FICAC actually appoints  its own staff and 

there is no influence by anyone.   Also something was raised about a particular provision to regularly 

update the Honourable Attorney-General.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Regularly  updating  the  Honourable  Attorney-General’s  Office  is  not  in  any  way,  shape  or 

form whatsoever, it is actually influencing FICAC decisions or investigations or prosecution.  It is 

only  there  to  ensure  that  FICAC  operates  independently  and  has  all  the  necessary  financial  and 

administrative support from Government to be able to independently carry out its constitutional duty, 

</span><span>Sir. 

</span></p>

<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>921 

</span></p>
<p><span>Contrary to what the Honourable Tikoduadua might have said, Sir, it is most definitely not a 

tool  for  political  oppression.  They  make  it  sound like  that  every  institution  within  Government  is 

actually sinister, it is not a tool.  If someone is being charged and they think they are innocent, they 

find a good lawyer, they go to court, when they are innocent or not, it is not influence by us or by the 

Honourable Attorney-General or anyone, it is  independent like any other court.  We now actually 

have a court that actually is going to do that, Sir.  It is most definitely, Sir, it is very wrong to make 

such  a  sweeping  statement that  it  is  being  influenced, that  particular  body  is  being  influenced  for 

political  oppression,  and  he  referred  to  some  cases  with  respect  to  some  people  who  have  been 

charged.   

</span></p>
<p><span>You will notice, Sir that we do not refer to those cases at all, we leave it aside because that is 

the matter that either been deal with or being dealt with, it is an independent body, Sir.  If someone 

does complain and measuring out of cases and saying that they have done these many cases and none 

have come to fruition and some have, in some yes, they may and in some they may not.  It depends 

on the kind of evidence that comes before the court.  I am not going to explain what happens in court, 

Sir, but again, it is important and imperative for us to remember.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, if I raise this in my hand and I stand there and I swear on it, it means something to me, it 

</span><span>means  something  to  all  Fijian  citizens.  If  this  book  says  that  it  must  be  independent,  it  must  be 

</span><span>independent. This is such an important tool for every single Fijian citizen and most important for all 

of us sitting here because by virtue of this book, we actually sit here, Sir.  It is not to be treated as a 

joke and said oh, I am just reading it, I do not really believe in it but you stood there, you held it and 

you swore on it.  You swear to abide by the rules in the Constitution, so Sir, this is not to be taken 

lightly. 

</span></p>
<p><span>All the issues that were raised within the Constitution are first and foremost the supreme law 

of the land. FICAC’s independence is guaranteed by this particular book, Sir. I know the Honourable 

Prime Minister is actually going to say a few words, Sir, so with those few words, I hope that clears 

the  air.  There  is  some  clarity  with  respect  to  independence  and  the  issue  regarding  the  Attorney-

General, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  quite  ridiculous,  Sir, that they  can  cast  aspersions  on the  Attorney-General  especially 

when he is not here, cast aspersions on him and his Office to say that he is interfering in the particular 

process. In no way, shape, form whatsoever has that happened, - if they have evidence to that effect, 

take  it  to  FICAC,  Sir,  take  it.    But  it  is  no  good  coming  here  and  just  making  general  sweeping 

statements on a daily basis without any evidence, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span> I stand by what the Report has actually done and I want to thank the Standing Committee for 

its hard work on the Report.   I see there are not too many recommendations in there that are required 

to be attended to but you know, I think it is also good to commend FICAC in terms of its operations 

and just one last thing, Sir, - we must also remember that FICAC is not just about prosecutions. It is 

also  about  informing  our  society.  They  go  out  and  do  a  whole  lot  more  work  and  informing  our 

society about how bad corruption is for our country and that is such an important task, Sir.  I thank 

you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister:</span> I now give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Prime Minister. You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  make  a  short 

contribution to the debate, in support of the motion moved by Honourable Maharaj as Chair of the 

</span><span>Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, and I thank the Standing Committee for its 

</span><span>Report to Parliament.  

</span></p>

<p><span>Consolidated Review Report – FICAC 2014 &amp; 2015 Annual Reports 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>But before I continue, Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell Honourable Tuisawau that the FICAC 

investigation is independent, whether it is Rabuka or MPs who are charged or even former Secretary-

General to Parliament.  FICAC in its investigation is independent and I must let him know that the 

decision with respect to the former Secretary-General, Mr. Speaker, was a unanimous decision which 

included the Leader of the Opposition who also agreed.  I do not know if he recognises that Leader 

of the Opposition or not.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Third but not last, I do not know what is so special about Honourable Tuisawau that they can 

stand here and not say, he does not accept the Constitution of this nation.  He should, before he comes 

to work tomorrow, look at himself in the mirror and say I am a man. I am not a hypocrite. I will not 

go, I will resign because I do not recognise this Constitution. That is what he should do.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, someone said that corruption is increasing.  It certainly has appeared in some 

unforeseen places. I know FICAC will not be able to reach the corridor of the university but I hope 

that  the  university  council  will  be  able  to  sort  out  all  these  corrupt  dealings  that  has  ravaged  the 

university corridors.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, one of the first conventions that my Government ratified as early as in 2007,was  the  United  Nations  Convention  Against  Corruption.      This  Convention  form  the  basis  of  theintroduction of two very important laws; the FICAC Act of 2007 and Prevention of Bribery Act 2007.</p>
<p><span>Subsequently, following the promulgation of the 2013 Constitution, FICAC’s establishment 

was continued as an independent legal institution similar to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the 

Legal  Aid  Commission,  the  Solicitor-General  and  of  course,  the  Independent  Legal  Services 

Commission. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Constitution enshrines the independence of FICAC with respect 

to  its  investigation  of  criminal  offences  and  prosecution  of  criminal  proceedings.    No  one,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, and I repeat, no one except a Court of Law has any influence or any say with respect to 

criminal  proceedings  brought  to  the  Court  by  FICAC.    No  one,  whether  you  are  a  Member  of 

Parliament, or a civil servant or a member of the public, the law applies to everyone equally. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  its  review  of  the  2014  and  2015  Annual  Reports  of  the  Fiji  Independent  Commission 

Against Corruption (FICAC), I understand that the Committee raised an issue about the independent 

of FICAC.  This, I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, arose from the contents of note 16 at page 50 of the 

FICAC Annual Report 2014 of which FICAC had clarified. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must however make it clear that section 115 (6) of the Fijian Constitution 

makes  provision  for  the  independence  of  FICAC,  its  functions  and  exercise  of  its  authority  and 

powers.  I must also highlight the amendment to the FICAC Act 2007, in 2016 which removed the 

provision that the Commissioner is subject to the orders, the direction and control of the President, 

further ensuring the independence of FICAC. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can all agree that the continuous rise in corruption cases calls 

for concern which is why FICAC was established in the first place.  My Government will continue 

to  ensure  that  corruption  related  cases  are  thoroughly  investigated  and  that  those  who  indulge  in 

corrupt practice face the full brunt of the law.  In this regard, my Government recently established 

for  the  first  time  in  Fiji’s  history  a  specialised  anti-corruption  division  of  the  High  Court  and 

Magistrates Court as you have heard. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this will not only ensure specialisation of designated Judges and Magistrates</p>
<p><span>in anti-corruption cases, but also ensure the consistency of the application of jurisprudence on anti-

</span></p>
<p><span>corruption cases across Fiji.  We all want corruption-related cases to be promptly dealt with in the 

Fijian legal and court system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Government remains committed to eradicating corruption 

and other related criminal activities and severely punishing those who continue to indulge in such 

practices without fear or repercussions.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

Minister for his contribution and clarifying everything that was raised in the Chambers today. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Another  thing  that  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  for  bringing  this

</span><span>to do so, I thank the Honourable Prime Minister for bringing this Commission to fight the corruption 

that was and that may exist rightfully said, we are in the verge of eradicating it. It may not but we 

need institutions like this and independent institutions like this to fight corruption and to take those 

people to task who may be involved in corrupt practice.  Thank you and </span><span>vinaka vakalevu.</span><span>
