<p><span>851 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the Ministers may speak up to 20 minutes. After the Minister, I will 

then invite the Honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to speak on the Statement for 

no more than five minutes.  There will also be a response from the Leader of the National Federation 

Party (NFP) or his designate to also speak for five minutes.  There will be no other debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I now call on the Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Lands and Mineral Resources to deliver his Statement.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Water Issues in Suva and Labasa 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Honourable Prime Minister, the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Members and the people of Fiji.  I am grateful to 

be given this opportunity to highlight to this august House some of the major water issues that we 

have been facing from December this year, and how the Ministry, through the Water Authority of 

Fiji (WAF), has been doing its best to resolve and address these problems. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Amongst  the  countries  in  the  South  Pacific  Region,  Fiji  has  had  one  of  the  oldest 

infrastructures for water, probably  because we started developing this earlier than other countries.  

</span><span>The greater Suva area accounts for the largest set of Fijians accessing water and wastewater services.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Post-</span><span>Tropical Cyclone Yasa</span><span>, all services in Suva have been restored with the current water 

production.  The WAF, Sir, continues to serve Fijians to the best of its ability.  The areas where we 

have intermittent supply are being served with water carting services. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the greater Suva area, supply is expected to improve further in the next year (2022) once 

the  Rewa  River  Water  Supply  Scheme  is  commissioned.    In  prioritising  water,  Government  has 

allocated a total of $120.25  million  in the 2020-2021 financial  year to WAF’s Capital Projects to 

progressively  help  us  achieve  our  goal  of  24/7  delivery  of  water  to  all  Fijians,  and  expand  Fiji’s 

sewerage network. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let  me  provide  some  insight  into  the  operations  of  WAF.    WAF  is  guided  by  the  policy 

provided by the Ministry for Infrastructure; its 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plans for 

Fiji; the Water Authority of Fiji Act, 2007; the recently completed Water Authority of Fiji’s Strategic 

Plan for 2020-2025; and the Water Authority of Fiji 20-Year Master Plans. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In the Year 2010, there were only 126,794 households in Fiji that were connected to WAF’s 

</span><span>reticulation system.  By January 2021, 11 years later, the number  has risen to 145,256 households 

</span><span>and those exclude commercial connections.  Looking at these numbers over that 10-year period, there 

has been an increase of 15 percent in the number of households that are connected to WAF. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Water produced by the Authority showed that when </span><span>TC Yasa and Ana</span><span> were rampaging over 

Fiji from December to January 2021, there were disruptions to the WAF infrastructure that caused a 

decrease  in  the  water  produced.   For  Suva’s  Waila  and  Tamavua  Treatment  Plants,  a  decrease  in 

water production was experienced from 5,292 mega litres or million litres in December to 4,872 mega 

litres  in January.  In Labasa, production dropped from 623  mega  litres  in December to 464 mega 

litres in January. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The cyclones’ impact caused heavy rainfall and the water intake faced very high turbidity and 

debris, resulting in major system blockages.  The WAF, in its quest to provide consistent water supply 

to all Fijians, even during post-cyclone periods, arranged for water carting to thousands of households 

</span><span>in the Suva and Labasa regions.  Carting tank loads of water up to the total volume of 6,300 mega 

</span><span>litres and using 990 truckload trips to households in the greater Suva area was carried out between 

</span></p>

<p><span>852 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>December 2020 and February 2021  In the Labasa region, a total volume of 10,240 mega litres of 

water using 1,352 truckload trips was carted to residents in the Labasa region. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji is highly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, floods and and the cyclone season runs typically 

from November to April.  In recent years, with the impact of climate change, we have been getting 

an average of two tropical cyclones each year.  This brings heavy flooding, destructive winds and 

rising sea levels.  These disasters have had an adverse impact on community water supply systems 

and also on WAF’S infrastructure.  The El Nino effect has also hit some of our community areas very 

badly causing drought and increasing rainfall in some instances causing flooding. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the two recent </span><span>Tropical Cyclones</span><span> </span><span>Yasa </span><span>and </span><span>Ana</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>one of which was a Category 5 </span><span>TC Yasa 

</span><span>damaged a lot of WAF’s infrastructure.  There were a total of 21 water systems that were affected 

during </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>and </span><span>TC Ana </span><span>nationwide and due to flash flooding, high turbidity, main bursts and 

landslides, the water systems were affected and thousands of customers were without water supply 

for some time. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the past three months, Suva and Labasa have been experiencing water disruptions issues.  

Suva has, for the past three months, experienced around 263 water main disruptions and Labasa had 

</span><span>159 water main disruptions.  In Suva WAF, has experienced 467 unplanned water disruptions and 3 

</span><span>planned water disruptions in 2020.  The Labasa urban region experienced 451 unplanned disruptions 

and 10 planned disruptions. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Power failure also affects our water pumping stations.  In the event of a power failure, pump 

stations,  water  treatment  plants  lose  their  ability  to  operate,  thus  water  supply  is  disrupted.    To 

mitigate this, Standby Gensets are installed to power the assets in the event of a power failure.  A key 

component  in  the  transition  from  EFL  grid  power  to  Genset  power  are  the  Automatic  Transfer 

Switches or the ATSs which enable automatic changeover of power. 

</span></p>
<p><span>However,  in  some  cases  ATS  capabilities  are  not  compatible  for  all  locations.    For  such 

locations switchover is carried out manually and it is during this period of manual switchover that 

causes reservoir levels to drop, thus affecting services, especially in the greater Suva area. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past 10 years, rural to urban drift has increased the urban population dramatically.  

The 2017 Census result revealed that 55.9 percent of Fiji’s population reside in urban areas which 

has increased from 50.7 percent in 2007.  In other words the rise of urbanisation has risen around 5.2 

percent over that ten year period. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Many  new  informal  settlements  are  springing  up  around  the  urban  centres  causing  new 

applications  for  water  meters.    The  challenge  for  this  is  that  WAF’s  treatment  plants  are  now 

processing way over their build capacity, the capacity they were programmed or designed for.  Now, 

they are being asked to produce for many more people that they were originally designed for.  That 

is the major challenge that we have and that, as I have said, for the greater Suva area that challenge 

will be addressed once the Rewa River Water Supply Scheme comes up like next year in 2022. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With the extra demand on the system, smaller mains become inefficient and unable to deliver 

the required newly increased flows and volumes demanded by the customer.  This will eventually 

result in low pressure and even lead to intermittent supply.  This can be remedied through hydraulic 

needs  major  improvement  which  consists  of  the  upgrading  of  the  existing  main  by  replacing  the 

existing pipe with the larger pipe that can deliver a greater flow in volume. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As I have said before, WAF operates a network that was built over half a century ago and a 

</span><span>lot of the age of the infrastructure, facets of their network, are now unable to meet the current demand, 

</span></p>
<p><a name="11">Page 11</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>853 

</span></p>
<p><span>hence the need to upgrade and improve.  Scheduled improvements to the system have also put a large 

strain  on  some  of  the  older  assets  leading  to  burst  mains  and  critical  failure  and  these  affect  the 

delivery of services.  As such these costs contribute to the increase in repairs and maintenance costs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We still have a lot of old infrastructure that have served its purpose and most the reticulation 

system was built along the coastline in response to population demand.  Given the infrastructure at 

its position, these structures have been the hardest hit and continued to be vulnerable.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of a plan of action and what WAF is doing to address all of these issues - to mitigate 

these challenges, WAF continues to invest in  major programmes and projects around the country.  

Water  Treatment  Plants  in  Namau  has  been  completed,  Savusavu  is  almost  complete  now.    The 

packaged Plants at Viria, Nabouwalu, Nagado, Vunidawa, Deuba and Waiwai are being constructed 

to fill in the reticulation gaps in these regions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover,  Tasman  Tanks  are  constructed  in  the  Western  and  Central  regions  to  ease  the 

intermittent  water  supply  issues,  particularly  for  Raralevu,  Tacirua  East,  Lautoka  Hospital,  Nadi 

Hospital and Toorak.  Our Fiji $266 billion Rewa Water  Supply Project will  supply  much needed 

water with the capacity to supply an addition 40 mega litres or 40 billion litres a day of water into 

</span><span>the greater Suva area.  This huge investment will come into fruition by the year 2022. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The WAF Master Plan for major towns has also been documented which shows the roadmap 

for the future investment on what WAF will put in to address its infrastructure. Building a resilient 

infrastructure that caters for the needs of the present and future, is the main goal of the Master Plans. 

The  WAF  plans  to  automate  one  of  its  daily  operations  which  sometimes  causes  water  supply 

disruption in the Suva and Nausori corridor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Currently it takes the WAF teams about two hours to manually operate eight critical valves 

and  by  eliminating  the  travelling  time,  the  valve  operation  happens  at  the  push  of  a  button.   The 

automated system will be more efficient.  It shall reduce the number of water disruptions caused by 

pressure fluctuations in the pipe during and after valve operations.  

</span></p>
<p><span>With WAF’s GIS systems, we now know where the pipes are, where the valves are, where 

the pump meters and other facilities are located. We also know the location and water usage patterns 

of our customers, who will be affected in the case of water disruptions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Automation of data on WAF’s SCADA System provides an edge to the Authority to have a 

</span><span>proactive approach  in scheduling plant protective maintenance to avoid unplanned shutdowns and 

</span><span>disruption in services.  It will further allow the Authority to plan water distribution using real time 

data in required areas in times of disaster.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The manual systems limit the Authority to be able to monitor real time data and evaluate the 

whole operations.  Carrying out analysis on service efficiency and its effectiveness is not an option 

on the manual system.  The impact of this will be continued intermittent supply errors in some areas.  

Furthermore, the  cost of  crude oil  keeps  rising  exponentially  and  manual  operations  do  not  allow 

reducing either energy costs or operational costs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Demand Management Programme; water conservation is at the core and is an integral part of 

managing the demand for water.  Water Demand Management focuses on managing the demand for 

water  rather  than  methods  of  exploiting  new  sources  or  suppressing  supply.    The  WAF  has  a 

responsibility  to  wisely  manage  its  fundamental  resource  through  the  implementation  of  water 

</span><span>conservation and demand driven programmes.  

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The initiative is paramount for the individual customer, consumer and the Authority, and as 

such  the  success  of  conserving  water  and  reducing  demand  is  borne  by  WAF  and  also  by  the 

customer.  The  project  of  water  conservation  and  demand  management  would  potentially  devise 

programmes that will promote better management of the water supply system, influence customers 

to purchase water saving appliances, disseminate information to influence consumer behaviour on 

water issues, regulate water usage and consumption patterns and enforce regulatory effectiveness.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Consumer  awareness;  WAF  conducts  awareness  programmes  and  all-year-round  exercises 

where customers are advised to store water for, at least, two to three days during droughts and cyclone 

periods.  While we are in the cyclone period, this is something that we constantly advise people, they 

should try to keep at least two to three days’ supply of water around, in case something happens. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Water-wise Education Programmes are run in schools to educate students to use water wisely.  

The  Water  Champion  Programme  was  initiated  for  students  to  educate  them  regarding  water 

harvesting,  treatment  storing  and  distribution  process.    To  the  people  of  Fiji  we  can  make  the 

assurance that while we have had issues we will continue to work on addressing these issues through 

the various measures that I have outlined so that we can veer progressively towards the target that 

we have to be able to provide all the citizens of this country with clean water and water that is good 

</span><span>for their lives on a daily basis. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement. I now give 

the floor to the designated speaker  for the Leader of the Opposition, Honourable  Aseri Radrodro. 

You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.   I  rise  to  respond to the  Ministerial 

Statements regarding the major water issues that have been faced in Suva and Labasa this year and 

how it has been addressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  state  our  disappointment.    We  have  always 

requested and proposed a proper summary of Ministerial Statements  to be given to this side of the 

House,  especially  to  the  Shadow  Ministers  to  ensure  and  allow  this  side  of  the  House  to  make 

necessary and productive adequate responses to such Ministerial Statements.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  understand  this  is  a  matter  of  national  importance  when  Ministerial 

Statements are made in this House but with the Ministerial Statements summary not been given to 

us, it handicaps this side of the House to give proper, adequate responses, especially on such technical 

</span><span>issues like water and infrastructure. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  do  not  know  why  that  side  of  the  House  do  not  want  to  give  this  side  of  the  House  the 

summary of the statement. They take 20 minutes to make a Ministerial Statements and we are only 

given five minutes and that five minutes will be very productive, if you give a very good response to 

the  summary  that they  give.    I  hope,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  something  that  Government  should 

consider in the future, to allow us to address matters of national importance in this august House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, we note the Ministerial Statement that has been made is relating 

to water issues that are currently been faced.  I would like to request the Honourable Minister, because 

yesterday, we were looking at the Office of the Auditor-Generals Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Annual Report for Water Authority of Fiji is yet to be tabled in this august House.  I think 

the latest one that has been tabled was for 2016 and now is 2021.  So, we would not be making such 

</span><span>questions  whether  the  Ministerial  Statement  that  has  been  made  by  the  Honourable  Minister  is 

</span></p>
<p><a name="13">Page 13</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>855 

</span></p>
<p><span>actually going to be actioned by the executives or will this be another round of Ministerial Statements 

that would be coming up, should we face future water shortages, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the contents of the Statement, I would like to redirect the Honourable 

Minister to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Report recently produced that I have reviewed and 

I am aware that disbursements under Fiji Development Bank (FDB) loan 2055(FIJ) for Suva-Nausori 

Water Supply and Sewerage Project for water implementation was approved in 2003 and completed 

in 2013, at a value of $72.4 million.   The ADB gave an initial loan of $47 million in 2009 and further 

supplementary loan of $23 million, to finance cost overruns resulting from implementation delays.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Reports points to a lot administrative challenges for Water Authority of 

Fiji. Since WAF became a reformed entity in December 2010, the people of this nation have, despite 

assurances that water disruptions would improve have continued to be inundated by water shortages 

for days, sometimes for weeks and sometimes for months.  Sadly, this is in most of our main urban 

centres, especially in Suva and other main centres.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I note the Honourable Minister is only concentrating in Suva.  My question to the Honourable 

Minister is, what about the Nasinu-Nausori corridor, Navua and Pacific Harbour corridor; why is the 

</span><span>Honourable Minister not including it in his update to this august House, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, 11 years after reforms, we still have this ongoing issues, despite so much money</p>
<p><span>being put into the projects for upgrading and maintenance of our water supply system. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The ADB Report I have cited online, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a lot of reasons why there 

remains  no Annual Report, for instance,  in 2006.  The audited accounts for the entity were never 

done since inception until 2013.  Now, it is five minutes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- This is why I requested for another five minutes:</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the auditor when conducting the first audit of the entity in 2013, issued a 

disclaimer  of  opinion,  which  means  that  it  is  no  longer  able  to  form  an  opinion  on  the  Finance 

Statements tabled on 31st December, 2010, Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to lack of evidence and  lack of 

supporting documents.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Instances of the lack of audit evidence cited are: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>adjustments to the accounts without proper evidence and authority; 

inventory General Ledger and sub-ledger balances not reconciled; 

lack of valuation of the property, plant and equipment taken over by WAF on its creation; 

stock-take not been undertaken at end of the year.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Those are similar  issues that have also been highlighted and discussed, and assurances have  been 

given by the Honourable Minister in yesterday’s motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In the 2011, the auditor issued an adverse opinion on the basis of: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>inclusion  of  water  and  sewerage  charges  and  the  corresponding  receivables  when 

proceeds from these sources are deposited in the Government Consolidated Fund; 

</span><span>lack of internal control over Journal Vouchers; 

</span><span>lack of valuation of the property, plant and equipment taken over by WAF on its creation;

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>inventory General Ledger and sub-ledger balances not reconciled; 

lack of evidence for other payables</span><span>. </span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Those  are  ongoing  important  operational  issues,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  have  yet  to  be 

addressed by WAF.  No wonder, the resulting outcome is the continuous water disruptions that we 

are currently facing day-in and day-out. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  the  Honourable  Minister  to  look  at  the  root  cause  of  the  issues</p>
<p><span>prevailing at WAF and address those  to allow WAF to fully function and bear fruit.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst the intention of all entities, including the Government who had assisted with providing 

funding to address Fiji’s water provisional challenges, I suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  that Government 

commissions a performance systems audit that allows fundamental challenges to be identified and 

addressed.   Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member:</span> I now give the floor to the designated</p>
<p><span>speaker for the National Federation Party, the Honourable Tikoduadua.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable 

Minister for his Statement.  He definitely  has a mountain ahead of him to move, and I must say I 

sympathise with him because it seems that the problem is so big that he has very little solutions for 

it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am not going to repeat all of the problems that are there, I am familiar with them, but I am 

just  going  to  suggest  a  few  things  to  the  Honourable  Minister.    One  of  the  things  I  am  going  to 

suggest, Mr. Speaker, is that the reform is not working.  It has been 11 years and that reform has not 

worked.  It is not only really in the infrastructure on the ground where water is delivered to households 

but it is actually in the work where the reform is happening.  It needs new ideas and a new WAF. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry for Infrastructure or the Ministry dealing with water and WAF responds to two 

Heads – the Minister for Public Enterprises where the reform originates  from and the Minister for 

Infrastructure that deals with water.  It is a big dilemma.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest at this time that because the reforms are not working, not only  in WAF, but FRA 

has collapsed and I know that very well, and the many other reforms of the Government entities have 

collapsed, that needs to change.  The brain on top of it has to change, and they need to recognise that.  

If the ideas do not change, then the same problem will occur in the next 11 years.  I sat in the job for 

six months, and it has not changed since then until now.  The question is, why?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday,  we  talked  about  all  the  economic  booms  and  everything,  water  continues  to 

diminish.    They  very  simple  things  like  water  re-supply,  trucks  getting  to  their  households  when 

water is disrupted between Nausori and Suva, or even down to Rewa and the deltas of Tailevu, let 

alone Labasa and Lautoka.  The reform has not worked, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are many problems and I am not going to talk about them anymore but all I am going 

</span><span>to say  is that, there are some  bad attitude, particularly coming from the WAF Board.  I mean, the 

</span><span>Chairman of the WAF Board replied to the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party last 

week and that is uncalled for. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are pointing out a problem that people are facing, consistently, regularly and that is over 

a lengthy period. Yes, the problem is there, but the people do not want to hear the problem, they want

</span></p>
<p><span>to hear the solutions and the immediate solutions is to get water to the people when the water supply 

is down, that is not happening.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  capacity  needs  to  be  boosted  and  I  would  like  to  recommend,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this 

privatisation reforms in the different places are not working.  The Minister needs more power.  He 

needs to grab the bull by the horn in the Water Authority and take a little bit of weight from the Public 

Enterprise, where a lot of ideas are not working. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Then and only then, with dedicated resources it can fix our water.  The majority of our people 

live between Rewa, Tailevu and up to Lami, which is where much of the reform should be done, he 

is doing a lot of good work, but it is not enough.  The strategy is falling way behind the problems.  

He has mentioned a lot of problems today and government, I hope, is going to give him a lot of help 

to deliver the water to the people.  Thank you.

<p><span>Youth Climate Action Summit 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  Honourable  Prime  Minister, 

Honourable Ministers and Honourable Members of Parliament, I am honoured to address this august 

House on the recent Youth Climate Action Summit, held in Suva from 16th to 18th March, 2021.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the  Summit  may  be  for the  first time,  but the  empowerment training  on 

climate change has been an ongoing programme for my Ministry.  We were also very glad by your 

presence amongst the youth as well, and I thank you.  I wish to thank the Honourable Prime Minister 

for  opening  the  first  ever  National  Youth  Climate  Action  Summit.    I  also  wish  to  highlight  the 

Opening Statement of the Honourable Prime Minister and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“I had been to a lot of climate change conference over the past few years, but let 

</span><span>me tell you something, there is something refreshing about this one.  I think it boils down 

to a simple fact, you, my friend are genuine.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prime Minister’s full speech paved the way towards 

a successful Summit.  I commend the Honourable Prime Minister’s leadership and thank him for his 

wisdom and the Government’s overall effort towards climate change issues.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  intention to host such a Summit emanated  from  my  </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions 

with the young people during my visitations to their respective communities.  I have witnessed, first 

hand, the  impact of climate change on their communities and how this translates to further socio-

economic challenges.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has a young population and youths between the ages of 15 to 35 (as we 

should all know by  now), make over a third of the nations’ population.  The median age of Fiji’s 

population is 27.5 years and 70 percent of Fiji’s population are below the age of 40 years.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The median age of Fiji’s population is 27.5 years and 70 percent of Fiji’s population are below 

</span><span>the age of 40 years. Youths play a vital role in the decision-making process and their potential as key 

</span><span>agents  for social change,  innovation and  future  leadership places them at  the heart of  building up 

resilience to worsening climate impacts.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Climate  science  clearly  tells  us  that  less  than  10  years  is  left  for  the  world  to  make  a 

sustainable,  inclusive,  resilient  and  low  carbon  transition  to  avoid  the  worst  impacts  of  climate 

change. Therefore, it is important to have our young people participate as agents of change as they 

can influence their fellow youths to join the fight against climate change.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker Sir, given this context, my Ministry convened 200 young Fijians to deliberate</p>
<p><span>on climate change issues affecting their daily lives and the nation as a whole.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, a key agenda for the three-day National Youth Climate Action Summit was 

to create awareness on Fiji’s climate agenda through national plans, policies and strategies as well as 

</span><span>generate  active  dialogue  among  youths  about  climate  change  and  how  it  impacts  their  lives  and 

</span></p>

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>communities. Such discussions tied up with important sections of the draft Climate Change Bill and 

how the draft Bill could serve their collective needs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir,</span><span> </span><span>the National Youth Climate Action Summit turned out to be an excellent 

enabler for youths to discuss matters relating to climate change.  I personally witnessed the innovative 

and  exciting  way  our  youths  approached  this  global  issue.  While  voices  of  all  youths  need  to  be 

heard,  many  a  time  we  see  that  discussion  spaces  on  climate  change  and  broader  national 

developments are dominated by urban youths.  

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  rather  unfortunate  that  sometimes  finance  and  time  do  not  allow  rural  youths  to 

participate  in  dialogue  regarding  matters  of  national  interest.  In  this  regard,  the  decision  by  my 

Ministry to ensure the participation of rural youths to be in this Summit to discuss climate change 

and the draft Climate Change Bill was greatly welcomed by the Climate Change Division within the 

Ministry of Economy and other UN agencies involved.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Summit was able to help  youths better understand the effects of Climate Change. The 

youths in their responses made it clear that they had a better understanding of Climate Change. I am 

happy  to  learn  that  they  clearly  stated  that  the  first  ever  national  summit  has  given  them 

</span><span>encouragement to become climate warriors.  It was also inspiring to have youths from the disabled 

</span><span>community, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to participate in the event with dedicated translators throughout the 

entire three-day event.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the highlight of the Summit was the  lively and  innovative discussions on 

Day 3 between youths on how the draft Climate Change Bill can be improved and factors that it must 

consider to ensure that it is  inclusive and truly representative of youth priorities. With 200 youths 

participating throughout the Summit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, national consultations on the draft Climate 

Change Bill have kicked off to an excellent start. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Summit also gave consideration to the Healthy Environments for Healthy 

Children Global Programme Framework 2021 by UNICEF as the Committee on the Rights of the 

Child has identified climate change as one of the biggest threats to children’s health and is urging 

States to place it at the center of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, these discussion sessions not only provided youths an opportunity to voice 

their concerns on priorities relating to Climate Change but provided the guideline to creating their 

own action plans outlining climate justice for their communities.  It allowed meaningful engagement 

</span><span>and  contribution  from  the  youth  sector  as  they  developed  the  self-sustainable  action  plan  to 

</span><span>implement in their respective communities.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  the  Summit  culminated  in  the  development  of  an  outcome  statement  by</p>
<p><span>youths and I wish to highlight the preamble, our future, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Children and youth are not just leaders of tomorrow, they are the partners of today. They 

stand  for  action  and  change.  They  stand  for  solutions.  The  document  recognises  that 

Climate Change is a human rights crisis threatening our lives, our families and our future, 

and propose the fact that youths want our future generation to live in a safe, clean, healthy 

and sustainable environment.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>In this outcome document, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 200 youth delegates of the National Youth 

Climate Action Summit 2021, representing the voices of young people, acknowledge and thanks 

</span><span>the  Government  of  Fiji  for  its  strong  leadership  in  implementing  a  whole  of  Government 

</span><span>approach, taking climate actions at all  levels.  It recognises positive steps taken at the national

</span></p>
<p><span>level including the development of the Climate Change Bill which sets the policy direction for us 

as a nation, recognising the rights of children and youth set out in the Constitution and aligned to 

global commitment and standards. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, the  youth participants recommended to establish  a National 

Youth Climate Change Advisory Group to amplify the voices of young people which will contribute 

to the  governance  and  oversight  of  climate  change-related  issues  in  the  National  Climate  Change 

Coordination  Committee  to  strengthen  mechanisms,  frameworks  and  financial  support  for  the 

inclusion  and  active  participation  of  Fijian  youths  irrespective  of  gender  and  abilities  within  all 

policy-making  and  planning  processes  at  national,  regional  and  international  level  including 

participation of young people in the official Government delegation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the youth participants pledged that “we the youth commit to take concrete 

action to contribute to the Climate Change mitigation and adaptation at grassroots level. When we 

return to our communities, we commit to implement our Climate Action Plan and involve other young 

people in our communities. Today, we the Fijian youths, take a firm stand in committing ourselves 

to take climate action and do all that is within our capacity to collaborate with our Government and 

relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the Climate Action Plan and Climate Change 

</span><span>Bill 2020.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcome document supports my Ministry’s approach in Climate Change 

programme such as Youth Coast Care Clubs, Waste Care and Management and our new Certificate 

1 in Resilience programme which covers disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation that 

will be implemented in all our youth training centres in the new financial year.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Climate Change affects all stages of life in different ways and it is every 

country’s  duty  to  formulate  ways  to  protect  its  people  against this.    The  National  Climate  Action 

Summit was made possible through the generous assistance and support of partners and stakeholders.  

</span></p>
<p><span>At  this  juncture,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  sincere  gratitude  to  the  Climate  Change  and 

International  Cooperation  Division  (CCICD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  United  Nations 

International  Children's  Emergency  Fund  (UNICEF)  Pacific  as  our  major  partners  and  other  UN 

agencies and relevant line ministries for their support.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to thank  my  Technical  Working  Group  for  all  their  effort  in 

putting up this event to recognise the voices of our youth.  Their contributions have made the event 

</span><span>a successful one as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to carry out its roles and functions 

for the youth across the nation and continue to strive to meet unique challenges of our youths with 

the resources for the 21st Century in Fiji.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I now 

give  the  floor  to  the  designated  speaker  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Honourable  Ratu 

Matanitobua.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA.:</span> Thank you, Mr.  Speaker, Sir.  I rise to respond to the</p>
<p><span>Statement by the Honourable Minister on the recent National Youth Climate Action Summit.

<p><span>I congratulate the Honourable Minister and the youth who attended the successful Summit.  

</span><span>Government continues to build on the initiatives of previous Governments, starting with the Alliance

</span></p>
<p><span>Government,  the  Soqosoqo  Vakavulewa  ni  Taukei  (SVT)  who  ratified  the  Rio  Biodiversity 

Convention and the Climate Change Convention in October 1992. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Following that, the Peoples Coalition in 1999 and Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) 

from 2001 continued the work of environmental protection and climate change adaptation initiatives. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, as always, the proof is in the pudding. It is in the detail of:</p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Laws and policies; 

(2)</span><span> </span><span>Budget allocation; and 

(3)</span><span> </span><span>Human resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For  the  enforcement  agencies  like  the  Department  of  Environment,  that  demonstrate  the 

commitment of the Government, to safeguard our nation and planet for future generations.  In this 

regard, Mr. Speaker, I urge the Government to ensure extensive and meaningful consultations on the 

Draft Climate Change Bill which affects the rights and livelihood of our people.  Government must 

explain the Bill simply without jargon to the people so they can have their say on the Bill. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the  iTaukei  as  the  First  People,  Government must  respect our rights  to  freedom,  prior 

</span><span>informed consent, before this law is tabled and enacted in Parliament.  This right to be heard before 

a law that affects us or our rights is enacted, is guaranteed in the UN Declaration on the Rights of 

Indigenous  Peoples  (UNDRIP)  and  ILO  Convention  169  on  the  Rights  of  Indigenous  Peoples.  

Unfortunately, Government did not respect this right when it comes to about 27 Decrees published 

since 2006, that affect our rights and the management of our resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, our environment is relatively fragile due to location, smallness and geographic 

isolation.  A SODELPA Government will put into place and strengthen necessary policy framework, 

to ensure the proper management of the environment and sustainable use of natural resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  will  initiate  the  review  of  the  “Green  Growth  Framework”  and  all  laws  relating  to 

biodiversity and climate change.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, there is little evidence of the Green 

Growth Framework being implemented. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, I urge the youth of Fiji to look critically at what is happening on the ground,</p>
<p><span>and not just what Government Ministers are saying.  For example: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The destruction of mangroves on the Lami/Naboro Highway to make way for industrial 

</span><span>development  and  deliberate  withholding  of  the  Mangroves  Bill  to  ban  mangrove 

destruction; 

Pollution through vessel spills from Suva Harbour affecting local </span><span>Qoliqoli</span><span>; 

Unsustainable extraction of gravel from rivers with adverse effects on the livelihood of 

villages, to name a few. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We also have disgraceful developers tearing up reefs and an Environment Department that 

</span></p>
<p><span>struggles to hold them accountable. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, while it is commendable that the Minister encouraged youth at the Summit to 

become climate warriors, I encourage the youth to measure Government’s commitment by its action 

and not its words.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  thank  the  Honourable  Ratu  Matanitobua  for  his  contribution  to  the</p>

<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  designated  speaker  of  the  National  Federation  Party  Leader, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua.  You have the floor, Ma’am. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  thank  the 

Honourable  Minister  for  his  Statement  on  the  Youth  Climate  Action  Summit.    As  a  matter  of 

curiosity, I went to the Government website and also to the UNICEF to have a look at the photographs 

and interestingly, it was the address that the Prime Minister gave, first of all.  It was a lovely address 

and the sad part was that, he mentioned the youth second last.  Imagine everyone including yourself, 

Mr.  Speaker, the Honourable Minister, the representatives, the agencies, the Cabinet Ministers, the 

members of the Diplomatic Corps and then the youth participants and then ladies and gentlemen. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The optics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was also interesting during the meeting.  All the dignitaries and 

the Ministers sat in the front while the youth participants, including my best friends sat at the back 

almost as an afterthought. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  in  his  Opening  Address,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  correctly 

said,“Act  later  the  matter  of  politicians  for  far  too  long  is  no  longer  being  tolerated,  especially 

amongst the world’s young people”.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Then  he  goes  on  to  say,  “We  (as  in  Fiji)  are  not  a  major  emitter,  we  all  know  that.    Fiji 

contributes around 0.006 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.”  Absolutely correct, but then, 

what should we be doing right now?  That is my question.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few suggestions from a 17 year old, AnnMary Raduva, in her speech at the World 

Consumer Rights Day on 12th March.  The theme for which was Eliminating our Plastic Footprint 

and Ms. Raduva says in her speech, and I would like to quote her: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“On December 2008, I launched a ‘no balloon December’ a campaign to eliminate 

balloons  in  the  month  of  December,  as  well  as  lobbying  for  the  Fijian  Government  to 

revise the Fiji Litter Act to classify balloon releasing, that is helium balloon releasing as 

littering.  Many families and organisations have stopped using balloons since 2018.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>And she went on to say, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Today, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask the Honourable Minister for Commerce, 

Trade, Tourism and Transport, the Consumer Council of Fiji and you to help me and support me 

</span><span>and the young equal champs of Fiji lobbying and request our Government to declare every April 

</span><span>the 20th which is International Earth Day, a plastic free day in Fiji” (and she went on.to say), “we 

have to start somewhere.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, while the outcomes of the Summit are fantastic, a lot have been praising Government, we 

need some action and I would like us to urge all of us, especially those of us in this House to please 

do  what this  young  woman  has  been  trying  to  do  which  is  to  declare  helium  balloon  releasing  as 

littering and also ask us all to please, declare every 20th April the International Earth Day as a plastic 

free day in Fiji because while we are talking about emissions and the Honourable Prime Minister was 

right that we are very tiny in the world of emissions.  Our plastic output is something that is going to 

drive us out before emissions do. </span><span>Vinaka. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Qereqeretabua  for her contribution:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, we will move on.  I now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing 

</span></p>
