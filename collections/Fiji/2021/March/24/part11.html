<h3>REVIEW REPORT - FOLLOW-UP AUDIT ON THE 
MANAGEMENT OF THE LAND REFORM PROGRAMME</h3>
<p><span>REVIEW REPORT - FOLLOW-UP AUDIT ON THE 

MANAGEMENT OF THE LAND REFORM PROGRAMME 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move:</p>
<p><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Follow-Up  Audit  on  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Management of the Land Reform Programme which was tabled on 15th May, 2019.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I now invite the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public</p>
<p><span>Accounts to speak on his motion. You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prime Minister, the Honourable 

Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Ministers and Honourable Members of Parliament, I, as the 

Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  who  moved  this  motion,  take  this 

opportunity to speak on the motion in regards to the Public Accounts Committee Review Report on 

the Follow-up Audit on the Management of  the Land Reform Programme.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Follow-up Audit made on the management of Land Reform Programme which was tabled 

in Parliament during the November 2018 Sitting and referred to the Standing Committee on Public 

Accounts for its scrutiny. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On  Monday  25th  March,  2019,  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources’  former 

Permanent Secretary, Mr. Malakai Finau, and his Team appeared before the Committee and clarified 

the audit issues that were raised by Honourable Members, especially on the audit focused areas which 

includes the: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>policies governing the administration of the land reform; 

system and processes governing the land designation and allocation; and 

recording  monitoring of  land bank activities to ensure Governments’ objectives are 

appropriately met and due regard for economy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Audit Report made on the Management of the Land Reform Programme was a follow-

up audit that the Auditor-General conducted to examine whether the Land Use Division (LUD) has 

</span><span>effectively  implemented  the  recommendations  which  were  made  in  the  Management  of  the  Land 

</span><span>Reform Programme</span><span> </span><span>Audit Report on Performance Audit Volume 2 of December 2014 (Parliamentary 

Paper No. 6 of 2015).   

</span></p>
<p><span>The auditors also assessed whether the actions taken  have addressed the underlying  issues 

that led to the Auditors recommendation on that initial report.  The Audit Report provides the details 

of  the  review  and  analysis  done  on  the  Land  Use  Division  in  addressing  the  original  audit 

recommendation under the following key audit areas:  

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Policies governing the administration  of the Land Reform 

</span></p>
<p><span>The first chapter of the Audit Report seeks to establish whether the Land Use Division 

has addressed the issues raised in the 2014 General Report with regards to the existence 

and effectiveness of policies and procedures governing the management of land and bank 

</span><span>activities.

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Systems and processes for land designation and allocation 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  second  chapter  of  the  Audit  Report  seeks  to  determine  whether  the  Land  Use 

Division  has taken the necessary actions towards issues raised  in the 2014 General 

Report  with  regards  to the  existence  and  effectiveness  of  arrangement  in  place  for 

designation and allocation of </span><span>itaukei</span><span> and designated state land. The 2014 Audit Report 

focused on the examination of systems and processes that the Land Use Division uses 

to establish a plan and manage activities related to the management of the land bank 

for the achievement of its objective. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Recording and monitoring of Land Bank activities to ensure Governments’ objectives are 

appropriately met with due regard to economy 

</span></p>
<p><span>The last chapter seeks to establish whether the Land Use Division has addressed the 

issues  raised  in  the  2014  General  Report  with  regards  to  the  effectiveness  and 

efficiency of the recording and monitoring arrangements in place with the Land Used 

Development. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  conducted  a  review  on  the  Follow-up  Audit 

Report on the Management of the Land Reform Programme and has few recommendations to bring 

to the attention of the House before Parliament take note of its report. The three main areas that were 

audited are as follows with the Committee’s recommendation: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Policies governing the administration and land reforms. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 1 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee notes the recommendation by Office of the Auditor General (OAG) 

and the timeframe provided by Ministry of Lands to the Office of the Auditor General 

(OAG)  that  policies  shall  be  developed  in  six  months’  time  from  the  time  of  the 

follow-up audit.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The six  months’ timeframe expired on 30th April, 2019. Therefore, the Committee 

expects  the  Land  Use  Division  SOP/policies  to  have  been  released  on  30th  April, 

2019.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Systems and processes for land designation and allocation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 1</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The  Public  Accounts  Committee  (PAC)  notes  the  Ministry’s  Land  Use  Division’s 

progress  on  its  monitoring  and  conducting  of  its  outreach  program  and  further 

recommends  that  the  Land  Use  Division  (LUD)  strengthens  its  evaluation  on  the 

outreach program. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 2 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Public  Accounts  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  should  conduct 

appropriate land studies on land deposited under the Land Bank to ensure there can 

be investment carried out on that land and have fair economic returns to landowners. 

The area covered was recording and monitoring of land bank activities

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>865 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 1</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  notes  that  work  is  in  progress  for  the  development  of  a  database. 

Further to that, the Committee recommends that this process be expedited and once 

fully operational, the information to be accessible to other relevant agencies dealing 

with land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 2 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee recommends that the Land Use Division should develop a monitoring 

procedure  which  should  be  incorporated  into  the  Division’s  SOP.  The  procedures 

should  clearly  outline  areas  to  be  monitored,  responsibilities  for  monitoring  and 

suitable timelines for carrying out the monitoring work.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  I  commend  the  effort  of  the  Members  of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  in  the 

compilation of this Report and most importantly, to the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources in 

taking  the  Committee’s  recommendations  positively  and  working  towards  addressing  issues  that 

were raised by the Auditor-General in its Audit Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker Sir,  with those few comments, as the Member  moving the  motion to debate this</p>
<p><span>Public Accounts Committee report, I thank you for this opportunity. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Chairperson.   I now, Honourable Members, declare that the floor 

is open for debate on the motion.  I call on the Honourable Aseri Radrodro. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I stand as a Member of the Public 

Accounts Committee, speaking in support of this motion.  I would like read a relevant passage, Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  pertaining  to  Land  Use  and  Management  from  the  motion  of  the  late  Ratu  Sir  Lala 

Sukuna to the Great Council of Chiefs in 1936, as captured in his book titled, “</span><span>Three Legged Stool</span><span>”.   

</span></p>
<p><span>He had three points which he pointed out, Mr. Speaker, Sir: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>It would be in the interest of the native Fijians to have their lands lying idle to be put 

to good use; 

The  amount  of  land  needed  for  the  proper  development  of  the  native  owners  be 

</span><span>determined so as to see the amount of land left over; and 

</span><span>All land that is not so required be handed over to Government to lease on our behalf. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in his motion the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna had stated that high chiefs in 

considering the interest of their people, must remember that Fiji is now made up of native Fijians and 

people of other ethnicities and it was everyone’s interest that land be utilized in the most appropriate 

manner because land is a basis of wealth.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Very importantly, Mr. Speaker, in this motion, the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna had reminded 

that landowners had a duty to the State and similarly the State had a duty to protect and promote the 

interest of landowners and all our citizens, to ensure Fiji prospers peacefully.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been 85 years today and the words of the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna 

remains so relevant for Fiji.  There has been  much progress  in the utilisation of  land with various 

forms of land policies which has seen land leases being granted for agricultural use, for business and 

commercial development for residential purposes, et cetera.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today,  we  discussed  issues  pertaining  to  the  Land  Bank  and  we  also 

discussed issues pertaining to the Land Buy Back Scheme.  It is evident that whilst the Government’s 

intention  may  have  been  good  for  the  various  land  use  programmes  it  has  initiated,  it  has  failed 

miserably, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support the various programmes it has with the necessary policies, as 

pointed out by the Office of the Auditor-General’s (OAG) Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    in  its  haste to  address the  issue  of  land  use  with  mutual  benefits  to the 

landowners and tenants, Government continues to evade discussing the real issues that made land a 

political football for various Governments from the past to the present day.  We still have expiring 

land leases and without any genuine attempt to resolve the rental and returns for landowners, we still 

have challenges of addressing land security concerns. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In a recent visit to the Western Division, I had the honour of sharing a conversation with two 

Indo-Fijians, whom I met for the first time and in passing.  Both gentlemen are from the sugarcane 

belt  area  and  hail  from  Sigatoka.    We  spoke  a  lot  about  the  current  economic  concerns  and  the 

impending Elections  in 2022 and as the crux of our impromptu discussions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 

agreed that a lot issues remained and must be addressed between the two major races in Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Something  that  they  shared,  has  remained  in  my  mind  since  we  met.    For  instance,  Mr. 

Speaker, they stated that they now realise as cane farmers and tenants that land leases have been used 

by politicians as a way of dividing our people.  They shared their views that it was sad that land leases 

have been consistently expiring and because of the insecurity of the land leases, the younger Indo-

Fijians who hail from indo-Fijian communities and who predominately plant sugarcane no longer see 

sugarcane farming as a lucrative option.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The two gentlemen surprised me, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  and they said that in their opinion, land 

lease  rental  should  have  been  increased  for  landowners,  to  commensurate  with  the  benefits  that 

farmers have enjoyed from the use of lease land.  Ironically, Mr. Speaker, my two-found friends even 

criticised  the  resettlement  funding  given  to  farmers,  whose  leases  had  expired.    They  said  that  it 

would  have been better utilised had those funds  been given to landowners so that leases could  be 

renewed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  time  and  again  I  have  said  in  this  august  House that  we,  collectively  as 

Fijians,  can  benefit  from  the  development  of  our  nation  if  Government  takes  the  lead  and 

responsibility to implement practical and realistic policies with no ego or political agenda. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  OAG  Report  also  highlighted  the  various  challenges  in  the  State  Feehold  Buy  Back 

Scheme policy.  It identified that 25 landowning units still owe Government a balance of $3.4 million 

for the purchase of freehold land on their behalf.  This is significant example of a policy given without 

the necessary support structure.  If capital was an issue, as it is common for our landowners, what 

does Government have as a solution for such scenarios? 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to land, there is just so much that we can speak on.  These 

issues that have been highlighted by the OAG point importantly to trust issues that landowners also 

have with Government and what it can and needs to do to protect and promote their interest.  I remain 

convinced that we will resolve the insecurities of both major races when it comes to land, and we 

will have lasting peace and economic prosperity in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  a  start,  for  reviewing  of  policies  and  implementing  the  appropriate  ones  to  guide  this 

subject and commodities, which we speak on today, I recommend that the Government conducts a 

review of the ITLB Leasing Administration Cost and also review the role of the entity, whether they

</span></p>
<p><span>867 

</span></p>
<p><span>remain  relevant  today  for  landowners  and  tenants,  or  the  entity  requires  modifications  to  ensure 

landowners’ interests are promoted and protected, especially for the purpose of engaging in business 

development and ventures, and for Fiji’s leasing sustainable development. 

</span></p>
<p><span> I will end with the words of the late Ratu Sir Lala as words of advice to the Government, 

</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span>kua so na vakusakusa, ia meda vakamalua</span><span>” - slow but sure.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Aseri Radrodro for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I  give  the  floor  to the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity</p>
<p><span>to speak on this report on the Follow-Up Audit on the Management of the Land Reform Programme.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, contemporary Fiji and the status of its development is basically due to the 

development in the agriculture sector and that is not of normal or out of normal for any developing 

country.  If you look at the study of all developed countries, almost all of them except those in the 

Middle East et cetera, have developed based on the surplus created out of the agriculture sector.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  agricultural  sector  growth  and  development  has  a  number  of  binding 

constraints and one of the binding constraints is the availability of land.  Therefore, we can fairly and 

squarely say that Fiji’s contemporary state of development is a result of the availability and supply 

of  land  for agriculture.  Had it not been  for the availability and supply of  land  for agriculture, we 

would  not  have  seen  surplus  creations  in  agriculture  and  we  would  not  have  seen  transfer  of  that 

surplus for the development and expansion of the non-agricultural sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I join Honourable Radrodro in thanking the thinkers during that time, Ratu 

Sir Lala Sukuna, the landowners and the landowning community for availing land for agricultural 

production and growth and development for their community but also growth and development of 

the other communities and for the country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last four decades we have seen how the country has expanded and 

it has basically demonstrated how we need to collectively create surplus and that surplus needs to be 

transferred to other areas where the surplus will  generate additional returns.  It is  normal that the 

</span><span>surplus created by individual decision-making units will find or search for areas where returns are 

</span><span>higher and the surplus will go to that particular area in pursuit of that higher return.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whether it is within a country or within a region or across the borders, it is normal that within 

a  locality,  within  a  country  a  surplus  is  created  and  if  other  countries  are  providing  much  higher 

return, then that surplus will be transferred.  Like surplus in Australia and New Zealand will come to 

Fiji in search of much much higher return than what is offered in Australia and New Zealand and 

therefore for example the tourism sector or mine sector et cetera and they will invest. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen surplus created in the agriculture sector invested in 

non-agricultural sector in Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the return on surplus that is created in the agriculture 

sector does not happen on its own.  It happens because there are other factors of production that needs 

to  work on  that  key  natural  resources  which  is  land.    If  you  do  not  put on  those other  factors  of 

production to utilise that resource, than the returns on that particular resource should be zero.  In any 

resource, which generates zero return, basic theory in economics is that, that particular resource has 

no value.  Simple!

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  what  I  am  saying  is  that,  we  have  resources  you  need to  ensure  that the 

resources have value and for the resources to have value, you need to put those resources under use 

otherwise the owners of the resource will not get any benefit even though they can see that they have 

available resource but the  fact of the  matter is that, if the resource does not generate any positive 

return than the resource has no value.  That is the law of economics. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Minister for Agriculture, I have toured very widely  in Fiji and I have 

seen a large vast tracts of land which is not utilised.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I sometimes hear commentaries 

from  people  saying  that,  and  I  quote,  “No!  this  is  not  a  very  good  land,  this  land  is  not  of  good 

quality.”  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, seven or eight decades ago, all the lands were under bush.  The land 

became arable because someone worked on that land and transformed it to be arable, to be worth to 

undertake cultivation on that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There were large tracts of land all over Fiji, which is now classified as ‘A’ category, class ‘A’ 

land, which at that particular point of time, was not “A”.  Labour was added to it, time was added to 

it,  other  resources  or  machinery  now,  and  at that  particular  time,  basically  there  were  hardly  any 

machine power, but it was utilised to convert that land and add value to that land and make it in a 

form which can then be cultivated with resources of crops or livestock which can provide particular 

return. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to take this opportunity to thank all the parties involved, the trustees 

of the land owner, the iTLTB, the landowners, the farmers, the labourers and the supplier of tractors 

for production, for making it possible for agriculture sector to provide positive returns for the growth 

in development of the non-agriculture sector.  The growth is the same for all development countries, 

be it agriculture, commercial and industrial and now we see how service sector is flourishing, apart 

from what had happened  last year and this  year, that the service sector is utmost down, but it is a 

temporary thing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am  saying  is that, we need to ensure that  we release this  binding 

constraint.  To release this binding constraint, we have got a strategic advantage.   We got a strategic 

advantage in agriculture sector, our weather conditions are good, we can grow crops throughout the 

year, our supporting resources, like water is very cheap here, our soil fertility is very good and our 

produce has a brand image in the export market.  We need to harness on that and take advantage on 

that and that branding gives us entry into premium market, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this, the binding constraint is the releasing of land.  Honourable Radrodro 

</span><span>talked about getting the rental rates right.  When leases are processed, there are a couple of things 

that potential  investors look at; size of  land,  length of  lease, and the processing  fee and the rental 

rates.  All these plays a very important role in terms  of the kind of investment you would want to 

make.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  investment  requires  large  capital    and  the  lease  length  plays  a  very 

critical role because you need to allow the owner to recover the investment and then create surplus 

beyond it, then only the investment will flow into that particular sector, whatever the sector we are 

talking about and in this case, the agriculture sector.  That is how it operates.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, in the penal account, you need to control cost and rental rates are 

a very important cost. If your processing fees is like, basically buying a simple property or freehold 

property then what is the rental rates paid for.  If you want to protect the rental rate equivalent to a 

market rate, the market rate would be around equivalent to, if you peg it, to the rate of return and the 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>869 

</span></p>
<p><span>rate of return would be around 5 percent to 6 percent.  Is Honourable Radrodro talking about a rental 

rate equivalent to 12 percent or 10 percent?   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the moment, rental rates are pegged to 10 percent.  You talk to anyone, they will say, “It 

is  a  very  lucrative  rental  rate.”    Government  is  subsidising  through  the  Committee  of  Better 

Utilisation of Land (CBUL), 5 percent of it, and we are relooking at it whether we need to look at 

paying the one off processing fee.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to balance out what are we paying.  If 

the processing fee is based on the size of the land then it is not a processing fee. What is it then?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  kinds  of  binding  constraints  need  to  be  released  if  you  want  to 

accelerate  the  growth  in  development  of  the  agriculture  sector.    I  must  say  that  the  Ministry  of 

Agriculture is having a very good relationship with iTLTB.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Our Permanent Secretary is working very closely with the Deputy General Manager of iTLTB 

in assisting farmers.  We get a lot of requests from investors within and outside Fiji to invest in the 

agriculture sector and they are looking for large parcels of land.  We are working on that to see how 

we could work with iTLTB and identify to them that these are the large parcels of land.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure potential investors that we are getting very positive support 

from the iTLTB and we do hope that we will be able to release large parcels of land for agriculture 

growth and development, but we also need to be mindful of how we move land away from virgin 

forest, et cetera, and what will be impact on climate change, how we need to manage that and have 

that critical balance.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to again thank the landowners we have.  We have over 92 percent of 

the land in the country held in trust for them and if there is an issue with lower rental rates, we need 

to  have  a  debate.  If  there  is  an  issue  on the  management  fee,  then  the  problem  lies  with  iTLTB.  

Normally, in the market, the management fee is about 10 percent, if it is beyond 10 percent, then they 

have to deal with the  iTLTB.  If there  is a problem  with rent collection, then the problem  is with 

iTLTB, it is not with the tenants.  Deal with the trustee and why they are not able to collect it and 

they need to come hard on those who are not paying rent on time.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  the  report  and  I  do  look  forward  to  continue  the  good 

relationship  we  have  with  the  trustees  and  landowners  so  that  we  can  expand  agriculture  in  the 

national interest.  The national economy grows then the surplus created will be distributed amongst 

</span><span>all those who are participating in these sectors: landowners will benefit, the owners of the factors of 

</span><span>production will benefit, the labourers will benefit, the households will benefit, the farmers will benefit 

and of course, in the product side, where the money  is spent, the other markets will  benefit  in the 

commercial sector where the money is spent on those sectors.  Thank you.    

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution today:</span> I give the</p>
<p><span>floor to the Honourable Niko Nawaikula.  You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    A  short  reply  to  the  Honourable 

Minister, I get angry every time when people blame the natives of this country to say that we own all 

these  land,  all  these  land  are  lying  idle  because  these  people  do  not  understand.    How  we  live  is 

sustainable.  We do not take more than we should from the land.  Also, a lot of these land that are 

lying idle beside our villages are rock.  All arable lands have been given away.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister for Ag does not understand and maybe, the other side of the House 

that the natives of this country have done their obligation to the nation and he should have listened

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>to  Honourable  Aseri  Radrodro.   The  late  Ratu  Sukuna  understood that obligation  that  we  are  not 

alone here.  We are here with other communities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to do our part, we need to make our land available and he walked in the valleys and 

the mountains to consult widely and obtain their prior and informed consent and they did.  They gave 

their land to iTLTB and they entrusted it to do its obligation, make available very widely.  So that 

side of the House or for anyone, do not ever point a finger at us and saying that we are natives …. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Nawaikula, this is not a consultation process. You have the</p>
<p><span>floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> … because we have done our duty and vested the control of our</p>
<p><span>land to iTLTB.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  reminded  me  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  when  I  went  to  Geneva,  the  representative  of  the 

Government said, “We do not believe in indigenous rights because we are a majority.”  The Human 

Rights Committee said, “No, that is wrong.  You should give them the totality of their rights and then 

you balance it”, and that is a very good example of what Ratu Sukuna did.  We had a right to our 

land but we have to balance it also to the needs of the other community for land and that is the reason 

why iTLTB started, to ensure that not only the natives have access to land, everyone else, so we have 

equality  of  access.    How  did  he  do  that?    He  enacted  the  iTLTB  and  that  is  Government.    He 

demarcated the land.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The land closest to where we live in our villages, those are declared Native Reserves.  Outside 

of Native Reserves we have equality of access, so to the other side or to anyone, do not ever tell us 

that we are lazy by not using our land. We have done our obligation to the nation, we have given the 

control of our land and its administration to the Government and we are asking from that time, 90 

percent of the development vests on that, on what we did.   

</span></p>
<p><span>What has the Government done in return? Very little. Very, very, little and it is good also, 

Mr. Speaker, that Honourable Radrodro had started the debate with those words from iTLTB, from 

quoting the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna and understanding that.  We have done that by giving our land 

to iTLTB to develop because this, what do we call this.  

</span></p>
<p><span>This Land Use Unit and the Act that established it has been done in total contradiction to that 

</span><span>and I hope, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Tevita Kuruvakadua, who is the CEO for iTLTB and Mr. Solomone 

</span><span>Nata, are listening  because what this law and this Unit has done is to usurp the rights that iTLTB set.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The iTLTB’s role is to lease out our land so they have passed this law to establish another 

unit to duplicate that role without consulting us, without obtaining our prior and informed consent 

and all this time, iTLTB has been sitting down. We entrusted iTLTB to work for us, to fight for our 

rights, to negotiate, so we are asking why has not the iTLTB Board question the Government on its 

motives in relation to this law. Let me just now put us in perspective of why this law is in breach of 

the duty of the Government to consult us and the duty of the Government to obtain our prior and 

informed consent, contrary to what the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna did in establishing iTLTB.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, Mr. Speaker, that this Government ratified the ILO Convention 169. The ILO 

Convention 169  makes  it prerogative  for the government of the day, whichever, FijiFirst, SDL or 

whatever, to obtain the prior and  informed consent of the  indigenous people before changing any 

law,  for  example  this  law  or  changing  any  policy  that  affect  them.  Now,  ask  yourself,  did  the 

Government do that?  Did the Government consult with us in establishing this Unit to usurp the rights

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>871 

</span></p>
<p><span>of iTLTB which was established by law by Ratu Sukuna.  No, it did not, so it is a breach of the ILO 

Convention 169.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There is another breach here, that right to obtain from us our prior and informed consent.  And 

not only that, Mr. Speaker, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which 

they  denied,  nevertheless  you  are  entitled  to  your  opinion,  but  our  opinion  on  UNDRIP  is  that, 

something that is passed by the majority of the UN becomes binding.  But ILO Convention 169, it is 

legally binding on us, for us to respect that and it is a great disrespect that they did not consult with 

us,  they  did  not  obtain  our  prior  and  informed  consent  so  it  is  in  breach  of  the  Government’s 

obligation to ILO Convention 169.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  know  it  has  not  been  contested  in  the  court  but  that  does  not  exonerate  them  and 

understanding that, Sir, that is a breach of that right and UNDRIP has now declared that all these 

rights which are duplicated, recognised by the ILO Convention 169 but duplicated in UNDRIP are 

now human rights.   So, this law was passed in breach of our human rights because our right to be 

consulted, our right to free, prior and informed consent before they change any policy or law that 

affect us, was not done, so it is in breach of our human rights. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is also racist and I will tell you why, Mr. Speaker. When I went to Geneva, similar law, 

termination of the DPP which is where we were also not consulted and obtain our prior and informed 

consent, the observation from the human rights committees that it is racist. Why? It is because the 

definition of racism is to deny or favour somebody, all people on the basis of ethnicity.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the Act to terminate the GCC was done without obtaining that, it is a law that is targeted 

to deny that rights on the basis of our ethnicity.  Similarly, to this one, this is a law that was passed 

to remove our right on the basis of our ethnicity and therefore it is racist.  Remember that, Honourable 

Usamate, you are indigenous and you do not understand it.  Now let me teach you indigenous, on the 

other side, what you should know.  The conclusion is that, this law is in breach of our human rights 

- remember that. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> How is it a breach?</p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Honourable Speaker, Honourable Usamate is asking me how it is 

a breach?  He was not listening, does he want me to repeat what I have just said?  He is interjecting 

saying, “How does it breach it?” and I have just spent the full 10 minutes in relation to that. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Just address the Chair:</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  I  have  added  now  to  explain  how  it  is  racist,  and  still  being 

indigenous, he does not understand.  I am not sure what is wrong with you.  I will talk to you about 

what  Honourable  Prasad  quoted  to  that  effect,  if  he  does  not  understand  me,  something  must  be 

wrong with him, that is the bottom line.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is a law which is also racist and anything done on the basis of something that is clearly 

unlawful,  will never succeed because you have the curse of God and also the curse of the </span><span>vanua</span><span> will 

follow you and the prime definition of that is that it is permanent and inalienable.  It will never go 

away even by passing a law like this.  It will remain as it is until it is removed.  That is the meaning, 

Honourable Usamate. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> You choose your interpretation ….</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Whatever law you pass, this will never take it away.  It will persist 

until it is removed.  That is that, now let me go to the Report.  The first review they did of this Report 

was  in 2014  and they  found out exactly  -  nothing done.  I will say  now because  it was  in  breach 

because that is the curse of the </span><span>vanua</span><span> and the curse of God.  You did something that is unlawful and 

it is time to build on it, that is why it did not work and will never work.  This Report is the second 

review (2018) of what they did in 2014.  In 2014, looking back, they achieved nothing.  There was 

no Standard Operating Procedures, they could  not do the valuation.  There was a clear conflict of 

interest with the iTLTB then, and this one, it reviewed that again in 2018.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Again,  there  are  four  recommendations  here  and  they  are  basically  saying  that  what  the 

Auditor-General  did  in  each  Report,  which  is  this  one  (Parliamentary  Paper  No.  134),  they 

acknowledged that and that needs a lot of improvement.  Let me go through the gist of what is to be 

debated as contained in the Report of the Auditor-General, and I wish to go through that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now I will concentrate on the Report.  I have discussed and I hope I have convinced you that 

</span></p>
<p><span>this law is in breach of our human rights and racist.  Now let us look at the Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- That is your interpretation:</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- That is not my interpretation, Honourable Speaker.  The other side 

of the House is saying that that is my interpretation.  I hope they go to Geneva and attend the United 

Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Rights (because I go there all the time).  It is a shame that 

all of you, indigenous, on that side there do not understand.  </span><span>Dou sega ni kilai kemudou tiko mada 

ga.</span><span>  You want me to say it to you in your own language.  </span><span>Dou sega ni kilai kemudou tiko mada ga.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- You do not know yourselves.  I have to do that because they cannot 

understand it.  I have to relate it to them in their own language and if they still cannot understand 

that, something must be wrong here. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, on page 4.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Don’t be emotional.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> No, I am not emotional.</p>
<p><span>Number 4 states the key facts in relation to what we are talking about and says that the land 

in  Fiji  is  managed  through  three  complimentary  systems:  iTaukei  land;  freehold  land;  and  crown 

land.    There  is  a  mistake  here,  we  do  not  have  any  more  crown  land;  it  should  be  state  land,  so 

Government, please tell whoever is responsible for providing these reports should not misinform us.  

The Minister for Land should know that.  No more crown land but state land – the Report does not 

even know. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> Oh, they are looking at me wondering why you do not understand.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, remember all the Members are looking at me and my answer to them is  –</p>
<p><span>they are looking at me and wondering why they do not understand.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>873 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not talk in relation to that, but let me come to my conclusions and say 

this.    Having  said  all  that,  do  we  need  a  Land  Use  Commission?    No,  we  do  not  and  I  hope this 

government will terminate this law.  I can tell the House now that this will be one of the first laws 

that we will terminate when we come into power. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- In lieu of that, what we will do is that, we will empower iTLTB.  

iTLTB has a Land Use Section where we can take all these and give it to them and give them the 

money  to  develop  the  land  to  empower  iTLTB  because  you  are  usurping  the  power  and  the 

administrative features of iTLTB.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Usamate is saying because the landowners give 

50 percent, therefore it is legal.  No, he does not understand what I have been talking about.  I was 

talking about prior and informed consent before we pass this law.  Wide consultation before you pass 

this law?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Well, forget about you, let us talk here Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The solution is to empower iTLTB 

to do this role.  Now, the question is, do we need a Land Use Commission?  Yes, we do but not in 

the shape and form as it is here.   I hope in the future, we will have what we may call a  Land Use 

Commission which will be a regulatory body to ensure that the concerns of the Honourable Minister 

of Agriculture are addressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that Commission will declare land that is declared as agriculture, do not turn it into 

residential or whatever.  I am sure the Honourable Minister for Agriculture will agree with me.  If 

you  go  through  the  leasing  areas  in  the  West,  lands  that  were  leased  out  for  agriculture  are  now 

residential.  That is wrong and I hope this Commission will work closely with iTLTB, Government 

and  all  the  major  landowners  to  regulate  the  appropriate  use  of  all  lands.    So  that  landa  that  are 

properly demarcated for agriculture are maintained and used for agriculture all the time.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I hope too, that they will take a leaf from a comment that I heard from Ratu Mara.  Ratu Mara 

is my hero.  At one time, I was the secretary of iTLTB and Ratu Mara said that we should move away 

from concentrating on investment on large tracts of native land to investing on small tracts of native 

land with higher return.  As an example of that, he said the hotel leases are very small area but have 

a lot of return.  So listen to that and I hope they do not just joke at what I am saying because what I 

</span><span>am saying is true.  Learn from it!  Amend this Act, take it away, take all that money and give it to the 

</span><span>iTLTB Land Use Section because they need it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I thank  the  Honourable  Nawaikula:</span> I  give  the  floor to the  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  You have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, true to form Honourable Naiwakula has gone off on 

his diatribe once again.  I think everyone  in this  House and the people of  Fiji actually  need to be 

reminded because he constantly does this, Sir.  I want to remind  him about our Constitution. Our 

Constitution is a very reason why he is actually sitting here and so are we.  In it, Sir, in the first line 

in the preamble it says, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“We the people of Fiji recognising the indigenous people or the </span><span>itaukei, </span><span>their ownership 

of </span><span>itaukei</span><span> lands, their unique culture, customs, traditions and language”.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  how  can  you  actually  go  beyond  this?    What  he  is  actually  talking  about  is  actually 

preposterous and beyond that, the indigenous people or the </span><span>itaukei</span><span> people’s land is actually protected 

by virtue of this Constitution.  It is protected like it has never been protected before.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We have said this time and time again, Sir, and a matter of fact the previous Governments 

gave it away without consent.   Sir, to come here time and time again with his diatribe is actually 

nonsense, ludicrous and preposterous.   It is ridiculous how they actually come to this Parliament and 

make such statements. This book protects the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people’s land for good, Sir, go and read it, you 

are a lawyer.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Constitution is one thing.  The train has gone off the rails because they 

have decided to take this in another direction, we are talking about the land use but the Honourable 

Member has now decided to tell us that maybe we should empower the iTLTB.    

</span></p>
<p><span>However,  let  me  tell  him  that  iTLTB  has  been  empowered  from  day  one  and  is  still 

empowered till today.  It is still empowered to do what it is supposed to do and it does what it is 

supposed  to  do.    Let  me  tell  the  Honourable  Member,  the  Land  Use  Division  was  set  up  not  to 

compete with the iTLTB, it is a parallel Institution. It gives the landowners an option to go to the 

Land Use Division if they wished to lease their land.  It is properly done and most importantly, 60 

percent of the signatures of the landowning communities is required before it gets into the land.  That 

is what the law is. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, it is not like it is being taken away and some funny business is going on at the Land Use 

Division.  I am sure the Honourable Minister for Lands will actually tell us even more about it but, 

Sir,  these  are  things  that  actually  need  to  be  said  clearly,  carefully  and  for  the  people  of  Fiji  to 

understand and not listening to the diatribe that comes out from Honourable Nawaikula.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  I  want  to  speak  from  a  former  investment  perspective  and  also  from  where  Fiji  is, 

economically. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have  been an economy that relies on tourism,  on a very, very 

large scale and for which we have suffered. At the moment the Ministry of Agriculture, our Ministry 

and the Ministry of Economy has actually being promoting as much diversification as we can. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Land Use Division is actually a critical component in that diversification 

because landowners can actually give their land if they choose to do so, then we can have large scale 

farming  if  that  was  required.    So,  what  is  it,  there  is  a  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Commerce Trade, Tourism and Transport, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Land Use Division.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whenever investors come (local or overseas) to actually find these large tracts of land so we 

can diversify, our local people also want to invest in large scale farming. Diversification for us is an 

important word, we need to make sure that we are building up more industries and I give a classic 

example.  I am sure Honourable Seruiratu will actually agree with me on this.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We actually sitting on a gold  mine  in terms of organic  farming, Sir. We are all organic by 

nature. We have released our Fijian organic labelling and we are encouraging more and more people 

to  do organic  farming  and  if  we  do organic  farming  we  release,  we  export  more,  we  actually  get 

more.  We get paid more for organic products outside the country.  All of these things, this particular 

body called the  Land Unit Division (LUD)  forms  a critical component  in terms of us getting that 

done.  You have heard very lucidly from the Honourable Minister for Agriculture on how we can 

actually do things.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>875 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, at the end of the day also, when we talk about Land Use Division we also want to talk 

about and I am sure the Honourable Minister for Lands will actually  say  something about it.  We 

actually talk about the actual benefit to the landowners.  When it comes to the Land Use Division, 

the State only recovers its administrative costs. There is no poundage .involved in terms of when they 

actually give their money to the Land Use Division. So, they do benefit out of it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>No one is actually going to lose their land. They have a choice, strict guidance in terms of 

when they do actually deposits their land in the Land Bank and it is signed off by the Honourable 

Prime Minister.  He is designated to sign off and I am sure the Honourable Minister for Lands will 

actually tell you.  So, just in a nutshell, Sir, that is where we are and I think the Honourable Nawaikula 

needs to stop going on about this issue. He needs to read this and stop talking about Geneva because 

no one’s rights has been tempered, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As a matter of fact, all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people’s rights are actually protected by this particular blue 

</span></p>
<p><span>book and I thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister:</span> I give the floor to the next speaker on</p>
<p><span>my list, Honourable Bulanauca. You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I wish to comment on the Review 

on  Follow-Up  Audit  on  the  Management  of  the  Land  Reform  Programme,  2014  and  reviewed  in 

2018.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again,  in  the  Land  Use  Decree,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  This  is  one  of  the  draconian  Decrees; 

</span></p>
<p><span>managing native land under the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, why?   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Native  Land  are  already  managed  under  the  Native  Land  Trust  Board  (NLTB).    The 

Native Land Trust Board is already in existence to control, manage and develop in the best interest 

of iTaukei owners and the nations as a whole.  It is a self-determination under UNDRIP and ILO by 

itself and already in existence and yet taken away; why?” No consultation made to landowners and 

the </span><span>Bose Levu Vakaturaga </span><span>on the creation of this Decree.  It is a forced Decree, similar to the forced 

Constitution that we have just been shown.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Decree, only the Honourable Prime Minister may designate 

land. What about the owners of the land under the  iTaukei Land Trust Board Act and the </span><span>Bose Levu 

</span><span>Vakaturaga</span><span> transferring authority from the landowners themselves to only one person.   

</span></p>
<p><span> (Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  It  is  alright  with  the  state  land.    Again,  with  freehold  land 

transferring  that  similar  authority  to  the  designated  land.  I  have  no  problem  with  the  60  percent 

consent but that one is very important. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Although in Section 3, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the objects are:  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>to utilise designated native land in the best interest of native landowners; and 

to utilise designated crown land or state land to optimal return to that state.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That is very important to develop those land with optimum return to the State or to the landowners 

</span><span>themselves.

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also on freehold land it is not covered under the Land Use Decree.  The definition of the land 

</span></p>
<p><span>there only state lands and native lands. So, freehold, there is no jurisdiction over that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Under section 3(2), achievements required: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>providing of a Land Use Unit; 

providing longer tenure of leases undergoing for agricultural and commercial; and 

providing  that  all  land  available  are  leased  with  the  purpose  for  all  parties  concerned 

landowners and other stakeholders as well.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  very  concerning  is,  section  15,  certain  decisions  cannot  be</p>
<p><span>challenged.  That is very important, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>“Part 7 – Miscellaneous 

</span></p>
<p><span>15(1)  No  court,  tribunal,  commission  or  any  other  adjudicating  body  shall  have  the 

jurisdiction to accept, hear, determine or in any other way entertain any proceedings, 

claim, challenge or dispute by any person or body which seeks or purports to challenge 

or question validity and legality.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Any decision of any Minister to the terms and conditions of lease issued by the Director of 

Lands or any government officers and the validity of the cancellation of the lease, licences and other 

instruments.  No Court, no Commission can hear them.  Any proceedings on claim or challenge or 

dispute in existence cannot be heard, Mr. Speaker, Sir and we have to issue a certificate that this has 

been dealt with. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A  particular  case  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  Atunaisa  Tiva’s  case  from  Naboutini  for  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>mahogany plantation to be returned to him.  He won that court case but they quashed it off.   

</span></p>
<p><span>“Where any proceeding is claimed, challenged, application on dispute of any form 

whatsoever that is brought before any court, tribunal, commission or any other adjudicating 

body with regards to  any of the subject matters in subsection(1) then the presiding judicial 

officer without hearing any of it and determining the proceedings of the application shall 

immediately  transfer  the  proceeding  or  the  application  to  the  Chief  Registrar  for 

termination  of  the  proceeding  or  the  application  for  the  issuance  of  a  certificate  under 

</span><span>subsection(2).” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, the Chief Registrar has a lot of powers. Under section 2(e) for the purposes of any 

proceeding  in  a  court,  tribunal,  commission  or  any  other  person  exercising  a  judicial  function 

conclusive of the matters stated in the certificate.  Lastly, a decision of the Chief Registrar is to issue 

a certificate under subsection (2) is not subject to challenge in any court, tribunal, commission and 

any other adjudicating body. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is transferring a lot of authority to the Chief Registrar for decision or any 

</span><span>grievances  raised  by  the  landowners  with  regards  to  the  Land  Use  Decree  or  the  Land  Use 

</span><span>Development.    Other  court  legal  cases  were  struck  and  thrown  out,  the  most  unfair  and  injustice 

shown by this Government.  There is a need to have a heart to ensure that justice prevails. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I need to follow-up on the audit findings on the standard operating procedureto validate this authority and further amendments to be finalised within six months, this was on 31stOctober, 2018 and that six months fell on 30th April, 2019 and that date has passed too.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Performance bonus - partly implemented processing procedure to be finalised by 30th April, 

2019 that has passed too.  Develop a policy on mortgage land and on how to execute mortgages to 

be captured and included in the SOP by 30th April, 2019, which has passed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Clearly defined procedures, SOP for advertising vacant land to be done by 30th April, 2019, 

passed.  Formalising MOU with Investment Fiji to advertise available land to be done by 30th April, 

2019.  Issues of registered leases that has been done.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Land acquisition procedures SOP for access roads to be finalised by 30th April, 2019 that has 

passed  too.    Maintain  proper  records  for  complaints  fully  implemented,  fine.    A  need  for  a  good 

record  keeping  practices  under  National  Records  Management  Policy  -  partly  implemented  some 

issues relating to poor record keeping still persist. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Incorporate monitoring procedures in Divisions on Standard Operation Procedures template 

in  process  but  not  yet  incorporated  by  Divisions  and  they  hope to  be  incorporated  by  30th  April, 

2019.  All passed too as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Tallyman at Nawailevu, on daily basis, transits of minerals extracted, stakeholders are 

consulted  prior  to  lease  agreement,  access  roads,  et  cetera.    This  has  been  done  but  we  need  the 

information to be diverted to the landowners. 

</span></p>
<p><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we are dealing with past reports, I suggest that the Minister should  just  

come  and reply to the recommendations made and then we, Members of  Parliament can comment 

or make suggestions as a way forward.  That is the recommendation to the government to take it up 

or not but it is important that the Minister just comes and reply to the various recommendations made 

and then we can comment on that, as we go along. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is much easier and much faster Mr. Speaker Sir.  Also, the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> trust account, where 

are  the  </span><span>mataqali  </span><span>trust  account?    Which  bank  and  how  much?    Who  are  the  trustees?    Are  the 

beneficiaries  fully  informed,  if  they  have  been,  fine  if  not, they  need  full  information  as  early  as 

possible?  How can they access it?  This is for the development of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>... 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is important that the information keeps on going, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is interesting to find 

out the  following, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  in this Land  Use Division.  How much  lands are in the  Land 

Bank per year to show the trend over the years?  How many developed and how many are returned 

</span><span>after five years and not developed and why?  How many leases and returns of leases issued over the 

</span><span>years?  How much premium and total trend in the last years?  What was the amount paid and how 

much annual rent each year?   

</span></p>
<p><span>The return as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  How much arrears each year and return, and how much 

arrears to annual rent, ratio of return, it is  important.  How much budget since the inception, how 

much  expenditure  since  the  inception?    Is  the  Government  inputs  generating  fair  and  reasonable 

economic returns in outputs?  It is important to know that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This is an economic sector that we need to be focused on, on the value of inputs that we put 

into the process and the value of the outputs that we get out of it, economically?  It is important, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, to have all those information in the annual reports in the future, to improve on that.  We 

need reports to be holistic in totality and much better and easier to deal with.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On Land Claims Tribunal, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on land reform, we need to have a Land Claims 

Tribunal.  There were certain decisions made in the past, created differences and disputes and errors

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>arising from various commissions.  It needs to be rectified and put right to be fair and ensure justice 

prevails.  This is on the land reform, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also,  a  reversion  of  Government  acquired  land  to  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land  owners  and  the  current 

acquisition of Lands Act, the purpose of acquisition had been fulfilled, the land is to be reverted to 

original  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>landowners,  and  organising  leases  and  development  on  such  land.    It  is  nothing 

wrong with that, but it must be done.  Just transfer the land back to the rightful owner legally.  It is 

all here Schedules A and B had been done, I am thankful for that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But this one needs to be undertaken, just return the landownership to the rightful owners under 

the law legally to ensure justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the need to open up native lands, land reform, 

as there are idle  land here and there, but there are land  locked.  We need to unlock it, we need to 

provide roads, access for agriculture, tourism, at the same time, markets and supporting infrastructure 

for better returns on agriculture and other economic aspects, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I also agree with Honourable Nawaikula, just to have a Land Use Commission, the land use 

</span></p>
<p><span>training.  Put the land in the best possible use that is supposed to be.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Bulanauca:</span> Honourable Minister for Health, you</p>
<p><span>have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity.  I have 

been reading the report and one thing that I just want to bring to the floor is that, from time before 

immemorial, until the time that we have come through to independence until now, our </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>lands 

are based on the collective and on the communal land.    

</span></p>
<p><span>I know that most of us who are here, who are </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> will agree to that, that none of us can 

actually  say  this  particular  land  is  mine.    It  is  communal  and  collective.    That  communalism  and 

collectiveness of the land is enshrined in the Constitution, how that land is used as </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  Whether 

that land is given to iTLTB, or whether that land goes to Land Use Division, it is the collective that 

makes the decision.  It is the collective in the 60 percent that is needed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I have known of many occasions where I have heard when  </span><span>mataqalis</span><span> wanted to lease their 

land and they had challenges because there are some who are living overseas, for example, refused 

to sign and they are not able to do whether it is for iTLTB purposes or may be in this case the Land 

</span><span>Use Division purposes.  I also know that some of these lands that have been discussed are in areas 

</span><span>where it is difficult to access.  But I think the most important thing that we need to realise is that, the 

collective makes the decision.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to make the short contribution. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister:</span> I  give  the  floor  to  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Qionibaravi. You have the floor, Madam.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank you for the opportunity</p>
<p><span>to speak on this motion before the House.  

</span></p>
<p><span>First, I would like to again commend this Report by PAC and I thank my friend, Honourable 

Maharaj for his Committee’s Report. May I also request that the Chairperson, Sir, makes an effort to 

listen to what the Members of this side are saying about his Report and in particular the two reports 

that were discussed on Monday and Tuesday. If he was listening, he would have heard me state, that

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>879 

</span></p>
<p><span>I, in  fact, commended the good progress by the  various Government  ministries  in the unqualified 

audit opinions which had been issued for the accounts of 2016. I went on further to say that I looked 

forward to the day when accounts of all Ministries would all be given unqualified opinions.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my contribution this morning, I would like to briefly refer to the Deed of 

Cession Document 1874.  It contained an important vision for Fiji. I believe the vision is still valid 

today,  147  years  later.  The  chiefs  of  Fiji  in  ceding  Fiji  to  Great  Britain  147  years  ago  in  1874 

expressed the desire to secure the promotion of Christianity, civilisation and to increase  trade and 

industry. These noble aims are fundamental and I believe are descriptive of the balancing of interest 

between the various communities that have made Fiji their homes.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst a three-legged stool has largely been referred to as the first statesman 

of our nation, the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna’s famous words and belief in the proper working of the 

</span><span>lotu, matanitu</span><span> and </span><span>vanua.</span><span>  It also describes the delicate balancing between the first peoples to settle 

in Fiji. A three-legged stool is an apt description of the delicate balancing between the indigenous 

Fijians and the need for the protection of their rights and resources which have been generously given 

or shared and which have facilitated the development of this nation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, the influence of European civilisation including the Westminster System and our 

system of laws, arms of Government, the legislature, judiciary and the executive, and the institutions 

that are our check and  balance on the exercise of State powers. As well as the recognition  by the 

chiefs of the need to trade and commercial operations and finally the industriousness and innovation 

of our Indian-Fijian community and the other minority ethnic communities who have made Fiji their 

homes. Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two remaining major races are the indigenous Fijians who were 

the first peoples of this nation and our Indian brothers.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, our  chiefs  had  given  the  approval  for  the  use of their  surplus  land  to  be 

leased for the development of this nation. This is the single most important giving or the </span><span>isolisoli</span><span> by 

our chiefs through the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna and the chiefs of Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The onus is on Government and the iTLTB to ensure that the first people of this nation benefit 

from the use of their surplus land and we, the Members of this august House have an important role 

in ensuring that the rights of the first people of the land are protected and that they benefit from the 

use of their land.  For this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have an onus that native land is administered under 

effective policies and procedures in governing matters concerning native land. That is the key of my 

</span><span>contribution today, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to refer to the initial document, the Land Use Decree 2010 which is now the Land 

Use Act of 2010. I would refer the House to Section 9(1) – application to other laws – which reads 

“the  Decree  (now  Act)  has  effect  notwithstanding  any  provisions  of  the  Native  Lands  Trust  (Cap 

134); Agricultural Landlord and Tenants Act (ALTA)(Cap 270); Agricultural Landlord and Tenants 

Ordinance (ALTO) 1966; and any other law,  accordingly, to the extent that there is inconsistency 

between  this  Decree  and  the  Native  Land  Trust  Act,  Agricultural  Landlord  and  Tenants  Act, 

Agricultural Landlord and Tenants Ordinance, or any other law, this Decree prevails.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>In essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Decree, now an Act, prevails over all other Acts including 

the Native Land Trust Board.  This is the main gist of my intervention this morning. The Land Use 

Decree,  now  Act,  has  been  promulgated  and  has  been  implemented.   The  cry  from  our  side,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, to Government is to ensure that they continue to consult with the first people of the 

nation in regards to their resources.

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, having promulgated that Decree, now Act, Government should 

have taken great interest in ensuring that processes, policies, are put into place to ensure the protection 

of those that have given their land, those that have designated their land to the Land Use Bank, which 

include native land as well as Crown land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Koya, my friend, is waving the Constitution of Fiji.  We quite understand that, 

Honourable Koya.  I have just read out the Section of the Decree, now the Act, which ensures that 

this Act, the Land Use Decree 2010 (which is now an Act), supersedes any other laws, including the 

Native Lands Trust Act.  This is the point I would like to make today, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I have already expressed appreciation to my colleague, Honourable Maharaj, for their Report 

and  their  Members.    What  I  would  like  to  say  next,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  fact that there  was  a 

special  audit on the Land Reform Programme 2014 and again the  follow-up audit  in 2018 clearly 

shows  the  grave  concerns  in  the  absence  of  proper  documentations,  policies  governing  the 

administration of the Land Reform Programme, the systems and processes for Land Designation and 

Allocation, as well as the needs to record and monitor Land Bank activities.  The PAC Report in their 

introduction states: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“As a matter of good governance, all public sector entities should have systems 

and processes to consider and implement in order that the interest of those who have given 

their land are protected.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>This, as I said earlier, is the main gist of my recommendations this morning.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, having looked at the follow-up audits, I noted at Page 4, the 20 key issues which I am not 

going  to  read,  it  has  various  columns,  the  last  being  the  OAG  Assessment  of  Status.  Whilst  we 

acknowledge that h some issues identified in 2014 have been implemented, there are still remaining 

comments such as “Recommendation fully implemented however, the Ministry has planned to amend 

the SOPs and to be finalised within the next six months” so on and so forth.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It does not reflect well on how the Ministry of Land’s Land Use Department or Unit (LUD) 

has failed (now it is almost ten or eleven years) to ensure that the proper processes and policies are 

put in place.  We acknowledge that some work has been done, Honourable Minister, but more work 

still needs to be done in order to ensure that the findings of the Auditor-General initially in 2014 and 

our follow-up audit in 2018 are carried out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to now refer to the few words expressed by Honourable Minister for Commerce, 

Trade, Tourism and Transport in relying on the Native Land Trust Board.  The Native Land Trust 

Board has a duty to administer all native lands and in administering native lands, it must ensure that 

there is always surplus land for the subsistence use of the landowners.  I am questioning because in 

the report, there is concern that there is a failure to monitor the lease arrangements, et cetera.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My question is, how is the Ministry of Lands conveying information about the land that have 

been  leased  to  the  Native  Land  Trust  Board.  I  hope  that,  that  is  happening  so  that  the  NLTB  is 

continually updating their record of leases to ensure that if there are other lease applications through 

the Board, that the Board is fully aware of the land that had been leased out for those </span><span>mataqali</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- I am very much aware:</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- I am thankful to hear that Honourable Prime Minister.  I 

These are the concerns because it is the 20 findings of the Auditors in 2014 

</span></p>
<p><span>thank you for that. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="39">Page 39</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>881 

</span></p>
<p><span>have not been fully implemented to date.  It shows that there is definitely wrong in how the Land Use 

Development Unit is ensuring that it complies with the requirements, the recommendations of the 

Auditor General. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Native Land Trust Board to date, has done away with  how the members of the Board 

used to be selected.  We understand that now, all members of the Board are being appointed by the 

Honourable Minister for Fijian Affairs.  Secondly, 60 percent to acknowledge the consent has been 

given  by  the  landowners  but  the  final  say  in  the  designation  of  the  land  remains  with  the  Prime 

Minister, and we cannot appeal that provision. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Bulanauca has referred to Section 15 of this Act which is the restriction given to 

any  Court of Law, Tribunal or any other adjudicating body to hear or to accept, determine or any 

other  way  entertained  proceedings.    I  hear  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  it  is  a  contractual 

arrangement, yes, Mr. Prime Minister, but it has to be in accordance with the Constitution of Fiji.  

Anyone should be able to take a grievance to Court.  In particular, for the first people of the nation, 

it is important that we have an avenue to take our concerns to Mr. Prime Minister, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Section 15, Mr. Speaker, Sir, says, “No Court, Tribunal Commission or any adjudicating body 

shall  have  the  jurisdiction  to  accept  or  determine  any  other  challenge  from  this  Act,  Mr.  Prime 

Minister. It is important for us to have an avenue to redress the complaints that we may have under 

this Act. 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, without having to go further into details, of the 40 findings I thought I 

would mention the absence of the Performance Bond Policy.  This was a matter that was raised in 

2014 and it has remained outstanding.  This is very important that a policy be prepared and approved 

for the performance bond. 

</span></p>
<p><span>What was indicated in the Audit Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Tengy Cement, in the absence 

of a policy on the Performance Bond, was allowed to use the Performance Bond which it had paid to 

meet other payments.  Payment of royalty, that was never supposed to have happened if the policy 

on Performance Bond was put in place. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir,   I would urge the Honourable Minister for Lands to ensure 

that all outstanding Audit recommendations are complied with.  To ensure that not only the native 

land owners, the first people of the nation but the people of our nation know that the land reform 

</span><span>administration is being administered for good governance and all the policies and processes are put 

</span><span>into place. Thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Adi  Litia  Qionibaravi:</span> I  give  the  floor  to</p>
<p><span>Honourable Ratu Tevita Navurelevu, you have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  RATU  T.  NAVURELEVU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir.    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition and Honourable Members of Parliament,   I rise 

to contribute to the debate on the motion before the House this morning.  I chose to speak on this 

issue because I am one of the member of a land owning units and I am leaving in the rural areas.  We, 

landowners are very emotional when it comes to issue of the land like any of us who owns a property. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the land issue is one of the very sensitive issue as I said.  It is the mother of 

wealth  provided  by  God  inherited  by  our  fathers  and  ancestors.  It  is  our  prior  responsibility  as 

landowners to see that the land are wisely utilised and wisely used well for any purpose.  So, we have 

the responsibility to make decision right and to do anything right for the land because if decision is

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>not right, if you abuse you make me question for what we are doing about our land and the people. 

When I say the </span><span>vanua </span><span>I mean the land, the people and their faith. That means the faith in the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, 

the faith in their ancestors, the faith to their God and the faith to their land.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, this  morning, I chose to stand up and raise our concern  as  indigenous  in the</p>
<p><span>vanua</span><span>.  I will speak very briefly on a few issues.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  Land  Use  Decree  2010  is  one  of  the  many  far  reaching  Decrees 

promulgated in a discriminatory manner to indigenous Fijians.  The majority of land targeted under 

the Decree is indigenous land and the Audit Report shows the unaccountable manner in which this 

scheme is implemented with the department refusing to advertise available land to properly inform 

the Land Owning Unit and basically to be accountable and verifiable Standing Operating Procedures 

(SOP), so that everyone including the Land Owning Unit know the rules.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Decree is basically a land grab with land alienated initially for up to 99 

years as alluded to by  earlier speakers.  This Decree allows the establishment of Land Bank. The 

Director of Land has been given the powers under this Land Decree to issues leases, collect rentals 

and has been given the powers to distribute these rentals, overriding the work of the TLTB. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Decree went on to give the powers and there will be no recourse as has 

been alluded to in this House today to the Court for Land Owning Units dissatisfied with the decision 

that Court jurisdiction is excluded. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree that there are many idle lands that need to be developed back home 

in the rural areas or all over Fiji. That needs to be developed with the landowners. There are lands 

for grazing, lands for resort, land for housing and many other projects can be done in those idle lands. 

But the problem, Mr. Speaker, is that the very poor people, the vulnerable people back home do not 

have sufficient funds to develop these lands. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU T. NAVURELEVU.:</span> Listen, I will be proposing some of the ideas so that you</p>
<p><span>can initiate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, the  landowning  unit  is  to  develop these  idle  lands  but they  do  not  have 

</span><span>sufficient funds to develop those land, so in order to develop the lands to pave a way for improved 

</span><span>socio-economic  growth  with  the  focus  on  equitable  returns  to  landowners,  may  I  propose  to  the 

Government to provide funding to the landowners so that they provide their land rather than taking 

the land away and giving it to others who are already rich.    

</span></p>
<p><span>I will give an example to this proposal.  Landowning units have an idea to develop a project 

on  grazing  field  to  develop  this  idle  land  as  a  cattle  farm.    May  I  suggest  and  propose  that  the 

Government assist landowners  by providing finance and if not, provide cattle fence, livestock and 

technical support and continuous monitoring and provide markets. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  any  Government  provide  this  assistance  concerning  idle  lands,  I 

believe these idle lands will contribute  to the  improved  socio-economic growth to our nations and 

more so, equitable returns to Land Owning Units of the land. 

</span></p>

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament resumed at 3.06 p.m. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate and  I now call 

on  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence,  National  Security  and  Policing,  Rural  and  Maritime 

Development and Disaster Management.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to contribute 

as  well  to  the  motion  before  the  House.    First,  I  thank  the  Committee  and  all  those  that  have 

contributed to the motion as well but I will keep it short, Mr. Speaker, Sir, rather than going back to 

the Deed of Cession of 1874 and going back to 1936 to Geneva, let us just look at the most recent 

issues and let us address it accordingly.  We can go back to the Garden of Eden, if you want to. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  said  it  before  and  I  will  say  it  again,  let  us  not  question  about 

ownership.  Ownership is intact, it is guaranteed, and it is protected in the Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, 91 percent of the land belongs to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> but the question is, how are we benefiting from this 

resource, not only the resources owners but of course, we have to look at the national interest as well.  

That is very, very critical. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This is the State of the National and Economy Report 2008 that led to the establishment of 

firstly,  the  CBUL  Committee  that  is  now  a  Programme  under  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  of 

course, the Land Use Unit in the Ministry of Land.  Let me read it out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a few 

lines, “....access to land is a major pre-requisite for any development.  Related to this is the timeliness 

of  the  supply  of  land,  the  company  and  by  both  security  of  tenure  and  the  ability  to  use  land  for 

whatever purpose.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The NLTB’s existence is mandated by legislation to ensure the interest of the land owners are 

safeguarded.  The complexities  involved with the administration of Native  Land and the  need  for 

extensive consultations with the stakeholders if changes are to be considered have been noted and, 

of course, Government still respects that to-date, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There is no utilisation of land or land taken out of the Native Reserves, so to speak, without 

the consent of itaukei landowners, but this is the point that I want to stress out of this document, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.  To effect such a transformation, it is essential that efficient mechanisms be created to 

make leasehold land available to potential users who are willing to pay for its use at a rate set by the 

market, and not by an administered or legislated rate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know the problems in ALTA and NLTA, because it is regulated and it 

is  under  the  Act.    This  is  why  the  establishment  of  CBUL  top  up,  UCV  rate  and  CBUL  to-date 

probably $70 million has been given under this programme.  That is what the landowner wants, apart 

from utilising the land for their own benefits.  That is one, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Secondly, creating a 

market for lease land is an essential ingredient to economic development in Fiji and will also lease 

to landowners returns commensurate with the true value of their resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated just recently, that is the problem that we had under ALTA and 

NLTA  which  is  administered  by  iTLTB.    We  need  landowners  to  have  the  right  return  for  the 

resources according to the market rate and this is why the  role of iTLTB remains contrary to what 

the Honourable Nawaikula who, unfortunately and deliberately, left the House, but keeps making the 

same old rhetoric that he has been harping about all the years.  There is no usurping of the role of 

iTLTB.  As correctly  highlighted by the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and 

Transport, it is a parallel institution that gives landowners a better choice, I would say, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="43">Page 43</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>885 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me just highlight some of the issues that were raised from the other side.   The reasonable 

and fair economic returns and that is exactly why CBUL, as I have stated, and of course, that is why 

the Land Use Unit so that they can be given market rates as opposed to. Because as I have stated, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, ownership is not an issue, but how are we benefitting from it.  Let us not create fear in 

our own people.  I urge all the Honourable Members of the House, let us help in enlightening and 

empowering our people with the correct information and the knowledge so that they can make the 

right and informed choices that they have been saying, so that they can get not only from the lease 

money, but of course in the utilisation of the land as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  question  about the  provision  of  funds  as  highlighted  by  Honourable  Navurelevu,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, this is not new.  But again, let us take responsibility and be accountable and responsible 

as well when we are given public funds.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not have a good record, let us be honest with ourselves.  We do not 

have a good record.  When there was money for resettlement, it is not only about the farmers who 

have lost their leases, resettlement money was also given to landowners.  But how was that money 

utilised?  I remember, a few years back we had the alternative livelihood allocation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> benefitted from the alternative livelihood allocation, because they wanted to 

utilise the land that has been vacated.  But majority of those lands, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have been again 

given  to  others  because  we  cannot  simply  work  the  land.    Let  us  be  honest  with  ourselves,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, so it is not a question of funding. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There are some who are doing very well but then unfortunately record shows that there are 

more who do not take their responsibility seriously. But funding, if you look at the programmes in 

agriculture, we are given the funds but it is only the land now, no one is or they have moved.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Land use for agriculture to be retained, yes we agree, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but let us also accept 

the fact that we are a developing country and when we look at the history of all developing countries, 

when development continues and the economy grows, the agriculture sector is perhaps the sector that 

suffers most because of the allocation of land particularly to other sectors and that is also the case in 

Fiji. There are social needs for housing purposes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Some needs to be rezoned so that 

they can be used for other purposes while we are wary of the fact that we need to retain the good 

agricultural land but also let us understand the fact that we need to give some for other purposes.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same old issue about providing access, providing infrastructure, 

</span><span>providing market access, again, let us do our part. Development again as I have said so many times 

is partnership. Government will do its part, we also, the beneficiaries of the projects, the beneficiaries 

of the allocations, we must do our part, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I use Bua as an example because this was brought up by the Honourable Bulanauca. Just a 

few  weeks  back,  we  went  to  Yadua  Island  with  the  Agricultural  Marketing  Authority  (AMA) 

representative in Dama, Bua. This facility was just opened one or two years ago; 2018, I remember 

correctly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I had a conversation with him on the way to Yadua. What surprised me, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the facility is now closed again and one of the two AMA officials in Dama, Bua 

has been posted to Taveuni.   I asked Samu (AMA Official) and he said, “Sir, right now I go from 

one end of Bua to the other end, I was only able to collect six bags of dalo, six bags of cassava”; that 

is why it is closed again. The only thing that we are buying now is crabs and fish.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am talking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about the partnership in development. Let us not only come 

here in this House and talk but let us go back and encourage our people to take their responsibilities 

seriously and of course, do their part so that they can benefit from these developments as well.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  talking  about  parallel  institution  and  giving  landowners  a  choice 

because this is exactly what happened in Nawailevu, Bua. It was under iTLTB but the landowners 

rejected what was offered by iTLTB and they opted to go to Land Bank, so the project in Nawailevu, 

Bua was facilitated under the Land Bank, not under iTLTB and let us not forget the fact, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>While we respect the  iTLTB and the role that it  is  mandated under the  Act but let us also 

remember the fact that at one stage and this is what led to what was here in this Report, iTLTB was 

heavily politicised.  As a result, the landowners suffered, our economy suffered.  Majority of the land 

leases or some of the land leases were not renewed until 2008 when the CBUL discussions  started 

to happen and, of course, 2010 and came in to effect, but let us remember that at one stage iTLTB 

was heavily politicised. 

</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to iTLTB, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are records when deals were done, not in 

the interest of landowners but I would say, I would not  blame iTLTB, but some of the officials in 

iTLTB made deals that were contrary to the very reason behind the establishment of iTLTB.  They 

would come into meetings, siding with the investor, not with the landowner, and lots of landowners 

question us on this, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They (iTLTB) are supposed to be sitting here on our side but 

they are sitting there with the investor because they have already made a deal outside and then they 

came into the meeting.  Those are facts and that is what led to the establishment so that we can have 

a parallel institution and give landowners a choice and, of course, learning from the past, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-    I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable 

Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources.  You have the 

floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you for the opportunity.  I think 

just to start the discussion this afternoon in my presentation just to go back to what we are actually 

talking about, what this debate is supposed to be about which is the report that we have on the review 

on the follow-up of the Audit of the Management of Land Reform Programme. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of the discussions that have taken place have gone far beyond the ambit of what we are 

supposed to talk about.  I remember earlier this week, there has been another talk about wastage, the 

Honourable  Professor  Prasad  has  talked  about  wastage.    There  is  wastage  when  you  have  a 

Committee that is set up to discuss something and make recommendations and when we come and 

discuss in the House, we discover a whole plethora of other things not related to the contents of the 

Report itself.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  will  start  off  by  just  focussing  on  those  issues  and  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Standing 

Committee on Public Accounts for the work that it has done on this review on the follow-up audit of 

the management of the Land Reform Programme which was tabled in Parliament on 15th May, 2019 

(Parliament Paper No. 66 of 2019).   

</span></p>
<p><span>In an effort to address the recommendations provided by the Public Accounts Committee, the 

Ministry has undertaken various improvements to facilitate the recommendations of the Committee, 

</span></p>
<p><a name="45">Page 45</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>887 

</span></p>
<p><span>therefore, the Ministry, in its presentation to the Public Accounts Committee in 2018 has managed 

to provide responses and issues of mitigation, resolved and actioned. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Again today, some of those issues that were discussed in 2018 and previous years, continue 

to be brought up in this particular discussion, even though they have already been addressed at that 

point in time, and already addressed to some degree by the former Minister for Lands, who made a 

Ministerial Statement on this matter in 2019.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, in addition to these issues are the five recommendations provided by the Committee 

and I will, today, inform this august House of the update of the recommendations made and what the 

Ministry has implemented and actioned. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On  the  first  one  -  policies  governing  the    administration  of  Land  Reform,  where  the 

Committee  notes  the  recommendation  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  and  the  timeframe 

provided by the Ministry of Lands to OAG that policies shall be developed in 6-months’ time, the 

time for the follow-up audit (6-months timeframe) which she says expires on 30th April, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The response is that, the Ministry can confirm that the recommendations for the formulation 

of a policy has been incorporated into the Land Use Division SOP and the relevant SOP captures the 

procedures for the transfer of freehold buy-back lands - so that has been addressed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The second recommendation  in relation to systems and processes  for land designation and 

allocation where the Public Accounts Committee noted the Ministry’s Land Use Division’s progress 

on  its  monitoring  in  conducting  its  outreach  programme,  and  further  recommended  that the  LUD 

strengthen its evaluation on the outreach programme. I can advise the House that the recommendation 

by  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  continues  to  be  implemented  and  enhanced  further  since  the 

inception of the Land Use Division.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The outreach programmes are planned according to the budgetary allocations with specific 

areas  identified  under  the  viable  land  parcels  that  are  collated.    The  targeted  output  for  all 

consultations and awareness within the last financial year was achieved and the Division has achieved 

its quarterly targets this financial year. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The next recommendation from the Public Accounts Committee was recommending that the 

Ministry should conduct appropriate land studies on land deposited under the Land Bank, to ensure 

</span><span>that there can be investment carried out on that land that have fair economic return to the landowners. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  has  implemented  the  strategy  since  its  inception  and  refined  it  further  and 

amended the way that it does this in 2017.  Appropriate land parcel feasibility studies and viability 

components  have  always  been  part  of  the  Land  Use  Division’s  responsibilities  and  measurable 

outputs in the Ministry’s Annual Costed Operational Plan as well as the Divisional business plan. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The physical inspections of land form, natural and man-made, including land use maps and 

soil types are being studied.  These are factors that contribute to the viability of the land for its highest 

and best use and also the determination of the fair economic return to the landowners.  Those sorts 

of assessments and studies are being made by the Land Use Division of the Ministry to make sure 

that we can identify investors for each type of land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  next  recommendation  was  in  relation  to  recording  and  monitoring  of  Land  Bank 

activities.  The Committee noted that the work is in progress for the development of the database. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="46">Page 46</a></p>
<p><span>888 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Further to that, the Committee had recommended that this process should be expedited and once fully 

operational, the information to be accessible to other relevant agencies dealing with lands. 

</span></p>
<p><span>You can confirm the implementation of the Land Bank database which is in operation.  All 

designated native land parcel databases are shared with iTLTB.  I think that issue was brought up in 

the House with updates on new deposits are carried out on a quarterly basis, so the information is 

shared on a quarterly basis. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Land parcel details and locations are also plotted and accessible through Vanua Geographic 

</span></p>
<p><span>Information System (GIS), so there is visual representation of what is happening. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  last  recommendation  was  where  the  Committee  recommended  that  the  Land  Use 

Division should develop a monitoring procedure which should be incorporated into the Division’s 

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  The procedure should clearly outline areas, activities to be 

monitored.  Responsibilities for monitoring is suitable timelines for carrying out the monitoring work.  

The Ministry confirms the implementation of the monitoring of processes and procedures have been 

done and they are now captured in our SOPs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>These are also reflected in the Ministry’s cost of operational plan which is done on an annual 

basis  and  the  Land  Use  Division’s  business  plan  that  SOP  clearly  outlines  the  responsibilities, 

reporting mechanisms and timelines to be adopted within the Division. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As a result of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there are about 20 recommendations that were 

brought up about the Land Use Division and with the meeting of these last five recommendations, 

we can  say that those 20 recommendations have been addressed  by the Land Use Division of the 

Ministry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Just to go back to some of the issues that have been highlighted in the House: I will not go 

back and talk about some of the issues that other Ministers have talked about, addressing some of the 

statements that have been made in this House.  I think they have been adequately addressed.  Some 

statements that were made I would like to talk very briefly about. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Radrodro  made  a  statement.    He  started  off  his  statement  with  the  Ratu 

Sukuna vision of making available land that you cannot use.  They think, if you think about it, all the 

Land Use Bank does, it just deals further on that vision of this great Statesman of ours - Ratu Sukuna.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The land that is available and not being used, the Land Bank is just another way of making 

that available.  It just complements the activities that are done by iTLTB.  Does not compete with it, 

does not usurp it but it complements that activity.  It is another way of getting the same thing done. 

</span></p>
<p><span>When you are in a market with two or three players doing the same sort of thing, there is the 

likelihood to be more returns  for the people who are being serviced when you have more than one 

party engaged in that exercise.  That is what the Land Bank does.  As I think about it, that vision of 

Ratu Sukuna is a great vision; Land Use Bank is another way of making that vision a reality.  That is 

what it does. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Aseri Radrodro also talked about issues in relation to what the Ministry is doing 

about the leasing of freehold buy back and the defaulting of the Land Owning Unit. As we know, 

there are about more than 20 plots of land that were bought back by Government and given to the 

landowners so that they can pay it back.  

</span></p>
<p><a name="47">Page 47</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>889 

</span></p>
<p><span>Over the years, a lot of them have not been able to do this well.  There have just been a few 

that  have  been  able  to  pay  that  money  back.    But  Government  goes  out  of  its  way  to  help  those 

landowners pay back the debts that they have.  How does it do that? In some cases, Government takes 

land, puts it into the Land Bank again and then leases that land out.  As people pay the leases for that 

land, the lease amount collected is used to pay back the debt owed by the Land Owing Unit and all 

the  costs  associated  with  leasing  this  land  out  is  not  paid  by  the  Land  Owning  Unit,  it  is  met  by 

Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So in this way Government  is actively working to make sure that that Freehold Buy-Back 

Scheme actually works even though the landowners who want the land back had made an agreement 

to pay for the money back to Government because the Land Bank actually helps them to pay back.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If, for instance, the agreement to lease the land is over 30 years and within 15 years they have 

collected enough money to pay back the debt, the excess amount, the difference between the money 

that  is  collected  to  pay  back  the  debt  and  the  amount  collected  by  Government  is  not  kept  by 

Government but paid to the Land Owing Unit, even though Government has paid for all the expenses 

for leasing out that land. So the Land Bank goes out of its way to help the landowners who wanted 

to buy back the freehold land. They are not able to pay it so we go out of our way to do it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There is nothing here about land grab. Who is grabbing the land? The concern is always if 

the control is always with the landowners themselves.  There are a number of other things that are 

here but I thought I should just identify some of the benefits that we have as the result of the Land 

Bank.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of these land parcels would never have been able to activate this land because it would 

not have generated the revenue if it had not gone to the Land Bank.  Since the Land Bank has been 

in place, there have been more than 122 land parcels designated with the total area of 10,749.3107 

hectares.  Some of this land has been designated, not leased out so after five years if the landowners 

want, they can take it back and there have been three parcels of land where the land has been reverted 

back because that is the choice that they have and if they can do that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The number of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land parcels designated in a survey, a 102 designated out of which 91 

land parcels have been surveyed. So once the land parcels come in, this is the benefit that they get. 

The land gets surveyed, they do not have to pay for that survey.  Even if no investor comes in and 

takes out that land, the land is already surveyed so if it goes back, the landowners will get the piece 

</span><span>of land for which they already have a survey done.  That is the benefit that they have, Mr. Speaker, 

</span><span>Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The total proceeds collected, the Land Use Division has derived a total amount of $12.891 

million in at least proceeds from the 91 leases, $11.1 million of this goes to owners of the  </span><span>Ttaukei</span><span>

land, $11.1 million of money that would not have been forthcoming if it had not gone to the Land 

Bank.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For the 2020 to 2021 Financial Year, the Division has so far collected about $666,000 for the 

State and more than $1 million revenue for the landowners.  Once again, this is money that is going 

directly into the pockets of the landowners.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Remember that the money that is collected by the Land Bank, Government does not take its 

poundage.  All the money that is paid, all the money that is due for that land goes directly into the 

pockets of landowners. There is nothing that is coming back so all the administrative costs, all the 

</span></p>

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>costs that come up in managing all of these assets is met by Government.  Government is actually 

assisting to put money into the hands of the landowners.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There is no competition in all of these things.  It is all for the benefit of the people, over and 

above that some of the land that came into the Land Bank was also land that was used then for the 

Nawailevu Bauxite. The Bauxite royalty of more than $1 million also went to the landowners there.  

So they are not only getting the money out of the leases for the land that is involved but also, they 

are getting direct benefit for themselves on a daily basis, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, other speakers will speak but to my mind I mean the Honourable 

Niko Nawaikula accused me of not being an indigenous person because I have my viewpoint of this.  

</span></p>
<p><span>My viewpoint is this, you can choose to look at this as something that is anti- iTaukei, I do 

not because we are talking about pieces of land here.  There was another statement that was made by 

the Honourable Nawaikula, at the very end of his statement where he quoted Ratu Kamisese Mara 

saying, “We should lease small portions of land at high return”. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I mean that is a great philosophy to do. Do not lease large pieces of land, lease small pieces 

of land where you can get high value investment, for instance, like hotels.  But not all landowners in 

Fiji have land in places where people want to build a hotel.  So, what about them?  Should we only 

just  lease out land where  you can get high  value investment?  How about those that have  land  in 

Navosa and in the Highlands up there? What do we do about them? Do we just leave them to tootle 

away with their fingernails or bite their fingernails, we do not do that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Land Bank offers them an opportunity. You give up the land and the Ministry goes out, 

surveys it and tries to get investors to come and invest on that land.  So even those people with that 

kind of land have the opportunity to get something for them for the people that are living today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I will rest my presentation there. I thank again the Committee for the 

work that  it  has  done,  and  I  think  we  should  not  be  seeing  the  Land  Use  Unit  as  something  that 

competes or usurps iTLTB.  It complements it and the returns that people get are far better than what 

they get from iTLTB.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Then when you have something in the Land Use Unit, things are offered at market value.  The 

leases make up market value.  Market value has no poundage, no costs so the benefits of that goes 

</span><span>directly back to the people.  Just look at it in terms of what benefits it gives to people and remember 

</span><span>also that all iTaukei land that is taken into the Land Bank, you have to get consent of 60 percent of 

the landowners.  If they say “No”, it is no.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Over and above that when all the processes have been done, it goes to the Honourable Prime 

Minister, who checks and verifies.  He will make sure because no one on this side of the House wants 

to push down the iTaukei landowners. We want to bring them up, that is why you put this Land Use 

Bank to be there for their benefits.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Everything that we do, this Government is for the benefit of the iTaukei landowners and for 

</span></p>
<p><span>the benefit of all the citizens of this country.  </span><span>Vinaka Vakalevu,</span><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>891 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will be very brief in my contribution 

on  the  motion  and  the  debate  this  afternoon  on  the  Report  of  Management  of  the  Land  Reform 

Programme.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  and  the  Honourable  Members  for this 

Report as they elaborated on important issues, one of which is the Land Buy-Back Scheme which 

has just been alluded to by the Honourable Minister.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Buy-Back  Scheme,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  established  in  1993  to  assist  the  ordinary 

iTaukei landowners who had little or no arable land.  All they need is freehold land for their socio-

economic wellbeing. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Government  then  purchased  about  26  freehold  lands,  the  total  of  about  $4</p>
<p><span>million and the acreage is about 8,500 at the market price, determined by registered valuers.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The iTaukei landowners, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would pay back the money owed within 30 years.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, under this Scheme, the landowner found it difficult in repayment as there was 

reluctancy but it interests them in assisting them payback what they owed. This has brought misery 

to landowners as it being vulnerable and unable to pay back what they owed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Although Government is helping them as alluded to by the Honourable Minister Usamate, 

through other means like leasing the lands, the question of ownership is in question.  They would be 

held to ransom all the time.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Another important issue to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the absence of a standard policy for the 

Ministry as far as existing landowners are concerned.  The Standing Committee raised the importance 

of  a  Ministry  knowing  what  to  do.   The  Ministry  I  am  sure  should  note  and  develop  appropriate 

arrangements for administering State freehold land to assist them in carrying out their functions. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommended that the Ministry should finalise 

a policy that will incorporate the processes of transferring freehold buy back land to landowners and 

if Government has not done this, then they have to do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government must help these landowners…. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- All right, I am reminding you again: The Government must help 

these landowning units pay back the land and identify ways to acquire them, that might be just lip-

service, I am stressing the point so that they can do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject)

<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- The Government must help these landowning units pay for their 

lands and then identify ways to acquire them and they have failed miserably in that regard if they 

have not done so:</span></p>

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  call  upon  Government  and  inform  this  House  as  to  the  status  of  this 

landowning units which I will highlight as far as the Land Buy-Back Scheme is concerned, and to 

help them get the land through some kind of concessions. These are Munia Island in Lau, Matakunea 

in  Cakaudrove,  Korodogo  in  Macuata,  Mua  State  in  Cakaudrove,  Namaqumaqua  in  Serua, 

Kovunikavika  in  Tailevu,  Vakabalea  in  Serua,  Nasoqo  in  Naitasiri,  Naisaudoga  and  Nukuloa  in 

Cakaudrove, Kobuka in Naitasiri, Tova in Ra, Matavatucou in Tailevu, Dedega in Tailevu, Vunivesi 

in Tailevu, Matasawalevu in Macuata, Naveria in Cakaudrove, Matakalulu in Naitasiri, Waiduru in 

Nabu, Naitasiri, Raiwaqa in Serua, Monanuku in Tailevu, Naboro in Rewa, Nausori in Tailevu. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the  landowning units that are still struggling to pay 

</span></p>
<p><span>back, then the onus lies on the Government to assist them.  I thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Leawere:</span> I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Viliame Gavoka.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As we all know, the Land Use Decree 

2011  caused  huge  anxiety  within  the  landowners  of  this  country  and  they  were  expecting  as  they 

believe in democracy and parliamentary democracy that this Decree would be brought to Parliament 

on the return of Parliamentary democracy to be properly debated but we know what happened.  All 

the Decrees that were manufactured during the time of the regime became laws in this country.  So, 

please, do not wave the Constitution at us because we know our laws, we know they are confused, 

we know our rights and we were denied our rights to debate the Decrees that were passed during the 

regime. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this Land Use Unit, I have to state here today that SODELPA will get rid</p>
<p><span>of it.  We will abolish this law, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-    They  keep  waving  the  Constitution  at  us  saying  that our  land  is 

protected  but  then  they  passed  a  law  that  says  that  that  law  cannot  be  challenged.    Who  are  you 

kidding  here?    You  are  saying  your  land  is  protected  but  we  are  going  to  enact that  law  that  you 

cannot challenge.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have challenged NLTB and we won.  Our people took NLTB to Court 

and they won, and here you are telling them, “We are going to form something parallel to NLTB but 

you cannot sue it”, and you say “Your land is protected under this Constitution”.  So, please, do not 

wave that at us.  We know better, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have  here  is dereliction of duty on the 

parts of FijiFirst when it comes to land matters. You know that land is a very delicate issue, you know 

that but you were drunk with power during the regime, during that first Term of Parliament and you 

thought you will get away with whatever you do.  Let me tell you this, people are now awake to this 

and your time in Government is coming to an end very soon.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were going to abolish this, but at least they soon have had the duty of 

care to look after what they had enacted.  Here, we have the Committee saying “There was lack of

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>process, there was lack of policy and procedures on how a Unit would operate”.  Already, they caused 

consternation within the community and then they failed to put in place proper structures.  How can 

you say you are working for the good of the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners when there were no policies and 

procedures on how to operate the Land Unit?  How can you say that?  It was dereliction of duty, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, on a breathtaking scale.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  you have  made  light of the reference to the Deed of Cession to 1936, et 

cetera, but those with the spirit with which the land was made available in this country to develop 

this country, and it is unfortunate that the Honourable Minister here only goes back to 2008.  That is 

the  tragedy  with  FijiFirst.    Their  history  goes  back  to  December,  2006,  when  they  overthrew  a 

properly  and  legitimately  elected  Government.      Their  history  does  not  go  further  than  that,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.  Then the NLTB and the land situation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been there with goodwill 

over the generations, and it is very sad that we have a Government who does not care, who does not 

respect, who does not try and protect the spirit of Goodwill that enabled us to use the land and develop 

Fiji to what we enjoy today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  team  is  sad,  all  the  natives  are  sad,  and  I  just  want  to  say  again  to 

FijiFirst, “Stop preaching, start practicing.”  You cannot be preaching while we have this Report that 

highlights massive shortfall in the way you manage the Land Use Decree, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is 

the word from us.  The people are saying you are wonderful preachers but you do not practice.  We 

are getting a little tired of all the preaching.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Land Use Decree is an aberration in Fiji, it should not have been brought 

into existence that iTLTB can easily accommodate that.  In actual fact, it has a Unit, a section in there 

that already does the work.  So why create something else to undermine the work of iTLTB?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a huge lack of faith in the way FijiFirst manages land.  There is a 

credibility factor here, people do not believe you, they do not agree with you and they lack faith in 

how you are doing things.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish in the short time that they are in power, which is about how many 

months now, at least do what is needful to protect the land that is in your care right now.  Very soon, 

we are going to abolish this Act and take away the sense of anxiety that you have  created for the 

landowners in this country.  It is time to repent to the people.   

</span></p>
<p><span>You have caused so much anxiety, it is time to change but I know, I might as well be talking 

</span><span>to a wall because these people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not believe in dialogue as it is all one way, their 

way and nothing else, but it will soon come to an end.  Land is a very delicate matter and I would 

urge you to heed what I am saying today.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Gavoka. Your name is not on my list:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, you have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to first thank the Standing 

Committee on Public Accounts and, of course, the OAG as well for the great work they have put in, 

in continuing to keep Government in check.  

</span></p>
<p><span>They have said it and we all agree - land is a delicate matter.  It can serve to create emotions 

of  division,  it  can  also  serve  to  create  emotions  of  unity  and  that  really  depends  on  the  ideals, 

principles we have and how we impart what we feel about land to the Fijian people.

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land is something that is sacred to every </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>person.  It is sacred to 

me and to every </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>in this House.  It does not matter which side of the House we sit on and it is 

part of  our  common  heritage,  it  is  part  of  our  common  identity  as  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>people  and  as  </span><span>iTaukei 

</span><span>people, our forefathers have agreed and pledged to share this natural resource with every other Fijian 

with a common quest to develop as a nation together, so let us not forget that the  </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land that 

matters so much to us </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people, also forms the basis of livelihoods for every other Fijian that 

has called Fiji “home”.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The platform for that legal sharing of this very invaluable resource is a lease up to a term of 

99 years with conditions set by the lessor.  For a long time that lessor was the iTaukei Land Trust 

Board alone.  

</span></p>
<p><span>With the Land Use Act 2010, another lessor has been created, the Director of Lands not to 

take away any powers from iTaukei Land Trust Board but to complement the work of the Board in 

relation to </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land. The aim being, Mr. Speaker, to utilise unused </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land which the owners 

wish to see being put to good use for their benefit and for the benefit of every Fijian.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The value that </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land has on the very fabric of our nation can be seen first and foremost 

in our Constitution, and I will keep waving this Constitution because this is the supreme law of our 

land.  How can we not speak about it when we speak about such a delicate issue as land  - </span><span>iTaukei 

</span><span>land?  And  apart  from  the  preamble  of  the  Constitution  which  the  Honourable  Minister  Koya  has 

referred  to,  Section  28  of  the  Constitution  provides  as  follows,  and  I  would  like  to  read  it,  Mr. 

Speaker:   

</span></p>
<p><span>“The ownership of all </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land shall remain with the customary owners of that 

land and </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land shall not be permanently alienated, whether by sale, grant, transfer 

or exchange, except to the State in accordance with Section 27.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Section 27 is a compulsory acquisition provision.  It has always existed, it is that provision 

</span></p>
<p><span>that allows Government to use </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land for a public purpose.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.:</span> Section 28(2), Mr. Speaker:</p>
<p><span>“Any  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>land  acquired  by  the  State  for  a  public  purpose  after  the 

</span><span>commencement of the Constitution under Section 27 or under any written law shall revert 

to the customary owners if the land is no longer required by the State.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>That, Honourable Speaker, is a new provision, it has never been in the Constitution before.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The return of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land to </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners after use by the State for a public purpose 

only came through this Constitution 2013.  Prior to that it was a discretionary matter for the Minister, 

and now the Minister does not have a say in it.  It must be returned if the Government no longer uses 

it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is this, prior to the Land Use Act 2010, all control of </span><span>iTaukei 

</span></p>
<p><span>land was vested with the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Land Trust Board …

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- Like </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>Land Trust Board, Government wants </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land 

to be used for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the landowner where it is being leased or indeed 

to encourage landowners to develop iTaukei land.  One just needs to look to the allocation of budget 

for  the  development  of  iTaukei  land  under  Head  50  to  see  Government’s  commitment  to  the 

empowerment of iTaukei landowner. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that a total of three projects have been completed under that, with six or seven 

</span></p>
<p><span>other projects on track as we speak.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.:</span> Tell them!</p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- Is that a  Government that does not care about iTaukei interest 

and iTaukei land in this country?  Why would Government spend millions to do that if it did not care 

about empowering the iTaukei? 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been here since 2014 and I have heard the lies and fear mongering 

tactics of Members of the Opposition using iTaukei land as a tool to bring division amongst Fijians.  

In fact, we heard it earlier today from Honourable Nawaikula using land and issues relating to land 

to divide Members of this House and by extension Fijians in this country.  And he had the audacity 

to say that we do not know where we come  from on this side of the House, that we do not know 

ourselves.  How dare he! 

</span></p>
<p><span>Please, I have a request to the Honourable Members of the Opposition, do not think that you, 

your voices are the only voices that carry the dreams, aspirations and the voices of the iTaukei people 

in this country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  a  Government,  we  carry  the  voices  of  every  iTaukei  and  every  Fijians  in  this  country.  

That  is  the  difference!    When  they  preach,  they  preach  about  iTaukei  aspirations  alone.    As  a 

Government, we preach about the aspiration of every Fijian in this country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The thing is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Land Use Act 2010, iTaukei landowners were given 

a choice that I do not get to hear about from the other side.  The Land Use Act opened up another 

avenue  for  leasing  of  land,  the  option  under  the  Land  Use  Act  has  a  number  of  benefits  for  the 

</span><span>landowner that may not necessarily be available for land under the iTaukei Land Trust Board, as we 

</span><span>have heard from the Minister for Lands. 

</span></p>
<p><span>And yet, we heard today in this House, this law being labelled as a “racist law”.  Racist, why? 

Because  it is  iTaukei people  have benefitted $11 million out of  it?  Because we  have empowered 

iTaukei  landowners  to  develop  their  land  for  the  betterment  of  themselves  and  their  future 

generations? 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we look at the Land Use Act that is under our consideration today, I would 

like to point to a few features of it that protects the landowner and we have heard about the 60 percent 

consent before it can be deposited. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Before the Honourable Prime Minister can designate land, there must be 60 percent consent 

by  the  landowning  unit.   The  Honourable  Prime  Minister  has  absolutely  no  power to  designate  it 

without the consent of the landowners, but apart from that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key features 

</span></p>
<p><a name="54">Page 54</a></p>
<p><span>896 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>of this law that does not exist at the moment in relation to the iTLTB Act and I would like to mention 

a few. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The establishment of a Trust for an on behalf of the landowners, that is mandated under the 

Regulations of the Land Use Act.  They must form a Trust.  That Trust then looks at the administration 

of  the  land  that  has  been  deposited  with  the  Land  Bank.    It  ensures  that  there  is  accountability, 

transparency and that every landowning unit member is aware of what is happening in relation to the 

land  and  in  fostering  the  principles  of  accountability,  transparency  and  good  governance  in  the 

administration of trust monies, Regulation 5 requires that the Office of the Auditor General audit the 

annual financial statement of the accounts of the landowning unit on an annual basis.  

</span></p>
<p><span>And as Members of Parliament, we would all love to see this, one day that these accounts will 

come here to the House, so that we can look at it and to actually having a law, the mandate that the 

Auditor-General look into the money that Trusts get in relation to iTaukei land. That is a huge step 

for us, as a people, to ensure that landowning units are empowered to be able to look at the financial 

interests of their communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the  regulations  require  that  an  Annual  General  meeting  be  held  prior to  31st 

January  each  year  for  the  election  of  new  trustees  and  for  the  endorsement  of  Audited  Annual 

Accounts.  And these requirements, Mr. Speaker, will ensure that each landowner has a say in the 

management of the collective asset and that those who have been entrusted with this management 

role  are  discharging  their  roles  in  accordance  with  proper  accounting  standards  and  this  is 

empowering. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Further, Regulation 6 empowers the landowners to ask for their land back after it has been 

deposited.  They  can  ask  for  it  back  after  five  years,  if  it  has  not  been  leased.  So,  that  option  is 

available as well to landowners who change their minds after five years and their land has not been 

leased as yet.  But we do not get to hear about all this, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just say a few words in relation to the report 

itself. It is encouraging, it is very encouraging to see the Auditor-General thoroughly looking into the 

work of the Land Use Unit and the Standing Committee as well, making recommendations on how 

they can make their processes and procedures more accountable and transparent.  

</span></p>
<p><span>You hear the differences in the way we look at this, Mr. Speaker. When they see the gaps in 

</span><span>processes  and  procedures,  they  use  that  to  create  fear  amongst  landowners.  We  see  it  as  an 

</span><span>opportunity to make our processes and procedures better and then we need the role of the Auditor-

General to point to this, to keep Government in check and to make sure that we cover those gaps.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is even more encouraging to see that the Land Use Unit under the Honourable Minister for 

Lands  have taken those recommendations to heart and have remedied and continue to remedy the 

gaps found by the Auditor-General.  It is encouraging to me because I believe that if the Land Use 

Unit can measure up to the third party objective recommendations of the Auditor-General and in turn 

the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts as appropriate that we may go a long way 

in alleviating the fears being fuelled by unwarranted statements and comments by some Members of 

this House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I sincerely  hope that come  next  year before election, we will stop seeing these DVDs and 

sermons of lies, fear mongering, using the same statements over and over to create division and to 

get votes for the General Election.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>897 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for her statement:</span> I now give the floor to</p>
<p><span>the Honourable Prime Minister.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.:</span> Thank  you, Mr. Speaker.   I rise to speak  in support of the</p>
<p><span>motion by the Honourable Maharaj. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, seriously, we are getting tired of old charade from the other side of the House.</p>
<p><span>It is starting to bore us, it is getting really boring.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Leader of the SODELPA keeps talking about since 2014 how they are going 

to remove this Government.  It is now 2021 and just about every day of the week, he talks about 

removal of this Government but I do not know which party  is going to remove this Government, 

SODELPA 1, SODELPA 2 or SODELPA 3. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- But they are all old charade. Honourable Nawaikula and his 

ILO 169.  How many times I am going to tell him that ILO 169 is nothing to do with the people of 

Fiji, he does not seem to know that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But if there is anything that has come up, it is about Honourable Qereqeretabua who asked 

the Honourable Minister  yesterday whether he  is going to deny about body parts being put  out in 

Naboro Landfill.  If she has any photo or any proof, bring it to the House. That is the problem with 

getting her facts from the social pages.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Tabuya, yesterday said how a family was so distraught that their house  caught 

fire and they have to pay the National Fire Authority (NFA) for putting out the fire. What a ridiculous 

statement to make in this House.  She should be investigated for this statement, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, as I said, I rise to speak in support of the motion  by Honourable Maharaj.  I 

would like to first acknowledge the work of the Standing Committee in bringing this report back to 

Parliament for discussion.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  productive  utilisation  of  land,  as  you  have  heard  from  this  side  of  the  House,  is  an 

</span><span>important  priority  for  any  country.  Fiji  has  always  placed  great  emphasis  on  better  utilisation  of 

natural resources while ensuring a sustainable future for Fijians.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Under  this  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  come  far  in  appropriately  managing  the 

development of  land.  Fiji’s  most comprehensive long term strategy  in the National Development 

Plan  clearly  places  priority  on  reforms  that  improve  access  to  land.  This  include  the  review  of 

administrative processes, digitisation of land records and capacity building to improve the efficiency 

and the effectiveness of land use administration. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Land Reform Programme discussed today, as you have heard, Mr. Speaker, was initiated 

in 2010 and has since evolved.  We now have more Fijians benefiting from investing in their land 

than ever before.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a few of the information put out today.  I wish to clarify 

some  issues  with  respect to the  Land  Use  Act  of  2010.  I  want to  say  here,  Mr.  Speaker, that the

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Opposition misleads and misinform Parliament with their misinterpretation and selective preferences 

to the Land Use Act, 2010.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Opposition purports to argue that the Honourable Prime Minister has the complete power 

to  make  decisions  on  the  utilisation  of  iTaukei  land,  without  consultation  with  the  landowners.  

However, they failed to tell us that the Act prescribes the minimum of 60 percent of the members of 

the  Land  Owning  Unit  must  provide  their  consent  before  any  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land  can  be  designated  for 

leases under the Act, as you have heard from the previous speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>No land can be designated by the Prime Minister unless and until 60 percent of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>

landowning unit provides their consent.  Moreover, Section 5 of the Act, states that the ownership of 

an  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land  designated  under  the  Act  shall  always  remain  with  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  landowners.  

Furthermore,  Section  11,  Mr.  Speaker,  of  the  Act  explicitly  provides  that  any  leases  issued  over 

</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land must have all times take into consideration the best interest of the landowners.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the Act establishes the Land Bank from the benefit  for all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners 

and takes  into consideration the  best  interest of the  landowners and the overall  well  being  of the 

economy. The template form of lease issued over any designated land is expressly provided in the 

Act. Any person reading the terms and conditions of the leases will know that the best interest of the 

</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners are taken into consideration at all times. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The landowners have a say, not just in the fair market rent of the land but also in the terms 

and conditions under which the lease is to be issued including the duration of the lease, the use to 

which the land will be put and the person/company to whom the lease will be issued to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The protections and safeguards provided in the Act are much more, what is provided to the 

</span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  landowners  under  the  </span><span>iTtaukei</span><span>  Land  Trust  Board  laws  and  policies.    For this  reason,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, it is not surprising that so many </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners have in the past, under the former 

SDL Government, been frustrated with the management of their land.  This was when leases were 

issued without proper or any consent and landowners had been ignored on the assessment of rent and 

the use to which the land has been put.  This had irritated many landowners and other stakeholders, 

hence the Land Use Act.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Act provides optimum ability to address these issues first hand, and for these reasons, so 

many  landowning units have  freely designated or are considering designating their  land under the 

</span><span>Act.  These landowning units are now enjoying full market rents for the lease of their land and every 

</span><span>single cent collected in rent is paid to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowning unit. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Opposition obviously completely  ignores the fact that under the Act  each  landowning 

unit elects up to five trustees and also requires the preparation of a deed of trust outlining their duties 

and functions.  The Act requires the Land Department to undertake a professional survey of the land, 

acting at all times in the best interest of the</span><span> iTaukei</span><span> landowners. The Act also sets out clear procedures 

for the assessment of fair market rent which is only paid to the landowners. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Act the landowning units have the full right to challenge 

compliance or non-compliance of any of these conditions issued under the Act. Section 15 does not 

take away that right in anyway.   

</span></p>

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>899 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINAMARAMA.- However, the effect of section 15 is to protect the interest of 

the majority of the members of the landowning unit who have chosen to put their land in  the Land 

Bank.  I want that to be understood by the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, especially the lawyers on the 

other side.  By excluding the jurisdiction of the courts from challenging the designation of land, the 

Act protects the majority; 60 percent of the voice of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners and the trustees of the 

</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Landowning Unit who have the right to be heard on matters such as the designation of the 

land or the fair market rent payable on their land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Act prevents any disgruntled or politically motivated individual in bringing court cases 

</span></p>
<p><span>against decisions made by the majority of the members of the landowning unit … 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.:</span> … and thereby frustrating the majority of the landowners of</p>
<p><span>the full enjoyment of the benefits from the lease of their land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  rather  unfortunate  that  the  Opposition  continues  to  misinform  and 

mislead Parliament.  The plan and simple fact is the Land Use Act empowers the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners 

to better participate in the decision making process of how their land is utilised for their benefit as 

well as future generations and the Fijian economy. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we saw today the constant bellowing 

from Honourable Nawaikula about ILO Convention 169.  I have already addressed this Parliament 

on a number of occasions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about this ILO Convention and since he has forgotten it, 

it  is worth reminding the Honourable Member on why he  is completely  missing the point on ILO 

Convention 169. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji ratified the ILO Convention 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal People in March 

1998.  We are one of only 23 countries in the world that have ratified this Convention that was done 

by his other friend, he knows.  Countries like Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and United States 

of America have yet to ratify the Convention. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.:</span> Listen!</p>
<p><span>Countries like Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and United States of America have yet 

to ratify the Convention, including the Pacific States have yet to ratify this Convention.  We are one 

of only 23 countries  in the world that have ratified this Convention, not those big  nations.  In  the 

course of the last few years, we have in many occasions addressed the issue of indigenous rights in 

Fiji and the safeguards provided for under the Fijian Constitution … 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … and the laws of Fiji to ensure that the rights of indigenous 

people namely, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people are promoted, protected and preserved.  As you have heard, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, from Honourable Faiyaz Koya that the Preamble of the Convention notes that in many 

parts of the world, indigenous people are unable to enjoy the fundamental human right to the same 

degree as the rest of the population of the State within which they live and that their laws, values,

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>customs  and  perspectives  have  often  been  eroded,  and  thus  the  Convention  calls  attention  to  the 

distinctive  contribution  that  the  indigenous  and  tribal  people  to  the  cultural  diversity,  social  and 

ecological  harmony  of  human  kind  and  to  international  corporation  and    understanding.    That  is 

Convention 169, Mr, Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  histories  of  indigenous  people  have  been  marked  by  discrimination,  marginalisation, 

ethnocide or even genocide and unfortunately,  violations of their  fundamental rights still occur  in 

many  countries.    Hence,  Convention  169,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reaffirms  that  indigenous  and  tribal 

people are entitled to the same human rights and fundamental freedoms as all other human beings. 

At  the  same  time,  this  also  implies  that  indigenous  customs  cannot  be  justified,  if  these  are  in 

violation  of  universal  human  rights.    This  is,  for  example,  important  in  cases  where  indigenous 

women with reference to customs or traditions are deprived of fundamental rights such as access to 

education or property. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  indigenous  people’s  rights  are not  special  rights,  but  are  articulations  of 

universal human rights as they apply to indigenous people.  For example, indigenous children have 

the same right to education as all other children, but their distinct languages, histories, knowledge, 

values and aspirations should be reflected in educational programmes and services.  The Convention 

does  provide  for  special  measures  to  ensure  effective  equality  between  indigenous  people  and  all 

other sectors of a given society.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, the requirement for special measures does not mean that the Convention requires 

that indigenous people be given special privilege </span><span>vis-a-vis</span><span> the rest of the population, unlike in other 

countries such as Australia and the United States of America, I would like the other side to listen to 

this, where we have seen various violations of rights against indigenous people, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are and 

have always been a dominant population, and is not even in any danger of losing their way of life.  .   

</span></p>
<p><span>  Thus, when we talk about the rights of the indigenous in Fiji’s context, we are not speaking 

of a marginalised minority.  We are talking about majority community with a proud and active culture 

and a history of strong representation in Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> culture is vibrant and thriving.  The Opposition’s continued attempts in trying to 

portray  the  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>people  as  needing  Government  protection  is  insulting  and  demeaning  to  the 

majority of the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  It is absurd and  makes  no sense to think that a population who  is  in the 

majority is in danger of losing their cultural heritage, their traditions, their language, their expressions 

</span><span>and their way of life, it is simply not possible, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The ILO Convention 169 provides 

</span><span>protection  for  indigenous  and  tribal  peoples  and  their  way  of  life,  traditions  and  institutions, 

especially when they are a minority population.  In Fiji, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are the majority.   

</span></p>
<p><span>With respect to the provision of the Convention in relation to land, Mr. Speaker, we have said 

this many times before, the over 90 percent of land in Fiji is </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> or  indigenous land. It is through 

the Constitutional Reforms undertaken by  my Government together with amendments to the State 

Lands Act that will now prevent </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land from being converted into freehold land … 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  …  or  being  permanently  alienated  whether  by  sale,  grant, 

transfer,  exchange  except  in  accordance  with  Section  27  of  the  Constitution  which  provides  for 

compulsory acquisition of land under certain conditions. All </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is 

to be acquired by the State must revert to the landowners if it is no longer required by the State.  

</span></p>
<p><a name="59">Page 59</a></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management

<p><span>901 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  In  other  words,  the  loopholes  which  both  the  SVT 

Government  and  SDL  Government  took  advantage  of,  to  permanently  alienate  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land 

previously was identified and rectified by my Government to ensure that </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land is never again 

alienated or taken away permanently again.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Fijian Constitution also provides for the access to fair share of royalties for the extraction 

of minerals which for the very first time provides compensation to </span><span>iTaukei l</span><span>andowners, not just for 

the exploitation of minerals but also for the exploration of minerals and we have since 2018 enacted 

the Fair Share of Mineral Royalties Act.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we have many times stated the purpose and intent of establishing the Land Use 

Act  which  also  protects  the  rights  of  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>landowners.  Very  briefly,  the  Act  prescribes  that  a 

minimum of 60 percent of the members of the landowning unit  must provide their consent before 

any </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land can be designated for lease under the Act.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, section 5 of the Act states that the ownership of an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land designated under 

the Decree shall remain with the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, section 11 of the 

Act provides that any  leases  issued over  </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land  must at all times take into consideration the 

best interest of the landowners.  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister:</span> I  now  give  the  floor  to  the</p>
<p><span>Chairperson of the Standing Committee for his right of reply. You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will try to keep it short. I would like to 

thank all the Members for clarifying a lot of issues, the former Ministers of Land and the current one 

for actually giving a brief on the Report itself.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There are certain things that I would like to actually talk about with regards to this particular 

Report.  As I always say, we need to stick to the Report. This is the Report of the Public Accounts 

Committee.   Back then we had five Members; Honourable Joseph N. Nand, Honourable Vijendra 

Prakash, Honourable Aseri Radrodro, Honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu and I. It is on record; a 

bipartisan Report. When we were scrutinising this particular Report on land reforms, we came across 

issues that were sensitive; land is always a sensitive issue.  We took a bipartisan approach.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Land security was not an issue. It was well-explained. Our Members actually agreed, that is 

why it is not in the recommendation that security of land is an issue when it comes to an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land 

being given to Land Bank. It was not an issue where if you give land to the Land Bank, that land is 

gone forever; if the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> is not happy, the landowners are not happy, they can always get that 

land back if there is no development on that particular land.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, what was discussed and was part of the recommendation of this particular Report which 

was discussed at length was the benefit to the landowners if the land is actually given to Land Bank.  

These were some of the issues that were once we were trying to scrutinise this particular Audit Report 

that was before us.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just  in  a  nutshell,  I  would  like  to  say  that  the  Land  Bank  Initiative  which  has  been 

implemented since 2011 through the Land Bank has undergone a number of reforms.  The Land Use 

Division is a government initiative programme designed to make more land viable for productive and

<p><span>Review Report – Follow-Up Audit on the Management 

of the Land Reform Programme 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>socio-economic purposes.  Most of these  lands were lying  idle  for all these  years that is currently 

under Land Bank.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This  government  initiative  is  stimulating  economic  activities  and  utilisation  of  available 

resources with a wider participation and Mr. Speaker, Sir, these  lands are given by the consent of 

landowners.  I think a lot has been said that we need at least 60 percent of the landowners to give 

consent before the Prime Minister can actually endorse that land. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The landowners do not incur any administration fee, that is another very important thing with 

regards to the Land Bank as compared to iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB).  The iTLTB takes its 

cut after collecting the lease money from the tenants and gives the remainder to the landlord.  This 

cut pays for the iTLTB administration.  The landowners who lease their land to the Land Bank in one 

way receive more money than those who would offer or prefer to stay with iTLTB.  On the current 

status, most of it has been mentioned by the Honourable Minister for Lands, but I will just briefly 

touch on some of the things. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Very rightfully he said that 122 land parcels with a total land area of almost 10,479 hectares 

is  currently  under  Land  Bank,  out  of  which  three  iTaukei  land  parcels  has  been  returned  to  the 

landowners.  Out of 122 parcels of land, 101 are iTaukei lands and 21 state lands, 102 designated are 

from iTaukei, 91 parcels have been surveyed and all those 91 land parcels have been leased out. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Minister  has  very  rightfully  said  that  they  have  actually  collected  $12.8 

million till to date, out of which, almost close to $11 million has gone to landowners.  These are some 

of the stats we have actually  looked at.  Twelve years ago, the landowners were basically getting 

nothing out of this land and in 12 years, they have been distributed with almost close to $11 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to look at these figures realistically.  We do understand that land is a sensitive issue 

but we should not be going out saying things that will not benefit the landowners.  We have said this 

every now and then that we need to bring in laws, we need to bring in policies which support both 

socially and economically, the landowners.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some  major  investments  that  have  actually  taken  place  on  these  lands  which  are  with  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Land Bank, and I would just like to name some: 

</span></p>

National Springs, Nananu, Tailevu; 

Equatorial Construction; 

Aurum Exploration Fiji Limited; and 

Emirates Resorts Limited. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Just  imagine,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  nine  major  investments  have  paid,  till  to  date,  $8.5 

million to the landlords.  What is wrong in taking your land to the Land Bank with the consent of 60 

percent in agreement?  We do not see anything wrong with that, Sir.
