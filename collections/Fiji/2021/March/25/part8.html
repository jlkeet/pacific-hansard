</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Administrative and Management of the  

Bus Fare Assistance Programme through E-Ticketing – Standing Committee on Public Accounts 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present this Review Report on 

the performance audit on the administrative and management of the Bus Fare Assistance Programme 

through e-ticketing for the school children, the disabled and the elderly.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  bus  fare  assistance,  through  electronic  ticketing,  was  implemented  in  2017  to  assist 

students from low income earning families to attend school, and the elderly and the disabled to be 

able  to travel  when  required.  This  programme  is  aligned  to the  5-Year  and  the  20-Year  National 

Development Plan of the Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Given the sustainable development objectives of the Fijian Government as prioritised in the 

</span></p>
<p><span>National Development Plan, the provision bus fare assistance through e-ticketing is a Government 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>941 

</span></p>
<p><span>initiative  targeted  at  providing  and  promoting  quality  education  for  all,  social  inclusion  and 

empowerment, youth development and women and gender equality. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Bus Fare Assistance Programme through e-ticketing to school children from low income 

families attempted to ensure that all school children have access to quality education.  However, the 

scope of the audit did not cover the acquisition of the services of the e-ticketing provider. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts and the Department of Social Welfare through 

the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation,  are  the two  Government  Departments 

involved and they administer and manage the Bus Fare Assistance Programme through e-ticketing 

for school children, the disabled and the elderly. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  important  to  note  that  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  administers  and 

manages students’  bus  fare assistance whilst the Department of Social  Welfare of the Ministry of 

Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation administers and manages the elderly and disabled’s Bus 

Fare Assistance Programme.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The performance of these two Ministries were thoroughly scrutinised but due to COVID-19 

</span><span>restrictions  that  were  still  in  place  at  that time,  the  Committee  requested  the  two  Departments  to 

</span><span>forward their written responses to the Committee.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  also  sought  formal  clarifications  from  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General 

regarding updates on the audit issues and the audit recommendations. The Committee deliberated on 

the  Audit  Report  using  the  Parliament  virtual  platform  and  the  written  responses,  and  formulated 

recommendations to address audit issues that were identified. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is also important to note that the Office of the Auditor-General had conducted performance 

audit  to  ascertain  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  Government’s  Bus  Fare  Assistance 

Programme through E-Ticketing for the school children, the disabled and the elderly.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  audit  examined  the  various  functional  roles  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  the 

Department of Social Welfare and how they managed the E-Ticketing Programme.  The audit also 

looked at the monitoring and reporting aspect of the programme and how the information maintained 

by  the  e-ticketing  services  provider  were  scrutinised,  analysed  and  reported  to  the  respective 

Ministries and Departments. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee noted that a total of 88,579 students received transport assistance vouchers 

</span><span>in 2009 when it started, while 80,879 elderly and disabled persons received 50 percent concession 

vouchers in 2011.  In 2017 the e-ticketing process for bus fare was implemented and by Term 3 of 

2019,  a  total  of  66,674  students  and  about  51,444  senior  citizens  and  persons  with  disabilities, 

received e-transport cards to utilise e-ticketing.    

</span></p>
<p><span>The  elderly  and  disabled  persons  received  full  10  percent  assistance  for  their  fare  at  the 

maximum value of 40 percent per month in 2018.  Students living in rural areas who have no bus 

services, still use vouchers to travel on carriers, mini buses and punts.  Public funds amounting to 

$100 million have been spent over three years since assistance was delivered to e-ticketing platform 

in 2017. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Bus Fare Assistance Programme through e-ticketing, has sufficient mandate under the 

Constitution  to  enable  it  to  be  functional  and  effective  in  providing  the  required  assistance  to 

</span><span>deserving school children, elderly and persons with disabilities.  However, anomalies were found

</span></p>
<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>given the poor internal controls,  including  lack of  monthly reconciliations of records between the 

two Departments and the e-ticketing service provider.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There  is  also  a  need  to  work  towards  mitigating  risks  identified,  which  can  cause  over-

payment.  These includes the risk of over-payment of assistance through excessive top-ups, school 

fares paid beyond the school zones, payment of assistance to ineligible recipients, lack of declaration 

of interest by processing officers, and continued top-up of cards for deceased senior citizens.  The 

risk of fraud for unused balances in cards also exists. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Generally,  the  system  has  been  effective  in  providing  bus  fare  assistance  through  the  e-

ticketing  platform.  However,  utilisation  of  resources  could  be  improved  with  an  effective  and 

accountable internal control system.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Given the review findings, the Committee recommends that: 

</span></p>

<p><span>(6)</span><span>

<p><span>(7)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  of  Education  to  expedite  the  finalisation  of  the  current  Transportation 

Assistance Policy which is under review and relook at its SOPs in consultation with the 

relevant stakeholders to align it with the Electronic Fare Ticketing Act 2014. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Department of Social Welfare develops a policy and finalise its SOPs in consultation 

with the elderly and persons with disabilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span> The Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts signs a Service Level Agreement with the 

external service provider to include reporting requirements to ensure any gaps identified 

in the Agreement, be addressed and vetted for legal compliance. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  Department  of  Social  Welfare 

strengthen their Complaint Management System. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Department of Social  Welfare examined the seven recommendations provided  by 

their Monitoring and Evaluation Team in 2018 and where practical, implement it as soon 

as possible. 

</span></p>
<p><span> Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare 

strengthen the reconciling of records with the e-ticketing service provider on a monthly 

basis. 

</span></p>
<p><span>By  2030,  the  two  Ministries  with  the  relevant  stakeholders,  provide  access  to  safe, 

affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems  for all,  improving road safety, 

notably  by  expanding  public  transport,  with  special  attention  to the  needs  of  those  in 

vulnerable situations which includes, women, children, persons with disabilities and older 

persons in line with SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Overall,  the  Committee  commended  the  Government  for  this  initiative  in  supporting  the 

vulnerable  communities  and  groups  as  this  Bus  Fare  Assistance  Programme  has  addressed  Fiji’s 

commitment towards the relevant 17 Sustainable  Development Goals  Targets such as: SDG1- No 

Poverty; SDG4 – Quality Education; SDG5 - Gender Equality; and SDG 10 – Reduce Inequalities, 

which aims to ensure that no one is left behind and endeavour to reach the furthest behind first. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  all  the  Honourable  Members  of  the 

</span><span>Committee who were part of the successful compilation of the bipartisan Report namely; Honourable 

</span><span>Joseph Nand, Honourable Virendra Lal, Honourable Aseri Radrodro and Honourable Ro Teimumu

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - Consolidated 2011-2013 Ministry of Lands  

and Mineral Resources Annual Reports - Standing Committee on Natural Resources 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commended the Ministry on its targets 

and achievements in relation to Key Output Areas/Key Performance Indicators achieved from 2011 

to 2013. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  is  a  key  facilitator  and  contributor  to  the 

</span><span>nation’s socio-economic development within Government’s vision of building a better Fiji  for all. 

For the period under review, the Ministry continuously aligned itself to Government’s overarching 

objectives which were explicitly defined in the People’s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress  – 

the  Strategic  Framework  for  Change  and  the  Roadmap  for  Democracy  and  Sustainable  Socio-

Economic Development 2009-2014. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  was  worthy  to  note  that  in  2011  in  its  Annual  Corporate  Plan,  the  Ministry  progressed 

towards achieving Government’s Land Reform Initiative and continued to facilitate the development 

of the country’s minerals and groundwater resources that makes significant contribution towards the 

nation’s economic growth. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the period under review, particularly in 2012, the Committee noted that the Ministry had 

undergone  re-structural  adjustments  within  the  organisation  but  nonetheless,  a  significant 

</span><span>achievement rate of 82.29 percent was the highlight during the said period.

</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, for the 2013 Annual Corporate Plan, the Committee noted that the Ministry enhanced 

its working environment and networking with other agencies to improve service delivery and increase 

achievements  on  Government  developments  in  land  reforms.  All  was  made  possible  through  the 

support of the 2013 budget that outlined the key outputs of the Ministry’s two core departments. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Permanent Secretary, Ms. Raijeli Taga, and her staff for 

their  assistance  in  this  review  process.  I  also  extend  my  gratitude  to  my  Committee  colleagues 

namely;  Honourable  Jale  Sigarara  (Deputy  Chairperson),  Honourable  Alexander  O’Connor, 

Honourable  Mitieli  Bulanauca,  Honourable  Peceli  Vosanibola  and  Honourable  Jese  Saukuru

</span></p>
<p><span>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Sugar Corporation 2007-2019 Annual Reports - 

</span><span>Standing Committee on Economic Affairs 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. NATH.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.  The Standing 

Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to submit to Parliament, the Consolidated Review Report 

of the Fiji Sugar Corporation Annual Reports from 2007 to 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) is the largest sugar milling company in the South Pacific.  

It  has  a  Board  of  Directors  which  is  the  policy-making  and  governing  body.    The  FSC  was 

incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1972 to take over the milling activities from South Pacific 

Sugar Milling (SPSM) and Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) in 1973.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The FSC operates three sugar Mills, two of which are in Viti Levu (Lautoka and Ba) and the 

third  in  Labasa  in  Vanua  Levu.  The  fourth  Mill  which  was  the  Penang  Mill  in  Rakiraki,  ceased 

operations in 2017 due to its inability to cope from the devastations caused by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  The FSC 

is one of the largest private sector employer with a workforce exceeding 1,000, especially during the 

</span><span>crushing season from May to December. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="8">Page 8</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>945 

</span></p>
<p><span>Earlier in 2020, the Committee conducted a site visit to FSC Headquarters in Lautoka, as well 

as all the three Mills in the Western and Northern Divisions, in order to better understand its functions 

and operations.  During the visit, it met with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and his team, who 

provided  a  thorough  update  on  the  sugar  industry,  as  well  as  the  various  initiatives  the  FSC  had 

undertaken in recent times to ensure the sustainability of the sugar industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee noted that FSC faced various challenges throughout the period under review 

which includes but are not limited to the decline in active growers, low yield, lease renewal issues 

including  short  term  leases,  damages  and  losses  caused  by  natural  disasters,  ageing  farmers  and 

shortage of labour. 

</span></p>
<p><span>During its deliberations, Honourable Members of the Committee agreed that the significant 

decline in the number of active growers need to be addressed and would require a holistic effort from 

all stakeholders in the industry to formulate marketing strategies to revive inactive farmers, as well 

as entice new farmers into joining the sugar industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee Members were also made aware of the detrimental impacts of climate change 

on the sugar industry over the years with natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods destroying 

</span><span>farms and infrastructure.  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016, as well as </span><span>TC Keni</span><span> and </span><span>TC Josie</span><span> in 2018, are such 

</span><span>examples of what the sugar industry have to go through over the years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the Committee would like to extend its appreciation to the Fijian Government 

for stepping in and assisting the sugar industry during natural disasters, in its capacity as the largest 

shareholder in the FSC. The Committee is of the view that other stakeholders must closely work with 

FSC to identify potential opportunities for the organisation. The Committee believes that commercial 

banks must also be encouraged to develop incentive packages to assist farmers.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere appreciation to all stakeholders for 

their valuable input.  The Committee would like to especially acknowledge the CEO of FSC and his 

team members in the Western and Northern Divisions, for taking out time from their busy schedule 

to give the Committee a tour of the Mills, as well as for being prompt in answering the various queries 

and questions raised by the Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 

produced  this  Report:  Deputy  Chairperson  -  Honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar,  Honourable  George 

Vegnathan,  Honourable  Inosi  Kuridrani  and  Honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau.    I  also  take  this 

</span><span>opportunity to acknowledge and thank the Parliamentary staff who had given us invaluable support.  

</span><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the review of the Fiji Sugar 

Corporation 2007 to 2019 Annual Reports to Parliament.
