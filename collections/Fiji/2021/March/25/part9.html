<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h3>
<p><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members the Minister for Health and Medical Services has</p>
<p><span>given notice to make a Ministerial Statement under Standing Orders 40.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister may speak for up to 20 minutes, followed by the Leader of the Opposition or 

his designate to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes.  There will also be a response 

from  the  Leader of  the  National  Federation  Party or  his  designated  speaker to  also  speak  for  five 

minutes.  There will be no other debates.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I now call on the Minister for Health and Medical Services to deliver 

</span></p>
<p><span>his statement.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Update on COVID-19 Strains and Current Vaccination Process 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> Vinaka vakalevu,Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  Honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Honourable Members of Parliament and also for those from 

around  Fiji,  who  are  listening  in  and  watching  today’s  proceedings;  I  rise  to  give  a  Ministerial 

Statement on the COVID-19 update on the strains and our current vaccination process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is now been exactly one year and six days since Fiji recorded its first case 

of COVID-19 on 19th March, 2020 and we look forward with anticipation for 19th April,  which will 

be one year since we last had a case picked up in the community.  Since our first case was reported, 

Fiji has now had 67 cases, 64 have recovered and two deaths.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As  we  are  all  aware, the two  deaths  were  border quarantine  cases, our  fellow  Fijians  who 

have come  back and, unfortunately,  been succumbed to COVID-19.  The last 49 cases have been 

international travel associated cases detected in border quarantine.  It has been 341 days since the last 

case was detected outside border quarantine on 18th April, 2020.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As of today, we have conducted a total of 35,986 laboratory tests, with a daily average of 234 

</span><span>tests per day over the last 7 days, and a weekly average of 1,609 tests per week over the last 2 weeks. 

Our testing capability now stands at 484 tests per positive case diagnosed, with a ratio of 40 tests per 

1,000  population.  We  are  seeing  the  continuing  increase  in  testing  ratio  as  our  capacity  to  test 

continues to improve.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Since  my  last update in this august House, we can now test for COVID-19 at the Lautoka 

Hospital  and  Labasa  Hospital,  in  addition  to  the  Fiji  Centre  for  Disease  Control  at  Tamavua.  

However, the good news is, a year down from our first case, Fiji still remains COVID-contained. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As of  yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total number of cumulative cases  in the Pacific was 

</span></p>
<p><span>over 30,000 with the following countries continuing to be worst affected:   

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>French Polynesia with 18,500 cases and over 140 deaths;  

Guam with over 7500 cases and 134 deaths; and

</span></p>

<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>947 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Papua  New  Guinea  recorded  a  20  percent  increase  from  my  last  update  with  over 

3,700 cases and 37 deaths. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  is a worry  for us and the challenges Papua New Guinea  is going through, 

especially as we have Fijians still in Papua New Guinea.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I note that a repatriation flight has been organised and I make a call for all Fijians who are in 

Papua  New  Guinea,  if  they  are  able  to,  to  come  back  home  to  Fiji.      There  continues  to  be  large 

community transmissions  in  those countries while Wallis and Futuna,  like Fiji,  has  imported cases 

totaling 338 and two deaths.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just  recently  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  seen  that  New  Caledonia  which  has  had  a 

fantastic COVID-19 containment period similar to Taiwan and Fiji, had also had COVID-19 picked 

up within the community.</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry continues to closely monitor the global and regional scene of 

the pandemic and regularly engages with experts in the country and abroad to ensure that we are well 

informed of developments.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Over the last four weeks, there has been another surge globally in the number of cases with 

over  123  million  cases  of  COVID-19  with  more  than  2.7  million  deaths  reported  to  date.  Cases 

continue to increase with almost 400,000 cases and over 7,000 deaths reported over 24 hours.  Daily 

case numbers range from 300,000 to 400,000 per day while daily deaths range from 7,000 to 10,000 

globally. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For infectious diseases, every time there is community transmission the likelihood of the virus 

mutating  increases.  The  longer the virus  lingers  within a community, the  likelihood that a mutant 

form of the virus can form, and that is a continuous worry because we have obviously, as you will 

understand, been repatriating our fellow Fijians from all over the world.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are concerns with some of the countries in Africa and as you know, that variants which 

I  will  talk  about  soon.    Most  viral  mutations  have  little  to  no  impact  at  all  on  its  ability  to  cause 

infections on people. But depending on the changes to the virus properties, as a result of the mutation, 

it may change the virus transmission rate, and its severity. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There are many variants of SARS COVID-19 as a result of mutation, but three are currently 

variants of concern - the UK variant, the South African variant and the recent Brazilian variant. I was 

reading early this morning that there is a double mutant variant picked up from India and that is one 

of the reasons why the Indian Government has also indicated that they want to lower the exports of 

Covishield which is the AstraZeneca vaccine that is being produced in the Serum Institute in India. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have also noted reports that France has variants and also, as I have alluded to, the Indian 

variant. Studies show that these variants spread more easily, are more transmissible - up to 70 percent 

more transmissible than the actual or original virus and they may be associated with an increased risk 

of death compared to other variants, essentially because more people can get infected and more people 

are getting infected.  The likelihood of more people being very sick is higher and the likelihood of 

more people dying, is high.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  COVID-19  vaccines  that  have  been  approved  and  those  currently  in  development  are 

expected to provide, at least, some protection against new virus variants because these vaccines show 

a  wide  immune  response.  Therefore,  changes  or  mutations  in  the  virus  should  not  make  vaccines 

completely ineffective. The authorities in the affected countries are conducting epidemiological and 

</span><span>virological  investigations  to  further  assess  the  transmissibility,  severity,  risk  of  reinfection  and 

</span><span>antibody response to new variants. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="11">Page 11</a></p>
<p><span>948 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>While science has proven that the new vaccines will provide some defence to the COVID-19 

virus, rigorous and increased compliance with public health mitigation measures, such as physical 

distancing, use of masks and isolation remains the top defence mechanism and is essential to limit 

the spread of the virus and protect public health. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji has been preparing well before the virus reached our shores, and was one of the very first 

nations to introduce the supplementary health arrival card.  We have found this  intervention to be 

extremely valuable.  We used it in the measles campaign and in our ability to quickly identify and 

track down all contacts of suspected cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  sequential  manner  and  guided  by  the  expert  health  advice  on  the  global  pandemic,  the 

Department of Immigration placed border restrictions that banned the entry of non-citizens into the 

country,  initially  from  China,  then  eventually  from  all  parts  of  the  world,  whilst  Fijians  were 

exempted. Those returning from these countries were required to undergo a 14 days quarantine at the 

Government  designated  quarantine  centres.  These  measures  were  subsequently  followed  by  the 

banning  of  all  cruise  liners  from  entering  Fijian  waters  and  docking  at  any  port  in  Fiji.  The 

international airports and seaports were shut down on 26th March, 2020, and only returning Fijian 

citizens and international trade remained open. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Following  the  community  transmission,  members  of  the  Disciplined  Forces  joined  the 

Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  to  assist  in  contact  tracing  and  community  surveillance 

through fixed and mobile fever clinics in each Division.  The mobile fever teams conducted house to 

house visits and reached 97 percent of our population. This massive undertaking has become a feature 

in the whole of Government COVID-19 surveillance response and is a testament to the truly national 

co-ordinated response to the pandemic.  

</span></p>
<p><span>A major marker in our success in this fight is the ability to do COVID-19 testing locally. Fiji 

commenced testing for COVID-19 at the Fiji CDC on  11th March, 2020 using molecular based Real 

Time  Quantitative  Reverse  Transcription  PCR  testing  –  RT-PCR  in  short.  This  is  a  globally 

recognized and approved standard of testing for this virus.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Our  testing  capacity  was  further  enhanced  with  the  introduction  of  GeneXpert  testing 

capability, also a molecular based test but with a shorter turnaround time of less than one hour for 

results.  This  has  enabled  Lautoka  and  Labasa,  as  well  as  the  Central  Division,  to  increase  its 

community surveillance through the GeneXpert test kit.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, this is important.  When we say there is no community transmission, it is not 

</span><span>because of the people they test in border quarantine, it is because of the number of tests that we are 

doing outside of border quarantine.  We are testing those that present with cough in the health centres, 

those who were admitted with pneumonia, we randomly testing our staff right throughout Fiji, and 

that is how we know that there is no community transmission of COVID-19. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Our quarantine facilities were busy from last year and we have identified key isolation centers 

and 17  facilities to provide surge support for COVID-19 if required. Today, there are 855 Fijians 

who recently arrived into the country and are undergoing the 14 days mandatory quarantine in the 

Government  designated  border  quarantine  facilities  under  supervision.  The  Government  has  been 

forthright and transparent with information on COVID-19, with regular press conferences to update 

the public on the progress of the disease in Fiji and the response measures implemented.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We  developed  the  comprehensive  communication  plan  which  included  a  community 

</span><span>awareness package on COVID-19 that was delivered to 100 percent of villages and settlements in 

</span><span>Fiji.  All  media  outlets  were  engaged  through  media  releases,  press  statements,  press  conferences, 

</span></p>
<p><a name="12">Page 12</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>949 

</span></p>
<p><span>social  media posts, frequently  asked questions, posters and videos that included one  by the Fijian 

men’s 7s Team.  Through the Ministry of Communications, we also put in place a toll-free number - 

158 - which has received nearly 10,000 calls, averaging 150 to 200 calls per day. Apart from that, we 

have our contact tracing app, the careFIJI App and also the case management tool (SORMAS) which 

we have in place.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  can  go  on  to  describe  the  commitment  Government  has  towards  ensuring  a  COVID-

contained Fiji and it surely comes with sacrifice of many dedicated and loyal Fijians including the 

discipline forces, front-line workers and staff of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services. I also 

pay respect to the Fijian Government and the Honourable Prime Ministry for the immediate decisive 

actions  from  the  initial  stages  through  many  policy  decisions,  budgetary  support  and  nation-wide 

actions. As I speak today we are mostly probably the only country in the world to have had COVID 

containment for more than 330 days. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Our attention is now focussed on the major vaccination campaign ahead of us. The COVAX 

Facility  initiated  by  WHO  has  allocated to  Fiji  100,800  doses  early  this  year,  a  portion  of  the  20 

percent which it has committed to Fiji.  Of this, we received the first batch of COVID-19 Vaccines 

on 6th March, 12,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine for two doses each for the targeted 

</span><span>6,000 individuals.  The months of April to May will see the additional 88,800 doses arriving.   Thus, 

</span><span>before June, we can anticipate that the country’s  frontliners and other vulnerable  individuals with 

comorbid issues would have been vaccinated.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji  has  developed  and  submitted  its  National  Deployment  and  Vaccination  Plan  which  had 

</span></p>
<p><span>started in November last year. This plan is a comprehensive document, outlining the: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span><span>(3)</span><span>
</span><span>(4)</span><span>

</span><span>(10)</span><span>
</span><span>(11)</span><span>
</span><span>(12)</span><span>
</span><span>(13)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>regulatory processes; 

target population; 

phased-out approach; 

cold chain systems in place; 

supply chain and healthcare waste management; 

effective vaccine management; 

digital platform with both the registration and monitoring systems; 

systems and processes for any adverse event following immunisation;  

monitoring and evaluation of the deployment and vaccination;  

human resource management and training; 

disease surveillance; 

</span><span>communications; and 

</span><span>financing.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Because we did it, answered the forms and filled it in comprehensively and presented it to 

COVAX  is  one of  the  reasons  why  we  were the first  country  in  the  Pacific  outside  of the  United 

States Territories to actually receive the COVID-19 vaccine. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This planning has taken place in all the four Divisions with a significant amount of micro-

planning specifically for the arrival and deployment of vaccines, to the monitoring.  While this level 

of  planning  is  taking  place,  a  significant  amount  of  work  continues  to  instil  preparedness  and 

anticipation in our vaccination teams as we get closer to operationalising the deployment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  initial  planning  has  involved  Non-Government  Organisations  (NGOs),  faith-based 

organisations  from  all  spheres  and  as  we  speak,  we  continue  to  develop  relationships  and  work 

</span><span>together with this one common goal of protecting all Fijians from COVID-19 when the borders open.  

</span><span>Thus, as a Ministry, our targets are as high as more than 95 percent of all eligible individuals which

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>is  individuals  above  18  years  of  age.    I  thank  the  Honourable  Members  of  the  House  who  have 

registered,  showing  leadership  and  responsibility  as  we  move  forward  with  the  vaccination 

programme. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The first 6,000 frontline workers have been from Health, all of the Western Health Staff, other 

frontliners from the Central and Northern Divisions, including the Blue Lane personnel to start soon 

in Savusavu, those working in sea ports and airports, hoteliers, those working in quarantine facilities 

and a few other associated individuals who work closely at the ports of entry, including our Defence 

Forces. The deployment of the first batch of vaccines has provided an excellent opportunity to test 

our plan, identify potential gaps in our processes and put measures in place to address our systems 

and processes before the bigger vaccine deployment exercise commences. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  vaccinated  6,278  individuals  in  the  first  batch  as  some  vials  had  more  than  10  doses. 

These  are  often  done  by  manufacturers  to  mitigate  against  wastage  during  vaccination.    Our 

vaccination teams were very efficient in making the most of this opportunity to vaccinate 105 percent 

of our target population for 6,000. I am pleased to inform that a total of 4,821 individuals have been 

vaccinated in the Western Division, 1,137 in the Central Division and 320 in the Northern Division. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  also  happy  to report,  Mr.  Speaker, that out of  the  6,278 there  were  no  adverse  event 

</span><span>following immunisation. Some individuals developed mild side effects which were temporary and 

adequately  managed  with  symptomatic  care  which  included  antipyretics  such  as  panadol  and 

hydration.  As per our Vaccination Deployment Plan, Mr. Speaker, the next batch of vaccines would 

target the rest of the health care workers, including Private Practitioners, across Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Apart  from  these  targeted  population  we  want  to  protect  our  most  vulnerable  population 

which are those individuals with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac issues, 

renal diseases,  including persons with disability.  When  you register on to the Online Registration 

Platform,  it  does  ask  you  if  you  have  any  comorbid  illnesses  including,  for  example,  high  blood 

pressure.    You  indicate  that  there  and  you  may  wish  to  actually  put  in  your  national  health  card 

number and what happens is that our staff (Data Managers) will go through that and pick out those 

who are in the vulnerable groups and then you will receive your invitation either by text.  That is how 

it works.   The Data Managers that are sitting behind go through the detail and identify the groups as 

they come next.  

</span></p>
<p><span>So, as you may have seen in the papers recently last week we were told that we were next on 

the list so we just went and had our vaccination done.  Apart from this, we are also anticipating on 

</span><span>vaccinating, at least, 145,400 individuals in the coming few months.  While we focus on this target 

</span><span>population, we also working to ensure vaccine for all individuals above 18 years old in Fiji.  This is 

required for at least 650,000 individuals, which equates to 1.3 million dozes of the vaccine. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Apart  from  COVAX  support  which  covers  an  initial  20  percent  of  the  population, 

Government is also actively involved in bilateral and multilateral discussion with partners who are 

willing to support Fiji in acquiring initial doses of vaccine for the rest of the population and also in 

places where Fiji will actually acquire using its own appropriation.  The Government and the Ministry 

are following closely the processes for approval by WHO for the other vaccines in a not too distance 

future.  

</span></p>
<p><span>To  conclude,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  UN  Resident  Coordinator  for  Fiji,  Mr.  Sanaka 

</span></p>
<p><span>Samarasinha, provided an excellent perspective of our efforts a few days ago when he said:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Fiji and the Pacific’s handling of COVID-19 is one of the best kept secrets that I 

</span><span>know off.  It really is an amazing story in some ways not surprised, but I am disappointed 

</span></p>
<p><a name="14">Page 14</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>951 

</span></p>
<p><span>that Fiji and the Pacific countries that have managed to contain COVID for so long have 

not got the credit and the people have not learnt their lessons from these countries, and look 

at us, we are able to walk around and not wear masks.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are happy with what we have achieved as a nation so far, but we are not resting on our 

laurels. We remain vigilant and focussed and we will not lower our guards soon because the virus is 

still pandemic, the virus continues to mutate in countries that have never had mutation before, despite 

vaccination have begun. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There is some light at the end of the tunnel but the end of this pandemic for the world is still 

out of sight.  Our experience so far have taught us that when we come together as a nation, we rally 

together, a whole of society and whole of government approach, and we commit to act together and 

respond in the same way with the same fervour and commitment, we can overcome this global threat 

and any other threat that stands in our way. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank the Honourable Prime Minister, the Honourable Cabinet Ministers, the civil servants 

and the  many others  in the community  including  members of this august House who are showing 

leadership and responsibility with us.   I thank all Fijians for your effort in keeping Fiji COVID-19 

</span><span>contained, we cannot drop this ball, we must continue and I ask you to stay with us as we complete 

</span><span>this difficult journey.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement.  I now give 

the floor to the designated speaker for the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Dr. Ratu Atonio 

Lalabalavu.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    With  your 

permission, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by my fellow colleague on the COVID-

19 vaccine. 

</span></p>
<p><span>First and foremost, I thank the Honourable Minister and congratulate him and the Ministry, 

frontline health workers, as well as the Permanent Secretary and the Multi-Sectorial Team he has led 

in our national response to the pandemic.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  recognise  the  support  from  development  partners  who  have 

generously donated ventilators and other necessary equipment to aid our national response to protect 

our people over the last one year period.  I also express gratitude to the frontline workers, doctors, 

</span><span>nurses, who have looked after patients and ensuring our quarantine protocols are enforced. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the substantive subject at hand.  Although each COVID-19 vaccine  is 

unique,  all  of  them  may  help  with  herd  immunity.    On  this  subject,  Sir,  I  have  already  said  the 

following; “a collective effort is required, where we all work with government to ensure the COVID-

19 vaccine is available and accessible to all the people of Fiji”. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The registration process is underway both face-to-face and online.  The question then is about 

those who do not use the internet on a daily basis due to connectivity or do not have a smartphone.  I 

hope the registration process, especially face-to-face is rolled out to the rural areas where 44 percent 

of our population reside. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We urge government to continue to work and consult closely with competent authorities such 

as  WHO.    We  are  glad  that  Fiji  is  currently  following  WHO  guidelines  for  frontline  workers  to 

</span><span>receive the first round of vaccination and thereafter other vulnerable groups.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  must  ensure  that  it  is  the  right  dose  for our people  and  we  must take  a  precautionary 

approach rather than rush into accepting free vaccines. The Honourable Minister has mentioned some 

vaccine and also the various strains of coronavirus and the Government strategies in combating it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the USA 

which is Moderna, Pfizer and the Johnson &amp; Johnson while AstraZenica, which was developed in 

the United Kingdom (UK)  is currently  being used in the UK, the EU and  many other parts of the 

world, including Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>While all four vaccines mentioned have efficacy rates in the 70 percent to 90 percent range, 

it is the endpoint that matters, in that, all four vaccines give you protection against severe symptoms, 

hospitalisation and death. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I note that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine entered the market a bit later than the other three 

vaccines.  It has been tested and found effective against some of the variant strains of COVID-19.  It 

is also a one-shot vaccine and storage is in the range of 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius.  To me, Mr. 

Speaker, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine appears more appropriate for Fiji because it is easier to store 

and transport, and is a single shot vaccine.  With that being said, Mr. Speaker, most of the people 

</span><span>who are leading this vaccination programme are saying, “Get the vaccine which you have.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of the rollout of the vaccine, I have every confidence in the Ministry’s vaccination 

programmes.  The only concern I would raise, Mr. Speaker, is the reported requirement by vaccine 

companies  that  extensive  personal  information  is  collected  by  Government  and  given  to them,  in 

addition to information on side-effects.  So that privacy concern, Mr. Speaker, must be addressed by 

Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Other  than  that,  Sir,  I  congratulate  the  Honourable  Minister  on  securing  the  first  batch  of 

vaccines through COVAX, and urge caution on the free vaccine, we must only accept those that have 

been widely tested and certified by the WHO, the US FDA, and Australian or European Authorities.  

I thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Dr. Lalabalavu for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Leader of the National Federation Party.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable 

Minister  for  his  comprehensive  statement  and  for  his  very  useful  account  of  the  statistics  and 

</span><span>processes involved in the vaccination process.  I support his view and statement that all of us should 

</span><span>take the vaccine when it is available and when it is our turn to do so. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, I also want to suggest (I think Honourable Dr. Lalabalavu referred 

to that) and this is in relation to the registration for the vaccine, we did it here very well, I mean, the 

staff actually had their birth certificate numbers but I am told that people who are registering outside 

are required to have a birth certificate and if they do not have one, then they will have to get it for 

$15.    I  suggest  that  the  Ministry  look  at  the  availability  of  other  ideas,  like  passport,  election 

registration cards, if that is what is being said to the people.  So, I would urge the Honourable Minister 

to look at that as well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, and this is what the people are telling us…. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>953 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Yes, I did, but they are being told that they are required</p>
<p><span>to have the birth certificate.  This is a very important point, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, is that, the Honourable Minister did not 

outline very clearly as to when the vaccine is going to be available in terms of the various stages and 

the various groups of people who are going to get the vaccine.  We already know that there are issues 

with the global supply chain, for example, India had just announced that they are slowing down on 

the export of AstraZeneca vaccine.  I am wondering whether we are getting that from India, whether 

we have requested it from India or we are getting it from other sources.  We need to be very clear 

about the process through which we are acquiring the vaccine and  from where, because as I said, 

there are serious problems within the global supply chain.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, while we appreciate that COVID-

19 has been contained and we appreciate the work that has been done by the Ministry of Health and 

those involved in it, we also need to look at how we are going to deal with the impacts of COVID-

19 on  the  economy,  which  is  the  other  side  of  the  big  problem  that  we  have.    Obviously,  we  are 

already seeing difficulty when we look at the bubbles opening, whether tourists from Australia and 

New Zealand, these are all uncertainties that are there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we need to come out more clearly in terms of 

the statistics, for example, the number of flights that are coming, the number of passengers that are 

coming, the numbers who go into the quarantine, and I think the Honourable Minister provided some 

aspect of those statistics.  But for us as a country, we need to have those statistics very clearly laid 

out because when we say to Australia, New Zealand or when we say we are pushing for Australia 

and New Zealand to include Fiji in the bubble, then we need to have ourselves armed with these very 

clear statistics as to how we are dealing with this, how many people are coming, what is happening, 

and we can show that we have and very clear plan so that when the Bubble does open, this is what 

we  have.    It  is  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  important  for  our  arguments  when  we  are  presenting 

ourselves  as  COVID-free  country  or  COVID-contained  country,  because  otherwise,  there  will  be 

questions about what we have.  

</span></p>
<p><span> The final point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the economy is bleeding every 

day and we have to understand that while we focus on COVID-19, while our donors are focused on 

COVID-19, we also need to focus on providing for those who are suffering as a result of the COVID-

19 and those who need income support, who need enhancement of the social welfare positions and 

those who need to be supported in other aspects.  So we must not lose sight of that aspects as well, 

</span><span>because the impact of COVID-19 is creating that great social and economic impact on the lives of 

</span><span>our people.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Leader of the National Federation Party for his contribution 

to the debate.  Honourable Members, on that note, we will now suspend proceedings for refreshments, 

which is being served in the Big Committee Room.
