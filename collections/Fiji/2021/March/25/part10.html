<h3>POINT OF CLARIFICATION</h3>
<p><span>POINT OF CLARIFICATION 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just need to clarify the  issue that was 

raised  by Honourable Professor Prasad regarding a member of the public  being charged $15 for a 

birth certificate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you were making the announcement on Monday, 22nd March, 2021, 

you had clearly stated to all the Honourable Members that they were requested to have their BRN 

which is the Birth Registration Number, which comes on the corner of your birth certificate and a 

valid photo ID.  There was no requirement for a birth certificate </span><span>per se</span><span>.  All we needed to do was 

have that particular number and they would pull the details.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- He did not have a birth certificate:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Let me finish, Honourable Member.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This is what happens, Sir.  We come here, we need to make sure we get 

our facts correct because what you say here disseminates out to the public of Fiji very quickly and 

this needs to be put to rest.  There is no $15 charge.  Honourable Professor Prasad said that someone 

told him they were  being charged $15 for their birth certificate, so if  you are going to go and get 

registered, Sir, … 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.:</span> A point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Point of Order:</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- At no time, Mr. Speaker, did I say that the public  is 

being charged $15.  All I said was that members of the public have told us that they are required to 

</span><span>have the birth certificates.  I said that if they are required to have a birth certificate, if they do not 

</span><span>have one then if they go and get a birth certificate they will need to pay $15.  That is what I said. I 

did not talk about the charge for registration.  I think we need to have that clarified.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> $15 - it was mentioned. You have the floor.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Thank you, Sir.  He has said it in a way that a citizen will have to go and</p>
<p><span>pay $15.  You do not, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that needs to be done for any citizen, is to go to the BDM Office and get 

your BRN - that is given for free.  It is not a charge - all you need is your BRN and for information 

sake, all of this is actually being disseminated on the necessary websites, et cetera.  If you go through 

the COVID-19 registration checklist, it will show you a copy of the birth certificate and at the top it 

has your BRN.

</span></p>
<p><span>I am taking my time to explain this, Sir, because this goes out to the general public. You do 

not need to go and get a birth certificate out, to go and get registered.  All you need is the BRN.  It 

does not cost you $15, so to the general public and to anyone else in this House, you need to say it 

correctly,  Sir.    There  is  no  requirement  for  $15.    As  a  matter of  fact,  even  Honourable  Professor 

Prasad himself did not have his birth certificate - he had to go and get the BRN. It did not cost him 

any money on the day and that is the point, Sir. Thank you for letting me clarify that, Sir.
