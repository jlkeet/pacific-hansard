<h3>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF FISHERIES 2016-2017 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<p><span>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF FISHERIES 2016-2017 ANNUAL REPORT</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Thank you Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move:</p>
<p><span>That Parliament debates the Report of the Ministry of  Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual 

</span></p>
<p><span>Report which was tabled on 16th May, 2018. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. SIGARARA.-  Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  now  invite  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Natural</p>
<p><span>Resources to speak to his motion.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  HonourableLeader  of  the  Opposition  who  is  not  here,  Honourable  Ministers  and  Honourable  Members  ofParliament.</p>
<p><span>Sir,  I,  as  the  Chairperson  of  the  Natural  Resources  Standing  Committee  who  moved  the 

motion.    I  take  this  opportunity  to  speak  on  the  motion  with  regards  to  the  Natural  Resources 

Committee on the Review Report on the Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Report contains the  findings of the Committee and the establishment activities,  major 

</span></p>
<p><span>achievements and performance of the Ministry from 1st August, 2016 to 31st August, 2017. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee undertook a three-day site visit on 11th to 13th April, 2019.  

A few of the Ministry’s operational areas namely the Ministry’s headquarters in Toorak, the  Makogai 

Fisheries  Research  Station,  the  Naduruloulou  Fisheries  Research  Station  in  Nausori  and  Galoa 

Research Station in Galoa and also visited the PAFCO in Levuka. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The objective of this site visit was to provide the Members an insight regarding the internal 

work  sites  and  in  particular,  the  sites  stated  above.  Furthermore,  the  Committee  reviewed  the 

ministerial documentary evidence provided for in its Annual Report for the period under review.  The 

</span><span>evidence collected from the site visit supported the Members in terms of verifying their findings on 

</span><span>the Report of the Ministry of Fisheries for the period under review. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report encompasses the  holistic review of the Ministry’s operations, 

challenges  faced  by  the  Ministry  during  the  period  under  review.    The  Committee  valued  the 

Ministry’s  effort  in  recognising  women  participation  in  areas  of  operation  in  line  with  SDG  5  as 

captured  in  the  Annual  Report  under  gender.    It  was  worthy  to  note  that  the  Ministry  strives  to 

improve its research and development competencies to assist resilience of coastal-based villages and 

settlements to natural disasters.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Another  achievement  of  the  Ministry  in  2016-2017  as  noted  by  the  Committee,  was  the 

drafting  of  the  National  Fisheries  Policy  during  the  year  and  is  awaiting  legal  vetting  from  the 

Solicitor General’s Office.  The Ministry reviewed and developed the Fisheries legislations namely 

the  Aquaculture  Bill  (Bill  No.  9  of  2016)  that  was  presented  on  13th  April,  2016  during  the 

</span><span>information session of Parliament.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>987 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  way  forward  for  the  Ministry  is  to  ensure  that  it  considers  implementing  the 

recommendations  put  forth  by  the  Committee  for  improvement.    The  Committee  hopes  that  the 

Ministry achieves the National Fisheries Policy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  I  commend  the  effort  of  the  Natural  Resource  Committee  Members  in  the 

compilation  of  this  Report  and  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  for  considering  the  Committee’s 

recommendations in working towards improving its operations.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with those few comments, as the Member moving the motion on this Natural</p>
<p><span>Resources Committee Report, I thank you for this opportunity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Chairperson for his motion.  Honourable Members, the floor 

is now open for debate.  I give the floor to the Honourable Minister for Fisheries, you have the floor, 

Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak on</p>
<p><span>the Annual Report of the Ministry of Fisheries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  at  the  outset  I  would  like  to  highlight  that  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  Annual 

</span><span>Report  of  2016-2017  is  somewhat  special.    This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries 

became an independent Ministry on September of 2016. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Like any other agency that was part of a larger entity, the Ministry of Fisheries faced its own 

</span></p>
<p><span>share of organisational and operational challenges that needed to be addressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, as a responsible Ministry, we took out the challenge with the aim to improve</p>
<p><span>the work and services we provided to the Fijian people and help grow Fiji’s Economy.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the efforts undertaken by the Standing Committee</p>
<p><span>on Natural Resources, in assessing the Ministry of Fisheries’ 2016-2017 Annual Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, we, at the Ministry, recognise the recommendations of the Committee and since</p>
<p><span>2016, have worked collectively to address these key areas of development. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to touch briefly on the 15 recommendations that were highlighted.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 1 - The regularisation of the National Fisheries Policy, as alluded to by the 

</span><span>Chairperson,  in 2017, 2018, the Ministry of  Fisheries commenced work on the National  Fisheries 

Policy.    To  achieve  a  collective  and  holistic  approach,  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  was 

conducted with the final document currently being finalised for endorsement.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  the  coming  months,  we  look  forward  to  publishing  this  important  policy 

document  that  would  be  shared  with  all  the  stakeholders  for  an  effective  awareness  and 

implementation.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 2 - Facilitate the promulgation of the Aquaculture Bill;  Mr. Speaker, the 

Ministry of Fisheries values the aquaculture sector and would like to highlight that the work on the 

Aquaculture Bill  have been picked up with the assessment of content currently undertaken  by the 

Ministry  of  Fisheries  which  would  be  later  submitted to the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General.    The 

passing of this Bill will allow the aquaculture sector to grow as we will be able to address the legal 

</span><span>parameters that enable the operationalisation of a fully-commercial aquaculture sector.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="51">Page 51</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 3 - Prioritising Existing Fisheries Research Centres; Mr. Speaker, in 2016, 

</span></p>
<p><span>we identified that there needed to be more effort put in to develop our Research Centres.   During 

this period our Research Centres were either lacking in equipment or without technical and financial 

support to operate at a level that met the Ministry’s goals and expectations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To  improve  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  first  began  by  undertaking  restructure  within  the 

organisation.    This  included  placing  well-qualified  officers  in  areas  that  needed  immediate 

improvement.  This work, Mr. Speaker, was not only undertaken for our research centres but through 

the  whole  organisational  structure.    I  am  confident  to  say  that  this  continues  to  be  carried  as  the 

Ministry  steadily  addresses  Recommendation  No.  4,  which  is  the  Review  of  the  Ministry’s 

Organisational Restructure.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  since  2017,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  established  critical  units  and  divisions 

within our organisation.  This includes the Inshore Fisheries Management Division, the Electronic 

Monitoring  Unit  under  the  Offshore  Division  and  the  Corporate  Division  which  houses  our 

Administration and Accounts Section.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Through the regularisation of these units and divisions, we are able to operationalise and make 

</span></p>
<p><span>significant progress towards the Ministry’s internal and external goals.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation 5, Mr. Speaker, in centralisation of survey data inventory and assessment 

of new species, again I am confident to say that through the Ministry’s restructure and partnership 

we were able to build towards this recommendation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, by establishing the Inshore Fisheries Management Division, the Ministry has 

recruited  dedicated  data  collectors that  send  in  collated  information  to  a  centralised  depository  at 

which data are assessed and housed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally,  through  our  bilateral  partners  and  regional  organisations  such  as  the  South 

Pacific Community (SPC), the Ministry of Fisheries is finalising the development of an Information 

Management System (IMS).  The system will house all data and will assist in the development of 

management measures aimed at sustainable practices. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation  6  -  Creating  Awareness  within  the  Communities  on  the  Importance  of 

Marine-Protected  Areas  (MPAs).    Mr.  Speaker,  since  2016,  the  Ministry’s  approach  to  our 

communities have been focused on raising awareness. This is important as we continue to educate 

</span><span>our  communities  on  the  importance  of  harvesting  at  sustainable  levels  to  ensure  that  our  marine 

</span><span>species are protected from over-exploitation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, through this approach, we were able to gazette two Community MPAs, namely the 

Kiuva  and  the  Naiqoro  Marine  Reserve.    This  was  achieved  through  the  support rendered  by  the 

Customary  Fishing Right Owners who gave their consent which enabled the MPAs to be  legally-

protected through demarcation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The work continuous to grow and in addition to the two community MPAs, we  are currently 

working with communities and civil societies in supporting around 240 other traditional MPAs that 

have been established around the country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, in noting Recommendation No.7 as highlighted by the Committee, the Ministry 

of Fisheries has strengthened its internal operating procedures to ensure that we are fully aware of 

</span><span>the scope and the requirements of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  This includes taking 

</span></p>
<p><a name="52">Page 52</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>989 

</span></p>
<p><span>the  message right down  to communities, so to say, to ensure that they are  fully  aware of the EIA 

requirements.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We also work closely with the Ministry of Environment through the exchanges of Fisheries 

projects and Inter Agency Site Assessments to reduce delays in assessing EIAs.  This help ensures 

all parties with their mandatory legislative requirements.  As the Ministry’s role is one step towards 

the finalisation of shore-based developments, we continue to work closely with line agencies to see 

that the needed work is completed as soon as possible.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  under  the  recommendation  of  the  Committee  for  Makogai,  I  would  like  to 

acknowledge Government’s assistance in allocating funds to rebuild the Makogai Infrastructure after 

being devastated by </span><span>TC Winston.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>With the allocated funds, the Ministry has been able to rebuild the hatchery, office building 

and  staff  accommodation.    In  addition,  we  have  also  managed  to  hook  up  communications  and 

utilities to operationalise Makogai Mariculture Station.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further develop Makogai Research Station, the Ministry of Fisheries is 

</span><span>working with our bilateral partners to assist in additional projects, which include the building of the 

</span><span>Station’s Jetty.  We are fortunate enough to have signed an MOU with the Korean Government and 

discussions are ongoing to secure the needed assistance who have finalised work in Makogai. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  fisheries  sector  services  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders, 

Recommendation No. 9 on the dissemination of information and decentralisation of services, have 

been part of the work undertaken by our Fisheries Service Centres.  Through this, Government, have 

been able to establish two new Service Centres in Moala and Cicia.  These Service Centres, which 

are equipped with ice plants, now cater for the needs of these communities and neighbouring islands.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same is currently being developed in Koro and we hope that this will 

contribute  to  the  growth  of  our  ability  to  serve  the  wider  public.    In  addition,  the  Ministry  has 

continued collaboration with  line agencies and partners to disseminate information and strengthen 

our ability to serve our communities.  One such way in which this is implemented is through road 

shows and attending Provincial meetings. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry of Fisheries believes that these are viable platforms to disseminate information 

</span></p>
<p><span>and more importantly address immediate needs received from the general public.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in Recommendations 10, 11 and 12 (on aquaculture), I would like to thank</p>
<p><span>the support of the Fiji Government in allowing for this important sector to grow. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, aquaculture continues to develop globally and since 2016, the Ministry of 

Fisheries has focused on key components within the aquaculture sector that needed to be improved.  

In addressing these recommendations, the Ministry of Fisheries was fortunate to have worked with 

our  bilateral  partners,  namely  JICA,  under  the  Japanese  Government  in  the  refurbishment  of  the 

Naduruloulou  Research  Centre,  and  the  Taiwan  Technical  Mission  in  the  upgrade  of  Caboni 

Multispecies Hatchery. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the assistance is inclusive of hatchery equipment, feed and feed production</p>
<p><span>materials, in addition to pond and infrastructural repairs.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="53">Page 53</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>To  address  capacity-building  needs,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has  been  able  to  secure 

technical experts from  bilateral partners, who are based within our aquaculture centres to provide 

hands-on training with our officers or improved culturing methods to help boost overall production.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as a result of this initiative, the Ministry is able to increase production of;</p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Sandfish or </span><span>dairo</span><span> in Galoa; 

Prawns and tilapia in Naduruloulou, and  

For  the  first  time,  efficiently  breed  shrimps  and  four  other  viable  species  namely, 

milkfish, rabbit fish, grouper and trout in the Caboni Multispecies Hatchery. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In recognition of these efforts, the Ministry of Fisheries is optimistic that the development in 

aquaculture will continue to grow.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to promote Fiji’s offshore fisheries brand in the 

export market under Recommendation 13, the Ministry of Fisheries have continued to work closely 

with the tuna industry, in understanding the global market and fishing trends that constantly change 

due to global demands. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Since Fiji is at the tail end of the path followed by migrating tuna stocks, Fiji’s fishing fleets 

</span><span>will always have a limit to what they are able to catch.  In addressing this shortage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

</span><span>we assist our Tuna Industry to achieve labels aimed at selling Fijian products within niche markets.  

These investments allow our companies to get the most value out of the products that are sold at high 

and export markets.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of these labels being certified under the Marine Stewardship Council or MSC having 

gain access to the European Union, both of which have proven viable to the offshore sector as the 

sector  is  able  to  access  stable  markets  while  receiving  more  value  on  Fiji-labelled  products.   Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, due to these developments, we are able to access  major  markets  in Japan, USA, the 

European Union, Australia and New Zealand and the Ministry of Fisheries is determined to grow.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in realising Recommendation 14 of the Standing Committee, I  would like 

to update this august House that the Ministry of Fisheries have finalised bilateral arrangements with 

Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.  The development of this work has been delayed due to the impact 

of  COVID-19  and  these  bilateral  arrangements  will  be  completed  once  the  global  restriction  of 

COVID-19 is eased. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally,  the  Ministry  continues  to  collaborate  with  our  neighbours  through  regional 

</span><span>body such as Forum Fisheries Agency, SPC, Forum Secretariat and the Pacific Island Forum.  These 

</span><span>platforms allow the Ministry of Fisheries to work with our neighbours in achieving Fiji’s needs at 

the national and regional level.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would  like to recognise the assistance  from our neighbours, 

New Zealand.  The Ministry of Fisheries was fortunate enough that when we became a standalone 

agency, New Zealand’s assistance enabled us to effectively train our officers and conduct joint patrols 

with the Fiji Navy.  This helped us address areas that we were not effectively able to cover due to 

our  limitations.   The  Ministry  of  Fisheries  continues  to  develop  close  ties  with  New  Zealand  and 

through this collaboration, we look to improve our ability to deliver the services needed to address 

fisheries priorities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Recommendation 15 is to strengthen the establishment and registration of 

Fishing Associations.  I am pleased to update this august House that we have been working to achieve 

</span><span>this throughout our four Divisions.  In implementing this recommendation, Fisheries Service Centres 

</span><span>are those that implement the work on the ground.  Due to the remoteness of some communities and 

</span></p>
<p><a name="54">Page 54</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>991 

</span></p>
<p><span>areas  that  need  assistance,  the  establishment  of  Fishing  Association  has  enabled  the  Ministry  of 

Fisheries to effectively introduce fisheries initiatives and programmes at the community level.  These 

programmes include, fish warden training, sea weed and oyster programme, post-harvest, training on 

market and financial literacy and raising awareness on Fisheries laws and threatened species. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  the  Ministry’s  experience,  we  noted  that  the  establishment  of 

Fishing  Associations  has  helped  boost  voluntary  compliance  within  our  fishing  communities.  

Additionally, through this Association we are able to identify suitable communities that are provided 

with solar power freezers and Association vessels to help them with the ability to conduct surface 

patrols within their customary fishing areas.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these all build towards the collective 

efforts of building partnerships and help foster community resilience within our fisheries sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  guided  by  our  Ministry’s  motto;  Sustain,  Manage  and  Protect,  we  are  a 

natural  resource  centred  Ministry.    One  of  the  most  critical  elements  of  our  work  is  to  ensure 

sustainability.  Our marine resources are not unlimited and if we fail to put a control measure on this 

harvest,  it  will  run  out.    Eventually,  we  will  not  have  enough  to  share,  thus  depriving  our  future 

generations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My </span><span>tauvu</span><span>, the Honourable Gavoka and Honourable Kuridrani have been grandstanding and 

</span><span>tried to force Government to lift the ban on beche-de-mer or sea cucumber.  I had personally advised 

Honourable Gavoka, with the other Members of the Opposition, Honourable Saukuru, Honourable 

Leawere, Honourable Rasova and  including other Members of  Parliament, that the decision to lift 

the ban will depend on Fisheries presenting a sustainable system of harvesting to ensure that future 

generations are looked after. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday, Honourable Matanitobua stated that the SODELPA Government will ensure the 

sustainability of natural resources.  The FijiFirst Government is doing that now and that is the reason 

for the delay in the harvest of sea cucumber.  I believe that my  </span><span>tauvus </span><span>are appealing to their voter 

base who used to work in hotels.  Do they ever consider others who do not have </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span>?  We must 

consider those who come from landlocked areas, provinces, </span><span>tikinas</span><span> and villages in Nadroga. Navosa, 

Namosi,  Naitasiri,  Ra,  Wainibuka  and  Serua.    In  Vanua  Levu,  the  interior  areas  of  Cakaudrove, 

Macuata  and  Bua,  are  basically  appealing  to  the  coastal  communities  in  Coral  Coast,  Vatulele, 

Mamanuca and Yasawa.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more importantly the Members from SODELPA are forgetting our future 

generations  -  the  future  generations  who  are  yet  to  be  born.  Our  grandchildren,  our  great 

</span><span>grandchildren and their grandchildren. In addition, Mr. Speaker, some hotel workers do not have any 

</span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> at all. This is through no fault of theirs but the fact that their forefathers chose to settle in the 

interior areas of our beloved Fiji. The moral of the issue, Mr. Speaker, is that we cannot push to lift 

the  ban  on  sea  cucumber  without  consideration  of  the  current  stock  and  the  extent  of  how  sea 

cucumber can be used to help sustain us now.  

</span></p>
<p><span>To  our  coastal  communities,  please  have  patience  while  the  Ministry  tries  to  work  out  a 

sustainable system of harvest to ensure that our grandchildren and their grandchildren will also enjoy 

it.  I  also  think  of  our  brothers  and  sisters  and  cousins  who  live  away  from  the  coastal  areas  and 

islands, let us move away from the greed of being self-centred. At this critical time, the statement by 

the former U.S President John F. Kennedy is important and I quote; “Ask not what your country can 

do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>In concluding, Mr. Speaker, much has developed in the Ministry of Fisheries since becoming 

</span><span>an  independent ministry  in 2016. We acknowledge the Government in assisting the Ministry with 

</span><span>additional  budget allocation. This has enabled us to grow as an organisation and as a sector.  Mr.

<p><span>Speaker, as a Ministry, we are determined to push on. We have the nation’s interest at heart and more 

so the interest of our communities that are shared owners of Fiji’s fisheries resources. I thank you for 

your indulgence.

<p><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As a Member of the Committee, I thank 

you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Review Report of the Ministry 

of Fisheries 2016 &amp; 2017 Annual Report which was tabled on the 16th of May, 2019.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I further wish to advise the House that the Committee is currently deliberating the Ministry’s 

2017/ 2018 Annual Report. Chair, I wish to thank your office and the parliamentary secretariat most 

sincerely  for  facilitating  the  site  visits  for  the  Committee.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  Minister  for 

Fisheries  and  his  executive  management  are  already  addressing  the  recommendations  of  the 

Committee and it is making the work of the Committee more meaningful and worthwhile.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst deliberating on the Annual Report, Sir, the Committee was aware that the Ministry 

</span><span>endeavoured to improve its research and development competencies to  assist resilience of coastal-

</span><span>based  villagers  and  settlements  to  natural  disasters  through  adaptation,  coastal  strategies  by 

restocking the reefs, re-establishing the Makogai Mariculture Station and improving the enforcement 

to minimise illegal, unregistered and unregulated fishing and better management of their customary 

fishing grounds.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly,  Sir,  the  Ministry  made  efforts  to  have  an  inclusive  and  united  society  and 

involved  the  women,  youth,  the  elderly  and  the  young  of  the  communities  to  income-generating 

fisheries activities to benefit the disadvantaged people. These activities were carried out through the 

various aquaculture and coastal fisheries projects.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  fisheries  sector  contributed  1.8  percent  of  GDP  and  we  should  be 

thankful to the development partners like Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Foreign Fishing 

Agencies and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community for their continued assistance.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, allow me to very briefly discuss some of the important findings of the Committee that is 

worth discussing in this august House. On Makogai Mariculture Research Station, Sir, the location 

of the bay itself makes Makogai Island ideal for research and mariculture, and it is also ideal for an 

</span><span>ocean nursery. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Makogai is well known for its giant clam hatchery that was established in the 1980s.  Giant 

clams are hermaphrodite where one animal releases both the sperm and the egg and the clams can 

grow up to 1.5 metres.  There are eight giant clams species in Fiji, Sir, and they are </span><span>vasua matau, 

vasua  dina,  cega,  katavatu,  teveroa,  tekeniose</span><span>  and two others  that  do  not  have  local  names.   The 

ecosystem  benefits  of  giant  clams  is  enormous.    They  act  as  shelters  for  coral  reef  fish;  food  for 

predators and scavengers; productivity and biomass; and they are a host for bacteria. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of the economic and social benefits, giant clam is a source of food security and the 

Ministry has projects where giant clams are used as attractions through eco-tourism.  Sir, when we 

visited  Makogai,  we  were  ascertained  by  the  fact  that  the  station  was  still  recovering  from  the 

aftermath of </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>and we are pleading with the Ministry to restore Makogai.  They should 

start first by fixing the jetty.  I called yesterday and the jetty is yet to be fixed.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>993 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, Naduruloulou Fisheries Station: Naduruloulou is the main hub for aquaculture activities 

that disseminate fresh water activities to Dreketi in Vanua Levu and Ba and Caboni in the Western 

Division.  The Ministry has about 450 farmers covering both tilapia and freshwater prawn farming 

and  they  aim  to  produce  200  metric  tonnes  tilapia  and  12  metric  tonnes  of  freshwater  prawns 

annually.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Aquaculture is one of the mitigating factors for climate change as well Sir, and is a very good 

source of  food  security.    With  that  being  said,   Sir,  we  call  on  the  Ministry  to  kindly  address  the 

manning of this station as there are only 19 staff that look after all the freshwater activities in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Galoa Fisheries Station:  This is another engine room for the Ministry’s aquaculture activities 

in  Fiji  and  a  hatchery  for  shrimps  and  sandfish.    Its  core  role  is  research  for  farm  development 

activities  and  seed  supply.    The  station  technicians  are  working  very  hard  and  encourage  shrimp 

farming  and  to  restore  the  fast  depleting  sandfish  stocks.    Sandfish  as  you  know,  Sir,  is  a 

commercially valuable species of tropical sea cucumbers.  There is widespread interest in restoring 

populations of sandfish particularly where this can deliver benefits to coastal  fishing communities 

with few other livelihood opportunities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Galoa Aquaculture Station offers potential to help restore production of these valuable 

</span><span>species in three ways through production and release of cultured juveniles in areas close to fishing to 

increase  the  spawning  biomass;  sea  ranching  operations  where  cultured  juveniles  are  released  to 

supplement fisheries catch; and through farming of cultured juveniles in earthen ponds and sea pens.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  we  have  been  importing  shrimps  worth  $25 million  and  sandfish  is  currently  fetching 

$1,600 per kg in the international market, hence the Ministry should be encouraged to explore these 

economic opportunities further.  Sir, I am suggesting that the executive management of the Ministry 

should consider regularising employment of those manning the Galoa Aquaculture Station that are 

still classified as project officers. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I will not touch on the recommendations that has already been elaborated by the Honourable 

Minister for Fisheries.  Sir, when talking about the Ministry’s challenges, I wish to raise the concerns 

of our Chiefs and </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners that is not part of this report.  Their concerns were on the decision 

made with regard to the fishing permit and licensing process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Director  of  Fisheries  has  indicated  that  the  legal  powers  vested  with  the  Divisional 

Commissioners,  as the  issuing  authority  for  fishing  permit  granting  access  into  customary  fishing 

</span><span>rights areas as stipulated in the Fisheries Act 1941, as opposed to the current practice.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, to deny the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners the granting of permits  is to deny them their right to self-

determination as the Vanua.  I am pleading with the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable 

Minister for Fisheries to please maintain the status quo and make wider consultations first with the 

Chiefs  and </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners.  Sir, we will  need them  in this partnership and  more  importantly, we 

need their blessing to enhance more activities in the fisheries sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, to conclude my contribution to the motion, the Ministry of Fisheries has the potential to 

</span></p>
<p><span>strengthen its coral and to improve its contribution to the GDP.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion before the House.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Member:</span> I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Qereqeretabua.  You have the floor, Ma’am.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  I just want to thank 

the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, also the Minister and the Ministry of Fisheries for 

this 2016-2017 Annual Report.    

</span></p>
<p><span>I  just  had  a  quick  read  through  the  recommendations  and  also  the  conclusion  and  the 

challenges that are faced by the Ministry.  I noted the environment of ecosystem in which the Ministry 

operates present a challenge in respect to climate change.  If I may just read this a little bit it says 

“climate change, it is an issue for the Ministry to mitigate and to focus on aquaculture costal fisheries 

management that is sustainable and protect resources and work towards a new fisheries development. 

This will improve on the Ministry’s work on research, science and development”.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I notice what the Honourable Minister said about the inshore fisheries, management division, 

as well as the research and marine conservation division.  I am so glad they have those two divisions, 

as well I note in the report the Ministry’s work with Women’s group around the country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I just want to ask, I understand from Honourable Saukuru that the 2017-2018 Annual Report 

is before the Committee now and what I noted in the report that there  is no mention of looking up 

river as affecting what happens in coastal communities and inshore fisheries.  As we know, there is 

</span><span>a lot of silting, deforestation, wrong deforestation activities upriver which impacts severely on coastal 

</span><span>fisheries.  

</span></p>
<p><span>While  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  and  the  Standing  Committee,  I  would  just  like  to 

perhaps, ask the Committee that when they are doing the deliberation on the 2017-2018 Reports, they 

should be looking upriver as well. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I  thank the Honourable Member:</span> I now give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Anare Jale, you have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. JALE.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to make a short contribution</p>
<p><span>to the debate on the Ministry of Fisheries Report for the period  August 2016  to 31st July, 2017.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I wish to thank the Chairman and the Honourable Members of the Committees for the report. 

I  noted  the  recommendations  and  other  findings,  I  think  it  is  a  very  important  document  for  the 

Ministry to work on to improve some of the things that need to be taken abroad and improved.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Report is out-dated but provides important indicators.  I noted from the 30 page report 

</span><span>did not include the financials statement; 15 pages of the report concerned training, meeting, survey, 

</span><span>learning and capacity  building, that is excellent.  That is really great.  I hope that the Honourable 

Minister will see that whatever transpired from those meetings and survey are translated to outputs 

and results.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry needs to improve each contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  It is 

$1.8m  in  that  year  during  the  period  under  review  and  I  am  sure  it  has  a  potential  to  improve  its 

contribution, the percentage of contribution to GDP.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The maritime province depend a lot on fisheries, what they get from the sea.  Their livelihoods 

and  their  economic  generating  activities  depend  a  lot on  what  they  get  from  the  sea  and  it  really 

address Output 5 of the Ministry’s Corporate Plan, which is food security and income generation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  Report  has  identified  that  the  Eastern 

</span><span>Division is the poorest of all the Divisions in Fiji.  I think that should be something that need to be 

</span><span>taken on board by the Ministry when  it plans  its  work in the  future. We are not talking about the 

</span></p>
<p><a name="58">Page 58</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>995 

</span></p>
<p><span>Eastern Division only  but to look at the Maritime Provinces and  how it can  improve the fisheries 

performance there.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The poverty headcount in the Division has been a concern.  It has been a concern for some of 

us that come from the maritime division, particularly the Eastern Division.  Our concern now is the 

people leaving the villages and come in to Suva.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The rural urban drift is a big concern to us. We need to find economic activities and income 

generating activities for people in the islands so that they can live in the islands and be able to earn 

and meet their requirements of life. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Seaweed farming used to be very productive and very successful in maritime province in the 

past.  I note there were only 3.9 metric tonnes of dried seaweed produced during period of the report. 

The target lost about 100 metric tonnes. I am not too sure whether I am right but that is my reading 

from the report, Honourable Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Outcome 19, fisheries resources and climate adaptation - mangrove planting is the output that 

we want to achieve.  This is a very important issue for the Maritime Provinces  because we depend 

</span><span>on mangroves as a nursery for the fish.  They have a place that provides a nursery for them and other 

</span><span>living creatures in the sea to be able to grow and reproduce.    

</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that the Ministry will try to strengthen each work in that particular area and with the 

cooperation  of  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  in  looking  at  areas  that  need  mangrove  replanting  or  the 

introduction of planting of mangroves in some areas.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I wish to conclude by referring us to the values of the Ministry.  There are five values of the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministry with the set of 5Rs.

<p><span>They have termed “reliable” as, we will do and deliver what we have committed and promised 

to our customers.  I wish to remind the Honourable Minister that the people of Susui, Yavea, Tuvuca 

</span><span>and Namalata in Vanuabalavu are still waiting for your promise for solar freezers, which were done 

</span><span>six years ago and months ago.  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir and I thank you for the opportunity 

to respond to the Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2016 and 2017 by the Standing Committee on 

Natural Resources.  My response will mainly seek to give a broad overview of the Report before I 

focus on some key recommendations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I highlight that Fiji and other Pacific Islands are most times 

</span></p>
<p><span>being referred to by our development partners as “Small Islands States”. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir,  we  must  change  that  narratives  now to  something  that  is  more  positive,more  inspirational  like  Fiji  is  a  small  island  state  but  we  are  ocean  rich  and  that  we  look  to  the</p>

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Minister for Fisheries to take the lead role, particularly at a time such as this, when we are faced with 

economic challenges brought about by COVID-19.  We  must review, renew, diversify and reboot 

our economy.  For example, investing more in the development of our fisheries sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  report  and  particularly  the  15 

recommendations  listed  in  the  report  which  have  been  elaborately  articulated  by  the  Minister  for 

Fisheries.  The recommendations are very substantial and timely and must be taken on board by the 

government  as  the  basis  and  foundation  to  our  diversification,  conversations,  consultations  for 

economic policies, programmes and strategies in the development of the Fisheries sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst  we  continue  to  hear  about the  efforts  in  reviving  the  tourism  sector,  we  must,  Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  unfreeze  our  mindset  from  tourism,  reset  our  vision  and  aggressively  pursue  the 

development of our fisheries sector.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the situation on the ground and the 

huge  number  of  our  people  that  have  lost  their  job  due  to  COVID-19,  there  is  a  strong  need  for 

diversification  focus  on  resource-based  sector  such  as  fisheries.    We  can  start  with  the 

implementation of the 15 recommendations, as alluded to by the Honourable Minister. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- This is my own work, Honourable Minister for Health.  We are 

quite capable of doing our own speech unlike your side have to rely on your government officials to 

give you the script Honourable Selai. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  actually  picked  up  three  recommendations  but  the  Honourable 

Minister for Fisheries had passionately alluded to all those 15 recommendations.  So, I will just focus 

on Recommendation 9 and I remember yesterday that we, on this side of the House had been accused 

by the government side that we selectively read the report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  followed  quite  closely  with  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  speaking  on  the 

recommendations  which  was  very  good  but  when  he  came  to  recommendation  9,  he  selectively 

omitted to finish that recommendation and the  last part of that recommendation reads, “hence the 

need to increase the Ministry’s annual  budget allocation”.  And when speakers on this side of the 

</span><span>House were giving their contributions, we were been given the sign that we have to look to the budget 

</span><span>which is coming up very soon. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.:</span> Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Point of Order:</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Member  is 

suggesting that our allocation in our budget has not increased, it has increased from $16.5 million to 

$23 million during the period of the report.

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>997 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  Honourable  Minister  for 

Fisheries must note that his annual budget allocation for 2019 to 2020 was only $15.4 million and 

that only  increased to $15.5 million  in 2020 to 2021; that is his current budget right now.  So, he 

cannot say that we do not know the budget.  We know  your budget is $15.5 million, Honourable 

Minister, and with only an increase of $0.1 million, how do you think you will be able to implement 

all those 15 recommendations?   Those 15 recommendations, as alluded to by the speakers on this 

side of the House, they need money, they need money to be able to carry them out, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, we are only about three to four months to the Budget Session and I really hope 

that the Honourable Minister for Fisheries will support our recommendation because we, on this side 

of the House, will support.  We will put on the floor the recommendation for an increase in the budget 

for the Ministry of Fisheries.  The least he can do is to stand up and support that recommendation 

when we come to the budget session.  We look to you, Honourable Minister, to honour your works 

on the recommendation, support the  increase of  budget in the Ministry of Fisheries during  budget 

debate so that you will be able to implement all those 15 recommendations.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Member:</span> I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Rasova.  You have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- </span><span>Ni bula vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to respond to the Ministry of 

Fisheries Annual Report for the period 2016 to 2017. Before I go into reading my response, I would 

like to acknowledge the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs in its involvement with the Kadavu Provincial 

Council  Meeting  that  is  currently  happening  now  in  Tavuki,  and  the  chief  guest  is  the  Assistant 

Commissioner of Police, given that the Police has been in Kadavu for the last three phases of their 

clean-up of the island.   

</span></p>
<p><span> I would just like to go to the Honourable Minister’s response in regard to the beche-de-mer. 

Given that he has never explained to us in detail why the beche-de- mer is not being accepted, even 

though that we want the people of Kadavu or even all around Fiji to dive for beche-de-mer.  But I 

will go into the nitty gritty of what took place in the verbatim of the report.  It says that, if you take 

it back a couple of decades ago when we had the British coming over, the economy was then run by 

</span><span>sucuwalu</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>itself.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It was a boom bust industry and it took about a hundred years for it to recover, as it is right 

now.  We have had science done over the 10 years with partners from our researchers from across 

</span><span>the universities, from the Fisheries Research Division as well as Secretariat of the Pacific Community 

</span><span>(SPC). So it was just not fisheries take on this, it was a multi-regional approach and the status not 

just for Fiji but across the Pacific, is that we are in dire straits  when it comes to our resources like 

</span><span>sucuwalu</span><span>.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In Fiji, as per the status right now that the white tinned fish, prickly red fish and black fish 

were very high sought after but the state right now, our fishermen or our communities are harvesting 

fish, beche-de- mer that are of the lowest quality and the sizes that have been exported right now are 

very very small. These are the fishermen that are going out more than used to be but they were fishing 

in  the  sand  tracks  15  metres,  20  metres  and  are  now  diving  60  metres  across.  We  had  taken  the 

precautionary approach to stop it internally but then we got the science to it saying, “look this is what 

is  happening,  if  you  continue  in  the  next  five  years,  you  will  have  absolutely  nothing  on the  fish 

floor.” So, let us take it for a while for fish to recover. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also in saying this, this was just not the fact that as fish managers, not as just science behind   

</span><span>what is happening on fishery itself but it is happening to our communities. We were being ripped off,

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>the communities were given $30,000 but in overseas markets, they were being sold 10 times or 20 

times more.  Additionally to this, there are a lot of fatalities associated with this because the resources 

are limited. The fishermen have to go out to dive 60 metres further down which is not sustainable. 

Our human bodies are not actually developed to sustain the level of pressure within a certain time.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have a  lot of cases  now reported as  mortalities, death and  a  lot of cases  now with the 

bench which are not reported, hidden within the communities. These cases are well-known to our 

fishermen, our officers and even the police.  So, of these cases have arrived to the complete ban of 

beche-de-mer  harvest  until  we  have  a  regional  approach on the  size  limits,  on  what  species  to  be 

harvested and on the baseline prices that provide the right value for our communities.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Once we have sorted that out and our fisheries have recovered then the onus will come back 

to Government to reassess the opening.  I think that explanation in the verbatim should have come 

from the Minister to tell us the real strategy behind the ban, but then taken the economic climate in 

Fiji, if the Government or the Minister can review.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As we know our fisheries sector is very important to the community since it provides food 

security,  employment  opportunities  and  export  for  foreign  exchange  earnings.  The  Ministry  of 

</span><span>Fisheries  has  an  aspiring  vision,  that  is  to  have  the  best  fisheries  in  the  Pacific  region  and  a 

</span><span>challenging mission which is to sustain, manage and protect Fiji’s fisheries.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, today  I  stand to  share  my  disappointment on  the  Ministry  that  has  been 

mandated by Government to manage and protect one of Fiji’s natural resources sustainably that has 

raked in millions of dollars for our economy over the years and yet the only available annual report 

of the Ministry is 2016-2017 and the recent 2017-2018 that was just tabled in February sitting this 

year.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I beg to question, how are they measuring the efficiency of their programmes 

and activities if annual reports pre-2006 has not been prepared and tabled in this august House? I am 

sure,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  fully  aware  of  the  requirement  under  section  69  of  the  

Financial Management Act 2004, that each agency must prepare an annual report for submission to 

its Minister by 30th May the following year.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the 2016-2017 Annual Report under the Aquaculture Division, a total 

of 323,645 megatons of tilapia fries were produced and distributed from the hatcheries from the one 

million megatons targeted. A total of 10,965 tilapia was produced from commercial and subsistence 

</span><span>farms from the 150 megaton target. A total of 265,120 prawns post larvae was produced from these 

</span><span>hatcheries from the 750,000 target.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other targets and outputs, too ambitious or is there poor management and 

monitoring within the Division? On a similar note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the newly established division 

within the Ministry of Fisheries, the Inshore Fisheries Management Division was established due to 

the limited information available on coastal fisheries.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask the Honourable Minister for Fisheries on the progress of collating coastal 

fisheries data and what approach has been adopted in terms of fisheries monitoring for inshore and 

coastal fisheries. Though inshore fisheries will depend on the support of the geographic divisions for 

the provision of data and also their role as implementers of inshore fisheries programme initiatives.  

How is the Ministry monitoring the compliance and the progress of this new and important division? 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with more and more people losing their jobs and those on reduced hours ofwork, the need to divert focus on resource-based sectors such as fisheries is crucial.  The Aquaculture</p>

<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>999 

</span></p>
<p><span>Research and Development Division of the Ministry of Fisheries needs to be strengthened to address 

and assist in this aspect. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Increase in budgetary allocation as alluded to by the other Honourable Members, recruitment 

for more skilled human resources, investment of technical expertise are some of the areas in which 

the  work  of  the  division  can  be  strengthened.    Over  the  past  two  decades,  the  Ministry  has  been 

concentrating on a few species of freshwater, brackishwater species, such as tilapia, grass carp, silver 

carp, milkfish, prawns, shrimps and sandfish, to assist with food security and a source of livelihood. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say the need to strengthen this division is because there is a need to explore 

the culturing of species of special interest such as sea cucumber, sea urchins, eels, to name a few.  

This  development,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  can  assist  the  unemployed,  the  people  who  are  seeking  an 

alternative livelihood to support their families during these trying times. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Offshore Fisheries Management Division, the technical advisory arm of 

the  Ministry  on  matters  relating  to  Fiji’s  offshore  fisheries  sector,  whose  main  objective  is  to 

conserve, manage and develop Fiji’s Offshore Fisheries Resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  note  that  the  total  tuna  export  from  2017  to  2019  was  approximately 

</span><span>US$142 million.  Tuna catch in national waters was US$47 million and tuna catch from national long 

line fleet was US$74 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impact of COVID-19 on tuna exports in 2020 to-date has been  most 

severely felt by long line vessels and processes supply the fresh tuna market as a result of the reduced 

airfreight capacity and a significant increase in airfreight cost.  What is the Ministry’s plan in assisting 

long line fishing vessel operators? Processing facilities and the local crew of vessels, if there is any. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I noticed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Offshore Fisheries Management Division rakes in a lot 

of money into the economy through tuna exports and license fees and is very structured in terms of 

its Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MSC components).  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the biggest 

threats to the management offshore fisheries is the Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated (IUU) fishing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  Fiji  and  the  Pacific  island  countries  are the  custodians  of  last remaining 

healthy tuna stocks in the world and manage a marine area of 300 million square kilometres.  Sir, 

IUU  fishing  remains  one  of  the  greatest  threats  to  marine  ecosystems  due  to  its  potent  ability  to 

undermine national and regional efforts to maintain  fisheries sustainability  and represent up to 26 

</span><span>million tonnes of fish caught annually, valued at $10 million to $23 billion a year. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, IUU fishing undermines fisheries conservation and management measures 

in  place,  affects  the    nation’s  economy  and  the  people  depend  on  fishing  industry  as  a  source  of 

livelihood. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the efforts to deal with the problem are hampered by a number of factors.  

The large area ocean space relative to the land area, the nature of fish and fisheries resources, lack of 

financial and technical resources and skilled manpower compound the problem of dealing with IUU 

fishing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fiji the national fleet which comprises the Fiji licensed and Fiji long line 

fishing vessels which fish in Fiji fisheries waters have mandatory requirements of installing a Vessel 

Monitoring System (VMS) on board so that the fishing activities out at sea is closely monitored. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>However, the Ministry of Fisheries is only able to monitor these licensed vessels out at sea. 

Other fishing vessels which enter our waters illegally are not monitored as Fiji does not have adequate 

infrastructure for aerial or surveillance to monitor the illegal fishers who enter our water. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are few occasions where Australia and New Zealand Navy assist Fiji’s 

fisheries in aerial and surveillance and if they detect activities suspected of illegal fishing, otherwise 

they are undetected. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the Fiji Navy also conducts services every once  in a while, an expensive 

exercise to patrol and police the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a 1.9 million square kilometres 

on a daily basis.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the degree of this problem and the importance of ensuring that Illegal 

Unreported  Unregulated  (IUU)  Fishing  is  addressed, the  Government  needs  to  seriously  consider 

ways it can assist the Offshore Fisheries Division by investing on securing the necessary equipment 

to enable the efficient and effective MSE of effective fisheries activities.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I urge the Government:</p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>to strengthen the Research and Development Division of the Ministry.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>More  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  the  Fisheries  Research  Centres  to  assist the  food 

security,  creation  of  employment,  source  of  alternative  livelihood  for  people  and 

hopefully  contribute  to  GDP,  noting  that  in  2014  we  had  2.8  percent  GDP,  2015, the 

highest was 8 percent to GDP, 2016-2017.  We note that there is only 1.8 percent, and in 

2018, 2019, was still 1.8 percent

<p><span>(6)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Strengthen  exercise  to  conservation  and  management  initiatives  currently  placed,  for 

example, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Increase awareness and strengthen communities on the importance of conserving marine 

resources, BDM ban is to be lifted for source of livelihood on unemployed and imposed 

catch coder for monitoring purposes.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Lift the ban for Group Line Coral, </span><span>Kawakawa</span><span>, </span><span>Donu</span><span> as sources of food and livelihood.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Increase issuance of offshore long line fishing licence which has been set at 60 only from 

</span><span>2014, need to create employment for our locals, therefore an increase in the issuance of 

long line licence is highly recommended.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I urge the Government to refocus  its attention on resource-

bases  sectors, such as  fisheries and  invest a lot more funding to enable the efficient and effective 

operations of its programmes so that it can deliver to the people who benefit through employment, 

food security and alternative source of livelihood.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I will try to be short. Much</p>
<p><span>of the issues that I wanted to raise have already been raised by my friends.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>1001 

</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for this Report 

and also I want to thank the Honourable Minister for Fisheries for that very informative presentation 

that he made earlier in terms of the intentions of the Ministry.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There is a lot of opportunities within the fishing industry and it is almost unthinkable that we 

have  such  a  big  vast  sea  resource that  we  are  not  getting  as  much  from  the  sea  as  much  as  what 

tourism is bringing to Fiji.  There is this realisation that tourism is almost like an impediment to the 

use of sea resources by people who could use that for living and also improve on our exports in terms 

of aquaculture and other fisheries related-areas that we could use for export.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to speak a little bit on this issue about fisheries and that is 

fresh water fisheries, I suppose, if you want to call it, as opposed to inshore and offshore where the 

majority of the speakers have sort of concentrated their efforts today.  I say this because obviously I 

come from the inland where there is opportunity for this to occur.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I recognise there is a lot of work been done by the Ministry with regards to aquaculture and 

in places  like Naduruloulou and Caboni  in terms of the development of freshwater aquaculture in 

these places, to help villagers and communities who depend on aquaculture in our local waterways 

</span><span>for food and also to earn a living by what they get themselves.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, that there is a lot of opportunities.  I believe I am not sure 

but I would like to ask the Honourable Minister as to what percentage of the Ministry’s Budget goes 

to freshwater because I believe  it  is probably the lowest of them all, compared to what goes in to 

inshore and offshore, but there is a lot of opportunities there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, post COVID-19, when we talked about poverty alleviation yesterday and some of the 

debates that we took part in, when we talked about poverty and people, we realise the movement of 

people that have come from the West to resettle in Tailevu, Rewa and Naitasiri, and some of these 

people come with no </span><span>i teitei</span><span> or farms. So, the easiest place they go to is the river, they go and get </span><span>kai 

</span><span>(mussels), </span><span>ura</span><span> or whatever else is available within the rivers.  These rivers themselves, I am sure you 

know Government Ministers and Members of Parliament that as you go into the country, you see the 

exploitation of our river resources.  

</span></p>
<p><span>So when we are developing other industries, it is  coming at a great cost to fisheries  in our 

inland water sources in the rivers.  A case in point is Dawasamu if I can recall, Ba River you know 

in certain areas, also the Lodoni River.  These people cannot exploit these resources any more.  I am 

</span><span>talking about rivers and the Honourable Qereqeretabua referred to this earlier.  So some resources 

</span><span>need to be put in to this, either for climate mitigation so that when this kind of resources is put into 

it, at least this initiative that the Honourable Minister is talking about can be there and used not only 

for aquaculture but also for the development of our waterways that are already there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I was talking to one of the scientists and I spoke to the Honourable Minister about Caboni on 

this project that we want to establish and start breeding fresh water prawns in my community.  When 

he came he said, “Oh, you have such a beautiful river here, what have you done and what are you 

planning  to  do  about  it?”    For  instance,  like  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  in  Tailevu  in  Korovou  has 

almost low capacity to be able to deliver this advice to the people who have such good waterways - 

the inlets of Wainibuka and Ra.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I mean, this is a completely neglected area that I want to bring to the attention of this House 

because, unfortunately, the development in other areas of our economy, our water resources inland 

</span><span>which are the sources of food security and, of course, economic opportunities for these communities 

</span><span>cannot be used properly because timber, gravel extraction and the many others that exploited these 

</span></p>
<p><a name="65">Page 65</a></p>
<p><span>1002 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>resources that have come at the cost of this inland water resources. We all know it.  We go to these 

major rivers and we see they are all dried up.  Why?  Because of a lot of deforestation before, there 

used to be a Ministry of Forests and Fisheries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister today said that it is now a separate Ministry of its own, of course, 

that  is  good  but one of  the  things  there though  is that there  can  be  a  disconnect,  we talked  about 

poverty yesterday.  So, when we tried to gain one area, we exploit and it comes at the cost of another 

resource and on most occasions, it is the marine resources, the fish, it is that which lives in the river 

that people feed from and live from, I suppose becomes the victim at the end of the day.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would like to ask here, Mr. Speaker, that the Honourable Minister, under his Programme, 

particularly  in  dealing  with  aquaculture,  must  also  consider  our  major  waterways  and  through 

something  about  them  so  that  people  can  always  go  back  to  it  for  poverty  alleviation,  for  food 

security, use these resources to make their own  living, particularly  now, when there  is no  jobs.  I 

know there is a joke that goes around with the iTaukei “</span><span>Sega tu nomu i teitei, levu ga nomu uku</span><span>”, but 

this is actually true because people that have lost their jobs go back to their communities and they 

have no </span><span>i teitei</span><span> to feed from and where do they go?  They go straight into the river and they find </span><span>kai</span><span>, 

fish, and whatever they can catch, they take it to the market. 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would just like to ask in that regard because of climate change and because of poverty, 

perhaps the Ministry could consider in the future, how to try and refresh and rebuild these resources 

so that it can protect the resources that are within it from the sustainability of the livelihood of our 

different communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I just recognise from the presentation of the Ministry that is here, Honourable Speaker, that 

there are so many opportunities for aquaculture in Fiji.  There is very little being done about it and 

in fact I would like to implore upon the Minister, please, I know you are doing a lot of work and I 

am not going to deny that on it and I know every once in a while I see you driving down to Caboni 

and that is something that has been captured and I would like to commend you for that but obviously 

there is still a whole lot more to do.  Of course, there is more for our people to gain from, from their 

own livelihood and, of course, share a little bit more that they can raise for the sustainability of their 

own family and, of course, through the local community.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  you  Honourable  Member:</span> Honourable  Ratu  Navurelevu,  you</p>
<p><span>have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  RATU  T.  NAVURELEVU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  giving  me  this 

</span><span>opportunity to stand before this House and  contribute to the motion before the House.  I would like 

to say a few words in response to the Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Reports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Before I proceed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would  like  to commend the Standing Committee for 

providing a comprehensive Report.  I note that the Ministry of Fisheries’ vision, which is to have the 

best  fisheries  in  the  Pacific  region  and  its  mission,  which  is  to  sustain,  manage  and  protect  Fiji’s 

fisheries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Ministry has a legislative mandate to manage and protect one of Fiji’s 

valuable natural resources.  I note, Sir, that there are some impediments that hinder the successful 

implementation  of  the  programmes  and  activities  in  place.    May  I  ask  for  your  permission,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, to let me outline the challenges.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the challenges have been highlighted by the Honourable Minister for Fisheries and 

</span><span>other speakers, one is yet to be regulated is the National Fisheries Policy, the overarching document 

</span></p>
<p><a name="66">Page 66</a></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Ministry of Fisheries 2016-2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>1003 

</span></p>
<p><span>that sets the foundation  for all Ministry policies with our land, the incomplete review of the Tuna 

Management Development Plan, the pending Aquaculture Bill which was gazetted as No. 9 of 2016, 

the low support for the existing Fisheries Research Centres leading to the dragging performances, 

lack of awareness and engagement with communities on the importance of Marine Protected Areas 

(MPAs)  and  conservation  of  marine  resources,  poor  turnaround  time  on  Environment  Impact 

Assessment  (EIA)  on  fisheries  programmes  by  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  non-availability  of 

hatchery fields locally, the poor condition of aquaculture facilities and the poor infrastructure of the 

Makogai Mariculture Station, including the jetty, transportation and communication, in these trying 

times, thousands of our people in the Tourism Ministry have lost their jobs and are struggling, the 

latest support from the Western Division for the civil society is that thousands are struggling to put 

food on the table because the FNPF assistance is simply not enough to feed their families and pay 

their bills. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For us in Northern Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the maritime province, the recent </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>

and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> have devastated our communities.  It is a tough lesson we are learning as the nation is 

relying solely on tourism.  Government put most of its eggs in one basket and overinvested in our 

national  airline  which  is  struggling  to  repay  its  loans  for  the  airlines.    The  Government  needs  to 

redirect its focus to the primary or resource-based sectors like the fisheries sector.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

</span><span>this is my humble plea to the Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As the Honourable Minister strongly objected on the lifting of the ban, I join my colleagues 

to  plead  the  Government  to  lift  the  ban  on  beche-de-mer,  it  is  now  four  years  since  the  ban  was 

imposed and the beche-de-mer population would slowly have recovered.  This is an important source 

of livelihood for the unemployment considering the sustainability issues.   

</span></p>
<p><span>With  the  absence  of  a  management  plan,  a  catch  quota  can  be  imposed  for  monitoring 

purposes.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure this House, sea cucumbers also known as beche-de-mer 

has been in Fiji for the past two centuries.  In the 19th century, sea cucumbers replaced sandalwood 

and became Fiji’s major export earner.  Since 1980, elevated export prices and demand from Asian 

markets have a catalyst for increased fishing.  This trend of inheritance from generation to generation 

until today continues.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  existence  of  marine  resources  is  not  a  business  but  rests 

entirely with our supreme Creator, God who is the provider and He exactly knows what is adequate 

for a person or for us to catch to meet our daily task.  We cannot be 100 percent and that beche-de-

mer now is not enough to provide for our future generation.  Our fishing grounds are very rich of 

</span><span>marine resources, and they are there for the provision of our daily needs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On behalf of the communities in the Northern Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I humbly request 

the Government to consider, maybe four months lifting of the ban on beche-de-mer and catch quotas 

to  enable  communities  to  rebuild  their  homes  in  the  aftermath  of  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  and  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>.  May  I 

recommend the Honourable Minister to consider more emphasis be placed on the existing fisheries 

research centres to improve the standard and provide better alternative sources of livelihood for the 

people,  increase  awareness  and  engagement  with  communities  on  the  importance  of  conserving 

marine resources and having marine protected areas.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Minister and the Ministry  for their 

report and continue work in this important sector and I thank the Honourable Chairman and Members 

of the Standing Committee for their Report.  </span><span>Vinaka,</span><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir.

</span></p>
<p><span>25th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to speak on the motion 

by Honourable Kirpal.  I thank the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee on Natural 

Resources for their deliberations on the Annual Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, access to adequate food is a constitutional right for every Fijian.  One way 

we  meet  that  mandate  is  by  looking  to  the  bounty  of  our  ocean  ecosystems  just  as  we  have  for 

centuries past.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The development of sustainable domestic fisheries to supply healthy and nutritious food is a 

critical pillar of Fiji’s food and nutrition security, but the protection and sustainable management of 

our fisheries sector, as you have heard, is full of challenges, is fraught with challenges.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Some are familiar like the threat of overfishing, others like worsening climate impacts we had 

never imagined. In response, Fiji is building a resilient blue economy, as you may have also heard 

that can sustainably keep food on the table for Fijian families, generate income for our fishermen and 

inspire the world to seek a more harmonious balance with the marine ecosystem.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji can and should be home to the  most prosperous  and sustainable  fisheries sector in the 

</span><span>Pacific.  With that aim, the Ministry has reviewed and implemented rigorous strategies in the three 

</span><span>key fisheries areas – the offshore fisheries, coastal fisheries and aquaculture, taking into account the 

unprecedented impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing climate emergency, both of 

which have challenged how we view fisheries as part of our economy and our one connected global 

ecosystem.  

</span></p>
<p><span>These strategies, Mr. Speaker, which are guided by a fit for purpose legislative framework 

have enforced compliance allowing  for the review of the licensing system, the provision of  better 

advisory  and  support-services  and  of  course  the  conduct  of  appropriate  research  and  marine 

conservation activities, all of which are aligned to the Government’s national priorities and to Fiji’s 

commitment to national conventions.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, not only did the Committee make recommendations to improve the services to 

be delivered by the Ministry, it has also addressed how we can better empower ordinary Fijians who 

rely on the fisheries sector for sustenance and as a source of income. There is an entrepreneurial drive 

within every Fijian, we know that, we have not always had the society that recognises and rewards 

that ambition but in recent years we have worked to empower innovators across society including in 

the fisheries sector to turn resource owners into business owners.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As  the  Minister  responsible  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  I  am  very  keen  to  see this  work  continue 

especially  in  light  of  the  economic  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  We  must  seize  every 

opportunity  to  spur  sustainable  domestic  growth  that  we  can.  Through  this  initiative,  customary 

fishing  ground  owners  have  a  pathway  to  collectively  collaborate  in  raising  and  realising  their 

business potential.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  by  permanently  enshrining  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  people’s  ownership  of  their  land  and 

fishing ground in the Constitution, this Government has done more to protect the sacred rites of the 

</span><span>iTaukei</span><span> than any other and we have done more for </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> fishing ground owners with regards to the 

equitable distribution of rental income for </span><span>iqoliqoli</span><span>, royalty payments and widening access rights to 

waters. Since day one, Mr. Speaker, this Government has held an open door to all Fijians, we listened 

to our people’s ideas, we noted concerns, we gave an honest accounting of what would be done and 

then we did it. We implemented changes to address the concerns of resource owners as you will have 

</span><span>heard and we have delivered or we are delivering development that changes lives for the better.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  just  like  so  many  budding  business  owners  in  the  fisheries  sectors,  the 

Government  has  its  sights  on  greater  ambition.  Fiji  has  the  potential  to  become  a  model  blue 

economy. We are leading the world, we are leading the world’s ship towards ocean action. We have 

led by example towards the 2030 goal of 100 percent sustainable management of our ocean with 30 

percent to be declared as marine-protected areas as you have heard from the Minister for Fisheries.  

</span></p>
<p><span>That commitment, Mr. Speaker, is upheld by our recently introduced National Ocean Policy 

which  I  hope  we  will  all  be  familiar  with  by  now.  The  sustainable  management  of  our  fisheries 

obviously plays a key role in that effort. My Government will continue to ensure that the Ministry is 

financially supported to play its key role in delivering on Fiji’s Ocean Action commitments for the 

benefit of fisheries businesses and the communities that count on them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>These  efforts,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  involve  combating  illegal,  unreported  and  unregulated 

fishing,  supporting  fisheries  sector trade  subsidies,  maximising  resource  rent,  building  Fiji’s  food 

security,  harnessing  the  full  potential  of  Fiji’s  aquaculture  and  inshore    industries  through  import 

substitution and diversification, blue carbon trading, marine biodiversity, conservation and disaster 

management. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  work  as  you  have  also  heard,  is  deeply  connected  to  the 

</span><span>industry, to the community and its development partners.  I also commend the Ministry’s efforts to 

preserve the cultural significance of fishing for our people.  As we all know our culture, our tradition, 

values and customs are intimately linked to marine ecosystems.  There is great wisdom in the cultural 

practises of our marine communities, some of these practises protect vulnerable species and allow 

for them to sustainably reproduce. Where  it  make sense, these practises are  being recognised and 

formalised as part of our sustainable management framework. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to decades of ocean degradation, the world’s marine ecosystem do not 

produce the same boundary they once did.  I worry that this generation of young people will not fully 

understand the riches that the ocean can provide them, because they have not seen the full extent of 

its  offerings.      But  through  the  sustainable  of  our  fisheries  and  all  of  Fiji’s  1.3  square  million 

kilometres of ocean, we can do more than stop the degradation.  We can do more than reverse course, 

we can build the strongest and most sustainable blue economy Fiji has ever known, and I look forward 

to working with our resource owners and fisheries businesses to bring that better bluer future within 

reach. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I therefore do support the motion.
