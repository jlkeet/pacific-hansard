<p><span>PRESENTATION OF PAPERS AND CERTAIN DOCUMENTS</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 38(1), I present the 

Mid-Year Fiscal Statement – Actual Expenditure from 1st August, 2020 to 31st January, 2021 to 

Parliament.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Please, hand the Report to the Acting Secretary-General.</p>
<p><span>(Report handed to the Acting Secretary-General) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, please, take note that the Acting Attorney-General and Minister for 

Economy, Civil  Service and Communications has tabled the Mid-Year Fiscal  Statement  –  Actual 

Expenditure from 1st August, 2020 to 31st January, 2021 Report.  The electronic copy of the Report 

will be made available to all Members and uploaded simultaneously on the Parliament website.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  you  will  note  that  there  is  a  slight  change  of  procedure  to  what  is 

prescribed under Standing Order 38.  Unlike the Annual Reports that are referred to the Standing 

Committees, this periodic statement will be circulated for the information of Honourable Members 

only.  The purpose of these statements is to provide periodic updates to Parliament and these may be 

itemised by Honourable Members during debates and utilised by them from a budgetary or financial 

perspective.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On that note, Honourable Members, please, take further note that all periodic statements that 

were  tabled  over  the  years  and  which  were  subsequently  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on 

Public Accounts are hereby retracted from  the Standing Committee, and the Standing Committee 

will not be required to take any further action.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I have been advised that there are no Committee Reports for tabling 

</span></p>
<p><span>today.  We will now proceed to the next item on the Order Paper.   

</span></p>
