<p><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CHAIR 

</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I welcome all Honourable Members to the first Parliament Sitting day</p>
<p><span>for the month of March and I look forward to working with you all during this Session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  also  welcome  all  those  watching  the  live  broadcast  and  the  live  streaming  of  today’s 

proceedings from the comfort of their homes, offices and electronic devices.  Thank you for your 

continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tabling of Committee Report – Deferment of 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the information of all Honourable Members, I have received a request from the Standing 

Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to table its report on the three election-related Bills at 

a later sitting date. These Bills are:

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span><span>(2)</span><span>
</span><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2020 (Bill No. 50/2020); 

Electoral (Registration of Voters) (Amendment) Bill 2020 (Bill No. 51/2020); and 

Political  Parties  (Registration,  Conduct,  Funding  and  Disclosures)  (Amendment)  Bill 

2020 (Bill No. 52/2020). 

</span></p>
<p><span>Pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 11th December, 2020, the Standing Committee 

was to have tabled its report during this sitting period.  However, Honourable Members, please, take 

note that due to increased public interest on the Bills, the Standing Committee intends to undertake 

further consultations before finalising its deliberations and report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I am of the view that this is a valid and justified notion, therefore, with the indulgence of all 

Honourable  Members,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  will  table  its 

report on the three election-related Bills at a later sitting date.     Thank you, Honourable Members. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On  the  next  Agenda  Item,  I  now  call  on  the  Acting  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 

</span></p>
<p><span>Economy, Civil Service and Communications to table his Report.
