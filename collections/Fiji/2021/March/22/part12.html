<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move:</p>
<p><span>That Parliament debates the Examination of Audit Reports on State-Owned Entities 

</span></p>
<p><span>and Statutory Authorities for 2015, which was tabled on 14th</span><span> </span><span>May, 2019.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  now  invite  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public</p>
<p><span>Accounts to speak on his motion.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prime Minister, the Honourable 

Leader  of  the  Opposition,  Honourable  Ministers  and  Honourable  Members  Parliament,  as  the 

Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion with 

regards to the debate on the Public Accounts Committee Review Report on the Audit Report of State-

Owned Entities and Statutory Authority for 2015.  This Report presents our overall analysis of the 

internal  control  of  state-owned  entities  and  other  significant  matters  highlighted  by  the  Auditor-

General which may have an impact on the operation of the entities in future if left unaddressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It was noted that the Report was for the year 2015 and the issues discussed may not be current.  

I wish to highlight that the issues identified in this Reports have either been resolved or are in the 

process  of  being  addressed  as  mentioned  in  the  Report  that  are  before  us  at  committee  stage  for 

scrutiny.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, this Report contains the finding of Committee relating to 18 entities.  The</p>
<p><span>state-owned entities and statutory authorities are as follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji Broadcasting Corporation Limited; 

</span><span>Post Fiji Limited; 

</span><span>Public Rental Board;

<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>705 

</span></p>
<p><span>(18)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Film Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee commends the work of the Auditor-General on the issuance of five modified 

audit opinions for the 2015 Financial Statements that were completed for the various entities and one 

entity was issued with the disclaimer of opinion.  It is important to note that 23 of the 2015 Financial 

Statements of the various State owned entities and statutory authorities that were audited, were issued 

with unmodified audit opinions.  This means that mis-statements were not noted in a majority of the 

entities that were audited.  

</span></p>
<p><span>State  owned  entities  are  basically  Government  Commercial  Companies  (GCCs)  and  these 

entities  should  make  profits  and  give  dividends  back  to  the  government  as  sole  or  majority 

shareholder.  Whilst certain entities have evolved over the years and overturned losses into profits, 

there are still some entities such as FRA, Fijian Elections Office and Higher Education Commission 

that  do  not  operate  to  make  profit,  but  rather  provide  service  of  its  international  standard  for  the 

benefit of every Fijian.   

</span></p>
<p><span>One needs to know that some of these entities, just two decades ago, were not making a single 

cent as profit.  I, therefore, would like to thank the CEOs, Boards and Board Directors for turning 

losses into profits, for example, Post Fiji Limited.  Please note, when internet and email was not much 

in use, the people used to resort to letter writing and rely on the Post Office and Post Box and the 

profit used to be around half  a million dollars, two decades ago for Post Fiji Limited.   In today’s era 

when everyone uses email, there is a 70 to 90 percent decrease in the use of Post Box and revenue, 

as people hardly use the Post Box.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The CEO, Dr. Anirudha Bansod, has overturned the company under his leadership making a 

profit  worth  $2.3  million  which  is  a  tremendous  achievement,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    This  was  done 

through  diversification  that  on  one  side  when  revenue  was  going  down,  on  the  other  side  the 

introduction of new business opportunities saw businesses thrive.  We salute CEOs like Dr. Anirudha 

of Post Fiji Limited; Mr. Hasmukh Patel of EFL; late Mr. Faiz Khan of Airports Fiji Limited; Mr. 

Riyaz Sayed-Khaiyum of FBC; Mr. Raj Sharma of Copra Millers of Fiji and Fiji Rice and Acting 

CEO of FRA, Mr. Kamal Prasad, for their dedication towards State-owned entities.   It is indeed a 

pleasure to acknowledge them in debate today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>While on one side, we do acknowledge the fact that these entities are doing above par, the 

Committee needs to keep these entities on their toes to ensure that their performance continues.  The 

</span><span>Committee noted that there were a few control issues within the entities included in this Report which 

</span><span>indicates that operation of these entities are improving.  I wish to highlight the common findings of 

the Committee; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>There have been issues in terms of internal controls or inventory of WAF.  The response 

from WAF revealed that the Authority conducts independent quarterly stock takes in all 

its stores and each storeman is held accountable for any unresolved variances.  The stock 

take procedures and processes have been put in place for inventory requests and issuance 

of stock.  Stock acquisition are authorised by the supervisors and the team leaders.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Plants and equipment not insured, was another significant issue for WAF.  Sir, WAF in 

</span><span>its response has stated that Erasito Beca Consultant Limited was commissioned by WAF 

to assist the reinstatement value of critical asset for insurance purpose.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This exercise was completed in April 2019.  Insurance valuation has been provided by 

</span><span>the consultant on the asset including building, plant and equipment on an as is where is

</span></p>
<p><span>(4)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>basis. WAF is currently in the process of getting quotes from its brokers, Marsh Pte. Ltd 

for  these  critical  sites.  Due  to  the  substantial  value  involved  as  per  the  valuation,  the 

brokers have approached insurers based on first loss limit policy restricting cover to fire 

and earthquake impact.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Airports Fiji had issues relating to the fixed asset verification.  Airports Fiji, in its response 

has confirmed that they have successfully completed revaluation of fixed assets. After 

receiving the verification report from Erasito Beca, Airports Fiji engaged an independent 

audit firm, Ernst &amp; Young, to provide an assurance on the accounting treatment of the 

report. The report clearly identifies each asset as description, life of the asset, category, 

rate of depreciation and location by the airport.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sugar Industry Tribunal had issues relating to fixed assets. The entity has responded to 

the Committee’s recommendation stating that the fixed asset register is now updated with 

all  machinery  and  equipment  written  off  which  were  not  used  in  business  operation. 

Generally,  it  is  pleasing  to  note  that  these  entities  have  taken  the  Committee’s 

recommendation positively and are working towards resolving its issues and gaps that 

were identified during the time of audit.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  I  commend  the  effort  of  the  Members  of  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  in  the 

compilation of this Report and most importantly, to the State-Owned Entities and statutory authorities 

in taking the Committee’s recommendations positively and working towards improving the issues 

raised by the Office of the Auditor-General.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with those comments, as the Member moving the motion for the debate of</p>
<p><span>this Public Accounts Committee Report, I thank you for this opportunity. </span><span>Vinaka. </span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Chairperson of the Standing Committee:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this issue and I give the floor to 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Honourable Aseri Radrodro. You have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  As  a  Member  of  the  Public 

Accounts Committee, I would like to make a contribution in terms of the motion before the House.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am privileged to be a part of the Public Accounts Committee and like all 

</span><span>other Members of the Committee, we take our role very seriously. The Public Accounts Committee 

is  usually  referred  to  in  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the 

mother of all committees of parliament and so, given the various issues this Report covers as well as 

others that will be tabled later in this House, I will reiterate and urge the Government to reconsider 

the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association benchmark as to have a Member of the Opposition 

chair this important Committee … 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.:</span> … and to allow for better, transparent and efficient scrutiny of</p>
<p><span>Government spending, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would like to start by saying that one of the most serious concerns of aCommittee  when  reviewing  this  Report  is  noting  that  a  number  of  entities  that  the  Office  of  theAuditor-General previously used to audit are now opting to be audited by private auditing firms and</p>
<p><a name="68">Page 68</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>707 

</span></p>
<p><span>this is very concerning. This practice eliminates the opportunity for this august House to scrutinise 

the manner in which these entities have utilised taxpayers’ money. It could have been forgiven if 

these entities are funded entirely by their own resources, however, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be funded 

through  Government  grant,  there  is  no  exception  and  the  most  prudent  way  to  ensure  good 

governance is maintained by those using taxpayer’s funds is to allow for parliamentary scrutiny as 

we are the representatives of our people in this august House.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the failure in not allowing the Office of the Auditor-General to scrutinise 

these  entities  opens  the  door  to  a  lot  of  anomalies,  possible  corruption,  collusions  and  a  lack  of 

guidance.  These practices, in fact, is already highlighted in these reports, so hopefully it is not the 

reason why some of these entities have opted to go for private auditing firms, instead of the Office 

of the Auditor-General. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also must be noted that it is not the right to continue to have a lot of these 

various entities still under the Public Enterprise Act, years after they have undergone reform and yet 

not  allow  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to  scrutinise  their  books  and  systems  to  ensure  the 

intention  of  the  reforms  have  been  realised  and  I  urge  that  as  long  as  these  entities  are  being 

supplemented through Government grants, the Office of the Auditor- General must be allowed to 

audit them, so it allows for Parliament scrutiny and debates of their books and functions. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  always  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  Government  is  in  a  position  whereby  it  sets 

benchmarks and once we allow private auditing firm without public scrutiny of public funds and be 

prepared to set dangerous precedence not only for the current Government but for future governments 

as well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have learnt from the past where such entities like the Fiji Sugar Corporation, Air Terminal 

Services and Fiji Airways chose private firms to conduct their audits and in doing so, the people of 

this nation were not aware of the earning business environment that they  were encountering until 

very late.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Today, entities like the National Centre for Small and Micro Enterprise, Fiji Airways, Fiji 

Pine Limited and many more similar entities are again choosing private auditing firms.  Whilst these 

auditing firms are reputable, the point is, without the Office of the Auditor-General’s involvement, 

we do not get to scrutinise these entity’s reports in this august House.  It is crucial that Parliament is 

allowed to scrutinise and question public spending on behalf of taxpayers to ensure prudent use of 

</span><span>Government resources for the equal benefit of all our people. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the 2015 reports, as time may be a little bit of a question in terms of how 

we are debating now and how have they been addressed, I expect some of the responses from that 

side to update us on how these audit issues have been addressed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I will start with Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC) Mr. Speaker, Sir.  For FBC, it was 

noted that Government grants were treated as revenue instead of capital equity and fortunately it was 

explained that this was a result of a Cabinet decision taken in 2012 which was later rescinded in 2016 

to be compliant with the International Financial Reporting and Accounting Standards (IFRS).  This 

</span><span>is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet needs to engage professional people who  are equipped with the 

</span><span>right  financial  background  to  provide  guidance  on  Government  policies  because  this  is  a  classic 

example of ill-informed policy advice. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, it is commendable that entities make amendments when anomalies are notedby the Office of the Auditor-General.  This is the whole reason why the Office of the Auditor-General</p>
<p><a name="69">Page 69</a></p>
<p><span>708 

</span></p>
<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>must scrutinise entities assisted by Government.  It is important to note that the functions of the daily 

corporate governance of an entity is very sensitive business which can grow or collapse entities due 

to simple accounting reporting anomalies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while still on FBC, I note that additional issues like asset impairment have 

been  highlighted  in  FBC’s  auditing  relating  to  projects  that  were  undertaken  by  the  company 

regarding the digitisation of television operations in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government has been providing FBC annual grants from the budget estimates to provide 

television services and in simple terms, what these impairments indicates is that the entity cannot 

determine how much revenue it will generate and collect from these digitisation projects. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were in the Lomaiviti and Yasawas a couple of weeks ago 

and it was a pleasure to see very clear FBC television reception in these areas through the  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>

platform and I commend Government for that.  However, in many other areas in Viti Levu like Serea, 

Waidina,  Lutu,  Muaira  and  Waibasaga  Villages,  where  we  used  to  enjoy  television  and  mobile 

connectivity, we now have major disruptions, Mr. Speaker, and to have good television connectivity, 

we now have to construct very long home-made antennas.  I urge FBC to speed up the work that they 

are doing to allow the accessibility of coverage.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF), I note similar reporting anomalies like the 

FBC  emanating  from  a  Cabinet  decision  that  show  Government  grants  being  reported  as  capital 

contributions.  The Office of the Auditor-General reported that this was against best international 

reporting  financial  practices.    Mr.  Speaker,  we  commend  the  assurances  by  MSAF  that  these 

anomalies would be rectified in the 2016 Audit and which I trust has now occurred.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, it is now imperative that I address the very important role that the Fiji Institute 

of Accountants play in these reporting entities.  In both these entities, the accounting of Government 

grants became confused as a result of conflicting financial reporting guidelines, which is ridiculous 

at  Government  level.  Government  should  ensure  that  any  changes  which  is  recommended  for 

adoption by such entities like the Fiji Institute of Accountants should engage full consultation with 

Government and Government institutions prior to it being implemented, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), the Committee noted that WAF had recorded in its 

books revenue on water and sewerage charges of $32 million which included outstanding receipts on 

</span><span>water  and  sewerage  charges  of  $10  million.  The  OAG  had  highlighted  that  WAF  is  merely  a 

</span><span>collecting agent of Government and cannot record such revenue as belonging to the entity.   I trust 

that this matter has been resolved, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The OAG has also highlighted the need to conduct a valuation exercise on WAF’s property, 

plant and equipment amounting to $1.8 billion for the year 31st December, 2010 and this is to truly  

reflect Government’s assets and liabilities.  With the current ailment of water supply, it is prudent 

that WAF conducts its valuation exercise to allow for a problematic areas that are being affected by 

constant water disruptions, which is now an ongoing annual event, particularly during drought.  When 

will Fiji’s water woes be resolved, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is the question I beg for the Honourable 

</span><span>Minister to provide an answer to?  

</span></p>
<p><span>The immense budgetary allocation poured yearly into WAF should see issues being resolved, 

not  continuing  with  the  definite  solution  insight.    The  Government  must  remember  that  our 

</span><span>communities, especially our mothers are struggling daily to fetch water for cooking and washing.  

</span><span>Imagine  those  with  toddlers,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  imagine  the  old  and  vulnerable,  water  disruptions

</span></p>
<p><span>709 

</span></p>
<p><span>becomes a hygiene and health issue.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, access to treated water is a constitutional right 

and we cannot afford to play havoc with Government policies in this regard.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On  a  side  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  would  be  appreciative  if  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Infrastructure enlightens this House on what WAF is doing to address the sewer  water leaking at 

Kabara Street in Samabula, which the residents are complaining not only about the sewer water leak, 

but the unbearable stench associated with it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), audit noted discrepancies in accounting for fixed assets whereby 

reconciliations were not done. These are basic accounting processes that needs to be conducted by 

any executive in organisations.  Consequently, deferred income reconciliations recorded for donation 

assets are not adjusted on a timely basis for revaluation and disposal of the donated assets.  Also the 

fixed assets register at the time of the audit had not been updated to record the revaluation perform 

for property, plant and equipment.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The revelation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the audit is very disconcerting and now grasp the depth 

of  abeyance  left  behind  due  to  the  poor  policy  decisions  at  the  time  of  reform  of  Public  Works 

Department into the entities, MWH and FRA, whereby the two existed together at the initial stage, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir. Who is to be held accountable for that poor policy decision is yet to be determined 

given, Mr. Speaker, Sir, millions was lost as a result of the duplication which is now being done by 

FRA without any need for MWH.  No wonder the depots are left in derelict condition. If these entities 

are unable to understand what the assets of FRA are, I make this point, Mr. Speaker, because Public 

Works Department (PWD) used to be one of the best-meant entities of Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In my last trip to Lomaiviti, we came across issues raised by villagers who requested that this 

be  raised  in  this  august  House.    For  instance,  they  are  asking  Government’s  assistance  for  the 

completion of their playing ground in Sawaieke, Gau, as well as the repairs of their roads and ailing 

depots. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  sad  that  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  checks  all 

Government spending every year in processes which is called an audit by carrying out annual audits, 

the Office of the Auditor-General assists Parliament to hold and call to account all persons interested 

with management of public funds and resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We, the Members of this august House, will come and go, in fact some of us will not be here 

</span><span>in the next Parliament term. What is important is the legacy that we leave behind with respect to the 

</span><span>sustainability of our governance structure, and therefore, Mr. Speaker, I support the motion before 

the House. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member:</span> Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.</p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Every time we have a debate on Public 

Accounts Committee (PAC), I am always saddened when I remember the way it was.  The way it 

was, Mr. Speaker, was that the Opposition would appoint the Chairperson to the Committee, and this 

was how we set out in 2014, and this was the practice observed in the majority of the Commonwealth 

</span><span>countries.

</span></p>
<p><span>auditor as in PAC and lo and behold, FijiFirst was getting very, very uncomfortable with the way 

things were happening because they were very thorough in the way they were scrutinising the reports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The work of the FijiFirst Government, Mr. Speaker, they changed the Standing Order to say 

that the Committee Members of five will decide on the Chairperson.  Now, they have three in the 

Committee  and  two  on  this  side  so  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  lost  the  chairmanship  of  that 

Committee.  It was a sad day for Fiji that we decided that FijiFirst like I have always characterised 

as the tyranny of the majority, abused its power to change what should have been a normal part of 

Parliamentary democracy.  That is the story about Public Accounts Committee.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject)

<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, Order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  When  the  Prime  Minister  of  New  Zealand,  Honourable  Sir  John 

Phillip Key came, I was invited to sit with the Leader, Honourable Kepa, at that time when he came 

to the Opposition Office.  We thanked him for bringing or helping Fiji to come back to Parliament 

democracy.    New  Zealand  was  very  instrumental  in  helping  us,  like  Australia,  but  we  said, 

“Honourable Prime Minister, unfortunately the bars for Parliament have been set very, very low” and 

he  appreciated  that.    I  was  thinking  he  went  back  and  tried  very  hard  to  bring  the  bar  up  in  our 

Parliament.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I guess it will have to wait for a SODELPA Office to bring up parliamentary 

democracy in this country in the way it should be.  That, Mr. Speaker, is the way Fiji should be.  No 

more of this abuse of power that the people of Fiji were noticing.  They noticed all these.  Remember, 

they have 32 seats, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We had 15 from SODELPA and 3 from NFP.  What happened 

in 2018?  They came down to 27, they came up to 24 and the difference between FijiFirst and all the 

Opposition was only 147 votes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It was all that because the people of Fiji saw the abuse, they knew 

what  democracy  is  like  and  they  wanted  true  democracy  to  come  into  your  Parliament.  

Unfortunately, there was inclement weather during voting and a lot of people were demotivated to 

come to vote because they just thought that Parliament was a circus at that time, but we will change 

</span><span>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Member, just stick to the Report.  We are not talking about</p>
<p><span>what happened in the last Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I just thought I will put a bit of background 

to PAC, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, in the Report here, we are talking about Film Fiji, and I am worried that 

it is not effective in the conduct of its operation.  Are they properly structured?  Are they properly 

resourced?  Because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I come from the West.  In the Mamanuca, Yasawa, a lot of 

filming  is  happening  in  there  and  a  lot  of  complaints  are  coming  from  the  people.    The  resource 

</span><span>owners are not getting a fair return for the use of their resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In one particular year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they were not allowed to fish, walk or sail in a part 

of a lagoon there, and they were paid a sum of money which came down to about $60 per head.  They 

</span><span>gave away so much but they were not properly compensated and I have often said many times - can

<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>711 

</span></p>
<p><span>we coordinate between Film Fiji and NLTB and decide on a rate that is equitable, not something that 

is almost ad hoc in the way they do it, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As  we  speak  about  resources  in  that  part  of  the  world  or  in  the  marine  resources  or  for 

entertainment, I am always reminded about the Surfing Decree for Tavarua.  Through FijiFirst, the 

people of Nabila and Momi have lost more than $10 million since the Surfing Decree was introduced 

by the regime and by FijiFirst.  Here we have, Mr. Speaker.... 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order.  Mr. Speaker Sir, as the Chairperson who has 

moved the motion, I would just like to bring to your attention that the Surfing Decree has nothing to 

do with the Report that is before the Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Member has been talking about the chairmanship, membership of the PAC 

Committee, et cetera.  Now, he has gone to the Surfing Decree, Surfing Act which is not part of this 

Report.  We request him to actually stick to the Report and talk about the Report which is before the 

Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> You have heard me very clearly when I asked him to stick to the Report</p>
<p><span>and I have just asked him that.  You do not have to remind me - stick to the Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What I am saying here is that when a 

huge part of the equation is to properly reward or properly compensate the resources owners in the 

use of their resources, Film Fiji is a huge part of that so basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the focus should 

be on being equitable.  Here, we have a people who normally categorise as “cash poor”, why would 

you remove $10 million from them over 10 years?  Here are people who are crying out for a formula 

that can be understood by all when they give up their resources for filming yet Government continues 

to behave in a very ad hoc manner.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I continue to be saddened by all these and I am glad that we will have the 

opportunity to debate on this today and I am very concerned with the way Film Fiji is structured.  I 

think it is not properly resourced, I think it should do a much better job in rewarding, compensating 

the resource owners when they come and film in Fiji.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  I give the floor to the Honourable Qionibaravi:</span> You have the</p>
<p><span>floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.-. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion 

before the House, on the Examination of Audit Report on State-Owned Entities and Statutory Authorities 

for 2015.  I would like to thank Mr. Chairman and Honourable Members of the Standing Committee on 

Public Accounts for their work in examining these entities and their Report to the august House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is pleasing to note that on page 5 of the Report, the Committee has made a 

comment that they found significant work has been undertaken to address issues raised in the audit.  It is 

clear that entities have taken the audit review process seriously and instigated processes to implement 

accepted recommendations.  Such recommendations will take time to fully action or are being addressed 

</span><span>through implementation of larger projects.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I also note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statement also on page 5, where the Committee noted that entities 

which had been issued unqualified opinions or clean opinions, have various control issues which had 

</span><span>been recurring in previous audit reports, and warranted the Committee’s scrutiny. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>As such, the Committee resolved to hear from relevant agencies, which had been both qualified 

and unqualified.  I would like to congratulate the Committee for continuing to scrutinise both entities that 

have been given unmodified opinions or certified opinions as well, as for those who had been given 

qualified opinions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I note further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at page 7 of their Report, that 29 audit opinions were issued by 

the OAG on the 2015 Financial Statement on State-Owned Entities as at 31st October, 2017.  Out of the 

29 opinions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, five were modified opinions or qualified opinions which means, that the 

auditors having obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence, concluded that misstatements individually 

or in the aggregate are material but not pervasive to the financial statements, or the auditors are unable to 

obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base their opinions.  But the auditor concludes 

that the possible effects on the Financial Statements of undetected misstatements, if any could be material 

but not pervasive.  

</span></p>
<p><span>These five entities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, includes the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation Limited (FBCL), 

Post Fiji Limited, Public Rental Board, Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji and the Water Authority of Fiji.  

I was going to speak briefly on the FBCL Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but the first speaker from this side of 

the House has elaborated enough comments on the FBCL Report.  However, I would like to just state a 

fact that, given the success and losses at FBCL, it is still surprising that the CEO and staff continue to 

receive year end performance bonuses.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to one entity that received a disclaimer of opinion from the Auditor-

General.  The Auditor-General gave a disclaimer of opinion to one entity, which is one out of the 29 

accounts which were audited.  The  disclaimer  of opinion is the  worst of the three types of modified 

opinions.  It simply means that the auditors are unable to obtain sufficient, appropriate audit evidence on 

which  to  base  their  opinions  and  conclude  that  the  possible  effects  of  the  Financial  Statements  of 

undetected misstatements, if any, could be both material and pervasive. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in relation to the National Substance Abuse Advisory Council Report for 

the year ended 31st December, 2015.  The OAG noted that the Financial Statements of the Council must 

be prepared in accordance with international standards for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and that 

the Council is yet to comply with this requirement.  It reported that the Council has agreed to improve 

internal controls and adopt the required financial reporting framework from 2016.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have a backlog and debating reports from six years, 

</span><span>but we are hopeful that the extra sitting week in May will enable this House to catch up and be up to date 

</span><span>so that we are debating current rather than outdated reports on government entities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The good news, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that 23 out of the 29 accounts were issued with unmodified 

opinions,  which  is  79  percent  of  the  total  reports  that  were  examined  by  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee. That is a very good progress and we look forward to the day when all audited accounts 

of State-Owned Entities will be given unmodified opinions or unqualified opinions which both mean 

certified opinions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Be that as it may, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am concerned that 11 out of the 29 have, by way of the 

</span><span>requirements of the Companies Act or by the resolution of their own boards, elected other chartered 

</span><span>accounting firms to audit their accounts. These entities are listed on pages 50 and 51 of the main 

report and comprise of the following entities:

</span></p>
<p><span>Government holds shares in these companies which are listed in this category or is providing 

budgetary allocation to maintain the principal activities of these entities and these include the last 

four in the list which I have just read.  I am concerned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the audited accounts of 

these  companies  and  entities  are  not  being  scrutinised  by  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and 

submitted to Parliament to be debated on behalf of the people of this nation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Public  Accounts  Committee  is  mandated  to  examine  accounts  of  Government  of  the 

Republic of Fiji in respect of each financial year and reports of the Office of the Auditor-General and 

for any other matter relating to the expenditure of the Government or any related body or activity 

directly or indirectly that it sees fit to review.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Public  funds,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  been  injected  to  these  companies  and  their  audited 

accounts should also be scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee and tabled to the House for 

debate.  It is the people of Fiji through Government hold majority or significant shareholding in these 

entities, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The fact that taxpayer funds allocated to these entities in the form of grants 

or  in  the  form  of  loan  guarantees  approved  by  this  august  House  requires  public  scrutiny  of  the 

performance of these entities to be accountable for the public funds they are granted and the fact that 

the board of directors are appointed by the Minister for Economy and Public Enterprises and that the 

people of Fiji hold significant or controlling shares in these entities.  For example, the Fiji Sugar 

Corporation (FSC), the millions of dollars which the Government has continued to inject into the 

FSC.  Its  accounts  should  be  audited  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  and  scrutinised  by  the 

Public Accounts Committee.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my colleagues have addressed the House on the increasing level of poverty 

and that situation. The reality of the matter is that, our country is falling into vicious cycle of poverty 

</span><span>and debt  trap.   It  is  all the more reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Office of the  Auditor-General 

</span><span>should audit the accounts of all State-owned entities to enable the Public Accounts Committee and 

this  august  House  to  scrutinise  its  performances  and  use  of  public  monies  and  Government 

guarantees.   

</span></p>
<p><span>With the reduction of Government revenue collection by 50 percent, there is the expectation 

that  all  Government  investments  should  be  contributing  to  Government  coffers  in  an  effort  to 

enlighten Government’s burden to deliver on its charge to ensure the good governance and wellbeing 

of the people of this nation. Unfortunately, we have some lame dark performers who continue to 

chew our public funds and take loan after loan guaranteed by the people of Fiji through this august 

</span><span>House.  

</span></p>
<p><span>All those loan guarantees, Mr. Speaker, Sir, constitute and contribute to the liability of the 

people of Fiji as they comprise and jerk up  the contingent liability for our future generations because 

</span><span>if these entities fail and cannot repay their loans, it is the taxpayers who will have to repay these

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>exorbitant loans.  The vicious debt trap that the Government has put this nation on, constitute a threat 

to the future of our nation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as such, the reality of the matter is that, Fiji is falling into a vicious cycle of 

poverty and debt trap. It is also high time that the grants allocated annually in the National Budget to 

these entities are reviewed, whether they are necessary or a waste of public monies, particularly if 

the entities are already profitable. I thank you, Sir, and I support the motion before the House.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you and I now give the floor to the Honourable Professor Prasad:</span></p>
<p><span>You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I thought the Acting Minister for Economy was ready</p>
<p><span>but anyway, thank you, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>My colleagues, all three of them, have quite eloquently raised many issues so I am not going 

to talk about these specific entities.  But I do want to pick on a number of points and if you look at 

Page 8 of the Report, basically, I want to pick on the issue of delay in submission of draft accounts 

for audits.  All draft accounts submitted were incomplete, relevant information, record note provided 

for audit on a timely basis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But before I go on to this, I just wanted to correct the Honourable Minister for Fisheries when 

he  was  interjecting  from  the  other  side.    In  fact,  he  was  the  Member  of  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee when I was the Chairman, Mr. Speaker, and he was absolutely a fabulous Member of the 

Committee.  He was doing a very good job, but he forgot that the old Standing Order and that was 

the only Standing Committee which said that the Chairman of that Committee would be from the 

Opposition.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, this Government did not like the work that, that Committee was doing at that 

time, but with the help of Government members, that Standing Order was changed in Parliament.  

But more importantly, relevant to this Report, Mr. Speaker, is this, when they changed the Standing 

Order,  they  actually  changed  the  provision  which  stated  the  brief  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 

Public Accounts and I want to just read that.  Just the whole Standing Order 109(d), it says, and I 

quote:   

</span></p>
<p><span>“(d)   Standing Committee on Public Accounts – including examining the accounts of 

</span><span>the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  in  respect  of  each  financial  year  and  

</span><span>reports  of  the  Auditor-General,  and  for  any  other  matter  relating  to  the 

expenditures of the Government of the Republic of Fiji or any related body or 

activity (whether directly or indirectly) that the Committee sees fit to review....”   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  was  the  original.    What  was  added  in  this  provision  that  the  Committee  must  only 

examine how public money has been dealt with and accounted for in accordance with the written 

law, and must not examine the merits of the underlined policy that informs public spending.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My   colleague, Honourable Radrodro, quite  clearly stated the role of the Public Accounts 

</span><span>Committee, Mr. Speaker, and in most Commonwealth countries, with the exception of one or two or 

</span><span>maybe a few more, all of them have the Opposition as the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee.  

And one other important role that the Public Accounts Committee plays, Mr. Speaker, is that they 

not  only    wait  for  the  reports  to  come  to  Parliament  before  they  actually  examine  it,  in  many 

</span><span>commonwealth countries, the Public Accounts Committee takes a very active role in ensuring that 

</span><span>the public funds are properly utilised.  In some countries, when they have big projects, I mean, if you

<p><a name="76">Page 76</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>715 

</span></p>
<p><span>have a statutory organisation like FRA, where we allocate, not millions but billions of dollars, in 

those kind of situations the Committee actually looks at periodically how the money is spent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For example, we are told that the new four lane road in Denarau initially the cost stipulated 

was $66 million but we ended up spending $166 million.   I mean, the horse had halted, it is too late 

for the Public Accounts Committee to look at how the expenditure has not been properly utilised, so 

the  value  for  money  is  very  important  for  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  and  that  is  why  this 

provision, Mr. Speaker, does not allow the Public Accounts Committee to actually question some of 

the policies because the policies and the regulations can actually have a serious implication on how 

the money is used.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is very important, and this is why Honourable Radrodro said quite rightly, that the Public 

Accounts Committee is the mother of all Standing Committees because that Committee is charged 

by Parliament which is the supreme oversight institution to actually ensure that every dollar that is 

spent by Government, brings value for money.  Now, I heard the Chairman of the Committee talked 

about some of the successes.  Well, Mr. Speaker, that may be true but we also need to understand 

that many of these commercial companies and statutory entities have had increases in fees, charges 

in the way they operate.  Some of the profit they made is a reflection of what the people have been 

paying, for example, the departure tax for Fiji  is  probably one of the highest amongst  those high 

charged countries elsewhere.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The final point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, is in this Report and Honourable Radrodro 

also highlighted this, which says the Committee expressed concerns that other significant findings 

arising from audit of entities for which the Auditor-General is no longer the external auditor, cannot 

be reported to Parliament under the current legislative framework.  This is, Mr. Speaker, a serious 

dereliction of duty, I would say by this Parliament, and by this Government, for allowing that kind 

of situation where the Auditor-General is not allowed to audit entities where Government gives grant. 

For  example,  we  guaranteed  the  loan  that  Fiji  Airways  takes,  FSC  we  guaranteed  the  loan.  Mr. 

Speaker, this is why it is very important and I think that the Committee made the right observation. 

I am glad that the Committee actually picked that up.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On top of that, Mr. Speaker, if you look at it, there is a provision for special audits.  At any 

time,  the  Auditor-General  can  ask  for  a  special  audit.    I  know  under  section  72  of  the  Finance 

Instruction 2010, the Permanent Secretary must authorise the conduct of any audit of all budget sector 

agencies.  That provision, Mr. Speaker, some two years or three years back, I do not have the exact 

</span><span>date, but that section 72 was changed by the Attorney-General  and the Minister for Economy’s office  

</span><span>and the new paragraph was stated and I want to read that. The new paragraph states that the Permanent 

Secretary for Finance must not authorise an audit of an independent office, unless the audit has been 

requested in writing by the responsible authority of the independent office. 

</span></p>
<p><span> What it means, Mr. Speaker, that if there has to be a special audit, then the entity itself will 

have to request, for example, the Chairman of Media Industry Development Authority of Fiji (MIDA) 

or the Human Rights Commission, as an independent institution or the Elections Office.  If there is a 

need for a special audit, they will have to request. The Auditor-General and the Permanent Secretary 

for Finance cannot authorise the special audit.  This is something that we, as a Parliament, need to 

</span><span>think through carefully.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, I tried to make sense of the expenditure, for example, with the FRA and 

if you look at the last two years or three years  and what is the total expenditure, you look at what 

</span><span>has happened in terms of the actual output, then you can figure it out.  You leave the civil service 

</span><span>salary aside, but if you look at the total government expenditure apart from the civil service salary, I

</span></p>
<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>would estimate that between 30 percent to 40 percent of the expenditure is wasted.  I think the wastage 

would be about 30 percent to 40 percent and I would actually say to the Government that they should 

have an independent commission of inquiry and look at the value for money into some of the projects 

that have already been undertaken, and some of the expenditure that has already been done in the last 

few years, and look at whether we have the value for money. 

</span></p>
<p><span>This is why when people are looking at the budget for FRA, they are saying, “where is the 

money gone? Why are we not having this?” It is the value for money and that is why this provision 

in this Standing Order. Mr. Speaker, this needs to change and it should give more teeth  to the Public 

Accounts Committee so that they are able to question not only the actual provision in the Financial 

Act,  where  basically  you  look  at  how  much  money  has  gone,  what  has  been  spent,  whether  the 

receipts are there and whether it is recorded or not recorded.  These are normal audit issues in every 

account, every year, but more important than that, Mr. Speaker, is the value for money and that is 

what is the Public Accounts Committee and this Parliament ought to look at.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  would  respectfully  submit,  Mr.  Speaker  to  the  Government  and  to  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee Members to actually look at recommending the change in this Standing Order; look at 

recommending change in the provisions.  Why are some entities which receive Government Grants 

not being audited by the Office of the Auditor-General and why are those Reports not submitted to 

Parliament?  We have raised this in the past in regards to Fiji Airways, Mr. Speaker.  We have been 

saying that those Annual Reports must end up in Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I have no issues, Mr. Speaker, now that the Standing Order is there for a Government Member 

to  chair  this  Committee.  I  have  no  doubt  on  the  integrity  and  the  capability  of  the  Honourable 

Maharaj, but I think the Committee, to begin with, needs to be given proper legislative authority, 

proper resources, proper administrative authority to analyse expenditures and make sure that we as 

taxpayers of this country get value for money. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Thank you, Honourable Professor Prasad. Honourable Nawaikula,  you</p>
<p><span>have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak 

to this motion.  The motion, of course, is for the House to examine the Audit Report on State-Owned 

Entities and Statutory Authorities for 2015.  That is the subject of the Parliamentary Paper No. 80 of 

2018.  The Audit Report is also contained as Parliamentary Paper No.128 of 2017.  I have seen that 

</span><span>basically what the Public Accounts Committee has done is to uplift the recommendations in the Audit 

</span><span>Report and take it as its own, which is good.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Agreeing with Honourable Professor Prasad and Honourable Adi Qionibaravi, I think we all 

suggested  the  first  oversight  of  the  Honourable  Maharaj  Committee  is  to  recommend  that  other 

entities of Government come under its scrutiny.  In the Auditor’s Report, Mr. Speaker, these entities 

which is contained at Page 15, defines the types of Government agencies and it says, commercial 

companies,  Government  Statutory  Authorities  and  majority-owned  entities.    So,  it  is  imperative 

therefore  that  all  institutions  that  come  under  that  definition  including  specifically  Fiji  Sugar 

Corporation and Fiji Airways, should come under the scrutiny of this Committee.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I say that, Mr. Speaker,  because it is  important  that these entities  should not  come to  this 

House and beg this House for a loan or for guarantee if this House does not scrutinise their books.  I 

am speaking in particular to Fiji Sugar Corporation and Fiji Airways.   Imagine, Mr. Speaker, we 

</span><span>guaranteed $455 million for Fiji Airways.  We have given another $20 million to this company but 

</span><span>we have not looked at their books.  Our auditor has not looked at the books of Fiji Airways and it is

<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>717 

</span></p>
<p><span>a peculiar company where the planes or the property which is the subject of the company is owned 

by someone else, Waqavuka Holdings.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  spent  some  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  in  December  to  try  to  trace  down  the  ownership  of  this 

company Waqavuka Holdings and it led me to an address and a few individuals in Ireland.  Now, if 

the books of Fiji Airways was also subjected to the scrutiny of the Office of the Auditor-General it 

would have told us whether it is a good idea for us to be guaranteeing a debt where the subject matter 

of the property is owned by someone else.  This is where I wish to commend the Office of the Auditor-

General because when I look at FBC, there are some entities that the Auditor-General audits directly.  

There are others like FBC for example where they choose to be audited by private auditors but all 

the same, the Auditor-General scrutinises it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One good example is FBC.  When you look at the FBC Annual accounts and the comments 

of the Auditor-General, it is very hard for me to find out the reservations that they made as opposed 

to the Auditor-General.  The Auditor-General was very specific in saying that the grant that was made 

to FBC is not correct but looking at its Annual Report by its independent or private auditor, it is very 

very hard. So, that is where I recommend that all these entities are subjected to the Auditor-General 

and subjected to the Parliamentary Accounts Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I will come back to the FBC later when I look into these books.  Looking at the Auditor-

General’s recommendation, if I can talk further on FBC.  The recommendation for FBC is contained 

in  page  9  of  Honourable  Maharaj’s  Committee  report  and  it  says  (this  is  taken  from  Auditor-

General’s Report on 2015 for the same company) and if I can quote; “the audit of the 2015 accounts 

of the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation resulted in the issuance of an audit opinion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Coming down it says, “By following the  government circular  requiring  FBCL to  treat  the 

government  grant  received  as  a  capital  contribution,  FBCL  did  not  comply  with  international 

accounting standards.  Now, that came out very clearly to me after reading this as opposed to my 

reading the private auditors report. This company chose to have their Annual Report set at the back, 

of their auditors report.  This is very clear to me as opposed to what their private auditor said.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee asked them for their FBC’s comment and they gave their comment and the 

Committee  concluded  by  saying  this  and  I  quote,  “finally  taking  into  consideration  the  cabinet 

decision  of  2016  all  FBCL  Report  are  prepaid  in  compliance  with  IFRS  and  IAS”.    They  said  it 

complied but that is not to be Mr. Speaker, if you read the following years of the Auditor-General’s 

</span><span>Report on FBC and if I can refer to that.  So, the very next year, when the recommendation was made 

</span><span>the Auditor-General also had the opportunity to relook at its books and it made this observation - also 

a modified opinion.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It says that the company accounted for all government grants received from 1st January, 2016 

as a capital contribution.  This is a departure from IAS 20.  So, there is a contradiction there and the 

good thing that I wish to say here is Mr. Speaker, is that it came about because of the Auditor-General 

and the work of the PAC Committee allowing as it should, jurisdiction or authority to scrutinise and 

audit all government entities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, I am saying here specifically that this would have happened if it looked at the books of 

</span><span>Fiji Airways and it also looked at the books of FSC.  For the second reason as I have clearly submitted 

that no company should come to this House and beg the nation for a loan or for guarantee unless this 

House and the Auditor-General scrutinises its book.  Thank you.

</span></p>
<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Nawaikula:</span> I now give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Ro Tuisawau.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion 

relating to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts examination of the Audit Report on State-

owned entities and statutory authorities.  I rise to point out in particular, the few entities  here, the 

other Members have contributed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Nawaikula had mentioned FBCL, some may think it is a repetition, but it is an 

interesting case study in terms of the operation of the State owned enterprises.  When you look at the 

auditor’s audit opinion on page 9, it specifically mentions the government grants.  Government grants 

received  by  FBCL,  meets  the  definition  of  a  grant  in  that  they  constitute  government  assistance 

provided to enable FBCL to broadcast in the outer stations and local programmes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>By following the Government’s circular, FBCL to treat the government grant received as a 

capital contribution, but FBCL did not comply as mentioned.  However, I would like to comment in 

particular on this grant.  If you look back at FBCL over the years, looking at their annual reports, 

they have been making losses, from 2010 - $517,000; 2011 - $1.1 million; 2012 - $7.1 million, 2013 

- $5.6 million and also in 2014 and 2015.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  those  years,  Government  grants  had  been  as  follows:  2010  -  $2.6  million;  2011-  $2.5 

million; 2012 - $2.6 million; 2013 - $2.9 million; 2014 - $2.9 million and 2015- $2.9 million.  So, 

when I look back the accumulated losses in those years, was $21.5 million and grants were $16.4 

million.  On top of that, they have taken out a loan with Fiji Development Bank in the six years, but 

there was still a loss of  $21.5 million.   So it was continually receiving cash grant  of up to  $16.4 

million  accumulated  of  2010  to  2015,  and  we  could  say  that  the  Government  was  basically 

underwriting FBCL.  The interesting thing is that these grants were increased in 2016 and 2017 to 

$9.2 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Looking at the contributions made by the Honourable Members, we also note in 2018, there 

was a bonus pay to the CEO of $21,259 based on the performance throughout the 2017 financial 

year, and that was just the second year where the FBCL made a profit but also we will note that in 

2016 and 2017, the grant increased from $2.9 million to $9.2 million.  So you know when we are 

talking about public enterprise accountability, this is something which is odd because the bonus was 

paid straight after the government grant was increased by massive $2.9 million to $9.2 million.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I also note in one of the recent statements made by the CEO, regarding that grant which is for 

the specific purpose, it is a public service fee for the services it provides and one of his explanations 

was as follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“I  am  glad  you  have  asked  us  the  question  on  the  acquittals  as  it  stands  at  the 

moment, the value of what we provide government, inclusive of the new channels that we 

have provided at the FBC 2 which is non-commercial, we are now sitting at the value of 

around $30 million for which we receive a fee of $11.4 million.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>So from that $9.2 million that is mentioned it has now increased to $11.4 million but from 

</span><span>their perspective the value is $30 million so they are saying it is a shortfall.  For us as Parliament, we 

question the value of the public services being provided and there is quite a number of programmes 

being provided – </span><span>Speak Your Mind, Na Vakekeli, Sports Lounge, Bati Ni Tanoa,</span><span> et cetera.   

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>719 

</span></p>
<p><span>Who determines the value of these programmes which they are saying is amounting to $30 

million?  That is something, I believe, as mentioned by the Members from this side of the House 

which is why it is very critical for the Public Accounts Committee to scrutinise these kinds of what 

I would call “odd use of public funds”.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the ways in which we could look at is to conduct an independent review of the Public 

Service Broadcasting fee between the Government and FBC and determine how that broadcasting 

fee is apportioned or how the costings are being done?  Another way probably is to be cost effective 

and  we  tender  that  out  because  there  are  other  service  providers  here  in  Fiji,  including 

Communications Fiji Ltd or even Fiji Television Ltd, and of course, we need to look at how cost 

effective are its operations to date.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Someone has mentioned about the bonuses et cetera and again, some of the public entities 

listed are paying that out at this time, I am not saying it is bad but given the situation we are in, maybe 

there needs to be a policy review by Government on that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, if one looks at page 19 of the Committee Report where in terms of plant and property, 

I was surprised that the entity’s response there is that they are still using excel sheet, but it is good 

that on the next page, they have mentioned that the Authority plans to conduct a full board of survey 

and upload its results in an asset management module, Sage 300 ERP system which was supposed to 

have been implemented from last year.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We hope that that is in process and again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note with concern the internal 

controls, maintenance and issue of inventories and project monitoring system.  I believe in internal 

controls  of  assets  and  project  monitoring  also  involves  the  use  of  equipment,  et  cetera  which  is 

internal  (WAF  assets),  but  also  those  engaged  from  outside  contractors.    I  raise  the  case  of  an 

investigation about the diggers. Let me just read out this report and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“The FICAC confirmed that an investigation into alleged WAF diggers scam of 

$33  million  is  still  underway.    However,  the  Commission  is  not  divulging  any  further 

information so as not to interfere with the investigation process. Last year in June, it was 

alleged that WAF spent more than $33 million to hire a digger for 15 months. This was 

identified in a second KPMG Audit Report, the draft report reveals alleged abuse of funds 

dating back to 2016.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are looking at 2015, it has identified issues related to asset and inventory control and I 

</span><span>believe that is related to these kinds of issues and $33 million, that is a huge amount. The draft report 

was tabled to the board which was in place in August 2017. The report stated that WAF needs to 

seriously consider the option of procuring vehicles and heavy machinery. The planning process in 

connection with the purchase of heavy machinery at WAF is not effective.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In  2015,  WAF  acquired  two  brand  new  large  steel  track  excavators  which  are  based  at 

Wailoku and Lautoka. We noted that the excavator was not fully utilised based on enquiry with the 

staff in the Western Division. This was due to the fact that buckets for the excavator were too large 

to be used in operations. The report also noted that the board had approved rates to be made for hire 

</span><span>of plant equipment, however, hire rates were paid to the contractors without any board approval. It 

</span><span>further  revealed  that  a  large  steel  track  excavator  was  mainly  used  at  the  Natabua  Wastewater 

Treatment Plant for six months at $80 an hour.  The same work could easily been done by medium 

steel track excavator at $45 an hour.  The WAF would have saved $25,497.

<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>In another instance, total charges paid to a contractor for works in Natabua was $59,119.  The 

overcharge was about 65 percent.  So these are some instances which were identified in that KPMG 

Report which when I read this report we are looking at, it seemed as a consequence in terms of the 

monitoring of projects and the maintenance and effective use of inventories. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The last point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise is page 22 regarding lease arrangements 

between Water  Authority  of  Fiji  and landowners.   I  would like to  raise  my concern  regarding an 

ongoing issue with Savura Creek landowners.  Various letters have been written to the Honourable 

Minister for Economy and Attorney-General.  The landowners even came here to see us and I would 

like to read out the statement by iTLTB on the issue and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“In  response  to  the  claim  made  by  iTaukei  landowners  where  the  Suva  Water 

Supply catchment area, Savura is located.  The iTaukei Land Trust Board now confirms 

that a special water catchment lease was issued to the Government in 1967.  The lease 

land which covered a total area of 1,008 acres is owned by landowning units including 

Mataqali Solia, Mataqali Valebure, Mataqali Daunivurevure and Mataqali Naisagavaki.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>What is currently being questioned by Mataqali Valebure</span><span> </span><span>is whether there was compensation paid to 

them for the standing trees since the beginning of the lease. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The CEO, Mr. Kuruvakadua said iTLTB together with the Ministry of Lands and the Ministry 

of Forestry are currently verifying whether there was any compensation payment done at that time.  

He said that although this lease was issued 52 years ago, the annual lease payment has been reviewed 

from $2,643 to the current rate of $120,000. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The issue of compensation for loss of forest as claimed by the landowners need to be clarified 

further with the Ministry of Lands.  I am requesting the other side of the House, please, that particular 

lease provision regarding loss of standing forest beside the water catchment area is in that particular 

document to compensate the landowners as soon as practical.  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir and I confirm the motion to support the motion at hand.  </span><span>Vinaka. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I thank the Honourable Ro Tuisawau, Honourable  Minister, you have the</p>
<p><span>floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  I will concentrate on 

</span><span>the findings of the actual report and just a couple of remarks that I have.  I also want to thank the 

</span><span>Committee for the Report.  Obviously the Committee has reviewed and examined 17 audit reports 

on State-Owned Entities and Statutory Authorities for the year 2015. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A  comment  on  the  recommendations  relating  to  four  of  the  state-owned  entities  and  just 

quickly, in terms of auditing, et cetera.  Those were the issues brought up by Honourable Professor 

Prasad  and  Honourable  Aseri  Radrodro.  The  entities  that  are  being  audited  by  private  chartered 

accountants, they are chartered accountants.   You do not mess around with their businesses. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I do not think there is a difference if there is a report by a chartered accountant or the Office 

</span><span>of the Auditor-General, they both are subject to the exact same scrutiny which people do not do us 

</span><span>any favours.  They do not do favours to government nor any private entity.  That is their reputation; 

that fact stays.  So, if Fiji Airways and other entities are actually using private chartered accountants 

to audit their accounts, it is properly done, Sir.  There is no cloak and dagger stuff going on.  I think 

</span><span>they should forget about that idea. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="82">Page 82</a></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>721 

</span></p>
<p><span>With respect to the recommendations from the Committee on the Report, Sir, especially with 

the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji,  obviously,  the  Report  from  the  Committee  was  noted.    Just  for  the 

purpose of explanation, Sir, WAF actually conducts an independent quarterly stock on all its stores 

and the storemen are actually held accountable for any unresolved variance and the procedures and 

processes that have been put in place for the inventory request and issues of stock, this deals with the 

exact things that have been raised by the Auditor-General.  The supervisor or the ones who authorise 

to approve these things and stringent controls are now in place whereby all those purposes require 

management approval.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There  was  a  second  recommendation,  Sir.    That  recommendation,  WAF  is  engaged  with 

Erasito Beca Consultants to assess the reinstatement value of critical assets for insurance purposes, 

because the recommendation had asked that WAF ensure its significant assets included as part of the 

property  plant  and  equipment,  et  cetera.    It  is  currently  in  the  process  of  getting  quotations  from 

insurance brokers, like Marsh Pte. Limited for these particular sites.  Due to the substantial values 

involved as per the valuation of brokers have approached, insurance based on first loss limit policy 

restricting cover to fire, earthquake and impact. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  respect  to  Energy  Fiji  Limited,  formerly  known  as  Fiji  Electricity 

Authority, the recommendation from the Committee was that they carry out a  physical verification 

of all its properties, plant and equipment and make reports on verifications performed at all locations 

available for audit review.  Obviously that was noted  and, this is a bit of substantial answer Sir, as 

per  EFL’s  initial  response  in  2018,  EFL’s  property,  plant  and  equipment  were  worth  about  $1.3 

billion as at  31st  December, 2015 and since then, EFL’s property, plant and equipment  as at  31</span><span>st</span><span>

December, 2020 is now worth $1.44 billion.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The exercise of physically verifying these assets simply could not be completed in one years’ 

time.  In view of this, EFL adopted the strategy to do staged approach for verifying its assets and they 

have undertaken this considerable task to two fixed assets officers to conduct the verifications.  It 

commenced in 2016.  Those physical verifications Sir, in 2017, they have done all the motor vehicles, 

the land and the buildings. Most of the land and where the buildings are have been traced back to the 

original titles and the land has been pegged against these titles in the asset register.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the verification of the power generation assets is anticipated to be completed 

by  2021.    It  should  be  noted  that  EFL’s  monitoring  practices  also  include  daily  updates  on  the 

performance of each particular power station, Sir. The power generation assets include the thermal 

</span><span>diesel assets, the windmills and the hydro plants, such as damps, tunnels, weirs,  water conductors 

</span><span>and turbines. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, apart from the issues mentioned earlier, there have been further delays in this verification 

exercise over the years because of the numerous cyclones that we have actually suffered.  The EFL 

had to devote seven months to restore power to the nation and this exercise also cost EFL about $35 

million.  Cyclone restoration works were also in terms of the highest priority in order to reduce the 

impact on its customers as well as to avoid any further damage, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With  respect  to  Fiji  Airports  Limited,  formerly  known  as  Airports  Fiji  Limited,  the 

</span><span>recommendation again was that each structure is fixed assets registered in a way that will enable the 

</span><span>company to easily identify assets belonging to a specific section of the airport by location.  In 2015, 

Sir, they acquired fixed assets module in accounting software and I am sure Honourable Radrodro 

will confirm this, it is known as Sage Accpac which captured all the assets in detail.  In 2017 they 

</span><span>have  embarked  also  on  a  valuation  exercise  for  its  assets  by  Erasito  Beca  which  was  engaged  to 

</span><span>conduct  an  independent  valuation  on  these  assets  and  to  ensure  that  the  fixed  asset  register  is  in

<p><span> Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>22nd Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>compliance with statutory requirement.  The register has been audited by the OAG in 2018, in which 

zero material misstatements were found, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With  respect  to  Copra  Millers  of  Fiji  Limited,  also,  Sir,  the  recommendations  are  there.  

Again, this was a fixed asset register and it has been updated where different class of assets have 

been properly grouped and CFL now maintains a spreadsheet of all these.  They had a second one 

with respect to carrying out assessment of property, plant and equipment.   This has actually been 

undertaken  in  payment  assessment  of  all  its  property  and  plant  and  equipment,  fixed  assets  with 

negative  or  zero  written-down  value  which  are  still  in  operation  of  the  revalue  and  subject  to  its 

board’s assessment.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There was a general recommendation, Sir, with respect to the Ministry of Public Enterprise 

through regular and active interactions.  The State-Owned Entities (SOEs) should encourage them to 

prepare and submit quality draft Annual Financial Statements as per the Public Enterprises Act 1996.  

The then Ministry of Public Enterprises worked closely with entities with respect to submission of 

quality SOEs and draft Annual Financial Statements and the new Public Enterprises Act 2019 does 

not require SOEs to submit their draft Annual Financial Statements to the Department but actually 

provides State-Owned Entities five months in which to complete and submit their audited accounts. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition,  the  Department  also  has  regular  meetings  and  discussions  with  the  boards 

pertaining to statutory  requirements  and State-Owned Entities compliance issues  and matters that 

may be raised by the Office of the Auditor-General.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I also just want to take this opportunity to say “thank you” to the Committee for the work that 

</span></p>
<p><span>they have had undertaken so far.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution to the debate.  I now 

call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee of Public Accounts to speak in reply. You have 

the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  At the outset, the way the debate was 

going, I thought as a Member to actually stick to the Report that is before Parliament but I believe it 

makes no sense to the Opposition to tell them to stick to the Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, what the Honourable Ro Tuisawau was saying was that the Water Authority of Fiji 

</span><span>is not even part of this Report but you had actually made a ruling, he went on not discussing about 

</span><span>what is in the Report itself, but totally something else.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Gavoka also mentioned a lot of scenarios where he was very concerned about the 

Committee, the membership, et cetera.  I think he should be more worried about his own division 

within his Party rather than the bipartisan approach that the Committee actually takes.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- That is not good:</span></p>
<p><span>HON A.A. MAHARAJ.- Please, do not worry about the Committee.  It is an insult actually 

</span><span>not just to ask as the Committee but the Opposition Members who are sitting in the PAC, Sir, it is an 

</span><span>insult.  These are the bipartisan Report and I am proud to say in this Parliament ever since I became 

a  Chairperson  of  this  particular  Committee,  we  have  been  handing  all  bipartisan  Reports,  they 

actually signed.  It is not that we actually restrict our Members to ask questions, they have the full 

</span><span>right to ask anything, to clarify anything they want to.  Even the Members from the Opposition, I

<p><span>Examination of 2015 Audit Reports -  

State-Owned Entities &amp; Statutory Authorities 

</span></p>
<p><span>723 

</span></p>
<p><span>invited them to actually come and sit as an audience to PAC when we are doing this scrutiny, so that 

they actually understand how the Public Accounts Committee works. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Very poor:</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Committee Members who actually sit in other Committees doing 

an Annual Report Review is not the same as the Public Accounts Committee Reports.  We actually 

stated that there were almost 28 to 29 Financial Statements in this particular Report. That means, in 

very simple terms, we were actually scrutinising 29 Annual Reports at one particular point in time.  

This is the extent of work that the Public Accounts Committee actually carries out.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members  from  the  Opposition  who  actually  sit  in  this  particular  Committee, 

participate  fully  in  this  scrutiny  process.    It  is  very  unpleasing  to  actually  hear  from  some  of  the 

Members how they tried to manipulate things when the Reports actually come into Parliament.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The other thing, Sir, there were certain concerns raised specifically with FBC.  I would like 

to put this on record.  For example, again, in very simple English, Fiji Airways’ majority shareholder 

is Fijian Government.  When we travel through Fiji Airways, that does not mean that we actually 

give them grant, we pay for our seats.  Likewise, when FBC does something for the Government, 

there is a fee.   

</span></p>
<p><span>All  this  while,  it  was  through  the  Cabinet  ruling  that  anything  that  goes  to  FBC  could  be 

regarded as a grant, it is not a grant, it is a fee that Government actually needs to pay for the services 

rendered by FBC. That was actually cleared in their financial report, then only they started showing 

the profit.  It was not FBC’s issue that it was all this while regarded as a grant.  They do not provide 

service to us. The way they calculate is that they sell air time, that is how they make money.  

</span></p>
<p><span>When Government puts an advertisement or any kind of thing through FBC, they charge us.  

The total value of work they carry out  for the Fijian Government per  year is almost close to $25 

million but what Government actually pays FBC is close to around $9 million to $11 million only.  

That is their social responsibility that they cover from their own pocket yet at the end of the day, they 

are giving profit now.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is why, Sir, I recommended and appreciated the work of the CEO and the board members 

who are turning this Government commercial company, from a loss-making entity to a profit-making 

</span><span>entity.  Everyone here knows that it is a service fee, not a grant that is given to FBC.  But yet every 

</span><span>time a particular report is presented in which FBC is mentioned that it is a grant, FBC is still making 

a loss, no it is not a grant, it is a service fee that we pay to FBC to channel or to take programmes on 

air that is requested by the Government of the day.  It is not a grant but a fee, I hope that clarifies 

that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other thing with regards to WAF, Sir, we would like to appreciate the work done by the 

CEO.  They are bringing in a lot of reforms, they have taken our recommendation on board in a very 

positive manner.  They are trying to rectify the reports that are before us, which we are scrutinising 

and seeing the changes that the new CEO, Mr. Barry Omundson, has brought about with regards to 

</span><span>WAF. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With those words, Sir, I would like to thank you for the time given to me.  </span><span>Vinaka.
