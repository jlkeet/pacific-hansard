<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Criminal 

Procedure Act was in fact put in place in 2009 where we completely repealed the Criminal Procedure 

Code of 1944.  There were a number of archaic provisions in relation to the Penal Code which we 

inherited from the British India, Queensland and came to Fiji which is now called the Crimes Act. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One  of  the  archaic  provisions  that  still  remain  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  is  becoming  quite 

problematic now is the issue of what we call Lay Assessors.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a matter of interest 

the Criminal Procedure Ordinance of 1875, the Criminal Justice System was very heavily influenced 

by  ethnic  considerations.  So,  if  you  are  European,  you  had  your  case  only  tried  exclusively  by  a 

European jury but if you are of any other ethnic group than the case was tried by lay assessors but 

also were Europeans. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The legal theory being that when Europeans as lay assessors decided on cases concerning 

non-Europeans they may have a particular bias so therefore the Judges could overrule the decision 

of the assessors. That was the philosophy that actually continued until the 1950s when people of other 

ethnic groups were then included in the list of assessors.  In 1961 they got rid of what we call “The

</span></p>
<p><span> Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>All European Jury System” so, since then we have been left languishing with this particular assessors 

system.  It essentially means Mr. Speaker, Sir, in practical terms, if a group of assessors find someone 

guilty, the Judge can overturn them and on the other hand for example if the assessors find a particular 

ruling or let us say the person is not guilty, the Judge may simply go along with them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, this has led to a number of inconsistencies and one of the other issues that we have 

discovered Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that, there is only a handful of assessors that are currently being used.  

There  is  only  about  30  people  or  40  people  who  actually  act  now  as  what  I  call  “professional 

assessors”, and they are well known to the registry clerks, they are well known to the lawyers but 

more so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we are concerned about in particular is that given that we  have a 

small group of people they are very subject to our economic, peer and political pressure and influence 

and in particular the level of sensitisation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>When  we  talk  about  sexual  offences  and  gender  related  offences  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and 

recently we have seen some cases in respect of that, where a lot of people are coming from a very 

patriarchal based society, we are getting a lot of inconsistencies in the verdicts (for want of a better 

word) by the assessors.  So, in some cases we have recently seen that where very similar facts, very 

similar evidence, assessors find not guilty.    

</span></p>
<p><span>In other cases they find them guilty and similarly the Judges whether it is maybe the mood of 

the day they may go along with the assessor or maybe they do not actually get  influenced by the 

assessors, they go against the assessors.  So, you cannot have a criminal justice system in particular 

when you try to address issues such as gender issues that will have a dual system; we need to have 

consistency.  You either have the decisions of all the assessors always adhered to like a jury system 

or you actually do not have the assessors where the assessors’ decisions can sometimes be followed 

and other times cannot be followed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly enough, Fiji and Vanuatu are the only countries in the Pacific that actually has 

this system, everyone else has moved along.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are seeing a lot of this in 

particular, some of the prejudices coming through in sexual assault and rape cases, et cetera, and in 

particular, when you are now getting sophisticated crimes, use of technology, et cetera, the ability of 

the assessors to perhaps comprehend these matters and come up with a ruling is very limited from 

that perspective.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment seeks to remove the assessor system and have 

the  judges,  like  in  many  other  jurisdictions  in  the  world,  actually  make  the  decision  themselves.  

Thank you, Mr, Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
