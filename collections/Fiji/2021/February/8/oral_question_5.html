<p>Identification of Alternative Crop to Marijuana 

 (Question No. 07/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 

Parliament on the work by the Ministry in identifying an alternative crop to marijuana that 

can be taken up by farmers?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir, I am a bit baffled with this question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, marijuana is a drug, it is illegal for consumption in Fiji.  You cannot find a 

perfect substitute as a crop.  I really do not know what they are asking for?  Whenever, you have got 

something that is illegal and it is a drug, the market value will definitely be very high and you cannot 

find an alternative crop which is for consumption to be of equivalent value.</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I suggest that in the next Session of Parliament</p>
<p>that they rephrased the question and then I am happy to answer.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Minister may need to understand 

this better,  if I can relate to the situation in Navosa and Nadroga, where at one time there were lots 

of marijuana up in the hills, and the Provincial people from Navosa asked the Province to create other 

products for the producers to help the farmers move away from marijuana to better crops.</p>
<p>There is a Collection Centre in Keiyasi, but the Agriculture Department  has not helped to 

make the Collection Centre work, Mr. Speaker, so the question is quite valid.  This is coming from 

the people - what can we do to move off farmers away from marijuana to something better?  He 

should answer that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order.  Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do follow the work that the Fiji Police Force 

is doing to eradicate marijuana and we have been working with the Fiji Police Force to see how it 

could engage these farmers into meaningful activity which will result in them earning an income for 

their  households,  their  livelihood  as  well  as  pursuing  the  national  interest  of  a  growing  national 

income.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example, in Kadavu, we are developing a nursery.   The alternative 

crops that we are looking at  have demonstrated  high value and also  high return, both  in  terms  of 

supplying the particular crop and the products developed out of this primary produce, both in the 

local market and the export market, are yaqona, fresh produce, cassava, dalo and ginger.  Now we 

are also looking at turmeric.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment the turmeric that we are exporting from Fiji is going to US, 

we are not able to fulfil the demand for turmeric.  The turmeric that we are exporting to the US market 

is branded as organic because all the turmeric that we are harvesting is wildly grown, so it is basically 

organic turmeric, and it is fetching very high premium price.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  working  very  closely  with  farmers,  for 

example, in Kadavu we are developing a nursery for yaqona, we are establishing one of the state-of-

the-art  nursery  in  Nausori  and  another  one  in  Koronivia.    We  got  funds  from  the  Canadian 

Development Fund of CAN$200,000 to establish a nursery at Koronivia Research Station, basically 

to provide seedlings at no cost to farmers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working very closely in terms of developing nurseries throughout 

Fiji so that we can provide planting materials, in particular seedlings in cases of these high valued 

crops so that we can ensure that the germination rate is 100 percent.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the 

Honourable Member is talking about crops that have demand in the local and export markets, with 

high value, high return and also we can develop products out of these primary produce, for example, 

kava pills, a product out of kava.  There are other products that we develop out of the primary trees.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Honourable Member had listened to my previous speeches, I said that 

we need to  move also  towards developing products  for various reasons.    For example, when  you 

develop  a  product  out  of  a  primary  produce  then  the  self-life  can  be  extended,  when  you  have  a 

product, you can also have no issues of transportation, when you have a product, you do not have 

any  issues  with  biosecurity,  when  you  have  a  product,  you  can  fetch  higher  price  than  what  the 

produce is fetching.  For example, cassava flour from the cassava produce, cassava flour is a product.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  also  simultaneously  looking  at  how  we  can  develop  numerous 

products which can also give us additional market.  To grow the market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need 

to shift our focus also from produce to products.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are doing work in this area 

so that we can create the market for our farmers so that the market is not an issue and therefore, 

limited market does not discourage them.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you talk to anyone, the single most factor that bothers a farmer is whether 

there is a market for their produce or that they will be able to really get their produce out when they 

harvest.  With regards to primary produce Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are perishable in nature so when 

they harvest, they need to immediately get it to the market or move it to a processing plant to process 

the produce so we are working very hard on that Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, we will move on.</p>
<p>I give the floor for the eighth oral question for today to the Honourable Veena Bhatnagar.</p>
