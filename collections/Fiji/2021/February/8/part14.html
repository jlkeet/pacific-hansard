<p><span>REVIEW REPORT - PUBLIC RENTAL BOARD 2016 ANNUAL REPORT  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move that:</p>
<p><span>Parliament debates the Review Report of the Public Rental Board 2016 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>which was tabled on 1st April, 2019.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable  Members,  I  now  invite  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing</p>
<p><span>Committee on Social Affairs to speak on his motion.  You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Rental Board was established in 1989 to 

manage the rental portfolio of Housing Authority.  Its vision is to provide affordable, quality and 

appropriate rental housing for financially disadvantaged Fijians, and to realise this vision, the Board 

is mandated with the following missions: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Facilitate  the  development  of  affordable  and  quality  rental  housing  to  meet  the  socio 

economic needs of customers; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Maintain efficient and effective customer service to meet customer expectation; 

(3)</span><span> </span><span>Maintain and enhance flats to PRB standards; 

(4)</span><span>
</span><span>(5)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Empower customers through innovative public relations and community building; 

Provide cohesion communities while enhancing openings that can be used to facilitate a 

win-win opportunity for every one; 

Undertake profiling and analysis of existing potential customers; and 

Promote migration to home ownership. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(6)</span><span>
</span><span>(7)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee upon being referred the Public Rental Board 2016 Annual Report, invited its 

senior officials on Tuesday, 29th January, 2019 for a public hearing.  During this meeting, officials 

from the Public Rental Board enlightened the Committee on numerous housing projects fully funded 

by Government, future plans and initiative in maximising the number of flats to cater for large wait 

list applications and overall operations aligned to the SDGs and the measures that are being taken by 

the Board to progress SDGs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Public  Rental  Board  reported  another  year  of  favourable  results, 

achieving increase in revenue and higher operating profits in 2016.  The Committee is of the view 

that  the  Public  Rental  Board  is  now  in  a  sound  and  sustainable  platform  for  the  future  with  an 

objective to develop more affordable rental flats for low income earners around Fiji.  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairperson.    Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now</p>
<p><span>open for debate on the motion.  Is anyone wishing to take the floor?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Tabuya, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the debate on the 

Report by the Public Rental Board (PRB), but before I do that, I just want to remind the Honourable 

Minister for Health that his disappointment with our walk out this morning fails in comparison to the 

disappointment and heartache that under his watch, has been caused with a lack of services at the

<p><span>Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>329 

</span></p>
<p><span>Savusavu  Hospital,  so  he  should  be  more  worried  about  that.    His  own  Permanent  Secretary  has 

admitted that, that hospital is not up to par.  The absence of the generator during the </span><span>TC Ana </span><span>has quite 

possibly led to the death of a young lady. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> A point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  she  has  misled  Parliament.    There  were  2 

generators there that were used during </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>and also </span><span>TC Ana.  </span><span>You have misled Parliament, take 

it back! 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister:</span> Honourable Member, just stick to the</p>
<p><span>agenda item. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you Mr:</span> Speaker, I will move on.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report as tabled by the Committee expressed some issues of concern 

and this is in 2016, and I wish to address those.  The first is the funding for capital developments 

under Public and Private Partnerships (PPP). 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Housing Authority developments which we have heard from the Minister are now given 

over to be developed or by IFC and there is still no update about that and we have not heard in this 

House what is happening there, even though we were informed last year.  Now, has there been any 

PRB new developments today by the government, or they have just been taken down like the PRB 

flats in Raiwaqa and nothing has been put in place? 

</span></p>
<p><span>The report notes a decrease in demand for PRB rentals.  It appears from the graph there that 

most of our people have given up, waiting.  They have been on the waiting list and we still have 

families that live in PRB flats, they have gone above the means test and should be out of there. What 

is the Ministry doing about it?  We have seen recently and over the years, a population boom in our 

urban centres, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with substandard housing for the majority of our population that live 

in these areas. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The recent cyclones, Mr. Speaker, Sir, had shown a lack of adequate housing in the squatter 

and informal settlements  with  poor drainage systems  caused by immense flooding and as well as 

roofs blown off and homes destroyed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I visited a settlement called ‘Ucuna’ in Nakasi in the past week. There are 

about 15 families that live there, wedged in between the homes there, still have not had electricity 

connected  to  date  and  their  concern  is  that,  there  are  now  stringent  requirements  and  costs  to 

connecting their electricity.  This is something that EFL needs to look at, in terms of providing for 

low income families in connecting electricity to their settlements.  But they had few roofs blown off 

just from </span><span>TC Ana </span><span>and they have been displaced.  Our most vulnerable which are our urban poor are 

left on the wayside.  They do not have access to this PRB flats and there is no space there and the 

waiting list obviously, our people have given up there, but I now move on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the 

decision by the Government or their policy to merge the Housing Authority and PRB. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the Minister for Housing, in February last year, talked about this merge and it is still in 

its transitional stage as noted in her report.  I wonder whether this power season effective move, Mr. 

Speaker, or   this should still be kept separate and independent from the Ministry.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="30">Page 30</a></p>
<p><span>330 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I refer specifically, Mr. Speaker, to the recent stabbing in the PRB on Mead Road, Nabua 

where the Minister issued a statement blaming the PRB employees and the Board for that. She stated 

that she had directed the Board to profile all the tenants and that by that date; January 8</span><span>th</span><span> of this year, 

nothing had been done. 

</span></p>
<p><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are conflicting reports from within the Ministry saying that 

the  employees  had  provided  a  very  extensive  profiling  to  the  Ministry.    It  was  conducted  by  the 

Board, so who is  telling the truth?  In  any  event,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, now  that the government  has 

brought PRB and Housing Authority under it and merging the two, the buck stops with the Minister.  

The Minister needs to accept responsibility for what happened and not blaming the employees, who 

had done their jobs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, our Bills of Rights in the Constitution states at Section 35 that our people have 

the right to accessible and adequate housing.  I think there should be another word added there, Mr. 

Speaker, the word ‘affordable’ to read,  “… accessible, adequate and affordable housing.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Our tens of thousands of people who live in substandard housing, Mr. Speaker, with no direct 

or connected water, no electricity and frequent flooding, as well as poor structures that have easily 

blown away, or a threat to life and person during this frequent cyclone season, should be addressed.  

We have been informed that the IRC has taken over to provide housing that can be owned by low 

income earners.  What is the update on that?  Nothing!  There is nothing from the Ministry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the Committee for highlighting the concerns and the works of 

the PRB from 2016 and it appears today that it has not improved.  The Government must do better 

and they should do better.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Tabuya  for    her  contribution  to  the  debate:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, let me just start by educating Honourable Members on 

the other side that a parliamentarian has a range of arsenal available to him or her, one of which is to 

walk out of Parliament.  The answer now is questions, motions, petitions, private Bills, and the like. 

</span></p>
<p><span>What we ask, as Parliamentarians is that, we want to create dialogue at a national level and 

today, we wanted to create dialogue on the USP saga.  We were denied that opportunity so we walked 

out, and the whole country is now having a dialogue on this.  So dialogue is happening, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Member, just stick to the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, because it came from the other side, it is</p>
<p><span>just a way of fighting back.  That is all, thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Public Rental Board (PRB), Mr. Speaker, when you look at Fiji in total and you look at 

the global phenomena today, the migration into the cities, we can never meet the needs of everyone 

who migrates to the city in terms of housing.  I am just concerned here, Mr. Speaker, that we continue 

to use models that are quite outdated.  I think it is about time that we relook at this and come up with 

a model that will truly meet the needs of those in need of housing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I note here that the PRB relies solely on Government for funding, thus the need to accelerate 

the availability of rental via PRB.  We can never meet the demand, Mr. Speaker.  It is time that we 

relook at the model.  Should the private sector play a role in it, Government can never provide enough 

homes to meet the need, the demand from our people.  Like I said, it is global, people are migrating

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>331 

</span></p>
<p><span>from the rural areas into the cities and towns.  Squatter settlement is not unique to Fiji, it is all over 

the world, but it is time, Mr. Speaker, that we relook at this. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In my visit to Singapore some years ago on a Parliamentary visit, we were briefed on how 

Singapore did it.  They put together a housing commission and that was able to provide housing to 

just about everyone in Singapore.  So, Mr. Speaker, the time has come.  I think that we look beyond 

the PRB and Housing Authority, and relook at the model, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>With our real status today, we need to do this.  My colleague, Honourable Tabuya, talked 

about  water,  sanitation  and  hygiene.    That  could  be  perhaps,  the  way  to  start,  Mr.  Speaker,  that 

whoever today is living in what we call as ‘informal settlement’, to be provided with the basics in 

terms of sanitation, water and hygiene.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That could be a way to start, Mr. Speaker, because it is a mammoth undertaking and the model 

that the Government is using today will never be sufficient to provide adequate housing to the people 

in Fiji.    I would urge the leadership today, the Government and us, to sit together and relook at this, 

and look at some of the best practices.  I quoted Singapore, what did they do right?  We should also 

emulate that in Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That, Mr. Speaker, is my contribution to this because I think it is timely that we consider this, 

Mr. Speaker, a challenge that will not go away and that we are not able to meet right now with the 

way we are doing things.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Viliame Gavoka for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister, you have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to support the Review Report of</p>
<p><span>the Standing Committee on the Public Rental Board Annual Report 2016.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I commend the work of PRB during the year 2016 and I note that gender reporting is included 

by PRB in its annual report.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, gender equality at PRB has vastly improved over the 

years with managerial positions which were previously held by male staff are now held by female 

staff.  To date, there are 49 percent female and 51 percent male staff for established positions.  For 

unestablished staff, there are 18 males and one female staff due to the nature of work.  This team is 

involved in repairs and maintenance of PRB properties.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the operating income for PRB in 2016 was $4 million as a result of increase 

in rental flats from 1,343 to 1,553 after the completion of Raiwai flats.  In 2016, two housing projects 

were commissioned in Savusavu and Kalabu.  In Savusavu, 48 units were developed at a cost of $3.8 

million while 36 units were developed in Kalabu for a sum of $2.2 million.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PRB is currently constructing 36 units in Simla, Lautoka which is fully-

funded by the Fijian Government.  This is expected to complete by the end of this year.  Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, we have heard from Honourable Tabuya many times as well as from Honourable Nawaikula in 

the past and it continues like an old record that this Government has done nothing, and that is his 

favourite line that this Government does nothing.  So today, let me tell him what we have done.  In 

the last six years, total Government grant to PRB was over $16 million for capital projects and rent 

subsidy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The PRB has to maintain its asset. General maintenance work was carried out on Vakatora, 

Naodamu, Kalabu, Charles Street, Mead Road Estate, Levuka, Tuatua and Kia Street.  In addition, 

PRB concreted Raiwai Estate car parking area to increase the number of car parks for its residents.  

</span></p>

<p><span>332 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Savusavu  flats  were  provided  with  grills,  the  area  was  fenced  and  a  walkway  was  made  for  the 

tenants.   Construction of rock-lining and hall upgrade was carried out in McFarlane Estate.  For 

Kalabu flats, drainage upgrade work was completed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PRB in its effort to provide better services to its customers, has invested in 

the  installation  of  CCTV  cameras  and  has  plans  for  new  projects.    New  projects  are  planned  for 

Newtown and Raiwaqa which will add close to 358 flats.  Honourable Tabuya mentioned about the 

merger of Housing Authority of Fiji with PRB.  There are a lot of benefits by doing that and it is 

important  for  me  to  brief  the  Honourable  Members  about  the  future  direction  for  PRB.    The 

operational merger of Housing Authority of Fiji and PRB, as I mentioned, will bring about many 

advantages,  not  only  in  saving  costs  but  also  provide  access  to  funds  and  new  technology.    This 

merger is in line with the recommendations made in the 2011 National Housing Policy Framework.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  certain  services  carried  out  by  both  organisations  that  can  be 

consolidated.    For  example,  customer  service,  finance,  human  resource,  credit  management  and 

information  technology.    The  Housing  Authority  of  Fiji  can  provide  additional  service  in  legal, 

internal audit and risk and land and housing development.  It is not prudent for PRB to engage in 

construction of rental flats on land given by Housing Authority when the expertise lies with Housing 

Authority.  Based  on  economies  of  scale,  the  cost  of  construction  can  come  down  if  Housing 

Authority builds rental flats that can be managed by PRB. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  also    taken  a  lead  role  in  identifying  and  introducing 

potential business partners with new technologies to work with these  two institutions. The next step 

is for these institutions to engage with appropriate partners that will bring in new technology and 

innovative financial models to increase the housing stock.  I definitely agree with Honourable Gavoka 

that no country in the world has provided homes to their citizens.  Generally every country tries to 

look after the vulnerable population and that is what we are doing here.  I also agree that Housing 

Authority, PRB or the Ministry of Housing cannot provide the housing solution. We need to depend 

or we must rely on the private sector and that is what this Government is doing.  

</span></p>
<p><span>If you have heard the budget which was announced by the Honourable Attorney-General, not 

only in last year’s budget even the year before, there were a lot of incentives given in the housing 

sector, not only to the first home owners but also to the private sector so that they can come on board 

and start building these apartments that we are talking about (strata apartments).  The Government is 

taking appropriate measures at every step and we are mindful of the fact that housing is a basic need 

and we need to work towards that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Tabuya mentioned that there are certain people who are still staying in the PRB 

flats; I agree.  For some people, PRB flats has become their permanent home and they have been 

living in that flat for the last 20, 30 or 40 years. Unlike the Koroipita Programme where a family can 

live only for one generation and they have to move out and start looking after themselves, but in 

PRB’s case that has been the norm where people continue to live in the flat and sometimes in one 

bedroom there are 14 to 15 people living in that flat. So we need to change that.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, PRB’s role is to assist those families who take the 

first step towards home ownership by providing them subsidised rental flats and helping them save 

money  to  build  up  their  deposits  needed  for  home  ownership  unfortunately  we  do  not  see  this 

happening.    Instead  in  some  flats  we  have  come  across  cases  where  families  who  have  been 

subsidised by the Government are abusing the extra money they have on hand.  And that is why we 

</span></p>

<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>333 

</span></p>
<p><span>see a lot of social problems in a number of PRB flats around the country.  People have excess money 

and then they indulge in drinking parties, et cetera.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The PRB case in Mead Road, I did the thorough analysis of the case and what I found was, 

when this lady was given the flat many years ago, she was barely in her 30s and she has been living 

in that flat and today she is about 58 years old.  So you can imagine, she was not able to accumulate 

her deposit and move out. So she continued living there, she had her children and now she has got 

her grandchildren.  So this is not something that we are encouraging, we are trying to curb that and 

this is the reality that we have.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on International Finance Corporation (IFC) Projects. IFC has stepped in to 

help Housing Authority to build strata apartments. The work was progressing very well and some of 

the preparatory work is complete. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we could not progress the work 

further  and  the  main  reason  was  that  consultants  and  technologies  had  to  come  from  abroad  and 

because of the travel restrictions, we could not proceed with that, so we are hoping that once the 

travel situation improves, we will be able to commence with IFC Project as planned.  Besides IFC, 

there are other local investors who are keen in developing strata apartments and they have come to 

the Ministry of Housing.  Even I had some meetings with the private sector, they are very keen to go 

ahead with it, and some of them are already in the planning stages. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One good example is Rups.  Rups is also building strata apartments.  There are other bigger 

companies who are also involved or have engaged consultants to explore the possibility of putting 

up strata apartments.  So every effort is being made from all directions to build the housing stock in 

Fiji.  That is all I have to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I thank the Honourable Premila Kumar for her statement and I give the</p>
<p><span>floor to the Honourable Niko Nawaikula.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    With  your  leave,  I  would  like  to 

contribute. The Honourable Minister had stated that I am on record as saying continuously that this 

Government has done nothing for the housing needs of this country.  That is the fact, and on the next 

breath, she admitted that Housing Authority and the Public Rental Board do not have a solution to 

housing, so there it is. 

</span></p>
<p><span>She referred to a sum of about $16 million for the building of a rental flat in Raiwai  as a 

measure  of  success  -  that  is  not  a  measure  of  success.    A  measure  of  success  is,  if  you  meet  the 

requirements of a mission statement, one of those is that, you have to assist migration to other housing 

and she admitted that one lady in Nabua went to the Public Rental Board and she was 35 and she is 

still there when she is 58 - that is a failure.  Your mission statement says, “You will assist them to 

migrate to better housing” and she has admitted also that there are people who have been living there 

for years, that is a failure on their part, that is a failure on the Government’s part. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me just refer in general that the failure of this Government to look into the housing needs 

of this country, consider the time when Ratu Mara was here.  First, you have the Housing Assistance 

Relief Trust (HART).  People who cannot afford, go to HART and HART is obliged to push them 

on to better housing.  They might go to Public Rental Board and then go to the Housing Authority of 

Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the moment, you have a whole generation of people.  I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, from 25 

to about 40 who cannot afford housing, who cannot afford a lot in the Housing Authority, who cannot 

afford a room in Public Rental Board.  Where are these people?  These people are renting and she 

admitted that Rups has tapped into the business of having strata titles, why?  Because the Government 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>is not addressing that, and so you have this whole generation of people who are renting.  Some of 

them  are  even  staying  in  squatters  and  here  again,  you  have  the  problem  with  this  Government 

formalising squatter settlements as an agreeable standard for housing in Fiji.  You should not do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>What was done before is that, all previous governments recognised squatters as “squatters” 

and they insisted that they move away from those areas to better housing.  This Government is not 

doing  that,  this  Government  now  has  a  Ministry  which  is  called  “Ministry  of  Housing  and 

Community  Development”,  “community  development”  is  squatter.    They  do  not  want  to  call  it 

“squatter”, they call it “informal settlement”, and they are now calling it “community development” 

but it is sad that all these squatters are living in sub-standard conditions. 

</span></p>
<p><span>What happens if a cyclone comes in, if a cyclone comes in, what will happen and you will be 

</span></p>
<p><span>to blame.  This Government will be blamed for agreeing for the public to stay in substandards.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- That is their problem:</span></p>
<p><span>They must admit it, Mr. Speaker. Where is your policy on housing? You do not have policy 

on housing.  People cannot afford a lot in Housing Authority lots.  People cannot afford a room in 

PRB.  Now, they are renting this PRB to university students because they cannot afford it.  That is 

not what your Mission Statement said.  She should have listened to the Chairman.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Provision  or  facilitate  affordable  housing,  maintain  effective  customer  service  and  very 

</span></p>
<p><span>importantly, assist in the migration to new homes.  They are not doing that. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.:</span> Very sad!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> Yes, it is very, very sad because this Government is not doing</p>
<p><span>anything to the housing needs of this nation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the Honourable Minister also referred to the PRB in Lautoka.  She should have read 

</span></p>
<p><span>what the auditor said, that is a subject of corruption.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You need to review the leases:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> A contractor who has done that, she should have addressed that.</p>
<p><span>So, the bottom line is this, Mr. Speaker, this Government has failed a whole generation of 20 

years to 35 years, they have not provided their housing needs.  They cannot afford a lot in Housing 

Authority. They cannot afford a room at PRB.  And where are they going? They are going to the 

squatters.  They are going to rent here and there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me just go back, Mr. Speaker, to the need for PRB to merge with Housing Authority.  The 

history of PRB was this, Housing Authority in 1988 or 1998 had whole lot of tenants that they cannot 

afford so they were just piling and piling debts, so it split it up.  It split up Housing Authority and 

started what is now called the PRB and it was left on its own with no expertise in housing.   All the

</span></p>
<p><span>expertise in Housing Authority, as the Honourable Minister has just now admitted and, therefore, the 

reason why they should merge.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  recommendation  from  this Committee  is  very  funny.    They  said  that  the  PRB  is  in  a 

sound footing.  The PRB is not in a sound footing, it should go back and join with Housing Authority.  

The PRB is not achieving its mission.  It is not pushing the tenants to better housing and in totality, 

this Government has failed the housing needs of this country and a whole generation are there, renting 

here and here and here.  Thank you.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Attorney:</span> General, you have the floor.</p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to bring a bit of rationality into the 

way  this  particular  Report  has  been  discussed.    Honourable  Nawaikula  had  just  contradicted  the 

Leader of his Party because the Leader of his Party actually said that there needs to be private sector 

input.  Honourable Nawaikula is saying that everything should be done by Government.  That is an 

enormous contradiction. He probably needs to listen to his Leader, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.:</span> The donkey has bolted, let us not try and recover that.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have on the floor of this Parliament on a number of occasions for the 

past number of years, highlighted some of the issues pertaining to housing and some of the legacy 

issues that we have had to deal with.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The issue pertaining to affordable housing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been that there has been no 

plans when these were developed. Honourable Nawaikula talked about HART, PRB and Housing 

Authority, et cetera.  We can cite Raiwaqa, we can cite Matavolivoli and also Tavakubu.  A lot of the 

people who were given housing in those areas, in fact, have never progressed, even though they may 

have owned those particular houses or apartments.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why they have not progressed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the inability of their properties 

to be appreciated in value over a period of time.  Any real estate that anyone owns, the value of a 

house  if  it  was  $20,000  in  1995  must  appreciate  to  a  higher  value  20  years  or  10  years  later  but 

because we have what  we what  we call the  ghettoisation of these areas, property prices  have not 

increased.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Property prices outside of these areas have always appreciated, and that is how real estate 

works.  So, fundamentally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the policy of that system was flawed in itself.  So, those 

people who are low income earners, they came into those areas, even though they did the repayments, 

even  though  they  have  bought  their  houses,  20  years  later  the  value  of  those  houses  depreciated 

because no one wants to go into those particular areas.  Period.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That is a fundamental issue and Honourable Gavoka talked about Singapore.  They have done 

exactly the same thing, contrary to what was done in Fiji.  Previously, they had apartments like that.  

Previously, they had streets that no one wants to go in, but they changed the whole concept.  So, as 

we have said repeatedly on the floor of this Parliament that when you have, for example, strata title, 

you have different price points.  On one floor you can have a pilot that may own a three-bedroom 

apartment, you may have a janitor or a school teacher or a bus driver or you may have someone who 

is a market vendor, different price points and, therefore, the properties will continuously appreciate.

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, if I buy a one-bedroom apartment, I then get married and have children, I want to go and 

buy a two-bedroom apartment, I want to buy a house on its own, I should be able to sell my property, 

get  value  for  it,  which  is  appreciated,  then  move  along.    That  is  what  we  call  socio-economic 

progression.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, that is what needs to happen.</p>
<p><span>Fact number 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Nawaikula is pointing out as if prior to 2007 

no one lived in the squatter areas.  There were numerous people who lived in squatter areas.  If you 

go to Omkar, people have been living there for 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, and people living in 

</span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangements for 60 years or 70 years.  That is the reality of the matter and, of course, the 

demand for ownership of homes has been enormous. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As people get more income, et cetera, they move to the towns and cities, they need access to 

housing but their housing stock was low and it has been a phenomena, not only peculiar post-2007 

but prior to that also.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are number of factors that we need to deal with.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Tabuya  talked  about  those  people  who  lost  electricity  connection  after  the 

cyclone, yes, of course, and they will get connected if they have the approval.  But someone else was 

saying, I cannot remember who it was, that even in this informal squatter areas, we should give them 

sanitation,  water  and  electricity.  You  need  the  consent  of  the  landowners!    We  have  so  many 

situations, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  was  recently  in  Nawaka  in  Nadi  where  a  particular  landowner  got  about  100  people  in 

</span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangement with him.  He has to give the approval, so they got electricity.  One day, he 

had a disagreement with one of the tenants, he told EFL, “I no longer give my consent”, so they had 

no electricity for six months.  That is how the squatter system works.  You need the consent of the 

landowners.  It is like anyone who comes and squats on your land, he or she needs the consent of the 

landowners.  So, it is not very simple to say, “Oh, let us give them all of that.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  wanted  to  highlight  is  precisely  what  the 

Honourable Leader of SODELPA has said, we are working with the private sector.  There are six 

sites - Raiwaqa - 10 acres; Davuilevu - 131 acres; Nepani - 45 acres; Wainibuku - 3.5 acres; Tavakubu  

-70 acres; andTavua - 32 acres.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, Honourable Tabuya is saying, “Oh, what is happening?”  There are different models 

and we are currently working with IFC and also the Australian Government.  You do not just pull 

things out of thin air, Honourable Tabuya, you need to actually have a project that will actually attract.  

Attract, Honourable Gavoka, you will learn if you listen!  You will attract private sector investment 

and these things need to be modelled properly. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister for Housing has also highlighted that some of the consultants, et 

cetera,  could  not  come,  but  we  are  still  working  behind  the  scenes.    Laws  need  to  be  changed, 

regulatory amendments need to be made and we hope to get this construction on the way.  People 

who  are  involved  in  the  private  sector  with  modern  day  technology  that  is  not  available  in  Fiji, 

obviously cannot come to Fiji at the moment or are hesitant to come to Fiji, or cannot leave their own 

countries, because their own countries will not allow then to travel.  Welcome to COVID-19 world.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>337 

</span></p>
<p><span>This is the reality.  So some things have actually slowed down as a result of that, but that is what we 

are doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to highlight very quickly is that, in the 

meantime as the Honourable Minister for Housing said, we need to increase the stockpile of homes.  

When you increase the stockpile of homes, there is less pressure on demand for housing.  So if the 

private sector local  investors are coming, doing  strata title, if the Ministry  of Housing is  offering 

$30,000 grant, if you are building your first home, the banks are lending people money.  There is a 

demand for it.  So when people build their own homes, there is less people asking for homes, so the 

others can move up the ladder.  You have to have a multi-pronged approach, giving people ownership 

of homes and the opportunity to do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I lastly want to highlight is that, the formalisation of 

squatter areas is also very critical.  Formalisation of squatter areas means that we go and talk to the 

landowners or we have the Lands Department where people have been living there for years and we 

actually give them proper 99-year leases.  Once they get the formalisation, they get the road, water, 

electricity and 99-year leases, then they can actually go to the bank, use their proper lease title as a 

security to mortgage their homes and build proper homes.  They do not have to live in shacks because 

when you have a year to year tenancy, no one is going to put a concrete home, they are going to put 

a tin home.  When there is a cyclone, it will get blown away.  But you have the ability to mortgage 

that land, provide security and get money from the bank to put a concrete home.  That is the reality 

of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, it is not a matter that can be solved overnight, but we are working, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, in that respect and I hope the Opposition understands that.  I know some of them on the other 

side see the squatter areas as the vote bank and go and make all sorts of promises to them, all out of 

thin air.  That is fundamentally, Honourable Tabuya’s </span><span>modus operandi</span><span> to go to the squatter areas, 

offer them unrealistic enticements and then come to this Parliament and pontificate on unrealistic 

basis.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney- General.  Honourable Members, it is 

not very often that I do this, but I will suspend the debate on this motion now, and we will carry on 

after we have had a lunch break.  I will take the Honourable Tuisawau as the speaker to lead off after 

the lunch break.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, it has been brought to my attention that there has been a typographical 

error  in  today’s  Order  Paper  with  respect  to  the  second  motion  for  debate  under  Schedule.  

Honourable Members, please take note that ‘31May 2019’ should be corrected to ‘13 May 2019’. I 

have  instructed  the  Secretariat  to  upload  the  amended  Order  Paper  on  the  Parliament  website.    I 

apologise for that error.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, we will now take a lunch break and after the lunch, we will proceed 

</span></p>
<p><span>with the debate and the Honourable Tuisawau will take the floor.  We adjourn for lunch.

<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.32 p.m. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, we will continue from where we left off before</p>
<p><span>lunch and I now give the floor to the Honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion 

on the Public Rental Board.  The latest Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2013 &amp; 2014 

indicates that our total  housing stock is  around 184,335 units evenly set  between rural  and urban 

areas  with  an  average  household  size  of  4.7  per  family.    Around  57  percent  of  houses  consist  of 

reasonably  well-constructed  timber  frame  and  a  further  40  percent  of  houses  are  of  concrete  and 

masonry construction. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst the average population growth is around 0.7 percent, the urban population is growing 

at an annual average of 1.5 percent and an average -0.1 percent annually in our rural areas.  Again, 

as I mentioned, this is the 2013-2014 survey and given the COVID-19, the rural data would have 

changed drastically in the last 12 months.  The annual average growth of 1.5 percent in our urban 

population  clearly  suggests  that  more  pressure  is  on  urban  housing  compared  to  rural  housing.  

According to the 2013/2014 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), there are more than 

186  informal  settlements  in  Fiji  with  a  population  of  53,611  or  12  percent  of  the  total  urban 

population and comprising 10,944 households.  The lack of affordable housing is one of the most 

pressing problems in urban areas.  Rising costs have made it hard for low income earners to access 

affordable housing, leading to the rise in squatter settlements.  The influx of foreign buyers in the last 

few years has worsen the problem of (lack of) affordable housing for a lot of people.  So, as mentioned 

by the previous speaker, Sir, the ongoing issue of housing will continue to be a major problem. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Minister  also  mentioned  the  merging  of  PRB  and  possibly  Housing 

Authority of Fiji.  I would like to highlight a few issues from there, in particular on the Acts or on 

the  legislation.    The  Housing  Act  1955  which  was  amended  by  the  Public  Enterprises  Act  2019, 

whereby  it  is  amended  in  Section  A  –  32,  inserting  “responsible  for  public  enterprise  in  writing, 

subject to the approval of the Honourable Prime Minister”.  This is with regards to the board members 

- “The board shall consist of no more than six (6) members appointed by the Minister responsible for 

Public Enterprises in writing, subject to the approval of the Honourable Prime Minister.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>So  the  Housing  Authority  of  Fiji  Board  is  appointed  by  the  Public  Enterprises  Minister, 

however, following are two of the principles of public enterprise as specified in the Public Enterprises 

Act 2019: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(a)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(b)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The  principle  of  commercial  objective  where  a  public  enterprise  must  operate  on  a 

commercial basis that is efficient and profitable.  

The  principle  of  measurable  performance  where  public  enterprise  must  identify  its 

business  goals,  responsible  management,  competent,  honest  and  accountable  and 

transparent performance.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned, there is probably conflict in terms of this legislation and as mentioned by the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister, this is something that they will need to look at in detail.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Under the Housing Act, on “Conditions to be observed by the Housing Authority of Fiji in 

letting and selling houses: Section16(1) – in selling or leasing houses or providing loans or other 

facilities to assist workers to purchase, lease, build or otherwise obtain houses, the objective of the 

Authority shall not be to make a profit ...”  So, what I am highlighting is, in the merger of PRB and 

the Housing Authority of Fiji which is also governed by the Public Enterprises Act, those three (3) 

pieces of legislation might need to be examined in detail and I suppose there needs to be widespread 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>339 

</span></p>
<p><span>extensive public consultation because it will definitely impact on them, how these organisations are 

governed  and  also  the  deliveries  as  you  will  need  to  reconcile  the  conflicting  principles  as  I 

mentioned.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by some of the previous speakers and also the Honourable 

Minister,  I  also  highlight  from  the  five-year  and  20-year  national  development  plans  a  particular 

clause  or  strategy  which  I  shall  read  out:  “Annual  review  of  government  subsidies  to  housing 

providers and develop strategies to graduate residents of low income Housing Assistance and Relief 

Trust (HART) and PRB housing towards Housing Authority of Fiji programmes.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>The issue I have is, in the Annual Report there is no update on that.  There is no separate 

section which updates us on that in terms of these strategies to graduate residents.  That has been 

mentioned by the Honourable Minister and the question is, are there any strategies because those are 

neither in the Report nor have they been highlighted by the Committee.  What are these strategies?  

Have they been implemented and what  are the results?   That was the 2016 Report, hopefully the 

Annual Reports which come in this year or in the next following years will contain that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On the update regarding the programmes and projects,  I have noticed that the Honourable 

Minister  mentioned in terms of PRB renovation and construction the number of units: Kalabu - 36, 

Savusavu - 48 (have just been completed). I understand that was supposed to be completed in 2017 

and 2018.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In Simla, that was the target objective that was supposed to be completed in 2018/2019 but 

</span></p>
<p><span>yet that is still in progress.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2019/2020, Namaka - 57; 2020/2021, Raiwaqa/Suva - 150; and 2021/2022, Raiwaqa/Suva 

- 200. So we can see that the progress is not in accordance with the National Development Plans for 

various reasons which have been highlighted by the Honourable Minister regarding the constraints.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  matters  related  to  this  particular  Auditor-General’s  Report,  on  the  unallocated 

Government subsidy, in 2016, the Board received $1 million subsidy from Government to provide 

affordable rental accommodation to low income earners as they work towards home ownership.  Our 

review for Government Subsidy Scheme revealed that the Board has not been able to allocate the 

subsidy promptly to the tenants.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  at  31st  December,  2016,  a  sum  of  $387,320  remained  unallocated  which  included 

unallocated balances of $44,618 for 2016 and $342,702 from previous years. The Board agreed that 

subsidy has to be effectively allocated to qualifying tenants.  The question is, how effectively has 

PRB worked on this recommendation on allocating these subsidies?  What measures have been taken 

by the Board to ensure that the ongoing problem of unallocated balances of Government subsidy is 

allocated? What has happened to the previous balances? Of course, they have also highlighted the 

reminder notices, what operational changes have been done to address this?  Those are some of the 

issues I thought I would raise.  The other one was on IT systems in terms of access and some issues 

associated with that.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report - PRB 2016 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members of the Committee.  I agree with the recommendation and we are debating here 

to note the recommendation and also the improvements probably that will be taken on board by the 

Government of the day.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just a few things that I would like to raise probably for the Honourable Minister to take on 

board: in the recent flooding in Labasa, the water level came right to the third louvre mark in the 

PRB flats at Naodamu, and took them more than five days to be kept at the PRB Hall and they are 

slowly returning there after that clean-up. Probably in future, if you can look into relocating those 

flats to higher grounds or moving into double storey flats like the ones we have in Suva given climate 

change and other things that come in as climate mitigation measures.  That is one of the things that 

we could consider on this. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, we used to be paying $20 subsidy, it has gone up to $40 just recently and probably 

given the effects of COVID-19  plus the effects of the floods and also other climate conditions that 

are coming frequently now, if that could be reviewed too. On the other hand, we also need PRB to  

earn income for its maintenance and administration but these are some of the issues raised by some 

of the tenants and their welfare.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other thing that was raised to me in terms of the facilities that they have, especially their 

halls at the rate they are paying now per tenant.  If they want to use the current hall that is in their 

PRB compound it is about $20 per tenant for those that are living in. The rate for those coming from 

outside is $30 per night for any function.  Given that they are living close to each other, that is the 

only option they have and those are some of the things that are in common use in those kinds of 

situations.  Those are a few things probably the Honourable Minister can take on board.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We agree that there is work done.  I think we cannot argue much in saying who has done 

more and who has done less but again it is a progressive thing and we are moving towards trying to 

attain them like any other country in the world is doing right now.  As we move along, we can do 

better and make the changes, I think, with the innovations that are coming in to see that we actually 

achieve the mission and vision which this institution carries.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu.</span><span>

<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Bulitavu for his contribution to the debate:</span> I now</p>

<p><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wanted  to  implore  with  the  Minister  for  future  Annual 

Reports of PRB.  I think this is 2016 and now we are in 2020.  Could the Minister further enlighten 

the House in terms of addressing the real issues which is the demand for housing.  I was waiting to 

hear  whether  the  Minister  would  state  some  figures  in  terms  of  the  number  of  people  who  have 

applied for the flats that are available at PRB and for the period in which they have been waiting for.  

That will ensure and assist the Members of this House to see that the housing issue will be resolved 

by the National Housing Policy in which the Honourable Minister has also alluded to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was not forthcoming from the Honourable Minister and 

maybe for future reports she could also inform the House on the progress in terms of the flats that are 

constructed.  How many people will be catered in accordance with the applicants that are there? Are 

there 2,000 applicants on the waiting list or 3,000 applicants on the waiting lists? So, these is the 

information that will give confidence to this side of the House to ensure that the issue of housing is 

resolved.

</span></p>
<p><span> Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of existing PRB flats, one of the existing issue there is the 

standard compliance in terms of safety and living condition in these respective flats.  Most of the 

time they have been left unattended in terms of repairs and maintenance and this is something that 

probably the PRB needs to also look at.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  terms  of  merging  the  Public  Rental  Board  and  Housing  Authority,  these  these  are  two 

different entities.  The PRB if I read it correctly looks after low income earners and the HA looks 

after the middle income earners.  The Honourable Minister can correct me on that one but in merging 

the two, these are two different organisations.  One is looking after the low income earners and the 

respective roles and responsibilities that they carry out.  Housing Authority gives out loan assistance 

to its customers while PRB does not.  So, when they merge these two entities, what will happen to 

the PRB tenants?  Will they be able to access the loan facility that are given by HA to allow them to 

fulfil  that  mission  in  which  to  promote  migration  to  home  ownership?  If  that  is  the  basis  of  the 

merger,  then  well  and  good.    We  can  be  rest  assured  that  this  process  of  mitigating  the  housing 

demand will be met by this process of merging the two entities. If the merging is just to combining 

the two resources within the two departments then unfortunately this demand will continue to occur 

in future years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other thing that also needs to be highlighted in this House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need 

for  housing  cannot  be  resolved  alone.    It  has  to  go  together  with  the  development  plan  of  the 

government  because  when  you  develop  land,  you  will  need  infrastructure  like  water,  sewerage, 

electricity and other economic entities that needs to be together with housing and also  some other 

facilities that will ensure that people enjoy in their place of stay.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So, these are some of the things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that probably the Minister, in future PR B 

Reports or Housing Authority Reports would like to enlighten the House to ensure that the demand 

for housing is something that she is working towards to resolve in the years to come.  Thank you 

very much.
