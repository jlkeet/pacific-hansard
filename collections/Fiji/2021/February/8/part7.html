<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CHAIR</h3>
<p><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CHAIR 

</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  welcome  all  Honourable  Members  to  the  first  Parliament  Sitting  of</p>
<p><span>2021 and I look forward to working with you all, again, throughout the year. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  also  welcome  all  those  watching  the  live  broadcast  and  the  live  streaming  of  today’s 

proceedings from the comfort of their homes, offices and electronic devices.  Thank you for your 

continued interest in the workings of your Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Non-Smoking Signs 

</span></p>
<p><span>For  the  information  of  all  Honourable  Members,  I  have  issued  instructions  for  the  ‘Non-

Smoking  Signs’  to  be  put  up  across  the  Parliament  precincts,  including  inside  the  offices.    The 

secretariat will continue with these works in the course of the week.  The designated ‘Smoking Area 

Sign’ will also be put up.  I expect that everyone will take heed and adhere to these.

<p><span>Urgent Oral Question 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, additionally, I am to inform the Honourable Members that I received 

notification of an Urgent Oral Question from Honourable Professor Biman Prasad this morning.  I 

have had a look at the question and rule that the Question is not of an urgent character or relates to a 

matter  of  public  importance,  therefore,  it  does  not  qualify  as  an  Urgent  Question  under  Standing 

Order 43(1).  

</span></p>
<p><span>Adjournment Motion 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  I  also  received  an  Adjournment  Motion  from  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition under Standing Order 36.  I have considered the nature of the Adjournment Motion, and 

rule that the matters raised in the Adjournment Motion are not something that requires the immediate 

attention of Parliament or the Government. Therefore, the Adjournment Motion is disallowed under 

Standing Order 36(2). 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I wish to remind all Members that Parliament must always respect the 

</span></p>
<p><span>doctrine of separation of powers. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you, Honourable Members 

</span></p>
