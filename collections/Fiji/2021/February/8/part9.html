</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report on the 2017 Audit Report on Social Services Sector –  

Standing Committee on Public Accounts 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Committee Review Report</p>
<p><span>on the 2017 Audit Report on Social Services Sector.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Report covers the audit results of the five Government Ministries and Departments under 

the Social Services Sector and these include; the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts/Higher 

Education Institutions, Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Department of Housing, Ministry 

of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to note that Ministries and Departments that were scrutinised by the Committee 

were not invited for interview because of the COVID-19 restrictions that were in place at that time 

but were requested instead to provide a written response on audit issues that were raised in the audit 

report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The audit highlighted that four out of the five Ministries in the Social Services Sector were 

</span></p>
<p><span>issued with an unqualified audit opinion and one was issued with a qualified audit opinion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Out of these, four Ministries were provided with an unqualified audit opinion with attention 

drawn  in  some  instances.  The  qualified  audit  report  emanated  from  issues  ranging  from 

unsubstantiated  and  unreconciled  general  ledger  account  variances,  accounting  irregularities  in 

account  balances,  non-disclosure  of  account  balances,  board  of  surveys  either  not  carried  out  or 

carried out but the losses were not approved or not recorded as losses to government and stock take 

were not carried out.     

</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the Committee’s review of the Audit Report highlighted that capacity was an 

inherent issue with accounting officers lacking the basic fundamentals required for reconciling and 

maintaining accounts, lack of basic financials report trainings, lack of monitoring and supervision by 

Manager Finance and senior management.

<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>307 

</span></p>
<p><span>This report contains few recommendations and observations made by the Committee. These 

recommendations  have  been  made  in  good  faith,  and  we  urge  the  relevant  party  to  which  the 

recommendation  is  made,  to  consider  and  respond  accordingly.  Some  of  the  pertinent 

recommendations made are as follows:  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Economy should increase staffing and resources in their Internal Audit Division 

in  order  to  be  able  to  conduct  (quarterly  and  bi-annual)  internal  audit  inspections  to  all 

Ministries and Departments.  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Economy should consider regular and timely training for all Ministries Accounts’ 

Officers  on  FMIS  and  ensure  that  the  system  is  compatible  with  actual  operations  of  the 

Ministries and Departments; 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Ministries and Departments should ensure that daily reconciliations are conducted and also 

strengthen their internal controls in terms of circulation of duties, and conducting supervisory 

checks. 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Ministries and Departments should ensure that procurement of technical equipment, such as 

generators,  pharmaceuticals,  vessels,  mechanical  equipment,  non-sugar  access  roads  for 

example, are carried out by competent personnel, particularly where procurements are made 

from abroad.  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Finally, Ministries and Departments should promptly take action on valid recommendations 

</span></p>
<p><span>made by the Office of the Auditor-General and the Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At this juncture, I wish like to thank my fellow Committee Members, namely; Honourable 

Alvick Maharaj,  the Chairperson;  former MP, Vijendra Prakash; Honourable Aseri Radrodro and 

Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa; for their efforts and contribution in the scrutiny process of the Audit 

Report and the final compilation of the Report.  I also extend my gratitude to the Honourable Mikaele 

Leawere, who stood in as an Alternate Member.
