<h3>REVIEW REPORT ON THE  
OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL ANNUAL REPORT 2015</h3>
<p><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE  

OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL ANNUAL REPORT 2015  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move that:</p>
<p><span>Parliament debates the Review of the Office of the Auditor-General Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>2015 which was tabled on 13th May, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable  Members,  I  now  invite  the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the</p>
<p><span>Standing Committee on Public Accounts to speak on his motion.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prime Minister, the Honourable Leader 

of  the  Opposition,  Honourable  Ministers  and  Honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  as  Deputy 

Chairperson of the Public Accounts Standing Committee (PAC) to move this motion,   I take this 

opportunity to speak on the motion on the Review made by PAC on the Office of the Auditor-General 

2015 Annual Report which was tabled in Parliament on 13th May, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At the outset, it is important to note that the report that is before the House for debate has 

been  majority  contributed  by  the  previous  Public  Accounts  Standing  Committee  and  was  further 

reviewed and endorsed by the current Public Accounts Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, the Office of the Auditor-General has been established under Section 152 of the 2013 

Constitution with the primary role to inspect, audit and report to Parliament on the public accounts 

of the State, the control of public money and public property of the State and all the transactions with 

or concerning public or public property of the State.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  the  Audit  Act  1969  further  empowers  the  Auditor-General  to  audit  the  Whole  of 

Government Financial Statements and the reports of all entities of the Government.  It also empowers 

the  Auditor-General  to  conduct  performance  audits  of  Government  Entities  and  this  assures 

Parliament that the entities are achieving their objectives effectively and in doing so economically 

and in compliance with all relevant legislation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Act also extended the scope of audit to include those that are specified under the Public 

Enterprise Act, comprising Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities 

and  agencies  specified  as  Off-budget  State  Entities  in  the  Financial  Management  Act.    Also,  the 

Environment Management Act required the Auditor-General to conduct a sustainable development 

assurance  audit  on  natural  resources  managed  by  ministries,  departments,  authorities  or  local 

authorities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commended the efforts of the OAG on the work carried out 

so far in the areas of environmental audit and hope that it will continue to progress into other areas 

such as climate change, one extractive industries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  acknowledged  the  objective  approach  on  gender  breakdown  by  positions 

provided by the OAG in its recent reports which promotes SDG-5 on Gender Equality.  Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, the OAG had worked tirelessly and continues to send reminders and follow-ups on the respective 

Provincial  Councils  and  Municipal  Councils  in  relation  to  the  issues  of  non-submission  and  late 

submission of accounts for audit. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OAG has in place measures to address those 

issues  in  consultation  with  all  the  affected  entities  and  the  recent  reports  shows  improvement  on 

actions that were taken.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report-2015 OAG Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>343 

</span></p>
<p><span>To conclude, I sincerely commend the effort of the previous Public Accounts Committee in 

the compilation of this report and also the OAG in providing the necessary technical support towards 

the scrutiny of all the audited reports referred from the House. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with these comments as a Member moving the motion on this PAC Report,</p>
<p><span>I thank you for this opportunity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Committee 

for his motion.  Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion and I give the 

floor to the Honourable Aseri Radrodro.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise as a Member of the Public 

Accounts  Committee  who  prepared  this  report  and  speak  in  support  of  the  motion  and  the 

recommendations  therein  in  this  report.  We  note  that  the  OAG  is  a  critical  and  a  very  important 

stakeholder in the public sector corporate governance.  To allow them to carry out their work, they 

need to be fully resourced to enable them to conduct their work as an auditor of the Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note that their legal framework is registered under Section 151 of the 

2013 Constitution with regards to their set up, and it is something that they have been challenged to 

conduct the audit of Ministries and Departments, Government Commercial Companies, Off-budget 

State Entities and Statutory Authorities of Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of these audits have been delayed because of limitations of resources they have.  They 

have been requesting for more resources to ensure that they complete the audit on time.  Not only 

that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  Ministries  and  Departments  continuously  delay  in  terms  of 

submission  of  their  Annual  Financial  Report  for  auditing  purposes.    During  Public  Accounts 

Committee  meetings,  they  have  always  continuously  raised  about  the  laxities  in  some  of  the 

Ministries and Departments.  They do not take the conduct of audit very seriously because they see 

it as not a very important element to address the issues within their Ministries and Departments.   

</span></p>
<p><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  also  there  is  a  need  for  the  OAG  to  have  specialised  skills  within  the 

Ministry.   We now have climate  change used by Government  to  highlight  climate issues and the 

environmental Acts and regulations have also been implemented, passed before this House to ensure 

that they comply during the process of application for environmental assessment.. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an area that they lack and it has also been highlighted by the Office 

of the Auditor General.  They do not have environmental specialists to assist them to carry out their 

environmental audit.  At the moment, they are just staffs with finance and commercial backgrounds, 

so they lack the capacity to conduct environmental audits and this is an area that they wish to also 

have expertise on. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, in carrying out their audit work, there are ministries and departments, 

government commercial companies which they cannot conduct audits because they are limited by 

the Public Enterprise Act or the Articles of the Association of the respective commercial companies.  

Some of the institutions that they seem to not conduct audit on are Fiji Sugar Corporation; Fiji Pine 

Limited; Air Terminal Services; and Fiji Airways - these are entities which are majority owned by 

government.  The minority owned entities by government are Amalgamated Telecom Holdings; Fiji 

Ports; and Ports Terminal Limited. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conduct of these audits are usually done by private entities and we all 

know fully well, that when private entities conduct the audit, at the end of the day, it is the bottom 

line that determines how they conduct the work, irrespective of how big the organisation is.  It is 

</span></p>
<p><a name="44">Page 44</a></p>
<p><span>344 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report-2015 OAG Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>usually the bottom line that determines how they conduct the audit.  When you compare that to how 

the  Auditor  General  does  the  audit,  it  is  pretty  quiet  different  because  they  have  roles  and 

responsibilities to ensure that they report back to the House and they will be scrutinised under the 

Public Accounts Committee.  Most of the times they used to debates with the respective entities on 

the issues that they brought up.   

</span></p>
<p><span>These  are  some  of  the  things  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  recommended  by  the  Committee 

highlighted in the report.  Lastly, on the gender issues, we would like to also thank the Office of the 

Auditor General  who have, in  their annual  report,  also  highlighted that they are working towards 

gender  balance  within  the  organisation  to  ensure  that  they  comply  with  the  requirements  of 

Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also of concern, is  the  delays of submission  of  accounts by municipalities and provincial 

councils.    We  had  recommended  that  these  entities  need  to  be  beefed  up  to  ensure  that  audited 

accounts  are  submitted  on  time  as  per  the  Financial  Act  and  most  of  these  entities  have  delayed 

audited accounts dating back to 2007, 2008.  We hope that the Honourable Minister will properly 

resource these institutions and also review the Audit Act to ensure that there are more audit firms 

available to conduct audits to address this backlog of audits. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, there are only four major auditing firms plus the Auditor General’s office.  They 

need to review the current Act of the Fiji Institute of Accountants to ensure you open up the market 

to audit firms so that they can carry out and address these delays in submissions of audited accounts 

by municipalities and provincial councils.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Aseri Radrodro for his contributions to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I give the floor to the Honourable Minister, you have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion that is 

before  the  House.    The  teams  of  special  administrators  as  well  as  the  newly  recruited  CEOs  of 

respective municipal councils have been specifically tasked to ensure the legislative provisions are 

complied by the councils.  All 13 municipal councils have been directed to prioritise the auditing of 

their accounts and to submit annual reports to the Ministry of Local Government for the Parliament.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  progress  on  the  submission  of  annual  reports  by  municipal 

councils, I can confirm a total of 31 annual reports were presented in Parliament in the last sitting, 

62 annual reports are ready for submission to the Cabinet, 18 annual accounts are with the Office of 

the Auditor-General (OAG) for auditing.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of strategies were adopted by the municipal councils to clear the 

backlog  of  pending  financial  statements  and  annual  reports.    These  are  recruitment  of  qualified 

personnel who can prepare accounts in-house rather than outsourcing. Outsourcing the preparation 

of  financial  statements  by  a  few  municipal  councils,  they  do  not  have  the  expertise  to  do  so.  

Procurement of accounting software that will bring about consistency in the preparation of financial 

statements  across  the  13  municipal  councils  and  finally  with  the  assistance  of  an  independent 

consultant, a new finance policy manual was developed for the councils.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation by the OAG to train the staff of the municipal councils 

in preparing quality annual financial statements for audit, is welcomed.  At the end of the day, the 

municipal councils will have the expertise to prepare the financial statements in a timely manner as 

required by the OAG.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.
