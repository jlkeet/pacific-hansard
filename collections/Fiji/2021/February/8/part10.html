<p><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make</p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:  

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>
</span><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service  and 

Communications; 

Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services; and  

Honourable Minister for Agriculture Waterways and Environment. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes.  After the Minister, I will then invite the Leader 

</span></p>
<p><span>of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There  will  also  be  a  response  from  the  Leader  of  the  National  Federation  Party  or  his 

</span></p>
<p><span>designate, to also speak for five minutes.  There will be no other debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 

</span></p>
<p><span>Economy Civil Service and Communications.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>COVID-19 Vaccines 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Honourable Minister for 

Health  will  be  speaking  later  today,  as  stated  by  you,  Sir,  on  Fiji’s  stellar  record  of  COVID-19 

containment.  I will be speaking now on Fiji’s economic recovery through the procurement of safe 

and effective COVID-19 vaccines.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amid the global pandemic, Fiji is one of the safest places on earth and we 

thank God everyday that we have our health and I am sure we all do that.  But all it takes is one drive 

down the Coral Coast, through Denarau, or up the Hibiscus Highway to see the obvious.  We are not 

necessarily alright.  Life is far from normal, for far too many of our friends and family members 

whose jobs and businesses, and industries they count on are stuck in what feels like a bottomless rut 

due to this global pandemic. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, globally, this is the most brutal poverty-inducing crisis in living memory 

and with global cases surpassing 106 million worldwide, it is clear there is only one way the world 

will  ever  return  to  normal.    The  same  way  we  defeated  polio,  measles,  tetanus  and  other  former 

plagues, the Coronavirus will only be stopped by vaccines.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The fact that safe and effective vaccines are available to us at all is nothing short of a medical 

miracle.  These remarkable advances have given humanity a chance to defend ourselves from this 

pandemic, in a manner that does not decimate our economies because immunisation, once achieved, 

protects a nation better than any border possibly can, even one as well-managed as Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As  of  this  weekend,  over  128  million  doses  of  various  COVID-19  vaccines  have  been 

administered in 73 countries around the world.  Compare that to the grand total of zero in Fiji and 

other sovereign Pacific island nations.  The story is much the same across small island States and the 

Global South.  So far, this is shaping up to be a rich country’s race.  At present, countries with just 

16 percent of the world’s population have bought up 60 percent of the world’s vaccine supply and 

that means, the world’s recovery risks being relegated to that concentrated group of countries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Medically, that does not make sense.  We know no nation is safe unless all nations are safe.  

Morally, it is indefensible.  As it means, the gap between the developed and developing countries, as 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>309 

</span></p>
<p><span>well as large and small nations will grow wider than ever. Fiji must secure our place in the world’s 

economic comeback by securing vaccines as soon as we can, not months after the rest of the world 

but alongside.  Otherwise, our people will be made more vulnerable than they have ever been exposed 

to infection, economically-disadvantaged and left behind, as the rest of the world races ahead. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  imagine  the  alternative.    Say  we  sit  timidly  by  through  the  coming 

months, fail at securing and procuring vaccines in a timely manner and keep Fiji on the margins of 

the global economic resurgence.  Other future-focussed tourism destinations which immunise their 

populations will reopen their borders and welcome back visitors.  Meanwhile, our hotel rooms will 

sit empty.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Those  other  nations  will  recreate  jobs  while  Fijians  remain  unemployed.    Foreign  airline 

companies will get their planes back in the air, while our national carrier risks not flying scheduled 

flights at all.  That is not ground that can be simply made up down the road.  Everyday, we lose out 

on that recovery, will place exponentially rising costs on our economy, costs that are too high to be 

measured and too astronomical to ever accept. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  success  of  our  recovery  hinges  on  our  timing.    That  is  why  every 

Government is laser-focussed on procuring vaccines now.  Even New Zealand, one of the few nations 

to match Fiji’s success against the virus, is focussed on getting “jabs in arms” as they say, as quickly 

as  possible.    Safe  as  they  may  be  today,  the  Kiwis  know  they  cannot  afford  to  drop  the  ball  on 

immunisation, neither can Fiji.  Yes, there is a cost to procurement.  But it pales in comparison to 

what we will lose if we fall behind and our major source markets send their tourists to more forward-

thinking countries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the global effort at equitable vaccination distribution is led through a facility 

known as COVAX.  Technically, it is a vaccine distribution arm of the COVID-19 Tools  Accelerator, 

which also covers tests and treatments.  COVAX is jointly led by GAVI - the Vaccine Alliance, the 

Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) 

and aims to secure and distribute 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.  So far, 

a 191 countries, including Fiji, and most recently the United States, have signed up to participate in 

the COVAX Facility.  Of this, Fiji is part of a group of around 92 countries that are eligible for donor-

funded doses. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, here is the rub - the timeline for COVAX is anything but guaranteed.  It 

could be many months, or even a full year until we get enough vaccines to cover a mere 15 percent 

of  our  population,  far  below  anything  approaching  “herd  immunity”,  which  is  the  level  of 

immunisation that makes transmission all but impossible.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Rich  countries  are  clear-eyed  about  the  urgency  of  getting  as  many  people  vaccinated  as 

quickly as they can, and for good reason.  They want their economies back, they want their jobs back, 

they want their lives back and they want their people protected.  They will not wait, we cannot either.  

Patiently awaiting our turn in the global COVAX queue would be economic-suicide for the country. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, we’re going to work with this facility as much as possible, but we are not going to 

bet our people’s lives and livelihoods on it alone.  Instead, we are working on a bilateral basis with 

our  development  partners  to  secure  financial  resources  to  buy  vaccines  now,  as  well  as  secure 

shipments  of  the  vaccines  themselves.    So  far,  Australia  and  India  have  stepped-up  with  direct 

funding and shipment support, and we will provide updates on other bilateral arrangements as they 

finalise.  

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are also keen to make direct purchases from the companies producing viable vaccines.  If 

you consider our eligible population in Fiji, we are looking at around 1.3 million doses.  In the USA, 

they are vaccinating at a rate of 1.43 million doses per day, so this is a marginal number of vaccines. 

With the right support, we can make it happen soon.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are currently more than 50 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in trials.  

With the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine being the first one to have been listed on the Emergency Use List 

(EUL) by WHO, several country regulatory bodies have approved the Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford-

AstraZeneca vaccines through their stringent regulatory authorities.  

</span></p>
<p><span>A number of vaccines such as Janssen by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sputnik of Russia, and the 

Chinese Sinovac are still in the third phase of trials. The rest of the vaccines are in first or second 

phase trials. Our standards for the vaccines we will accept are as high as they are anywhere.  Once a 

vaccine is  medically trialled and deemed safe  and effective by reputable  country medical  boards, 

such as Australia or the United States, we consider them as options on the table.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, procuring the vaccine or vaccines, is only part one.  Rolling them out nationwide 

will be the most complex logistical exercise in Fijian history.  It is critical we have a plan in-place 

today. Unlike many larger nations whose rollouts are suffering from inconsistent implementation, 

Fiji can and should be able to vaccinate our population quickly and more efficiently.  Our medical 

staff are battle-tested in vaccination campaigns, and we will lean heavily on their vast experience. 

But  due  to  the  nature  of  COVID-19  vaccines,  this  will  be  a  far  more  data-focussed  and 

technologically-intensive campaign.  

</span></p>
<p><span>COVID-19 vaccines are almost all stored at extremely cold temperatures and most require 

two doses. Mr Speaker Sir, in terms of cold chain requirements - for the Pfizer vaccine, it is minus 

80 degrees Celsius.  Moderna requires storage of minus 20 degrees Celsius, equivalent to that of a 

deep  freezer,  and  AstraZeneca  and  all  the  other  vaccines  are  stored  at  normal  refrigerated 

temperatures of 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius. Should the Pfizer vaccine be made available in Fiji, 

we have the required high-degree cold chain facilities, including the capacity to manufacture dry ice 

to allow storage of up to 30 days. The Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and all the other vaccines are 

well within Fiji’s cold chain capacity.  

</span></p>
<p><span>With the exception of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, all other vaccines, including Pfizer, 

AstraZeneca and Moderna, require two doses per person. That requires careful biometric tracking, 

and we have a digital registry in development now that will ensure Fijians are vaccinated in line with 

the most effective dosage timelines.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign will cover all individuals above the age of 18 years, 

as all clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines were conducted on this age group. Given our unique 

status as a COVID-contained country, our priority group for Phase 1 will be our Front-liners - all 

individuals in border control at sea and air ports; front-line health care and hotel workers, and their 

immediate family members.  Phase 2 will cover vulnerable persons, including but not limited to those 

with  pre-existing  comorbidity  issues,  for  example,  diabetes,  hypertension  and  cardiac  issues 

including rheumatic heart diseases, et cetera.  Phase 3 will cover all those above 60 years of age, 

followed by any other person above the age of 18. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we  are closely monitoring the latest  efficacy of proven  vaccines  against 

emerging strains of the virus.  It may be the case that booster doses are required at later stages.  In 

the meantime, developed nations are pressing ahead with the vaccines they have available.  As they 

should,  the  science  supports  it,  but  we  should  not  go  into  this  expecting  that  vaccines  will 

immediately send life back to normal and keep it that way forever.   There will be a gradual process 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>311 

</span></p>
<p><span>and many of the good habits and health protection measures we have adopted, must remain.  They 

may always be with us in some form.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we expect the COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in phases throughout 2021, starting 

in the first  quarter.  As highlighted previously, our vaccination  campaign will be implemented in 

phases according to the schedule of vaccine supplies and deployed in order of priority.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The phase supply of vaccines will make deployment somewhat complicated as priority groups 

need  to  be  pre-identified,  tagged  and  tracked  according  to  the  deployment  plan  for  each  batch.  

However, mitigation measures are being planned to safeguard the effectiveness of the campaign.  On 

the  other  hand,  a  guaranteed  supply  of  1.3  million  doses  at  any  one  time,  of  say  AstraZeneca  or 

another vaccine with similar storage conditions could be easily deployed over 12 to 16 weeks, based 

on the Ministry of Health’s proven capacity and capability of vaccinating between 15,000 to 20,000 

Fijians per day.  We will ensure that the relevant authorities and stakeholders are fully prepared and 

pre-positioned to inoculate target groups as the consignments arrive into the country.  Much of this 

will be based on the type of vaccine we secure, and we are all preparing for viable options. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Given the absence of a national identification mechanism and a digital immunisation registry 

in  Fiji,  the  need  to  have  a  credible  registration  process  and  an  internationally  acceptable  vaccine 

passport  is  paramount.    This  is  where  other  countries,  who  have  robust  national  identification 

infrastructure,  coupled  with  biometrics,  are  able  to  deploy  these  vaccines  at  great  speeds  and 

accuracy.  Our priority is  to  authenticate the identity of the individual who is  getting vaccinated, 

accurately capture the vaccine doses taken and issue a vaccination passport, which I will discuss a 

bit more shortly.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To  do  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  will  also  soon  deploy  a  National  COVID-19 

Vaccine Registration for the administration of vaccines.  The point is to identify people prior to the 

vaccines arriving on our shores.  The registration can be done in two ways.  Firstly, self-registration 

whereby Fijians complete a registration form online from the comforts of their homes.  To log into 

the form, you will need to input your Birth Registration Number (BRN) which is evident on your 

Birth Certificate.  Also, for those who have registered for a digitalFIJI e-profile, the BRN can also 

be found on their secure e-profile account.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Once both these login details are correctly filled in, a form is generated which contains critical 

questions  that  will  need  to  be  answered.    Once  the  form  has  been  completed,  you  will  receive  a 

confirmation via text message and email, if you provide your email address. You will then be able to 

visit a designated facility to complete the registration by providing your biometric details.  Fijians, 

who do not have access to their birth certificates will be able to obtain their BRN by visiting the list 

of health facilities which will be published by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services in the 

next few weeks.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The second form of registration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is face-to-face registration whereby Fijians 

can visit designated registration centres to register and give their biometric details at the same time.  

After registration, Fijians will be notified when to go for vaccination via text.  The system that we 

are developing will be able to capture the two vaccine doses as and when it is carried out.  We are 

also considering the inclusion of a personalised, what we call a “digital wallet” whereby Fijians can 

have their vaccination details right on their smartphones.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The registration system and digital wallet that we are seriously considering are in compliance 

with  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organisation  (ICAO)  and  the  General  Data  Protection 

Regulations (GDPR) of the European Union.  This will allow for cross-border seamless verification 

and authentication, and also help us to travel.  The Ministry of Health and Medical Services as the 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>agency, will be making announcements of when the registration exercise will commence.  They are 

obviously working with the Ministry of Communications behind the scenes to develop these forms 

and also the digital process.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  us  talk  about  vaccine  passports.    Just  last  week,  the  Global  Tourism 

Crisis Committee called for a vaccine passport, saying it must become an essential travel document 

to help restart global tourism.  A vaccination passport is proof that the holder of the passport has been 

vaccinated against COVID-19.  This is crucial for assuring future travellers that Fiji is safe and open 

for business.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The vaccination passport could be an App on a mobile device, a QR code or barcode printed 

on a vaccination certificate, or an authenticated way of verifying the individual vaccine passports 

through information systems. We are actively exploring all possibilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, therefore, critically important that every eligible Fijian registers for 

vaccination. We cannot afford to jeopardise our safety and chances of economic recovery, which can 

only truly begin once the target population is completely vaccinated.  The sooner the process begins, 

the easier our rollout will be.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji suffered one of the most severe economic crises anywhere in the world.  

We are a remote service-based economy and unlike our friends in the Caribbean, our major markets 

- Australia and New Zealand, have much more strict border control policies than, for example, the 

USA.  This vaccine will protect us, it will save lives but it will also be a shot of live for our economy.  

It  will protect  our frontline officials  who risk their wellbeing to  help  Fijians come home.   It  will 

protect our tourism workers who hope everyday to fully return to the jobs they love.   It will protect 

those most vulnerable in our society, those who grimace every time they hear a person cough for fear 

of what it means for their everyday lives. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are pleased to have the full support of the Fijian tourism industry in this 

unprecedented effort to vaccinate our people and get our economy moving again.  The hotels have 

the unique capability to be able to provide additional vaccination venues.  Our national carrier, Fiji 

Airways, has offered to carry vaccines into Fiji, providing the necessary storage conditions, while 

our Airport Terminal Services has the capacity to produce dry ice.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Tourism transport providers, like buses and ferry services, are also willing to step in to help 

transport tourism frontline workers, while public transportation can feed in to bring members of the 

other services identified as frontline.  The good news is that the industry stakeholders are ready to 

work with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to map out schedules and logistics, and work 

with the Ministry of Communications in the digital effort that we are to putting in place, in particular 

for biometrics.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There  are  other  factors,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  we,  and  other  developing  countries,  must 

contend with.  We are not only competing with the citizens of wealthier countries due to what can 

only be described as active global sabotage, we are actually competing with developed world citizens 

that do not exist at all.  According to data analysis, with the pre-ordered vaccines, the European Union 

could inoculate its residents (about 447.7 million) twice, the United States - 382.2 million four times, 

and Canada - 37.5 million six times.  We are also urging these nations to supply their surplus vaccines 

to lower income countries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>To  meet  the  growing  supply-demand  gap,  several  countries  have  initiated  domestic 

production of medical products and/or are modifying existing medical products for the treatment of 

COVID-19 patients.   The rapid scaling up of manufacturing globally is an obvious multi-beneficial 

</span></p>
<p><a name="13">Page 13</a></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>313 

</span></p>
<p><span>solution to address the timely availability and affordability of medical products to all countries in 

need.  Fiji may not be able to produce vaccines, but we are fully capable of serving the Region as the 

hub of distribution.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Another important barrier to also consider is also misinformation on COVID-19 vaccines, a 

global trend that is threating the success of vaccination campaigns around the world from the UK 

and  USA  to  India  and  East  Asia.    Not  surprisingly,  research  has  found  a  significant  relationship 

between the spread of false information about COVID-19 vaccines and people’s reduced willingness 

to get vaccinated.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we should have an open, transparent and facts-based discussion about all the vaccines 

that we are considering, but we have to base those conversations in medical reality.  That starts in 

this Parliament and it carries to the grassroots of every Fijian community.  We have heard numerous 

stories, for example, from some cleaners at Suvavou House, who told us that their leaders in their 

faith-based organisations told them, “do not get vaccinated because it is something evil.”  We are 

urging,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  every  Fijian  to  do  more  than  refrain  from  sharing  or  spreading 

misinformation.  If you hear it, condemn it or even better help guide that person to facts.  Lives and 

livelihoods depend on it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We are talking about Fijians being able to put food on the table, businesses being able to run 

again, families separated by border closures being connected again, and lives of vulnerable Fijians 

being saved.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will say it again, if you hear people lying about these vaccines, 

please tell them, ‘do not lie about our economy, do not lie about our lives.  Please, stick to the facts.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this campaign is the most ambitious global and local effort 

that Fiji has ever undertaken.  The stakes are as high as they can be.  We have to procure vaccines 

now before the window of an inclusive economic recovery slams shut in our faces.  We are doing 

that through every avenue available to us, and we are willing and able to meet the costs of buying 

vaccines directly.  We do not want to wait around just for hand-outs.  We need to have a rollout plan, 

and we do.  We have a technology-backed, data-driven approach with private sector linkages that can 

achieve immunisation nationwide on a rapid timeline. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to be united.  God help us if this becomes a political issue.  We 

have spoken with too many Fijians who are out of work, too many business owners who are anxious 

about the future, and too many healthcare workers who are nervous for their wellbeing, to watch this 

effort  being  strangled  by  anyone’s  political  point-scoring.    This  is  a  national  effort  -  the  most 

important of our lifetime.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We must meet this momentum and moment together, equipped with nothing less than facts.  

We can protect our frontline workers, we can protect our lives, we can restore our livelihoods and 

we can give our economy the shot of life that it so badly needs.  That is what our people deserve, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, and that is exactly what we are going to do.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, the Honourable Minister for Economy, in his 

Ministerial  Statement  this  morning,  which  they  were  not  here  to  listen  to  and  participated  on, 

explained to the nation about the COVID-19 Vaccines Procurement Programme that is in place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This COVID-19 vaccines procurement is a strategy that is of a greatest importance for this 

nation now.  By their not being here, they have shown to the nation that they do not care about those 

who have lost their jobs.  They do not care about the tourism industry. They do not care about the 

vulnerable population. They do not care about the front liners. They do not care about Fijians.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> Shame!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Shameful.  Fiji  is  COVID-contained  and  as  of  today, 

Monday,  8th  February,  we  are  now  nearly  300  days  without  any  cases  within  the  community. 

Honourable Nawaikula, do not talk.  You were not here this morning to listen to what we are going 

to do, to save this nation and the economy of this nation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Globally, there have been 105 million cases of COVID-19 

reported, with more than 2.3 million deaths.  Cases are increasing with over 300,000 to 400,000 cases 

every  24  hours  and  10,000  deaths  every  24  hours.  Just  because  your  nation  can  start  having 

vaccination, it does not mean you will stop having COVID-19 straightaway or people would not die.  

As of last week, we had 26,635 cases in the Pacific, French Polynesia with over 18,000 cases and 

132 deaths.  Guam with over 7,000 cases and 129 deaths.  Papua New Guinea with over 800 cases 

and nine deaths. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the beginning of this, our scientists together with our experts sat down 

and went through an Epidemic Model and that was presented to the Honourable Prime Minister in 

the beginning of last year. In that Epidemic Model, we looked at something called R-zero where R-

zero is the possibility of somebody infecting someone else.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="15">Page 15</a></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>315 

</span></p>
<p><span>If R-zero is one or less than one, that means that infection can only infect one person.  We 

knew from them that COVID-19 was more than one, R was more than one, and we knew that if we 

allow this to go uninhibited within the community than we would be seeing the numbers that we are 

seeing here, 26,000 in French Polynesia.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We knew given our population if we had followed what they had suggested by not having a 

layered approach than this Nation would have seen at least 5 percent of the nation get infected which 

is about 40,000 to 50,000 people.  With a 5 percent, possibility of death would have been easily 2,500 

people die within this nation, if we had followed what they had said.  We decided not to because we 

follow science, we follow what the experts are telling us.  The same experts they have said to cut 

their pay by 35 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji has had 56 cases in total.  We have one active case at the moment and it is a historical 

case, currently admitted at the Lautoka Hospital, 53 recoveries and 2 deaths.  The last 38 cases have 

been detected in the mandatory 14 days boarder quarantine in the government designated quarantine 

facilities, supervised by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and the Republic of Fiji Military 

Forces. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 27,100 tests have been conducted with the daily average of about 150 tests.  

Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  even  though  there  is  only  one  case,  we  are  testing  150  because  we  are  testing 

widely.  We are testing those who are in the front line, we are also testing those who present to any 

of  our  75  early  warning  signs  with  approx.  of  fever,  cough,  or  being  admitted  to  hospital  with 

pneumonia or admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), needing ventilation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Our test positivity is 0.2 percent.  As well as testing people in our border quarantine facilities 

and as I have alluded to, we conduct surveillance testing right across the nation.  For example, if 

someone might actually turned up to Wainikoro Health Centre and have fever, and cough, they would 

be tested.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I must convey our appreciation to our border health protection team and they are everyone.  

They are not only Health, Disciplined Forces, Airports staff, Customs staff they all participate.  We 

hear of breaches in border quarantine in other countries but thanks to the men and women at our 

borders that we have not had a breach leading to a case in the community. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to touch again on this topic of a layered approach.  Some countries, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, had made it very clear in the beginning of COVID-19 that they would rest their 

laurels on their hospitals.  Some countries rested their laurel on the ability to be able to produce  a 

vaccine.  We did not.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We looked at a layered approach, a Swiss cheese approach where we knew that the layers in 

between would be able to cover that.  What are the layers?  The layers are the quarantine process that 

we have in place, the region and robust testing mechanisms that we have. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst we have RT-PCR, which is the test will require of people coming into Fiji and there 

are more than 1,000 panels of light throughout the world.  We only recognise 24.  There was a period 

of time where anyone in the Eastern sea border of USA who wanted to come to Fiji actually had to 

go to one particular lab in Washington that we recognise.  That is how pedantic we were, to be able 

to come to Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from the quarantine, also  the other measures  that we have  in  place, the Disciplined 

Forces actually managing the quarantine facilities.  The PPEs that we have, the designated isolation 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>facilities for those who are unwell.  The designated equipment that goes with the ventilators that we 

procure.  These are all part of the layered approach.  Also part of the layered approach is the slight 

restrictions that exist.  One continues to ask, what is the role of the curfew in terms of health?  This 

is what it does Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We know that the breaches in quarantine that has happened in New Zealand, Australia and 

all over the world have happened because people went out to go and buy something.  They went out 

to have a good time, they went out to go and see family and if for example, in the Nadi area, if we 

still had night clubs going for 24 hours, it will be a place where the people in quarantine will feel like 

they want to come out, so breaches could happen.  These are the many layers that are in place.  Not 

only a particular layer does solve it all.  All the many layers all contribute included in it is the slight 

restrictions that we currently have in place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We continue to build capacity and respond to this pandemic.  Since my last update, we have 

been using GeneXpert technology</span><span> </span><span>as this is now available in the three divisional hospitals of CWM, 

Lautoka and Labasa. This compliments the RT-PCR testing that we have.  We are also exploring 

opportunities  with  our  development  partners  for  developing  capacity  to  conduct  whole  genome 

sequencing for this virus.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, this was actually something that the Regional Director of WHO said to me in a 

zoom meeting.  He said, “Minister, your Fiji CDC molecular laboratory has grown from strength to 

strength.  We now believe that it is time that we can support to have genome testing so that we can 

be able to identify the variant or the strain where it comes from.”  This is a level that many countries 

around the world do not have.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we are also formalising the creation of border health protection unit in Nadi and 

this will also include a new Fiji CDC laboratory in Nadi and again it has come because development 

partners have seen the strength that we have shown in terms of our COVID-19 containment and the 

capacity within our laboratories and they want to support that. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.:</span> Hear, hear!</p>
<p><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  immunisation  is  a  global  health  and 

development success story saving millions of lives every year.  Currently, two million to three million 

deaths are prevented from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles and the list goes on.  

Immunisation is a key component of primary health care.  It is the best health investment money can 

buy in our effort to strengthen global health security and will be a vital tool against antimicrobial 

resistance.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we have shown the strength of our immunisation programme with the MECN 

Programme that was done.  We have also shown it with the measles campaign.  In 2018, Fiji faced 

the Meningococcal C outbreak.  We recorded 85 cases and 6 deaths.  In response, we conducted rapid 

test investigation and isolation and we vaccinated 91 percent or 292,000 of our target population of 

1 to 39 years.  With the measles campaign, November 2019, we vaccinated more than 98 percent or 

360,000  people  in  the  target  population.    Six  months  to  five  years,  a  19  to  39  years  old.    Those 

numbers do not include the many that are above the target population.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we have had zero measles outbreak cases after the outbreak last year.  We had 

just  one  meningococcal  case  last  year  and  no  deaths.    It  is  essential  for  us  to  understand  the 

importance of vaccination.  Mr. Speaker, the Honourable Attorney-General alluded to what we are 

doing  in  terms  of  procurement  of  the  vaccine  and  because  of  time,  I  want  to  talk  about  the 

misinformation on vaccine.  I want to reiterate the message that the Honourable Attorney-General 

</span></p>
<p><a name="17">Page 17</a></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>317 

</span></p>
<p><span>mentioned  this  morning,  as  we  progress  on  the  discussion  related  to  vaccines  and  proactively 

planning on getting them earliest to Fiji. A number of the false claims are emerging and I will list 

and address them now.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, there is a claim that the vaccine is a mark of “666” with the mark which will be placed 

inside you.  This is not true.  The smallest micro-chip, even if they exist is too large to insert in one 

immunisation shot.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly,  the  vaccine  contains  weak  products.    Again  this  is  not  true.    The  Pfizer  and 

Moderna vaccines are made from mRNA while the AstraZeneca from the DNA strand and contain 

lipids or fats and a few other products such as sucrose (sugar), salts, water for injections and amino 

acids.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Thirdly, the vaccine contains foetal products; this is again not true. It does not contain any 

foetal  cells,  blood  products,  mercury,  egg  or  latex  stoppers,  preservatives  or  pork  products.    Mr. 

Speaker, vaccinations that are currently widely used worldwide in Fiji are safe and side effects of 

these vaccines are usually minor and temporary such as sore arm or mild fever.             

</span></p>
<p><span>More serious side effects are possible but extremely rare.  Any licensed vaccine is rigorously 

tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use and regularly reassessed once it is 

introduced.  Scientists are constantly monitoring  information  from  all the sources, including  ours 

when we begin ours, for any sign that the vaccine may cause health risk.  Remember, you are far 

more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by vaccine.  For example, 

tetanus  can  cause  extreme  pain,  blood  clots,  measles  can  cause  inflection  of  the  brain  and  many 

vaccine-preventable  diseases  can  result  in  death,  including  COVID-19  as  we  are  seeing  with  the 

millions of deaths worldwide.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The benefits of vaccination greatly outweighs the risks and many more unnecessary deaths 

could  occur  without  vaccines.    We  have  competent  health  workers  who  have  been  administering 

vaccines for decades and as this vaccine is new to the world, we continue to strengthen our nursing 

capacity to ensure we deliver to the expectations of the nation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not possible to 

predict every individual who might have a mild or serious reaction to a vaccine, although there are 

few contraindications to some vaccines.  But following contraindications, the risk of serious adverse 

effects are minimised.  It must also be remembered that by the time anyone in Fiji gets vaccinated, 

millions  of  people  in  other  countries  around  the  world  will  have  already  received  their  vaccines.  

Therefore, we have the time to watch the effects of vaccines in other countries to ensure they are safe 

for our people. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite and encourage all our community leaders to assist the Ministry and 

the Government in addressing the misinformation around the vaccine, to discourage those who are 

spreading false information and support those who are vulnerable in our communities, so we are all 

well  placed  to  successfully  vaccinate  our  community  just  as  we  have  done  together  to  fight  the 

outbreaks in the past.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have developed our National Deployment Vaccination 

Plan, we have done consultations on the campaign with the medical team and development partners, 

and in this process we have the resource capacity, as alluded to by the Honourable Attorney-General.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  be  on  top  of  our  game,  we  have  the  right  number  of  staff  to  deliver 

efficiently  and effectively with minimal to no hiccups to service delivery, ensuring universal access 

to all Fijians regardless of how near or far one stays.  We will ensure that for every team carrying out 

vaccination, there is a medical doctor to support the team at all times and address any adverse event.  

Though, unlikely as mentioned earlier, that the adverse events are rare.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a programme that we have experience in.  As I have alluded to before, 

we have experience from the MenC vaccination campaign and we have experience from the measles 

vaccination  campaign.   Those experiences will be useful in  how we will roll this out.  As I have 

alluded to we are hoping that the Honourable Members on the other side of Parliament will show 

responsibility  and  leadership  by  not  spreading  fake  news  but  supporting  us  in  ensuring  that 

misinformation is cancelled and taken out that we will all support the vaccination programme.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also ensure to communicate as much as possible to everyone.  We have 

started doing it.  The Government Pages including the Ministry’s Pages and WHO Pages and apart 

from  this,  we  have  to  encourage  one  another  to  consider  giving  the  correct  information.    With 

registration process starting soon and the preparedness plans in the country, Fiji is ready to receive 

these lifesaving vaccines for the nation.  We intend to target more than 90 percent of all individuals 

who are eligible to receive vaccines.  When science is ready to tell us that it is safe to administer 

amongst children below 18, we will ensure to protect.  The objectives of these are simple – to protect 

all  Fijians  from  contracting  COVID-19  and  ensure  that  we  do  not  have  any  more  deaths  or 

complications.  These, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would allow us to leverage on the opportunities to open 

borders,  bring  our  economy  up  to  par  and  we  can  only  do  this  together.    This  needs  an  all-of-

Government and all-of-society approach like never before, we have done it together once and we can 

do it again for our beloved nation.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, I thank the Honourable Minister for Health and</p>
<p><span>Medical Services for his Ministerial Statement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now call on the designated speaker for the Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable  Dr. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Atonio Lalabalavu.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, I would like 

to thank the Honourable Minister for Health on his update with regards to COVID-19 contained issue. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the update on COVID-19 vaccine, there is no doubt that we 

must have a collective effort working with government to ensure that COVID-19 vaccine becomes 

available and accessible for all the people of Fiji.  Although we are considered a COVID-19 contained 

country, however the risks are still high due to those entering our border which we must continue to 

manage with stringent measures.  There are lessons to be learnt from experience in other countries 

like  the  United  States  and  United  Kingdom,  although  they  have  all  the  necessary  resources  and 

logistical arrangements, they still encounter challenges.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  would  urge  the  government  to  work  and  consult  very  closely  with  the  competent 

authority,  WHO,  to  ensure  that  the  vaccine  that  will  be  purchased  or  donated  meets  Fiji’s 

specification.  We must not accept donations because it is given to us free.  We must ensure that it is 

the right  dose for our people.   I believe there are a number of vaccines currently  available in  the 

market,  therefore,  we  should  not  rush  and  make  unnecessary  procurements.    We  must  take  a 

precautious approach rather than rushing into receiving free vaccines because we are dealing with 

people’s lives.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government should work with all key stakeholders to ensure the efficient and effective 

</span></p>
<p><span>way in the acquisition and immunisation programme: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>We must be very clear in the prioritisation of those that will be vaccinated first and there must 

</span></p>
<p><span>be clear public awareness of the programme. 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Logistical arrangements must be organised to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Processes and procedures must be in place to minimise delay. 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Better targeting to ensure accessibility; 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>We must ensure that the right type of vaccine is suitable and appropriate to the needs of our 

</span></p>
<p><span>people. 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>The tender process must be followed and we should learn from the COP 23 which was given 

</span></p>
<p><span>to Qorvis. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition  to  the  update  of  COVID-19  vaccine,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to  raise  a 

question on the restrictions of our freedom of movement by the 11.00 p.m. curfew under the Public 

Health Government Regulations issued by the Permanent Secretary for Health. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no scientific evidence to prove that by forcing people to stay home 

between 11.00 p.m. and 4.00 a.m. will help with the management and containment of the virus.  While 

we in these chambers are subject to the social distancing rules, this is not the case for the vast majority 

of Fijians outside of curfew hours, in particular sporting events.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge on the Honourable Minister and the Government to review 

the curfew because while the crime rate did reduce briefly, more crime is happening during the day 

and also because of the curfew.  All crimes are undesirable, but the curfew cannot be used to reduce 

crime.  It is appropriate for Government to increase support for law enforcement rather than locking 

down the whole nation with this draconian curfew. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I again thank the Honourable Minister for his update and I thank 

</span></p>
<p><span>you for the opportunity. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for his contribution to the debate:</span> There</p>
<p><span>being no designated speaker from the National Federation Party, we will move on.

<p><span>I  now  give  the  floor  for  the  next  Ministerial  Statement  to  the  Minister  for  Agriculture, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Waterways and Environment.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Devastating Impact of TC Yasa and TC Ana on the Agriculture Sector 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Prime Minister, the Leader of the</p>
<p><span>Opposition, and Honourable Members. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  this  morning  to  inform  this  august  House  through  my  ministerial 

statement, the Ministry of Agriculture’s response to the devastating impact of  </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>and more 

recently, </span><span>TC Ana </span><span>on Fiji’s Agricultural Sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  agriculture,  as  we  all  are  aware,  is  a  vulnerable  activity  that  is  highly 

susceptible to natural disasters, particularly cyclones and floods.  It is therefore imperative for the 

sustainable development of the sector that we are all prepared and have the right response plans in 

place  that  reflects  disaster  risk  and  resilience.    Only  then,  can  we  facilitate  quick  recovery.  

Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, building resilience will ensure that in the future, if there is a natural 

disaster such as a cyclone or flood, we are able to bounce back quickly. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Category 5 </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> made landfall in Fiji on the evening of 17th December, 

2020, with over 250 kilometres per hour wind speeds experienced in zone 1, located 50 kilometres 

from  the  centre  of  the  cyclone.    This  area  included  the  Bua  Province,  Macuata  and  Cakaudrove 

Provinces, parts of Lomaiviti Province, Koro Island, Naigani Island and the Lau Group.  Agriculture

<p><span>Ministerial Statements

<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>in  those  areas  were  severely  affected  and  reports  highlighted  significant  losses  due  to  damaging 

winds, coastal storm surge, flooding and land slips in sloping areas. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  44 days after that, another system, </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, brought in weather devastation, 

impacting  the  entire  Fiji  this  time,  not  only  greatly  scaling  up  the  demand  for  recovery  and 

rehabilitation  efforts,  but  hampering  our  ability  to  respond  quickly,  given  its  widespread  impact, 

cutting-off access and causing major infrastructural damages around the country. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At 6.00 a.m. on Saturday, 30th January, 2020, </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> as a Category 2 system made landfall 

near Rakiraki and continued to track South-South East of the Central Division towards the Suva area.  

From midday, the centre of </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> was located over the coast of Viti Levu between Suva and Navua 

and headed towards Kadavu.  It exited Fiji in the late evening on that date, leaving behind a path of 

destruction. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Close  to  the  centre  of  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>,  destructive  storm  force  winds  with  average  speeds  of  100 

kilometres per hour with momentary gusts of up to 140 kilometres per hour was experienced over 

Viti Levu, Yasawa, the Mamanuca Group, the Western half of Vanua Levu, the Lomaiviti Group, 

Vatulele, Beqa, Kadavu and nearby small islands.  It was groundhog day for Fiji, fortunately, we 

were  spared  from  the  wrath  of  a  third  cyclone  immediately  after  -  TC</span><span>  Bina</span><span>,  which  was  later 

downgraded and fizzled out without causing too many issues.  The real work starts now as we bounce 

back to rebuild, recover and rehabilitate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  first  to  acknowledge  the  assistance  by  the  UN  Food  and 

Agriculture Organization in the provision of a Disaster Risk Management Consultant, who has been 

working  with  the  Ministry  in  the  past  six  months,  reviewing  our  preparedness,  response  and 

rehabilitation  plans  and  Standard  Operating  Procedures.    This  technical  support  provided  timely 

assistance during the Ministry of Agriculture’s </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> response operation whereby we were able 

to implement our response plan in a more timely and well-coordinated manner, ensuring distribution 

of  agriculture  rehabilitation  items  within  few  days  after  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>.    We  are  following  a  similar 

approach for </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> at the national level and detailed assessments are ongoing to map out the areas, 

spread and quantum of the impact on the agricultural sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry’s initial damage assessments was conducted within 24 hours to 72 hours post-

</span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.  The Ministry of Agriculture’s Extension Services staff interviewed community leaders and 

this initial raw data, was complemented by available baseline agriculture data, and GIS wind speed 

information  provided  by  an  initial  estimated  total  damage  to  the  affected  agriculture  households 

valued around $108.9 million. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Categorising the impact of the cyclone by zones, according to distance from the centre of </span><span>TC 

Yasa</span><span>, ensured rapid  analysis  in  the identification of estimated damages that  occurred to crop and 

livestock infrastructure such fencing and livestock sheds. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I wish to highlight that amidst this devastation, the Ministry also ascertained damages to staff 

quarters and research stations that were located in those affected areas.  Work was also organised – 

the ripping of fallen trees, utilising the timber to ensure timely repairs are coordinated to affected 

stations. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, further damage was caused, including the greater Viti Levu this time around.  

The Ministry’s desperate estimates considering its impact and damages, took around 10 persons to 

vegetable farmers in the Sigatoka Lower Valley area and about 60 to 80 persons to vegetable farmers 

in Ba and Nadarivatu.  Rootcrop farms in the Central Division were also badly affected by flooding 

in low lying areas with farmers experiencing more than 80 percent damage to their crops.

</span></p>
<p><span>Farmers in the Northern Division are the worst affected for both cyclones. The Ministry is 

considering  the  implementation  of  an  intensive  response  plan,  to  ensure  farmers  are  fully 

rehabilitated.  The teams that are deployed on the ground are currently carrying out a detailed damage 

assessment which will form the basis of our response for </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>, based on the initial findings from the initial damage assessment, 

the Ministry after 72 hours, recommended the provision of three months of food ration to National 

Disaster Management Office (NDMO) for households in Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, the Ministry 

of  Agriculture  commenced  the  immediate  food  security  response  which  included  distribution  of 

vegetable  seed  packages  for  home  gardening,  root  crops  cuttings  and  other  planting  materials 

targeting households in Zone 1 and Zone 2.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as part of Phase 1, the following items were distributed to households in</p>
<p><span>affected areas today.  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>19,779 households were provided with seed packages with five commodities which would 

</span></p>
<p><span>guarantee them, at least, some vegetable supply within three months’ time.  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Additional to those 19,779 households, 7,000 household seed packages were sent to Taveuni 

</span></p>
<p><span>and the Eastern Division to be distributed there as well.  

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>7,402 households were provided with 10 </span><span>kumala</span><span> cuttings.  

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>1,114 households were provided with </span><span>bele</span><span> and cassava cuttings.  

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also 2,500, a day-old chicks were distributed in Bua/Macuata area farmers 

</span></p>
<p><span>along with feed.  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Due to damage caused by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> to the flora, the Ministry of Agriculture also supplied 190 

bee  farmers  with  over  3,000  kilogrammes  of  sugar  to  supplement  feed,  as  well  as 

rehabilitating 1,722 beehives.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also organised the deployment of a mobile veterinary clinic to 

set up in various parts of Vanua Levu to assist with the injured livestock so livestock could be saved. 

This mobile veterinary clinic was deployed to Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove, and assisted a lot of 

farmers who needed assistance to save their livestock from injury during the cyclone.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in this veterinary clinic, we had deployed vets, animal health production</p>
<p><span>specialists along with medicine to be provided free while this clinic was executed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the collaboration of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, we 

</span><span>also assisted in the clearance of dead carcasses so that they are not a risk to the community. We had 

</span><span>mobilised machinery where there was a lot of dead carcasses of large animals, cattle, we assisted in 

digging up the ground to provide for burial of these dead animals. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  assisted  in  quickly  repairing  some  of  the  farm  roads  and  also 

clearing roads so that farmers can have access to their farm. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the support from 

the Ministry of Waterways, we also assisted in quickly clearing up drains in a number of areas in 

Vanua Levu so that we are able to get the farmers to rehabilitate their farms. We have organised and 

outsourced  these  works  to  contractors  so  that  we  can  have  multiple  contractors  working 

</span><span>simultaneously so that we are able to clear up these fields so that farmers can quickly get back and 

</span><span>start working.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work was hampered given the weather conditions there. We 

have also just deployed a team from our entomology and plant pathology section to assist the farmers 

in pest and disease control so that their crops can be saved and this is ongoing.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also, with the support from Fiji Rice Ltd, were able to provide a 

special assistance package to rice farmers to rehabilitate their rice farms.  I wish to highlight in this 

august House, the Ministry’s </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> Demand Assessment Exercise was undertaken. This time, very 

rapidly using an IT tool called Goplus Tool Box and we were able to deploy all our staff from the 

Western  Division  to  undertake  the  survey  so  that  we  can  do  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  actual 

damage.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the findings from the overall operation recorded that 19,678 agricultural 

households were affected by </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>whereby 9,936 were located in Zone 1, 8,942 in Zone 2 and 

799 in Zone 3.  Of these recorded households, 18,496 were headed by male and 1,182 were headed 

by females.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual damage assessment done following this exercise came to about 

$147  million  for  the  agriculture  sector,  94  percent  were  valued  damages  on  crop,  5.4  percent  on 

livestock and 0.6 percent on infrastructure.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the top five  crop damaged was  </span><span>yaqona, dalo</span><span>,  cassava, water melon  and 

chillies and top five livestock was goat, sheep, bees, cattle and horses.  Zone 1 was the most affected 

area according to cyclone path, crop planting area damaged were recorded was more than 50 percent 

in the total area and captured value of dead livestock was around $5.2 million.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture as need for food security and livelihood customers was tasked 

with  designing  the  response  rehabilitation  plan  for  the  next  six  months  post  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  crop  and 

livestock.  Following, the Phase 1 assistance, we have now move on to Phase 2 covering lifesaving 

rehabilitation  plan  with  six  rapid  recovery  of  a  rule  productive  sector  by  targeting  almost  14,000 

agriculture households and prioritises subsistence and semi-commercial farmers that lost 75 percent 

or more of their stock.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  Phase  2,  we  are  continuing  to  provide    farmers  with  farms  response  

package planting materials  and tools, land tilling  and preparation, rehabilitation of infrastructure 

and repair to farm roads.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Phase  1  was  looking  at  food  security  and  Phase  2  is  now  looking  at 

rehabilitation and expansion of agriculture in this area.  As we continue with the Phase 2 programme 

of  expanding  commercial  agriculture,  we  are  now  also  putting  together  a  new  programme  in 

collaboration of our donors called ‘cash for cultivation’.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, later this week, we will be announcing this new programme of “cash for 

cultivation”  where  farmers  who  have    cultivated  a  minimum  of  one  acre  of  land,    completely 

cultivated will be provided with a $150 cash.  So one acre per farmer throughout Fiji for vegetable 

production.  Work is on the way to support this cash for cultivation programme while we are getting 

funding from donors.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to announce at this juncture, the support from the United Nations 

through the Central Emergency Relief Fund to the value of $1 million. As you probably would have 

read from the papers and heard from the media, the United Nations through Food and Agriculture 

Organisations have provided us with FJ$1 million to assist the most vulnerable farming households 

and  fishermen  who  had  been  affected  by  </span><span>TC  Yasa.  </span><span>This  particular  $1  million  programme  was 

launched in Bua on Friday last week and this includes a basic agriculture rehabilitation kit for 2,200 

most vulnerable affected farm households and 1,100 fishing households should benefit from a basic 

fishing kit. Also this package will assist female headed households and also all the households in this 

area who have people with special needs.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to take this opportunity to thank the UN Pacific Regional Head,  His 

Excellency Sanaka Samarasinha, for his assistance in securing this fund so that we can assist these 

most vulnerable households affected by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>. I want to assure the House that the Ministry of 

Agriculture in collaboration with the Ministry of National Disaster Management and other Ministries 

that we are working very hard in terms of ensuring that not only in securing these households that 

were affected by the cyclone in regards to food security and nutritional security, we are also working 

very hard to ensure that we will continue our programme of expanding agriculture in the national 

interest.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, that is in brief, the work that we are doing and I want to assure the House</p>
<p><span>and our Agricultural households that we will continue to work hard to support them during these 

difficult times.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement, and I now 

give the floor to the designated speaker of the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable 

Saukuru.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  J.  SAUKURU.:</span> Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to</p>
<p><span>respond to the Honourable Minister’s update this morning. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Agriculture has been the backbone of the nation since Fiji  was ceded to 

Great  Britain  through  Independence  and  never  more  so  than  now.    When  we  had  the  COVID19 

Pandemic which has brought our largest foreign exchange earner - tourism to its knees, the need to 

safeguard the industry is imperative because when all else fails, Agriculture will ensure food security 

for thousands of our people, even if they lose their jobs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding mitigation and adaptation efforts to the impacts of climate change 

which includes the increasing frequency and severity of cyclones, I wish to thank the Honourable 

Minister for addressing the issue of food security, especially amongst over 115,000 workers laid-off, 

as a result of this pandemic in his Ministerial Statement. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  the  Western  Viti  Levu  hosts  many  of  the  highly  sought-after  tourism</p>
<p><span>destinations in Fiji, and a lot of our people have lost their livelihoods as a result of this pandemic.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  it  is  likely  that  tourism  will  not  be  fully  operational  in  the  next  three  to  five  years 

therefore, Agriculture is our only hope to revitalise the economy.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need accurate, 

up-to-date data and I ask the Honourable Minister, for the National Agriculture Census Report that 

cost taxpayers $4 million conducted in February 2020. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is now 11 months and there is still no sign of that National Agriculture 

Census Report.  The Ministry needs to refocus and develop high value and low volume products, 

such as </span><span>yaqona, dalo</span><span>, ginger, cocoa and vanilla.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>yaqona</span><span> has been doing well for the exports and tripled since 2015, from 

$8.9 billion to $32.5 billion in 2019, yet Government has reduced the allocation for Yaqona Farming 

Programme to $250,000 in the 2020-2021 Budget, compared to $300,000 in the 2019 Budget and 

$500,000 in the 2018 Budget. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I ask this question: where is the cold storage for Nukuloa, Ba and Kavanagasau in Sigatoka?  

This was approved in the 2018 Budget and still not constructed to date.  We also need to increase 

allocation for milk production, beef production and poultry production.

<p><span>8th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The improvement and capacity-building in monitoring and evaluation is critical.  We need 

more qualified extension officers, field officers, supervisors to be recruited.  The implementation of 

programmes  to  promote  resilience,  go  hand-in-hand  in  ensuring  the  Ministry  is  making  the  right 

interventions, training and support to our farmers and growers as well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I take this opportunity again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to thank Government for taking on board the 

</span></p>
<p><span>cash-for-crop programme that they have suggested this morning.  Thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
