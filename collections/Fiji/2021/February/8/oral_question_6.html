<p>Combatting Outbreak of Diseases – Post-TC Yasa&TC Ana(Question No.  08/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Given  the  threat  of  increased  diseases  following  tropical  cyclones,  can  the 

Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services advise Parliament what steps has 

Government taken to combat the outbreak of diseases such as leptospirosis, typhoid, 

dengue and diarrhoea afterTropical Cyclone YasaandTropical Cyclone Ana?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Thank you</p>
<p>Sir, and I thank the Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these diseases are climate sensitive and certainly after the major cyclone</p>
<p>with the water tables being up, the flooding; it is very common that they can actually cause 

outbreaks to happen.  This has happened very significantly in the past.</p>
<p>In the flooding of 2012, we had more than 40 deaths from Leptospirosis alone.  We have had 

dengue in some years that were up to 30,000 of our community in Fiji and about 10 to 15 years ago, 

up to 30,000 had dengue.  This year, it is so important for us, not necessarily because we want to 

obliterate  outbreaks,  but  certainly  because  we  have  this  pandemic  of  COVID-19  that  is  lingering 

offshore.  Because it is lingering offshore, this year is also about vaccination.  One thing we do know 

about  the vaccination  for COVID-19 is  that  when someone has a vaccination, he or she may not 

necessarily be infected with the virus, but they can still transmit the virus.  It is also a very vulnerable 

time when we begin our vaccination for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the proxies that we use for our surveillance for COVID-19 is fever 

and I have discussed that in my Ministerial Statement today, but fever is also caused by Leptospirosis, 

Typhoid and Dengue.  What we intended to do was to work very hard with the NDMO during these 

times of emergencies that have been declared, to try and obliterate all the possible outbreaks from 

happening.  When we have actually minimised this to a certain level and then we begin on this large 

scale vaccination programme that we will begin this year, if God forbid, we have fever that pops up 

in the community we know that we are dealing most probably with COVID-19 and nothing else, 

because we have worked very hard to try and reduce the likelihood of the outbreak.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>What  we  have  done  is  even  beforeTC  Yasa,there  has  been  a  very  strong  public  health 

awareness that is happening in the media whether it be printed or also on social media, working with 

the Commissioners, Turaga ni Koros, Rokos, PA’s, DO’s and also the District Advisory Counsellors 

on a daily basis, around the awareness campaigns that were being done.</p>
<p>You may be aware Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the middle of last year in between the lockdowns 

there was alsoTC Haroldand the many clean up campaigns that have happened since.  SinceTC 

Yasa,we concentrated on the North but we had the comprehensive work done all throughout Fiji. 

Our  northern  teams  working  with  the  NDMO  began  the  initial  assessment,  the  initial  awareness 

straight after the cyclone.  I went across with the FEMAT team just before Christmas and who spent 

three weeks there - there was a team in Nabouwalu, a team in Wainunu and there was a team set up 

in Nakorovatu and we had two teams in Lekutu.</p>
<p>One of the FEMAT teams was specifically looking after the COVID-19 quarantine corridor 

that was made possible forHMS Adelaidewhen they came into Fiji and the other team worked with 

us.  Basically what happened was - there was a comprehensive screening of all the communities on 

Vanua Levu beginning from one end, all the way to the other.  We did Cakaudrove in three days. I 

was  there  personally  with  the  teams,  beginning  on  the  first,  second  and  third,  all  through  the 

communities, villages and settlements in Cakaudrove and including Macuata.  We went across to 

Rabi and worked through the whole island of Rabi.  It did many things, and this is something that we 

saw withTC Winston, Mr. Speaker - that many people suffered from the trauma of the cyclone, they 

were sick or injured but they just decided to stay home - they were more concerned about making 

sure that they had a roof over their head, more concerned about getting food, so we picked them up 

from the community.  We brought them across.</p>
<p>There is a great story about a lady, who was basically gasping for air in Rabi; we picked her 

up, got her evacuated quickly to Labasa and now she is back home in Rabi and she is well.  So, we 

picked up those who were sick and those who were injured – that was the whole aim.  The other thing 

was actually working with the community leaders in identifying hotspots, getting it sprayed so our 

health inspectors did spraying.  We also talked with them about what we wanted in terms of moving 

forward, in terms of reducing the sources of leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue.  WithTC Anabecause 

it involved the whole group, we also ran this programme and because of the difficulties of access, 

there  is  a  hospital  team  with  operative  capability  in  Nabouwalu;  a  hospital  team  with  operative 

capability in Savusavu, there is a team in Rakiraki and a team in Sigatoka.  Apart from that, we have 

also sent minor teams into other areas, so there is a team based in Nadarivatu, there is a team based 

in Korovou, there is another team based in Navua, there is a team based in Vunidawa and there are 

other teams elsewhere that have come from the hospital system.</p>
<p>The hospitals are a critical mass of staff that we can repurpose to be able to push out on the 

public health campaign.  Mr. Speaker, before I sit down, I just saw that the Meteorological Office 

has sent out a statement to say that there is another tropical disturbance.  I would like to remind all 

of us today that it may seem like a never-ending fight but we must not lose hope.  Though we have 

these climate sensitive diseases, though we are faced with climate change and the disturbances that 

it brings us, we must work together to ensure that we keep these climate sensitive diseases obliterated 

as much as we can.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Nawaikula, you have the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Can the Honourable Minister clarify whether or not the Australian</p>
<p>Defence personnel were quarantined and what process of quarantine did they go through?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  They met all the requirements of 

quarantine.  They were tested before they came.  When they arrived they were tested again.  They 

were negative and they were tested again before they went out into the community and they were 

negative.  They met all the requirements including the 14 days.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Leawere.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In terms of moving forward, as alluded 

to by the Honourable Minister, when schools reopen in the north, are there plans to immunise the 

students in terms of this outbreak of diseases, as per the question today.  In terms of immunisation, 

are our students going to be immunised, in terms of trying to avoid these diseases in future when the 

schools reopen in the north, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- That is three questions. Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Thank  you.  I  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  that 

question.  Going back to the schools, Mr. Speaker, the schools have been used as evacuation centres 

and  we  work  hand-in-hand  with  NDMO  and  also  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  ensuring  that  all 

schools,  before  they  are  handed  back,  are  actually  disinfected.    When  they  were  being  used  an 

evacuation centre, our teams visited the schools on a regular basis, they gave advice and guidance to 

those who were sheltering in the schools to ensure that they do not have an outbreak within the school.  

They give advice on OHS issues so that we do not have schools that burn down because of the place 

that we may be cooking.</p>
<p>We also disinfect the schools during that period, and when they are actually evacuated we 

disinfect the schools again.  The immunisation programmes that we have in place for the schools, for 

example those who are within the schools that will happen.  The normal functions of immunisation, 

the normal functions of vaccination, of visiting the students, of making sure that we’re checking on 

them, the awareness - those programmes will continue. We have made sure and this is happening 

because of the increase that has happened to our budgetary provision which allows us to ensure that 

we do a normative functions well and deal with the extra normative functions of COVID-19 and in 

this aspect, theTC YasaandTC Ana.Vinaka vakalevu.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you Honourable Minister.  Are there any supplementary question?</p>
<p>Honourable Member, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, a quick supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I 

thank the work done so far in the community and the teams that are coming around to make those 

tests and also distribute medicines working with theNasi ni Koroand theTuraga ni Koroat post 

disaster time.  My question will be just an assurance from the Honourable Minister to clarify works 

on the current measures put in place in terms of the disconnection or isolation of Cakaudrove from 

Labasa,  given  the  road  conditions,  and  just  to  give  an  assurance  to  the  general  public  on  what 

developments have taken place in Savusavu Hospital to become functional, given the referrals that 

are normally done?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- I thank the Honourable Member for that question and it is 

a very relevant question.  What we have done, we have made Savusavu Hospital in many instances 

as of today, similar to  Labasa.   We did  that afterTC Ana, as soon as  the road that  went  through</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>Nayarabale to Korotasere, we were able to move our team across.  So now we have an obstetrician 

in Labasa, we have a physician, we have a very senior surgeon in Savusavu, we have also moved 

across a paediatrician looking after children and a physician from Lautoka Hospital.  They have their 

nurses and they have been able to operate on all the emergency caesarean sections, the urgent cases 

that are moved through the greater Cakaudrove area and also from Taveuni that comes through to 

Savusavu.</p>
<p>When we were in correspondence they were quite happy with what is happening within the 

hospital, the ability of them to be able to meet those needs.  As I have alluded to, we want to ensure 

that the access is not an issue.  The same format of the team exists now at Nabouwalu, so we have a 

surgeon, an obstetrician, an anaesthetist, a paediatrician and a physician from Suva.  They are all 

based in Nabouwalu as we speak – the same in Rakiraki and same in Sigatoka.  We will reflect on 

them - the thinking is that hopefully by the end of this week, we can get the Rakiraki and the Sigatoka 

teams back to their bases but it seems like what is happening in the North, it might be mid-term to 

long term given the challenges that we have in accessibility.Vinaka vakalevu.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you.    We  will  move  to  Written  Questions  and  I  call  on  the</p>
<p>Honourable Ratu Matanitobua to ask his question. You have the floor, Sir.</p>
