<p>Fiji’s Country Partnership Agreement 2020-2024 

(Question No.  03/2021)</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and 

Communications provide an update to Parliament on the arrangement of the $1 billion loan 

from  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  under  the  Country 

Partnership Agreement 2020-2024?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service 

and  Communications).-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  World  Bank  Group  is  actually  a  group  of  five 

international  organisations  namely  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development 

(IBRD),  International  Development  Association  (IDA)  for  grant  funding,  International  Financial 

Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Credit Agency (MICA) and International Centre for 

Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICID).</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question actually somewhat misplaced because there is no $1 billion 

loan  to  Government.    There  is  the  World  Bank  Country  Partnership  Framework  (CPF),  which  is 

available,  it  is  for  public  consumption.    In  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  will  see  that  this  Country 

Partnership Framework is of a period of four years and the World Bank is a billion dollar support of 

which US$210 million is directly by way of loans to government and they are in the areas of Social 

Protection,  COVID-19  Response  and  System  Development  Project,  the  Economic  and  Climate 

Resilience Development Policy Operation, the Catastrophe drawdown and the Vanua Levu Tourism 

Development Project.  Even prior to the COVID-19, we believe that Vanua Levu was completely 

underutilised and indeed, it can serve as what we call ‘second redundancy area’ should something 

dramatic happen in Viti Levu and planes cannot land, we should have an international airport on the 

other island.  Vanua Levu is not that much smaller than Viti Levu.</p>
<p>The  second  Economic  and  Climate  Resilience  Development  Policy  Operation,  this  is  the 

US$210 million which is about F$400 million and then the balance is the $300 million indicative 

amount that the World Bank through IFC has expressed for potential private sector funding where 

they participate by either way of equity in various projects or they actually can lend directly.</p>
<p>IFC as anyone who knows about the machinations within the World Bank Framework, IFC 

does not lend money to governments, it is the World Bank that does but IFC does actually lend to the 

private sector, IFC does participate in equity participation.  For example, the Vision Group when it 

was listed, IFC actually participated in that, they actually held some shares in it and that is what they 

normally do, to prop up organisations.</p>
<p>So,  that  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  in  a  nutshell  the  $1  billion  Country  Partnership  Framework.  

There was in fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, an official press release that was put out by the World Bank and 

you will note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that again it reconfirms or reiterates what I have just said in respect 

of the facility that has been provided both to government and also to the private sector.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I sit down for any supplementary questions, we are constantly trying 

to get the World Bank to give us more funding through the International Development Association 

(IDA).  The IDA entails very concessional loan terms incurring a service charge of 0.75 percent and 

a repayment period of 40 years, including a 10 years grace period.  So, it is less than 1 percent.  We 

can imagine a period of 40 years, obviously you may perhaps or in fact, paying less than what you 

borrowed.</p>
<p>The  other  loans  are  through  the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development 

(IBRD) and they are non-concessional and they charge variable interest rate, are liable which have 

been historically low with repayments over a period of 15 years.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.  Honourable Niko Nawaikula,</p>
<p>you have the floor, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Will  the  government  be  using  any  of  this  money  to  help  Fiji</p>
<p>Airways with its loan repayments?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Tuisawau, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  With the experience regarding Fiji 

Roads Authority on the contract worth of $40 million, which was cancelled due to non-compliance 

of the Suva Road Upgrading Project and also in terms of the capacity to implement documentation, 

et cetera.  Can the Honourable Minister for Economy explain how the current capacity will be able 

to manage this particular arrangement?  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Honourable Members 

question actually is fundamentally flawed because it is premised on a notion that the funding was 

withdrawn from FRA because of non-compliance, which is completely incorrect.  I actually did not 

want  to  comment  on  the  previous  motion  regarding  the  Auditor-General’s  Office  but  there  are  a 

number of issues in respect of how they have been arriving at various conclusions.  In that particular 

instance, if the Honourable Member stops reading theFiji Times, the funding was through ADB and 

not the World Bank, and the reason why that funding was withdrawn was because FRA and ADB 

agreed for that funding to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>There is a particular challenge that we have actually been having, in particular with ADB and 

some of the other funding agencies where they go for the cheapest price.  So just because a company 

comes along and puts in a tender, and says that they will build the particular stretch of a road at the 

cheapest price, but our argument is, it should not necessarily be awarded to them, because you have 

to look at the track record, the capacity to be able to deliver the particular project at a quality level, 

so we do not have to actually go back and fix up these roads within three or four months’ time, or we 

get variations to contract which actually becomes a lot more expensive.</p>
<p>There is a particular project that ADB at that point in time, where if you meet the minimum 

qualifications, they do not look at other technical aspects, they give it to the cheapest one.  So that is 

the reason why and we also said that the scope needs to increase or be widened when you do the 

technical assessments.  We have agreed that we will not draw down those funds and that is the reason 

and unfortunately, the Auditor-General’s Office again, hurried to a conclusion which is actually not 

correct.</p>
<p>In respect of the question regarding this, of course, as I have highlighted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

the Honourable Member, as I have highlighted earlier on, we are looking at drawing down funds for 

our social protection, COVID-19 Response and Assistance Development projects and we are also 

looking for the Climate Resilience Development Policy Operation.  Please, remember, this US$210 

million is over the period of four years.  The country partnership is over four years.  Of course, the 

Vanua Levu Tourism Development Project, things have slightly slowed down there but we had been, 

as you know, talked about issues looking at finding a site with a longer run way, we eventually can 

land 737s.  At the moment, our ATR-72 cannot even get on full load at the current Wailevu site.  It 

just cannot take it, one way is not long enough, it is built between the bend of one river.  Of course, 

we  have  the  Economic  and  Climate  Resilience  Development  Policy  Operations.    So  we  have  the 

capacity to do so.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.  Honourable Tabuya, you have</p>
<p>the floor for the supplementary question.</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Honourable Minister for Housing 

had mentioned that in the difficulty with working with IFC was the lack of expertise that is currently</p>
<p>Page 50</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>not in the country.  Here the Honourable Attorney-General is talking about IFC having the bigger 

portion of this money for the private sector.</p>
<p>My question to the Honourable Attorney-General is, how are we going to guarantee that these 

loans are actually given out to the private sector, given that we have a lack of expertise to put together 

business proposals and to carry through the kind of work that will fit the IFC standards?  How are 

we going to fill that void if we do not have the expertise to put together the business proposals that 

will fit the high requirements of the IFC in obtaining a loan?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Honourable Member may 

not be aware but there is in fact an IFC office in Fiji, it has only opened about two years ago.  There 

are IFC officials here.  There is also a called technology which now days people are meeting over 

zoom and various other ways of communicating and that is how a lot of these projects are actually 

on foot and we continue to have those meetings.  As we said, in respect of the IFC, for the housing 

projects, we need the contractors to actually come down, there would be investors and they want to 

see the site.  So in that aspect of course, that has slowed down, but the work regarding IFC itself, the 

ability to do assessment and the ability to have the input obviously continues.   Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.  We will move on.</p>
<p>Honourable Members, the fourth Oral Question was supposed to be asked by the Honourable 

Dr. Govind, who has reported sick today, but he  has  agreed  that the  contents of his  question has 

already been answered in the  Ministerial Statement by the Minister for Agriculture this morning.  

So, we will move on to the next question.</p>
