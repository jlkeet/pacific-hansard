<p><span>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2021

<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move:</p>
<p><span>That the -

</span></p>
<p><span>High  Court  (Amendment)  Bill  2021  (Bill  No.  1/2021)  be  considered  by  Parliament 

without delay; 

Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 

Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 

Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 11th February, 2021 

and; 

one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of eply given to me as the Member 

moving this motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I intend to 

be brief as we hope to debate this on Thursday but essentially, this particular amendment seeks to 

create a specialised division within the Fijian Judicial System, a division that will deal solely with 

anti-corruption cases.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fijiâ€™s Judicial System there are already various divisions in 

the High Court and also the Magistrates Court.  So, for example, we have the Family Division. We 

have the Court of Review established to look at the Customs Act, the Tax Court and the Employment 

Relations Court. So, the creation of a division is not anything peculiar.  Also of course in the UK 

they  have  specialised  courts  as  the  Commercial  Court,  Admiralty  Court  and  of  course  the 

Administrative  Court.    There  has  been  a  growing  emergence  of  specialised  courts  to  deal  with 

corruption in many countries throughout the world, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the idea is to ensure that we get consistency in the application 

of anti-corruption jurisprudence in relation to corruption cases.  The specialisation of magistrates and 

judges  in  this  new  and  growing  area  of  jurisprudence  in  particular  the  adherence  to  international 

norms and standards in relation to anti-corruption.   And also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by having specialised 

courts it will give not just the prosecutors but those who actually get prosecuted, a particular level of 

certainty and indeed will further reinforce the rule of law because it will get rid of inconsistency.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with those introductory remarks, I would like to recommend that we debate</p>
<p><span>this Bill on Thursday.
