<p><span>New Subsidised Rates for Kidney Dialysis 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  On 23</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2020, the 

Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services, through an extraordinary gazette, legislated 

new  subsidised  rates  for  kidney  dialysis  by  amending  the  Public  Hospitals  and  Dispensaries 

Regulations.  Is this a fact providing real benefit to our kidney patients requiring dialysis or is it a 

fallacy designed to hoodwink the people, especially our dialysis patients. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The new prescribed rates were $137.62 for Fijians and $68.81 for those below the income tax 

threshold.  These would be patients from families earning a combined income of less than $30,000 

per annum.  Now Fijians are being asked to pay $275.24 for each session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the question that I am asking today is, how beneficial has this reduction been, 

and the answer is this - negligible.  Apart from the Colonial War Memorial Hospital which is limited 

and I have cited documentary evidence of this in the form of receipts for payments to the Kidney 

Foundation of even patients admitted at the CWM and Labasa Hospitals, I do not know of any other 

public medical facility that provides this essential service. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  want  to  know  who  actually  operates  the  Dialysis  Centre  at  Labasa  Hospital,  is  it  the 

Ministry of Health or someone else?  In every Parliamentary sitting period, we are subjected, Mr. 

Speaker, to what the reality of the matter is, but, Mr. Speaker, the harsh reality and facts speak for 

themselves.  Our kidney patients are suffering, struggling to get dialysis treatment at private centres 

in Suva and Lautoka.  Those with kidney ailments in the Eastern Division hope for a miracle because 

of the exorbitantly high charges of between $200 and $250 per session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A kidney patient on dialysis, as we all know, needs three treatments per week.  It would cost 

him or her between $600 and $750 per week.  This cost is beyond the reach of a decent salary earner.  

It is beyond the reach of us ordinary Members of Parliament.  So the patients cut back on the treatment 

to  one  or  two  treatments  a  week  until  they  and  their  families  as  well  as  assistance  from  Good 

Samaritans come to an end. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The financial inability to meet dialysis is quite literally the final nail in their coffins.  Why 

has  it  come  to  this  painful  and  tragic  end?    The  fact  and  reality  of  the  matter  is  the  FijiFirst 

Government’s repeated broken promises about subsidised dialysis.  A cardinal sin as far as we are 

concerned.  How have we come to his point?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  29th  July,  2017,  following  the  Government’s  continued  rejection  of 

NFP’s motions from years 2015 to 2017, to please increase dialysis subsidy to at least $3 million, my 

party  announced  that  an  NFP  Government  would  provide  free  dialysis  for  patients  from  families 

whose annual family income was less than $30,000 as well as subsidised treatment for those earning 

more than the income tax threshold.   

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>End of Week Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  This  was,  is  and  will  continue  to  be  the  correct  way 

forward.  A year later in 2018, Mr. Speaker, less than five months from the general elections, the 

FijiFirst Government having early announced the establishment of a National Kidney Dialysis and 

Research Centre allocated $3.5 million for subsidised dialysis saying that patients below the income 

tax threshold of families would only pay $75 per session.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, we know this was hogwash, to quote the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, 

Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources, because this promise did not apply to private 

facilities  providing  dialysis.    The  Government  had  promised  in  2017  to  equip  our  hospitals  with 

dialysis  machines.    A  Kidney  and  Research  Centre  is  gathering  dust  in  Nadera;  no  research,  no 

dialysis despite the assurance in Parliament during the 2020/2021 budget deliberations in July last 

year that it would be operational by November 2020.  If this is not a broken promise, Mr. Speaker, 

than what is?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 cannot be blamed because the Honourable Minister for Health 

provided a very comprehensive answer as to the timeline of the arrival of these dialysis machines.  In 

response to my motion during the debate on the 2020/2021 Budget in July of last year to have the 

subsidised dialysis allocation significantly increased, the Honourable Minister said the Centre would 

be operational by the end of November last year.  The </span><span>Hansard Report</span><span> of 29 July, 2020 would prove 

what I am saying.   

</span></p>
<p><span>He also scoffed at the suggestion of providing subsidies to the overwhelming majority of our 

people visiting privately-owned centres, saying the Government was going to ease the burden as the 

new dialysis machines had been purchased and the nephrologist had already identified 40 patients 

who needed dialysis treatment urgently.  We wonder now, Mr. Speaker, what has become of those 

40 patients who were identified?  Was this a pre-election gimmick?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we believe it 

was because the allocation fell from their pre-election promise of $3.5 million to $200,000 in 2019 

and further reduced to $100,000 in 2020.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Going back in time so to speak, the Honourable Minister for Economy on 29th June, 2017 

</span></p>
<p><span>while delivering the 2017/2018 Budget announced as follows, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“We will allocate, Madam Speaker, $1 million to establish and equip the National 

Kidney Research and Treatment Centre in Suva to be directed by Dr. Amrish Krishna, the 

only Fijian nephrologist in Fiji.  This Treatment and Research Centre will advocate the 

treatment of kidney diseases in Fiji by operating 10 new kidney dialysis machines and 

offering a range of other therapies as well as diagnostics and counselling to its patients.  

Four new kidney dialysis machines will also become operational at the Lautoka Hospital 

in the next few months.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>These  next  few  months  are  still  coming.    Patients  are  being  denied  subsidised  dialysis  in 

hospitals.    I  repeat,  the  so-called  Dialysis  and  Research  Centre  is  gathering  dust.    None  of  the 

promises and assurances made in Parliament by both the Honourable Economy Minister in 2017 and 

the Honourable Health Minister in 2020 has come to fruition.  It reminds me, Mr. Speaker, of a song 

that I am sure you will be familiar with from Fleetwood Mac, “Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies” 

- the pain and suffering of dialysis patients, struggling to make ends meet and to survive. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FijiFirst Government’s broken promises is tragically captured by the death of a man early 

yesterday morning at the Lautoka Hospital.  This gentleman will be accorded his final rites on the 

date of his birthday (tomorrow).  He did all he could to be able to have two dialysis sessions per week 

instead of three at a private facility in Lautoka.  He could not even afford to rest because he had to

</span></p>
<p><span>End of Week Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>633 

</span></p>
<p><span>operate a stall at the Lautoka Market until recently to earn enough money to meet his dialysis cost of 

$400 per week plus other medical costs.            

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  told  today  of  another  case  that  happened  this  week  where  a  patient  went  to  receive 

treatment  at  the  Lautoka  Hospital  only  to  be  told  that  the  dialysis  treatment  is  available  only  for 

emergency cases.  Why are people being restricted from receiving lifesaving treatment, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir?  Again, I ask, why?  Is it because:  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>of this Government’s lack of empathy and support for those receiving dialysis at privately- 

</span></p>
<p><span>operated facilities due to the inability of hospitals to provide dialysis: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>10 new dialysis machines did not become operational within a few months as announced by 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>the Honourable Minister of Economy in June, 2017; and 

the late patient was denied the right to subsidise dialysis of $75 per session and $68.81 per 

treatment post-December 2020, instead paying $200 per session. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, throughout this week, the Honourable Leader of the National Federation 

Party has emphasised that politics is not about winning elections and arguments, it is about doing 

good to the people that we serve.  Government must now come to grips with the reality.  The reality 

of the matter is, it has failed to equip public hospitals with the dialysis machines as promised both in 

2017 and 2020.  It has failed to even remotely make operational the National Kidney Dialysis and 

Research Centre. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, Government should extend such subsidised dialysis to 

patient predominantly using private facilities.  Our people need compassion and the compliance of 

Government’s social responsibility to the population especially during these very difficult times.  If 

Government can hire overseas consultants and recruit Permanent Secretaries from abroad saying it 

needs  expertise,  there  is  simply  no  reason  why  it  should  deny  our  citizens  their  fundamental 

Constitutional right to health and without any hesitation whatsoever provide subsidised dialysis to 

patients receiving treatment privately due to the acute lack of dialysis in hospitals. This is all we are 

asking for, Mr. Speaker, fairness and adherence to the Constitutional rights of our people. </span><span>Vinaka. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua for her End of the Week

<p><span>First of all, she has lied.  The Nadera Dialysis Centre is not gathering dust, it is actually open 

</span></p>
<p><span>as we speak, to do the clinic.

<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> Shame on you!  The person doing the clinic there, look at</p>
<p><span>me, Honourable Member, is an Australian trained nephrologist and is doing the clinic now.

<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Say it again:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> Why would you lie to the people of Fiji on camera when it</p>
<p><span>is not gathering dust, it is actually working.  Clinics are being done there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Do  not  sing  to  me.  The  reason  why  we  made  the 

amendments to the Regulations is because we are bound to make dialysis cheap to every Fijian who 

can:</span></p>
<p><span>And  Honourable  Member,  you  must  differentiate  between  acute  dialysis  from  chronic 

dialysis.  Any person who is very sick, and I have had patients who have been very sick, you would 

know that, when they come to the hospital and they need dialysis, Government pays for  14 sessions... 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- Not a promise:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> Not a promise, it happens.</p>
<p><span>...  in  the  Intensive  Care  Unit.    As  we  speak,  there  are  some  receiving  dialysis  now  in  the 

Intensive Care Units in CWM, Lautoka and Labasa.  That is paid for by Government and that is not 

reflected on the chronic dialysis.  You must demarcate it, please do not talk about medicine and what 

is happening in health in Fiji if you do not get it properly. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.:</span> Tell them!</p>
<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Acute Dialysis which saves many, many lives are paid for  

by Government; they are paid completely by Government.  And I have had personally some patients 

you  have  needed  more  than  14  sessions.    Some  of  them  had  needed  28  sessions  paid  for  by 

Government.  Every day as we speak, there are many receiving dialysis in Government institutions 

paid for by Government (free).  Those are what we call acute dialysis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Kidney Foundation of Fiji is different and you know that Honourable Member.  Please, do 

not say that it is part of Government, it is not.  Please, do not say that.  The Kidney Foundation of 

Fiji runs its own dialysis centre.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at the numbers around the world and at some Small Islands Development States, 

some of the countries around the Pacific, some of the small island nations, they are putting about 30 

percent to 50 percent of the Ministry of Health budget, just looking after dialysis and the treatment 

of  chronic  diseases;  dialysis  alone.    There  are  a  lot  of  people  from  Tuvalu  who  are  in  Fiji  at  the 

moment, receiving dialysis.  

</span></p>
<p><span>When  we  talk  about  nephrology  care  in  this  country,  we  are  interested  in  both  primary 

prevention and secondary  prevention. We  are interested in making sure that we  reduce the blood 

pressure that causes this, that we make sure that we reduce the diabetes that causes this. We want to 

make sure that we have the ability to be able to test their kidney functions wherever they are and we 

have laboratories all over the country.  We have just recently recruited even more laboratory scientists 

so that we have laboratory facilities in some small subdivision hospitals. I talked about radiology 

recently, these ae being able to have Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in these places.

<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>End of Week Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>635 

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to begin by that, Mr. Speaker and also say that Dr. Amrish Krishnan was sent 

across,  he  was  trained  on  a  Fiji  Government  scholarship  and  he  got  his  Masters.    I  was  Medical 

Superintendent when we supported him to go for training in Taranaki. This Government supported 

his training. He went to Taranaki with us. He came back and indicated he wanted to go into private 

practice.  We sent Dr. Yogeshni who now works in Labasa - she was trained in Christchurch, and Dr. 

Anish, the nephrologist who is also Australian-trained, who looks after our dialysis centre here in 

Suva.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the construction of the centre in  Nadera is  now nearly $800,000. Due to  the 

supply chain challenges that we faced and the fact that the German company that actually sold us this 

dialysis machine, they indicated to us that they will only allow a biomedical engineer which they 

certified, so we had to wait. When we were finally able to bring across a biomedical engineer through 

Fiji Airways into the country, served quarantine and as we speak again, that place is open.  You can 

go after this and check.   He is there installing the machines.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Professor B.C. Prasad interjects)   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> No, no, I am not talking to you, Honourable Prasad. Stop</p>
<p><span>bringing lies into this august House.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There are 15 dialysis machines which arrived in April - 10 machines are now at that centre 

and  the  others  we  have  distributed  because  we  want  to  be  able  to  support  our  ICU  facilities  for 

COVID-19.  So they are in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa and they are looking after patients on a daily 

basis. The state of the art human dialysis machine made by the German company, Fresenius  will 

greatly  improve  the  quality  of  care  currently  provided  to  end-stage  kidney  disease.  Once 

commissioned into service, the machine will add to  the number of dialysis  machines that will be 

accessible to kidney disease.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Member, you have to understand that we have gone away from people just falling 

into end-stage renal disease. We now have capable doctors available both in the public system, in 

Suva and Lautoka and teams under them including Dr. Amrish in private, who are now able to rescue 

them in chronic renal failure. And the ideal setting, we do not want them to have dialysis and if the 

Honourable  Member,  Mr.  Speaker,  does  not  know  that  to  have  dialysis  you  just  do  not  take  the 

dialysis  and  stick  them  into  somebody’s  body,  they  need  an  operation  to  create  an  arteriovenous 

fistula. Guess, who does it?  The public system does it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Our surgeons, trained locally and in Australia and New Zealand, they do it. They do it because 

you  are  talking  about  what  is  the  investment.  There  has  been  a  lot  of  investment,  Honourable 

Member. There has been a lot of investment and these are people that Government has supported for 

their training. So, we have the Kidney Foundation of Fiji which charges $250; the Kidney Hub, Dr. 

Amrish - $200; Ba Medical Centre – Dr. Dur Sami - $200; Pasifika Care - $200; Northern Dialysis - 

$115.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, we fully subsidise those 15 to 20 Fijians in Labasa and the one in Suva, once it 

is open, we will begin that at a $150 and the subsidy kicks in. We are also in negotiation with the 

dialysis centre in the west. There is one who is willing to come to us but we do not want (and this is 

what we have had before), is that they will then add on to their cost. We want them to actually bring 

down their cost.  We do not want a provider to actually say “look if you are going to give $75 subsidy 

we are going to make the amount now to $175”.  That is something that one of the providers indicated 

to us that they want to up their price a little bit. We do not want that, we want to actually bring it 

down and that is the whole nature of the legislation that was put in place.

<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  Labasa alone it cost us $9,300 every month just to provide the actual 

subsidy.  We started registering in the centre to make sure that we actually have the right patients 

who meet certain criteria.  We have actually registered 19 patients and we made it very clear that 

these patients have to go and be seen by our designated nephrologist and they register them because  

we want to be sure that the consultant and the specialist in this area actually agrees and concurs that 

they need dialysis.  Dialysis is not for everyone, it is not like a panadol that you just give for everyone.  

It is a treatment that has its effects, that can save a life and it can also have its side effects.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the specialist clinics have been working there for more than two months 

now.  They open on Thursdays and Fridays specifically to see 60 kidney dialysis patients.  Quite a 

large  number  of  them  in  Nadera  have  been  seen  and  managed  without  the  use  of  dialysis  at  the 

moment; our doctors and nurses have been able to rescue them.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  want  to  finish  my  statement  by  saying  the  Honourable  Professor 

Prasad mislead Parliament on Monday.  He said, “There was no panadol and diabetic medications 

around the country.” 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.:</span> There was’t - I have got evidence.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.:</span> I  have  information  here  from  the  Director  of  Fiji</p>

<p><span>correcting you today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We have it available.  Weactually have more than 87 percent of stock that is needed over 

three month period available.   It  is  important  to  understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that these types of 

statements actually have an effect on our people not coming to institutions, not coming to the health 

centre and  not coming to the facility. If you just say things like that bluntly then, what happens?

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of us sitting in this honourable House sometimes in our lives, have 

experienced a sense of insecurity or fear, in case the rooftop on top of our heads fall down, Sir; fear 

for our loved ones, the fear of our safety and the fear of death during natural disasters.  If there was 

a safe place to get quickly to we would within seconds round up our loved ones and get to that safe 

place where we can be with other family members, community members, our leaders, other women, 

youths and children.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that safe place or the house of hope in other words evacuation centres, cum-

community hall, churches, places of worship which is our only hope for safety for our survival when 

natural disasters happen and there is no existing evacuation centre in our community.  There is  a 

need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to strengthen existing community halls, churches, et cetera which have been 

used  as  evacuation  centres  or  build  new  community  centres  or  repair  churches,  to  ensure  that 

everyone and every citizen has an evacuation centre to relocate to when disasters happen.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Having  said  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence  and  Disaster 

Management for his update yesterday on the two recent cyclones. As we know, this the new norm 

especially for us in the Pacific. We know that cyclones are now more frequent and more severe.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We have been informed in details, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of Government’s effort to ensure the 

safety of our people, provide relief supplies to  ensure the restoration of electricity, to  ensure that 

damaged roads are promptly repaired so that food supplies not only for those in dire need but also 

for trading purposes reach the people or are available to the people, to ease the needs of travellers as 

well  as  civil  servants  and  volunteers  involved  in  damage  assessments  and  distribution  of  relief 

supplies and the members of civil societies involved in relief work and the business community in 

supplying the basic needs to our people.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We are grateful for the efforts of the Government and civil societies to bring about relief to 

the members of those communities that were affected. We are also grateful to the volunteers, Mr, 

Speaker,  Sir,  who  have  sacrificed  both  their  time  to  assist  in  the  voluntary  work  that  has  been 

provided by Government to ensure prompt relief to those that were affected during the recent cyclone 

or in all previous cyclones.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst we are grateful for Government’s effort to ensure speedy recovery, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

we equally need to look beyond the structures that we have now.  We need to ensure that we have 

evacuation centres readily available to every community both rural and urban for the safety of our 

people when natural disasters happen.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Almost every village has a </span><span>vale ni bose va koro</span><span> or village hall or a village church which had 

been used as evacuation centres, for other communities their places of worships or gathering halls. 

These are the buildings which Government can assist to ensure that they are cyclone proof or have 

engineering  certificates  to  provide  safety  houses  for  members  of  the  village  or  community  when 

natural disasters do happen. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since independence, the Alliance Government led by the late 

</span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui</span><span> Nayau, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara have assisted communities to construct halls as 

evacuation centres.  This was continued by the SVT government under Major-General Rabuka, the 

SDL government under the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  unfortunate,  Sir,  that  this  initiative  and  allocation  is  no  longer  available.  Without 

evacuation centres schools are used and where schools are far away, there is risk of death or injury 

for members of communities in the path of severe cyclones. This is a cause for anxiety and fear in 

the community and has a cost for affected families, communities and the nation.

<p><span>End of Week Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>12th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the education centre was also severely impacted by the recent cyclone as 

alluded to by the Honourable Minister for Disaster Management, with more than 90 schools damaged 

across the country.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as in the past, schools have been used as evacuation centres.  There are risks</p>
<p><span>involved in damages being caused due to cooking and for other reasons.   

</span></p>
<p><span>All schools in Fiji have to take another extra week in order to be able to re-begin the new 

school  year.  We  can  avoid  further  absences  from  school  if  evacuation  centres  are  located  in  all 

communities, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I also refer to the information provided by the Honourable Minister for Disaster Management 

in his Ministerial Statement yesterday where he confirmed that immediately after the storm (</span><span>TC Yasa)</span><span>

had past, close to 23,000 Fijians were temporary relocated to 456 evacuation centres. Some of those 

evacuation centres were schools.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We express our appreciation to the Australian Defence Force and the Republic of Fiji Military 

Forces for their work to repair 32 schools to open in time for the new school year (19</span><span>th</span><span> January) and 

this ensured that more than 8,000 students returned to school. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to propose that Government considers changing 

its policies to ensure that all villages and communities have engineered proof, approved community 

hall as evacuation centres or churches which can be used as evacuation centres.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to comply with our own Constitution as well as our commitment to the Sustainable 

Development Goal of the United Nations.  On that note I would like to ask Government through the 

Honourable  Minister  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  to  consider  what  we  are 

proposing today to ensure the availability of Evacuation Centres for all communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Their earlier response to one of our questions to provide a number of evacuation centres in 

provinces will not work, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  For Tailevu North, an evacuation centre to be built in 

Matacula.  If there is a cyclone affecting the people of Dawasamu, how are they expected to get to 

Matacula for safety during the cyclone season? 

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank you, Sir for the opportunity to participate in this End of Week Statement and I wish 

all  Honourable  Members  a  safe  journey  back  to  their  homes  after  this  session.  </span><span>Vinaka  vakalevu</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Adi Litia Qionibaravi for her statement.  I now 

give the  floor to  the Minister responsible for the response, the  Honourable Minister for Defence, 

National Security and Policing, Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me, from the very outset say that 

no doubt there is no element of doubt whatsoever that evacuation centres are important for the good 

and for the safety of our people and, of course, the Government does agree and let me also assure 

this  honourable  House  that  Government  is  also  committed  to  the  construction  and  retrofitting  of 

evacuation centres.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Member  talked  about  our  fear  and  feeling  insecure 

whenever  we  have  disasters  but  I  must  also  ask  the  question  of,  what  are  we  doing  about  our 

responsibilities as well?  Because if we are in the state of fear or insecure, of course, the question that 

we also need to ask is, how will we eliminate and get rid of this feeling of fear and insecurity?

</span></p>
<p><span>End of Week Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>639 

</span></p>
<p><span>It comes with responsibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have often said in this august House 

that development is partnership.  There must be partnership between the government, people and the 

communities. That is something that we need to take seriously, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We appreciate the 

work  done  by  previous  governments;  the  Alliance  Government,  SVT  Government  and  SDL 

Government, but it is not correct to state in this House that this Government no longer constructs 

evacuation centres. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let  me  go  back  to  2015,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  completed  retrofitting  three 

</span></p>
<p><span>evacuation centres; Nacokoni in Burebasaga, Wasavulu in Labasa, Navakaka Village in Navatu.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2017, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government  completed retrofitting works for the following 

evacuation centres in Sabeto in Ba, Narokorokoyawa Village at a cost of $40,000, Koroiyaco Village 

at a cost of $40,000 and Naboutini Village at a cost of $20,000.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  2018,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  built  four  evacuation  centres  in  Cakaudrove, 

Navakavou  Village  in  Taveuni  at  a  cost  of  $65,000,  at  Tavuki  Village  at  a  cost  of  $100,000,  at 

Nukubolu Village at a cost of $47,000 and Tabia Village at a cost of $75,000.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2019 there were already evacuation centres to be constructed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that 

includes  Matacula  and  Maumi  in  Tailevu.    Saliadrau  in  Namosi  and,  of  course,  Narikoso  and 

Rokovuaka in Ba but we all understand the situation that we are in and the communities have been 

advised accordingly. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to say that this Government is no longer making available this facility to 

assist our rural communities is an outright lie.  That is not correct, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Let me say, that 

the concept of evacuation centres is a proactive measure put in place by Government to ensure that 

Fijians in affected communities are protected and provided with basic human needs such as water, 

food and accommodation during disasters.  It is important to note that due to climate change, larger 

and more damaging disasters are the new norm and we need to be prepared year-round, rather than 

just in the predicted cyclone season. 

</span></p>
<p><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the will of the people is reflected in the Government and this is why they 

chose this Government.  That will of Government and the people are reflected in the policies of the 

Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the Disaster Risk Reduction Policy of Government for the years 2018 

to 2030.  It talks about preparedness, we need to prepare now to minimise the damages and of course 

the loss of unnecessary lives as well when there is a disaster.  It talks about key structural measures, 

Sir,  and  I  will  refer  on  a  few:  safer  schools,  safer  hospitals,  evacuation  centre  and  multi-purpose 

community centre.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  have  already  in  this  House  answered  a  question  by  the  Honourable  Member  about  the 

difference between a community hall and a properly constructed built for a purpose evacuation centre 

and we have gone further in this document, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to say that we also need to build multi-

purpose community centre.  Because of the community halls in the villages are just waiting for the 

next </span><span>bose va koro</span><span> or for the …. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  However,  we  need  to  fully  utilise  that,  instead  of 

properly building another kindergarten, it can be better used, that is why it needs to be a multi-purpose 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>centre, and of course we have started building purpose-built evacuation centres as well, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me go to the schools.  We understand the economic disparity in our communities; that is 

a fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have talked about responsibility, but of course in the absence of these 

facilities in the communities, there are alternatives, but people need to move quickly.  This week I 

have been talking to the media, they have been asking me, “Why did the siren not come up?”   There 

is a difference between alert and warning.  When the alerts are given, that is the time for you to start 

moving.  Do not leave it too late, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is why the unfortunate case in Taveuni, I personally made the effort to go to that </span><span>Mandir</span><span>

in Taveuni and apologise to the </span><span>Mandir</span><span> Committee, but this is the fact about that situation.  That was 

not a Government designated evacuation centre, but the advisory councillor, who was worried about 

the safety of the people, who did not adhere to the alert that was given earlier left it too late.  When 

the wind was at its peak, then they wanted to start moving.  Unfortunately, Mr. Mahendra Chaudhary 

did not state this fact, the next Evacuation Centre is six kilometres down.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If  you  have  been  to  Taveuni,  he  was  referring  to  South  Taveuni  Secondary  School;  six 

kilometres down the road to get to that place.  So it was on the initiative of the advisory councillor 

that she asked the </span><span>Mandir</span><span> Committee and the priest if those people can be sheltered but, of course, 

people need to take responsibility and respect the place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Government does not have to be blamed, because it was not a designated evacuation centre 

but on the initiative and in the interest of safety that I have already stated, the advisory councillor 

asked if they could be sheltered there.  I have apologised on behalf of the Government, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, and I have assured the chairman of the </span><span>Mandir</span><span>, “You have every right to close this facility.”  But 

if people come here, they have to respect this place. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government already has about 1,033 registered evacuation 

centres throughout Fiji and the majority of these are schools:  443 in the Central Division, 86 in the 

Eastern Division, 198 in the Northern Division and 306 in the Western Division.  We have come up 

lately with a new App that you need to use in order to find out where your nearest evacuation centre 

is</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also say that through the Build Back Better Programme of Government, 

after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, we reconstructed or retrofitted resilient infrastructure with a total of 118.   Sir, 33 of 

</span><span>those were schools and most of the schools, I would proudly say here, withstood Category 5 </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>in 

</span><span>the recent calamity that we went through.  Let me share some ideas to the Honourable Members of the 

House, maybe we can go back now to our communities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Government has a long list of priorities that cannot be addressed all at once.  I have spoken to the 

</span><span>Roko</span><span> and District Officers (DOs).  There are smarter ways in which we can short-circuit the Government 

development programmes so that they can have evacuation centres, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  All that they need 

to do is go to the Ministry of Agriculture or go to the Ministry of Rural Development through the self-

help projects or through programmes in here - 100,000 </span><span>dalo </span><span>suckers at one dollar per </span><span>dalo,</span><span> that is one 

</span><span>evacuation centre, cashed within a period of nine months, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sawaieke in Gau has done that, they did not have to run back to Government and ask for money 

because  through  their  yaqona  planting  programme,  they  have  managed  to  constru  ct  their  new 

evacuation centre.  Nasolo in Bua, they do not have to come to Government to ask for money.  There 

</span><span>are ways - we just need to organise and let us get these ideas across to the people to make sure that 

</span><span>retrofitting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is continuing.

<p><span>641 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let  me  assure  this  august  House,  Government  values  and  takes  seriously  the  safety  and 

wellbeing of our people and we will continue when we have the resources, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will 

continue  with  the  building  of  evacuation  centres  and  retrofitting,  according  to  this  document, 

purpose-build evacuation centres and multi-purpose centres so that our people can be safe.  Thank 

you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence,  National  Security  and</p>
<p><span>Policing, Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management for his reply.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  at  this  juncture,  I  have  been  asked  from  the  floor  for  a  point  of 

clarification  and  I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy, 

Civil Service and Communications.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What I would like to clarify is 

the  issue  on  the  question  that  Honourable  Tikoduadua  had  asked  on  the  Accountability  and 

Transparency Commission in which I had mentioned that the Bill had been sent to the Committee.  

The Committee has actually finished its work, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Bill now needs to go into 

the floor of Parliament for the Committee Stage where we go clause by clause. We hope to obviously, 

get that done soon.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I just want to clarify that the actual Committee has done its work, has come back to Parliament 

now for the Third Reading and before that, we need to go into the Committee Stage of Parliament to 

go clause by clause and hopefully, with the time given and the new extra week of sitting, once we 

have finished all of that then we can probably go into this Committee Stage to look at this Bill.  Thank 

you. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.  We will leave it at that:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I just want to make one other point clear before we adjourn.  This week, 

the Speaker has been thumped from right, from left, from the front in this House and outside of this 

House.  People think that they know my job better than I do.  I can do this job better than anyone and 

that is what I have done and I will keep on doing that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to Statements in the House, there are two persons in the House that I give leeway 

to; the Honourable Prime Minister and the Honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I give them the 

licence.  Some of you have strayed all over the place when you speak and then you start to blame me.  

I can take it on the chin, you ask yourselves if you can take it on the chin.  I just want to make that 

point clear.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament, you have the floor, Sir.
