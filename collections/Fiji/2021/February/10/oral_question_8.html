<p>(Question No. 27/2021)</p>
<p>HON. S.S.  KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 

Maritime Development and Disaster Management inform Parliament on the response by the 

Fiji Police Force duringTC Yasain ensuring that the mandate of national security and the 

rule of law is upheld?</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU (Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 

Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management).- Mr. Speaker, Sir again the Police is 

one  of  the  key  stakeholders  when  it  comes  to  our  response  during  emergency  operations  and,  of 

course,TC YasaandTC Anaand the rest is not an exemption.  Again, we are guided, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, by the Police Act Cap. 81 â€“ the key responsibility is the maintenance of law and order and protect 

life and property.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the Fiji Police Force, Royal Fiji Military 

Forces and the National Fire Authority for their commitment duringTC Yasaand of courseTC Anaas well.</p>
<p>How do they provide assistance not only in terms of maintaining law and order but also to 

protect life and property?  As mandated, every agency of government has to have liaison officers at 

the national level, at NDMO, and even District level as well, what we call DSLOs (Disaster Liaison 

Officers) in the respective EOCs.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the maintaining of cordons.  They provide cordons in towns or 

cities or they control movement through the establishment of checkpoints, not only that but they do 

the normal patrols in the towns and the cities as well and of course in the rural areas.</p>
<p>One thing that we appreciate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the establishment of Community Police 

Posts apart from the major Police Stations throughout Fiji.  These Community Police Posts and Police 

Stations allow easy access by the community to the Fiji Police Force so that they can respond to the 

situation, not only in terms of law and order issues, but of course for the protection of life and property 

as well.</p>
<p>I recall the incident, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Salababa Road in Waila where the police had to 

sacrifice their lives to rescue the family that perhaps made the decision very late to vacate their home.  

And that is not the only case, there are so many of these throughout Fiji.  Not only that, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, the Fiji Police Force also assists by providing resources, not only manpower, but their vehicles, 

boats, they also provide escorts and the manning of check points as I  have already alluded to.  The 

normal investigative work continues and of course all the other normal police work, whether it be 

prosecution or administrative work so that law and order, and of course protect life and property.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>I also use this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to acknowledge the Government of Japan.  As 

we speak, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government of Japan has assisted the Fiji Police Force in terms of 

capability, probably something that we will see (God forbid) come the next one, we will see a lot of 

assets, particularly on water rescue.  We have new boats currently unloaded at the Fiji Police Force 

in Nasinu (former Mobile Base), and that is something that we will see online, God forbid, come the 

next one.  So we continue to commit to the improvement of the capability so that they can maintain 

effectiveness and efficiency in performing their roles.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Tabuya, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  ask  my  question,  I  wish  to  join  the 

Honourable Minister in thanking the Fiji Police Force for their help during the cyclone, especially 

forTC Ana.We have family that live in Salababa Road, especially mytauvufrom Ra, who a lot of 

their families were saved by the Police, so thank you.</p>
<p>My supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is based on the Constitution, the freedom of 

movement of our people which is a fundamental right.  My question to the Honourable Minister is, 

how do they continue to justify the national curfew when there is no scientific evidence and neither 

has it been proven that it prevents crime?  Why do they continue to impose it, it has been almost 12 

months now, and people need to know why do they continue to justify the imposition of this curfew?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    There  is  a  thin  line 

between health and safety in the interest of safety and of course the other issues that the Honourable 

Member has raised.  But there is a proviso in the Constitution relating to not only national security, 

but of course health as well.   The curfew that we have in place is not only something that we pulled 

out duringTC YasaandTC Ana, but it was there from day one when we wanted to have a COVID-

free Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone in Fiji appreciates the fact, the Honourable Ro Kepa has just 

expressed her gratitude that we are COVID-free and let us not rush into changing what we have in 

place because life is more important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, than anything else.</p>
<p>The right to life is more important than the economy.  The right to life is more important than 

anything  else,  so  let  us  stick  the  course  and  let  us  suffer  together  as  a  country  for  the  good  and 

betterment of every Fijian.</p>
<p>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!</p>
