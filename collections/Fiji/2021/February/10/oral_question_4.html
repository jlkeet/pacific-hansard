<p>Reinstatement of Water Supply 

(Question No. 23/2021)</p>
<p>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 

Mineral  Resources  inform  Parliament  on  the  status  of  reinstating  water  supply  to  affected 

areas during the course ofTC YasaandTC Ana?</p>
<p>HON.  J.  USAMATE  (Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and</p>
<p>Mineral Resources).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for his question.</p>
<p>DuringTC YasaandTC Anathere was a total of 21 water systems and over 80 rural water 

schemes that were affected nationwide. The problems were due to major landslides, flooding that 

caused blockage of inlets at our catchment areas and blockages of water pumps which reduced raw 

water supply to our treatment plants.  These resulted in the breakages of critical of all the pipelines</p>

<p>supplying raw water to water treatment plants and because of the continuous heavy rains, flooding 

and high turbidity levels cause excessive sludge at our water treatment plants.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,TC Yasasignificantly damaged many rural water schemes in the Northern 

Division especially in the severely affected areas of Bua Province. However,TC Anaalso caused a 

lot  of  damage  to  our  water  systems  and  rural  schemes  combined  throughout  the  country  with 

continuous heavy rain, major flooding and major landslides.</p>
<p>Post-TC Yasa,the  WAF  team  that  was  deployed  managed  to  repair  over  80  villages  rural 

schemes benefiting over 11,000 people in the eighttikinaof the Bua Province.  They restored 96 

percent of the affected areas within two weeks post-TC Yasawith the main repair works at the Galoa 

Island which involved installing 6 kilometers of submarine pipeline. As I informed the House, Sir, 

yesterday I visited Galoa on Saturday last week and I found that their pipeline is not working again 

so now Water Authority is looking to reconnect that pipeline.</p>
<p>To-date, 98.5 percent of water is restored to the rural water schemes affected duringTC Yasa. 

After  the  destructions  caused  byTC  Ana,water  supply  within  the  Central,  Eastern  and  Maritime 

Divisions  is fully restored except  for the Navua  Water  Supply and Nayagi  borehole system at  70 

percent.  The WAF team is currently running all four borehole pumps to fill the reservoirs in which 

services are to be fully restored  as soon as possible.  Water carting trucks have been deployed to 

service affected areas.</p>
<p>The Western Division Water Systems have been fully restored except for the Sigatoka Water 

System which currently is at 75 percent completion. This was due to the blockages on all six main 

raw water pumps which affected the Matovo Water Treatment Plant in Sigatoka. The WAF team has 

been working around the clock to clear the blocked pumps and to desilt the water treatment plant 

clarifier.  WAF deployed water carting trucks to ensure continuous supply to affected areas.</p>
<p>The Northern Division Systems are fully restored except for the main system in Labasa which 

is at 40 percent completion.  Continuous heavy rains have caused major landslides in the Nasealevu 

area resulting in the washing away and rupture of the major bulk pipelines supplying raw water to 

the Benau Water Treatment Plant.  Initially 250 metres of this major pipeline was washed away and 

later on another 80 metres was washed away and these have yet to be replaced.   This has also delayed 

the systems repair and restoration works.</p>
<p>WAF team of 25 workmen have been camping on the site and we will continue to be engaged 

as human resources to  do works that machines cannot  perform.  With the current  production, the 

water supply has been normalised to the main business areas of Labasa and their valve operation 

schedule will be submitted for the remaining areas - it will allow water to be rationed to other affected 

areas as the pressure normalises and as the reservoirs fill up.</p>
<p>The WAF team should be able to finalise the additional resources required such as extra tanks 

at  strategic  locations  and  water  carting  trucks  engagement  over  the  next  few  days  to  ensure  that 

affected  customers  are  provided  water  for  their  basic  needs  during  this  time.    As  at  Monday,  8thFebruary,  2021  the  repair  works  have  been  completed  and  we  are  anticipating  full  100  percent 

restoration as soon as possible.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution. I now give the floor 

to the Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa to ask Question 24/2021 which is the fifth Oral Question for 

today.  You have the floor, Madam.</p>
