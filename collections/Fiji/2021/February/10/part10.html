</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji’s Emissions Reduction Payment Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  I  rise  to  inform  Parliament 

about Fiji’s Emissions Reduction Payment Agreement between the Fijian Government and Forest 

Carbon Partnership Facility or ERPA as we call it.  The concept of an ERPA is fairly novel, not just 

for Fiji but for the world, so at the outset, please allow me to provide context.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In order to achieve a net zero global economy and keep global temperatures well below 1.5 

Degree  Celsius,  189  countries  that  are  party  to  the  Paris  Agreement  are  required  to  reduce  their 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions or GHGs through emission reduction initiatives.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Emission  reduction  commitments  of  each  country  are  articulated  in  their  Nationally 

Determined  Contributions  or  NDCs,  which  are  periodically  reported  to  the  United  Nations 

Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  In mapping out the paths to a low carbon 

future, high GHG emitting countries are running into a dilemma. They are unable to create enough 

natural carbon sinks to negate their national GHG emissions and achieve their NDC commitment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>To address this shortfall, these countries have the option to purchase emission credits from 

countries  like  Fiji  that  are  small  global  emitters  with  surplus  natural  carbon  sink  stocks,  such  as 

forests, grasslands, mangroves and sea grasses. Moreover, both high and low GHG emitting countries 

also have the option to establish domestic trading schemes to  entice resource owners within their 

borders  to  preserve  and  protect  natural  carbon  sinks  in  exchange  for  payments  according  to  a 

predefined carbon price.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  forms  of  international  and  domestic  carbon  emission  trading  are 

broadly defined as what we call carbon markets. The practice of carbon trading is widely regarded 

as a crucial component for addressing the global climate crisis.  It helps put a price on GHG emissions 

and  entices  government  and  non-government  stakeholders  to  create  a  business  case  for  GHG 

abatement, as well as the potential to support nature-based solutions in climate vulnerable countries.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  Small  Island  Developing  State  (SIDS)  that  contributes  only  0.006 

percent to global GHG emissions, while being lush with an expensive ecosystem that is well-suited 

for offsetting carbon emissions, Fiji has incredible potential to create far more natural carbon sinks 

than what we will need to accelerate towards a net zero carbon neutral future. That leaves us with the 

prospect for great untapped potential to both help the planet and bolster our economy here at home.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  market  opportunity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  great.  Carbon  markets  are  continuing  to 

experience  steady  growth,  despite  the  global  economic  contraction  caused  by  COVID-19.    Right 

now, their carbon pricing mechanisms in more than 90 national and subnational jurisdictions around 

the  world  (Nationally,  these  include  New  Zealand,  China,  Europe,  South  Korea,  South  Africa, 

Thailand, Japan and Canada, and Sub-nationally, the United States), we are glad to see them back 

into the Paris Agreement family. This creates an opportunity for Fiji to participate in carbon markets 

to convert our already strong focus on environmental preservation into financial gains that can be 

used to fund new and additional climate actions.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we can all agree that our comparative advantage of being both, a 

low-emitting and nature-rich country, creates a strong socio-economic rationale for Fiji to sign the 

ERPA with the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ERPA was signed on Wednesday, 27th January, 2021 (this year) as a 

five-year  carbon  trade  contract  between  the  Fijian  Government  on  behalf  of  all  Fijians  and  the 

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as trustee of the carbon fund owned 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>by the FCPF.  Fiji is one of 19 countries only in the world, accepted for funding under the Carbon 

Fund portfolio and this is the first and only Pacific Island Country to enter into the carbon trade under 

this framework. 

</span></p>
<p><span>While we are just getting started with carbon trading, the hard work that went in behind the 

scenes, to make this possible, had been going on for some time and I think it is only appropriate, 

apart  from  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Forests  and  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Fisheries  and 

Forests, the Permanent Secretary for Economy and the Head of Climate Change,  to mention the four 

individuals specifically who were involved in the technical work – the Conservator of Forests, Ms. 

Sanjana Lal; Mr. Ilai Tulele, Programme Team Leader REDD+; and Jeannette Mani and Deepitika 

Chand,  the Mitigation Officers in the Climate Change Office.  Those were the core technical people. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The ERPA is a culmination of over a decade of work that begun in 2009, and over the years 

with funding and technical support of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility managed by the World 

Bank, the preparatory work ensued in readiness to the implementation of the ERPA. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  humanity  has  long  exploited  natural  resources  at  the  expense  of 

development and released GHG emissions to a level that has suffocated the earth’s fragile biosphere.  

The ERPA elevates the importance of trees and forests as a natural resource in sustaining lives and 

offers a tangible solution through designating forests as sinks for sequestration GHGs and provide 

the system for verifying quantifiable measures of the reducing level of GHG emissions over the next 

five years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The ERPA has identified an area of 37,282 hectares within 20 Districts, spread over the three 

islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu and Taveuni, in which the emission reduction activities will be 

conducted.  Those activities include the: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>establishment of forests on degraded land;  

sustainable management of designated timber production forests;  

total protection of intact existing natural forests; 

incorporation of trees into farming and agricultural systems;   

promotion of forest-based livelihood ventures as an alternative to forest attraction, such as 

ecotourism, beekeeping, agroforestry; and  

establishment of nurseries for high-valued native species of forests. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate  bodies,  such  as  the  Fiji  Pine  Group  of  Companies  and  the  Fiji  Hardwood 

</span><span>Corporation  Limited,  are  already  supporting  the  ERPA.    They  have  pledged  to  contribute  to  the 

</span><span>establishment of forests as designated carbon sinks within their respective programmes and as their 

corporate social responsibility to reduce emissions and help Fiji combat climate change. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the contracted volume of carbon dioxide emissions that Fiji is expected to 

sequester  from  those  forest  activities  over  the  next  five  years  is  2.5  million  tonnes,  which  upon 

verification will yield a result-based payment of US$12.5 million over the span of five years, divided 

into three trenches, which are as follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>11th July, 2019 to 31st December, 2020 - 300,000 units; 

</span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2021 to 31st December, 2022 – 1 million units; and 

(3)</span><span> </span><span>1st January, 2023 to 31st December, 2024 – 1.2 million units. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  total  cost  of  commitments  under  the  ERPA  is  US31.2  million,  of  which  the  Fijian 

Government’s contribution over the five years is US$13.5 million, and will be absorbed into the usual 

annual  work  programme  in  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.    A  further 

</span></p>

<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>447 

</span></p>
<p><span>US$8.82  million  of  the  remaining  amount  is  associated  to  costs  for  corporate  bodies  involved  in 

forest  establishments  and  the  cost  of  adopting  sustainable  harvesting  regimes.    The  balance  of 

US$8.89  million  will  be  sourced  externally  from  multilateral  climate  funds,  such  as  the  Green 

Climate Fund (GCF), Adaptation Fund (AF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). 

</span></p>
<p><span>By  leveraging  Fiji’s  usual  expenditure  in  the  forestry  and  agriculture  sector  to  unlock 

additional funding of US$12.5 million, ERPA encourages integration and coordination throughout 

the  various  Government  structures  and  tiers  of  decision-making,  promotes  inclusivity  and  the 

empowerment of resource owners and often marginalised communities through livelihood ventures 

and employment opportunities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that the US$12.5 million that will be generated from 

this initiative will be passed down to resource owners as incentive payments through a benefit-sharing 

plan developed by the Fijian Government in collaboration with the World Bank.  Moreover, the rights 

of  property  owners  will  be  protected  under  the  feedback  grievance  mechanism,  the  safeguard 

information system and a robust monitoring, reporting and verification system, which will be jointly 

administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Forestry,  iTaukei  Lands  Trust  Board,  the  Provincial  Councils, 

Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Economy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>From a policy perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ERPA further supports Fiji’s commitment to 

various Agreements, Treaties and Conventions, particularly the commitment to reduce Fiji’s GHG 

emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and the planting of 30 million trees in the next 10 years.  At the end 

of  the  five-year  ERPA  Programme,  Sir,  Fiji  will  establish  a  reputable  monitoring,  reporting  and 

verification  system  that  will  vigorously  be  tested  in  preparation  for  future  carbon  trade  and 

competitive carbon markets, allowing us to build on our momentum and continue to tap into new 

carbon trading opportunities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government is cognisant of the fact that carbon markets require 

robust  enabling  environment,  to  ensure  market  forces,  namely;  the  supply  and  demand  of  carbon 

credits.  They must interact seamlessly.  In this regard, we are currently conducting, as we all know, 

a national consultation on the Draft Climate Change Bill which will create the legislative framework 

for creating carbon markets in Fiji, enabling local resource owners to access foreign carbon markets 

through the Fijian Government’s trading setup.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  in  particular,  the  Draft  Climate  Change  Bill  establishes  carbon  sequestration  property 

rights and defines it as exclusive and distinctly legal right to carbon sequestration and carbon stocks.  

The draft Bill sets out the perimeters for the assignment of such property rights by defining them, if 

they have exclusive and distinctly legal right to carbon sequestration and carbon stocks. The carbon 

sequestration  property  rights  shall  be  attached  to  an  eligible  land  until  its  term  is  concluded  or 

renewed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  pleased  to  highlight  that  once  a  resource  owner  registers  and  is 

assigned carbon sequestration property rights by the Registrar of Titles, it is recognised as an official 

instrument of title that is recognised under the Personal Property Securities Act.  Essentially, it gives 

additional asset value to the land it is assigned for, even people who may lease it can actually have 

those properties assigned to them.  Such legal recognition creates the foundation for trading carbon 

sequestration property rights in the carbon markets.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In summary, the Draft Climate Change Bill will enable the Fijian Government to work with 

resource owners to assign carbon sequestration property rights and transfer them to the Forest Carbon 

Partnership Facility for a period of five years, in exchange for emission reduction results payments.  

The Forest  Bill  2020, which is  the  revised improved version  of  the  Forest  Bill  2016, is  currently

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>under consultation.  We will also supplement and support the Draft Climate Change Bill provided in 

the Framework to facilitate the implementation of ERPA.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as nations in the world work towards creating a carbon neutral future by 

2050 which Fiji has already given a commitment to carbon markets are one of the many tools that 

will  be  leveraged  to  tackle  global  climate  emergency  which  science  tells  us  is  a  direct  result  of 

increased GHSs in the atmosphere.  Fiji, through the support of the World Bank and the FCPF, now 

has the opportunity to participate in international carbon markets  which goes beyond the existing 

National REDD+ initiative.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that at the end of the five year ERPA, Fiji will have 

the option to have 95 percent of its 2.5 million tonnes of emission reduction units transferred back 

by the FCPF.  This, again, can be used by Fiji towards our NDC, to achieve our 2050 net zero carbon 

reduction targets and, indeed, we can trade on it again.   

</span></p>
<p><span>While the carbon credits are currently only be quantified for the Forestry Sector, this is just a 

start.  Through this prestigious programme, Fiji will gain global recognition as  FCPF is playing a 

catalysing  role  in  connecting  countries  with  private  sector  investments  which  could  potentially 

unlock opportunities for other sectors, as well as, for example, the blue carbon ecosystems, something 

that obviously has great potential for big ocean State like ours.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  has  the  unique  opportunity  of  capacity  building  for 

monitoring,  reporting  and  verification  access  to  the  central  registry  housed  at  the  World  Bank.  

Certification of the carbon credits by the FCPF and more importantly, leveraging much bigger future 

financing incentives in the voluntary markets around the world. 

</span></p>
<p><span>If Fiji successfully implements the emission reduction programme and obtains payments, its 

carbon crediting system will demonstrate world leading field tested processes and systems to support 

future carbon trading.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot underestimate, nor overstate the potential here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as all countries are now required to reduce emissions as much as possible 

under the Paris Agreement, carbon markets will evolve towards financing climate projects that truly 

drive the zero carbon emission and the transition to it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Draft  Climate  Change  Bill  thus  creates  an  enabling  environment  for  carbon  market 

initiatives in Fiji by defining carbon sequestration and property rights, encouraging the formulation 

of  robust  REDD+  and  blue  carbon  policies,  mandating  the  development  of  emission  reduction 

methodologies,  as  well  as  providing  guidance  on  voluntary  and  compliance-based  market 

mechanisms.  The signing of the ERPA could help garner financial support to operationalise these 

aspects of the Climate Change Bill, once it is enacted by Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government has laid the ground work and we are excited to see 

where this innovative new initiative takes us in the months and years ahead.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy, 

Civil Service and Communications for his Ministerial Statement.  I now give the floor to the Leader 

of the Opposition.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise in response to the 

Ministerial Statement as presented just a while ago by the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister 

for Economy, Civil Service and Communications. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="11">Page 11</a></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>449 

</span></p>
<p><span>From  the  outset,  the  Ministerial  Statement  being  made  is  fully  endorsed  and  fully  agreed 

upon, but at the same time this side of the House will not take things lightly as to how the downstream 

effect of this Agreement is going to be felt by the very people who are involved, especially with the 

resource  owners.  When  I  say  resource  owners,  it  also  means  landowners,  native  landowners, 

including freeholders who own big chunks of land that are covered with forest as well.    A few will 

disagree  that  to  achieve  the  climate  goals  of  limiting  global  warming  from  1.5  to  2.0,  there  is  a 

massive amount of work to be done, one of which is to fundamentally transform the fossil fuel based 

global energy system.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Paris Agreement is made through country arrangements to share this 

burden - their contributions being determined voluntarily at the national level.  Most agree that the 

contributions put forward to-date are grossly inadequate to the task.  In short, we have a long list of 

difficult essential actions and a short time to do them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we look back at what we have, especially to do with our resources, past 

colonial governments of Fiji have made very important decisions as to how we conserve our forests.  

Now, through modern science and technology, we have come up with this kind of policies that relate, 

or are connected in one way or another to the Paris Agreement.  But, Sir, we usually have forest 

reserves that are agreed upon by the landowners or it was Government’s initiative at that time.  I am 

specifically talking about the big forest reserve in the Nadarivatu area and in Taveuni.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At one point, they were being paid annual sums to ensure that there is monetary benefit going 

down to the resource owners because they were to forego all potential incomes that were going to go 

to them, if they were to access their natural forest resources.  As such, with this development to do 

with carbon mission, Sir, we on this side of the House support that but then again, the only question 

that we beg to raise with the Government is, what happens to the resource owners?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we have just heard from the Honourable Minister for Economy that they are still doing 

studies and these were the very things that were indicated in this House when we raised questions to 

the Honourable Minister for Forestry as to how resources were going to be shared or how returns 

from those investments were going to reach down to the landowners.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our contribution is part of our resources, Sir, but then again I can only state here that we hope 

that with the REDD+ and all those new policies that are coming, that a proper awareness programme 

be undertaken with the landowners so as to enable them to properly understand what this is all about.  

Otherwise, it is just Government trading discussions so we can conform to the Paris Agreement, et 

cetera, but the poor landowners are completely at a loss as to how they would be able to benefit. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Prime Minister interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- The benefits are clear, Honourable Prime Minister.  We 

will  have  threats,  air  to  breathe  and  we  will  protect  our  natural  resources,  et  cetera,  but  the  poor 

landowners are the ones who are going to suffer.  I beg you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Leader of the Opposition for his statement:</span> I now</p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Leader of the National Federation Party.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C  PRASAD.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  Carbon  emissions  trading 

schemes are known to be fission schemes, private sector-led but I think some of the points that the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition raised are important.  There are important issues with respect 

to the Agreement.  We need to understand what the details of the Agreement are and I know that the 

</span></p>
<p><a name="12">Page 12</a></p>
<p><span>450 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Attorney-General  alluded  to  the  Climate  Change  Bill  because  that  Bill  will  actually 

embed the domestic laws that will determine how the Agreement is put into effect.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We must also understand that the World Bank, Mr. Speaker, does not always have a very 

good  record.    I  remember  in  2015,  there  was  the  whole  scandal  about  how  communities  were 

dispossessed with respect to how the Agreements were put in place.  So, while we want to use all the 

tools to achieve the NDC commitment, we have to ensure that those who were going to provide the 

resources have the Agreement which is properly in place so that they are not dispossessed, or that 

they  do  not  lose  out  because  there  have  been  cases  around  the  world  that  the  World  Bank  is  not 

always the best guide to actually do that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, Mr. Speaker, that is all I have to say on that but while I have time, I just want to 

respond to the Honourable Attorney-General because he could not help responding to what I said 

yesterday  and  I  think  basic  understanding  of  economics,  Mr.  Speaker,  will  tell  the  Honourable 

Minister  for  Economy  that  when  I  talked  about  creating  demand,  it  was  not  just  talking  about 

consumption.   I can understand the idea behind reducing tariffs in the last Budget but, Mr. Speaker, 

when people do not have the money, when they do not have the income, when they have lost their 

jobs, when they are earning less than what they should be earning, reduction in tariff is not going to 

help.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, the Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterway and Environment should give an 

</span></p>
<p><span>economic lesson to people on the other side.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- The point I was making is that, when we have a crisis 

of this nature, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where demand is a big issue, you ought to look at health, education 

and look at income support for those who do not have income.  Let me give you an example. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  look  at  the  tourism  industry,  for  example,  80  percent  of  the</p>
<p><span>employment generation…. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party, you should speak to</p>
<p><span>the topic. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.:</span> It is related to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.:</span> I have my time and I want to respond to it because it is</p>
<p><span>important to them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>Honourable Member, that is probably related to that but you are taking quite a while coming 

</span></p>
<p><span>around to it.  So, please, get on with it.

<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- That is unparliamentary language:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor:</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, basic understanding 

of  economics  will  tell  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Economy  that  if  you  are  trying  to  help  the 

communities, they have to be supported through income support.  In addition, I mentioned the three 

pillars on which our policy is going to help us recover from these crises which are education, health 

and income support. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We can bring this Bill, we can bring this Agreement to say, “Alright, we are doing things on 

the side to help people to get income support through carbon emission trading.”  That is fine, but 

right now, we need to hear from the Honourable Minister for Economy a recovery plan to ensure that 

we are dealing with the crisis in an efficient and effective manner.  

</span></p>
<p><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Attorney-General should not play politics.  Politics is 

not always about Elections.  Politics is not always about winning an argument.  Politics must also be 

used to do good for our people.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I thank the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party for his</p>
<p><span>contribution.  We will move on. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, I have been advised that there are no Bills for consideration today.  So, 

on that note, we will now suspend proceedings for refreshments and this will be served at the usual 

place.  We adjourn for refreshments. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.28 a.m.
