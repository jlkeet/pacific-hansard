<p>Chicken Coops in Rural Non-Municipal Towns 

(Question No. 20/2021)</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the indulgence and I 

apologise for not being here.  I had to attend a very urgent call that really had to be attended to.</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament what 

action  will  be  taken  against  residents  building  chicken  coops  next  to  dwelling  homes  for 

chicks  provided  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  the  rural  non-municipal  towns,  like 

Korovou, which is in contravention of rural local authority or health bylaws?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Thank you, Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring some background into answering this question. The 

Fijian Government  as part of the rehabilitation programme has  given farmers  day  old  chicks and 

distributed it as part of the rehabilitation programme and also as part of food security for farmers.  

Obviously, there is a difference between commercial farming and household farming to meet their 

needs.  These birds are very useful, as you know, we are going through unprecedented times, so it is 

an ability for the farmers as a good source of protein and especially being able to again being another 

source of food readily available at home.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fundamental basis of building a chicken coop is obviously to ensure that 

the chickens are protected and also coming back to the letter of the law is because of the Public Health 

Act, there should not be a nuisance.  Nuisance in terms of the noise and also the smell.  That is where 

the Public Health Act comes in to play.</p>
<p>As I have said, these nuisance can be a health hazard and under the Public Health Act, where 

the complaint is actually brought forward to the Health Inspectors, whether they be at the Rural Local 

Authority or they are our Health Inspectors, then what happens is, the Health Inspectors and the Zone 

Nurse then goes across and discusses this with the family and tells them, “Look, this is the issue at 

hand.”  Then they are given a time to be able to deal with it, whether it be the smell or the noise or 

whatever it may be, before actually enforcing the legislative process.</p>
<p>What we have also done is that, in this unprecedented times, we have actually realized that 

we have to be able to look at the spirit of the law rather than the letter of the law.  There have been 

occasions  where  our  people  have  actually  had  to  go  and  give  warnings  several  times  before  we 

actually go across with the regulations and say, “Look, we are now going to actually go through the 

process of the law” - understanding them.</p>
<p>Just as a side note, you might have noticed that recently, we have just assigned a legal notice 

for tobacco farmers and their registration extending it by another one or two months and trying to get 

people to understand that to be able to continue to meet the needs, that they have to be able to tick 

these boxes to be able to do so.  If they do not meet that, then certainly, we will obviously issue them 

with the notices and then actually take them to court.  Having said that, in the intervening period 

between the end of last year till now, we have taken 17 to court for a variety of reasons, including 

nuisance and other things.</p>
<p>As  I  have  said  earlier,  we  are  more  interested  in  them  understanding  the  spirit  of  the  law 

before enforcing the letter of the law, understanding the difficult challenges that we are going through 

at this time.Vinaka.</p>
