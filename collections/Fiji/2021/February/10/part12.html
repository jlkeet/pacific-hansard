<h3>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI MEAT INDUSTRY BOARD 2014 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<p><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI MEAT INDUSTRY BOARD 2014 ANNUAL REPORT 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V. NATH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move:</p>
<p><span>That Parliament debates the Review of Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>which was tabled on 14th May, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V. K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I now invite the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic</p>
<p><span>Affairs to speak on his motion. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB) was mandated to 

protect and preserve the meat industry in Fiji with the core function to construct and operate public 

slaughtering facilities so that people in Fiji get safe and hygienic meat for consumption.  

</span></p>
<p><span>During deliberation on the report, the Committee invited stakeholders of FMIB to present on 

the  Annual  Report.  During  the  submission  the  challenges  faced  by  FMIB  came  to  light  which 

included but were not limited to poor supply of livestock which was listed as a major contributing 

factor towards its struggles.  The Committee was made aware that between 2000 and 2018 (the total 

number included Suva and Vuda) it declined from 10,779 cattle being slaughtered per year to 8,798.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee was concerned with the poor financial performance of the industry as well as 

the  deteriorating  conditions  of  the  abattoirs  and  concurred  with  the  previous  Committee’s 

recommendation from the 2013 Annual Report, to divest and privatise FMIB which could result on 

more efficient and sustainable abattoirs operating throughout the country.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Further to the above, the Committee also agreed that Fiji has the potential to develop specialty 

beef under its own brand (Fijian Grown and </span><span>Fijian Made</span><span>) and recommended for similar initiatives 

to be undertaken as was done for the Tilivalevu Beef Scheme.  

</span></p>
<p><span>During its submission, the Chief Executive Officer of FMIB also put forward policies and 

Action Plans that would strengthen FMIB’s position. This included plans of upgrading both abattoirs 

to be HACCP certified to enable them to supply to hotels. The Committee looks forward to recent 

year reports from FMIB to be able to determine the progress on the proposed policies since its last 

report. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with those few comments to enlighten the House as a Member moving the</p>
<p><span>motion, I thank you for the opportunity. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Chairperson  for  his  motion.    Honourable 

Members, the floor is now open for debate but what I will do is, we will break for lunch and after 

lunch, I have a list of speakers here. There are already five speakers; the Honourable Gavoka will be 

the first off and then we will play it from there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, we adjourn for lunch. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.18 p.m. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>469 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.32 p.m. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, we will continue from where we left off before</p>
<p><span>lunch.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There is a slight change in the batting order and I will give the floor to the Honourable Prime 

Minister first then followed by Honourable Gavoka, Honourable Minister Reddy, Honourable Niko 

Nawaikula,  Honourable  Minister  Koya,  Honourable  Qionibaravi,  Honourable  Minister  Seruiratu, 

Honourable Tikoduadua and the Honourable Attorney-General - that is the batting order so you have 

an indication of when you are going to speak. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Prime Minister, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the</p>
<p><span>motion by the Honourable Vijay Nath.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the livestock industry remains a crucial industry as Government continues its 

efforts to reduce import bill and promote local production to boost local consumption as well as for 

the export markets.  The livestock industry has an important role in contributing to Fiji’s economy 

despite the challenges the industry continues to face over the many years.  Now only two registered 

slaughter houses in Fiji,  Mr. Speaker, which have the capacity to process cattle, sheep, goats and 

pigs.  Both are run by Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB).  Limiting the operations of FMIB may result 

in the increase of illegal slaughter houses and place huge risk to the health of ordinary Fijians. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tuberculosis and brucellosis have been threats to the Fijian dairy industry and FMIB facilities 

have been instrumental in taking care of infected animals as well as processing the compensation.  

Despite the challenges, Mr. Speaker, it is noted that in the reported period, Government provided 

new initiatives in its annual budgetary allocation.  It is in this interest that Government emphasises 

collaboration, participation from  all actors in  the supply chain  of any industry.  Government  will 

continue to support the livestock industry but the Government also needs everyone’s concerted effort.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, I therefore support the motion.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister:</span> I  now  give  the  floor  to  the</p>
<p><span>Honourable Gavoka.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to speak on the motion before 

the floor from the Economic Affairs Committee. I was part of this Committee and I am no longer 

there but I do miss the wonderful people that I worked with in the Committee over the last couple of 

years.  I was part of this Committee when we carried out this review of the Annual Report of the 

Board.  The consultation was quite broad, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I was touched by the lack of recognition by the Government in the potential for beef in this 

country.  Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the abattoir at Nasinu was only operating three days a week 

because of the lack of supplies.  There is a dwindling number of livestock in this country and I found 

that to be quite sad, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the potential in this country to raise this industry to a 

level that would meet the local consumption and also exports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was a hotelier and as a hotelier, we only use local beef for 

curry.  The quality was not there for steak and all the other stuff, which had to be imported, this was 

always a challenge since tourism began in this country.  That is why when we talk about tourism we 

always talk about the high leakage factor. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="32">Page 32</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Leakage factor, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the dollar that comes in, the amount of that dollar that 

goes out of the country to service the industry and it is quite high in tourism, and that is one of the 

questions about tourism and the challenge for us is to reduce that leakage and a huge part of this 

leakage is the importation of beef; not only beef but other meat products. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also the potential for brand beef (special beef), and as we know, 

Vanuatu exports beef to Japan.  You will know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Japanese are very discerning 

consumers.  They do not buy anything below standard.  We know about kobe beef, one of the best in 

the world and we understand that the Vanuatu beef is as good as kobe beef hence the export market 

to Japan.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When we ask the agricultural people who came to us, they said, “The climatic conditions in 

Taveuni is similar to Vanuatu.”  So, Taveuni and other parts of Vanua Levu can grow the kind of 

beef.  I spoke with the Honourable Tui Cakau about this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because I also used to 

manage two Estates in Taveuni when I was in Shangri-La; Ura and Salialevu and Salialevu was huge 

with beef production. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am just wondering if my colleague the Honourable Minister of Agriculture could refocus 

the effort of the Ministry towards more and better beef production.  The potential is huge, we should 

not have the kind of numbers that we have today.  It is very low and it must improve.  There are many 

ways we can look it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When I look at the cane farmers, how many do we have in this country, 12,000 or 13,000?  If 

each  of  those  farmers  can  also  grow  beef,  that  is  already  one  each,  it  is  about  13,000  heads  of 

livestock.    These  are  the  types  of  things  that  we  need  to  do  but  certainly  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is 

something that the Ministry of Agriculture should focus on.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In my province, we had a number of schemes in there but most of them had kind of fallen by 

the wayside and indeed when I speak with my people up in Navosa, they say that you do not drink 

milk in Navosa if you are lazy.  There are so many cows in there that can produce milk and likewise 

when they go up there, beef is on the table everyday, when you go in for functions, et cetera.  I have 

just  wondered  if  Navosa  has  been  factored  into  the  equation  when  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is 

looking into the numbers of cattle, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  share  something  with  the  House  today:  in  my  District  Cuvu  in 

Nadroga, we know that the beef there is amongst the best.  One day about a year ago, I was driving 

past and I saw these cattle (about 10 or 12 of them), emerged from the bush.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was 

surprised when I saw them and I said “This kind of cattle breed here is the ‘picture-postcard’ kind of 

beef, they were so healthy, and I remembered once when I spoke with Dan Costello about a kind of 

</span><span>vaivai</span><span> in our area and he said, “That </span><span>vaivai</span><span> has 30 percent more proteins than in any other cattle feed 

in the country.”  Dan Costello was a Fiji Meats’ person.  Here are the opportunities, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, that we call it “tania” in the Nadroga dialect.  But this is what we have and I just wish that the 

Agriculture Department would look into these things in a targeted manner and see if they grow more 

beef, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  was quite sad reading  this Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but  while we  are  talking about  the 

difficulties we are facing, we also know the huge potential that is there.  I would wish this House to 

prevail the Government  to  grab those opportunities  and grow our beef industry.  Thank  you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Gavoka:</span> I now give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Minister for Agriculture, you have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="33">Page 33</a></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>471 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Member said and he should be 

ashamed  because  he  should  go  back  and  ask  previous  Party  leaders  “Why  did  they  abandon 

Yalavou?” Yalavou Station had electricity, water, but they abandoned live animals there, as well as 

brand new wood quarters, street lights and they had abandoned the entire Yalavou Scheme of about 

3000 acres with about 500 acres of core government land and then you had adjoining farms which 

they have abandoned and that is why today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not have an adequate amount of 

beef cattle coming to the abattoir.  The abattoir, rightly said, is closed three days a week because you 

do not have enough animals, and they have abandoned the station and the largest beef cattle farm. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Yaqara is now supplying beef cattle every week to the abattoir because it 

was restructured and reformed by the Ministry of Economy.  We want the abattoir to run full time.  I 

note from the Report that they are talking about the abattoir not financially running well.  It is not 

running well because you do not have enough animals.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Member 

should  know  that  we  have  been  culling  animals  because  they  are  infected  with  tuberculosis  and 

brucellosis.  He knows it very well and he is saying that the number of animals coming to the abattoir 

is low, just because we have been culling animals.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got 10 senepol breeder bulls ready to give out to beef cattle farms 

free with tuberculosis and brucellosis.  Guess what, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot get 10 farms which 

are  free  from  brucellosis  and  tuberculosis,  I  cannot  get  tuberculosis  in  particular.    If  I  give  these 

breeder bulls to these farms, again they will be infected with tuberculosis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what had happened is that, we did not constantly replace the 

breeder bulls and because of that, we now see our animals getting smaller and smaller because they 

have lost their original generic attribute.  Who is responsible for that?  He has the audacity to come 

here and say that this Government is not doing enough to increase beef cattle production. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, I went and spoke to the Honourable Minister for Economy to get 

some  money  to  upgrade  the  rendering  plant  at  the  abattoir  in  Nasinu,  so  that  they  can  get  some 

additional income. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we are importing protein to make feed for chicken.  As you know, we are</p>
<p><span>100 percent self-sufficient in chicken.  In fact, we are supplying to other countries in the region. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had encouraged the abattoir to diversify because they get some of the 

offcuts and some of the left-over animal parts which can be dried and grinded to get meat and bone 

which is being utilised for poultry feed manufacturing.  We said that a lot of companies out here have 

also got offcut fish parts which can be used to develop fish meal.  From the COVID Budget,  we 

were able to get some money and we gave $150,000 to the abattoir and they were able to produce 

202 tonnes of fish and meat meal last year after fixing their rendering plant with a value of $304,773; 

they were so excited.  They have got another plant that they need to repair and we can substitute this 

and  stop  inputting  fish  meal  to  make  poultry  feed  and  use  our  own  protein  products  that  we  are 

wasting. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we had everything ready, we would have utilised all the animals that died 

in </span><span>TC Yasa </span><span>to convert them into fish meat protein.  We were not able to do that because we were 

really not ready with all the plant and equipment in the Northern Division, we want abattoir.  They 

are talking about abattoir throughout Fiji, we want it, but where are the animals for the abattoir to 

slaughter? It will happen progressively because now we are reviving the beef cattle farm.  You go 

and talk to abattoirs and they will tell you, from last year they started to get monthly beef cattle from 

Tilivalevu Farm because we have revived the Tilivalevu  Farm.  They are getting beef cattle on a

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>weekly basis from Yaqara.  It is the largest beef cattle farm in the Pacific, do not talk about about 

Vanuatu, talk about Yaqara. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Yaqara beef is now well-known amongst the hotels and they are buying</p>
<p><span>quality beef that is being produced out of the abattoir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  we  want  all  our  animals  to  go  through  the  formal  slaughter  house  and</p>
<p><span>abattoir for various reasons: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>All those meat as they are processed, we do not want to put public health at risk, we want 

it  to  go  through  the  proper  meat  inspection,  proper  abattoir  and  then  it  ends  up  for 

commercial sale.  We do not want backyard operators to cut and sell.    At the moment we 

have  got  two  abattoirs,  we  have  allowed  for  slaughter  houses  based  on  having  meat 

inspectors, but it will take time.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>There is a lot of environmental hazard arising out of people slaughtering and throwing the 

remainder of the carcass into the drains, waterways, around the environment which could 

also cause health risk. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now reviving the Yalavou Scheme and if we did not have </span><span>TC Yasa 

</span><span>and </span><span>TC Ana, </span><span>et cetera, we could have done the major launch during middle of this year, but we have 

got about 300 acres pasture double-fencing because we will be keeping the animals.  We do not want 

any outside animals to come in and infect them.  We are now developing the pasture and very soon, 

we will be moving cattles there.  We were able to get the old cattles (close to two dozen) back to the 

paddock which we are removing so that we can get totally pure genetic material there. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, never again will this happen, what happened to Yalavou.  We are making 

sure that for all livestock, regularly we will provide farmers with new breeder stock whether it is 

chicken, duck, sheep, goat, beef cattle or dairy cattle.  Regularly, we will ask them to replace and we 

will supply them with beef cattle breeder so that genetic material is not lost.  They will continue to 

maintain their pure genetic attributes. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we have plans, we have a vision and we are targeting that vision.  Thank</p>
<p><span>you. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister Reddy for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Niko Nawaikula.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Yesterday, I called for the removal 

and replacement of the Honourable Minister for Economy and I had a person in mind from the other 

side of the House, Dr. Reddy, he is an economist. But after listening to him now, he cannot even 

resolve the problem of livestock in Fiji. All he can say, “We have a plan and a vision”. We do not 

want that. What is your plan? What is your vision? He is grunting about Yalavou. But but you have 

been in Government for 14 years, my friend, and a lot of what he is saying is rightly directed at his 

predecessor,  who  is  right  here.    Ask  him,  but  that  is  the  problem.  I  will  come  back  to  that,  Mr. 

Speaker.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me now look at the 2014 Report.  The first problem with this is that it is seven years old 

now and going through it, if I can just note some of the concerns that are written here and mind you, 

Mr. Speaker, the Fiji Meat Industry Board was established in 1976. Again, that was the time when 

the late Ratu Mara was here. Sorry, I have been talking a lot about Ratu Mara because I fan him. I 

think he is a father of this nation. He has foresight, he has everything which we are now destroying.

<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>473 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Honourable Kepa will know that and I hope she supports me on 

this. But, this again was one of his child and he was hoping that we will build on it and we have not 

been doing that to everything that he has done. We have sold most of it and we have broken the other 

things down. But 1976 and then coming to the Chairman’s Report, it is noteworthy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Chairman  at  that  time,  Mr.  Timothy  Brown,  this  is  what  he  said  in  relation  to  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>challenges for the FMIB and I seek to read this:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“The continued decline in cattle, sheep, pigs and goat numbers is beyond the control 

of FMIB but directly affecting FMIB’s income.  FMIB is not in the business of production. 

The production of cattle is looked after by the Ministry of Agriculture. FMIB slaughters for 

only three days a week as a result of above operating under capacity.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>And he was then talking in 2014 which was seven years ago now, so the Honourable Minister 

should have told us what they have done then that we are achieving now. He blames TB or that kind 

of problem but what about Vanua Levu? Vanua Levu is quarantined. I hope that one day he will 

come to Savusavu, catch the bus like I do. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, he was there and I met him there, but he was in the business 

of giving out aids to the farmers, not from the Government but from other countries. One country 

gave a tractor here, so he goes there delivering all these but if the Honourable Minister manages, you 

catch the bus, leave your flashy car down, catch the 2 o’clock bus and there is a bus at 10 o’clock, 

there is another bus at 2 o’clock or you can catch the 4 o’clock bus.  Go down the Hibiscus Highway 

and there you will see all the estates - Maravu.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Maravu is a very successful beef farming area. Have you been there? Does he know it? And 

then go further -  Vunilagi,  Qiloi and then Tuvamila. All  these used to  be very successful in  beef 

farming then.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.:</span> Who mucked it up?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- But not now. That is the question:</span> Who mucked it up?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- You:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.:</span> What happened?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- You mucked it up:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Then:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Go to Natuvu, catch the ferry and go to Taveuni. Take a drive, 

catch the bus, leave your car behind. Catch the bus from Matei to Salialevu and you will see all the 

estates there are overgrown but they were not like that before. Before, they were very successful beef 

farming areas, so the problem is not the land. You say,”leases.”  No, it is not the land.  The problem 

is not the land.  Ask yourself, what happened to Yaqara? What happened to Yalavou?  You have

</span></p>
<p><span>been in Government for 15 years, ask yourself.  You should have come up with the problems there 

and then.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.:</span> I will tell you what happened in Yaqara</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- The problem is that you changed the batting order around. I was 

hoping that he will speak after me to  tell  us the solution.   All that he told us were  the problems, 

problems, problems, problems and it is not only limited to cattle.  What about piggery?  What are 

you doing on piggery?  It is not limited to piggery even.  Goat farming.  What is happening to goat 

farming?  What is happening to sheep farming?  All these come under the jurisdiction of the FMIB.  

It is not only cattle, it is not only brucellosis or whatever that is.  It is also piggery and all these other 

things.  The failure falls upon the Minister - Minister, this is your problem.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.- You have to wait:</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Well,  we  cannot  wait.    We  only  have  two  more  years  before 

elections.  We are out of time now.  The only thing that we can ask you is to move out so that we can 

have a new initiative, new minds who will listen to the experts, not like you.  That is the problem. 

The problem is the Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Nawaikula:</span> I now give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would firstly like to 

acknowledge the findings and the recommendations by the Committee in the Report in supporting 

the Fiji Meat Industry Board and its immense potential which can contribute significantly to the meat 

industry in Fiji, and I think everyone will acknowledge that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a well-known fact that the outbreak of tuberculosis and brucellosis was 

actually compounded by the growing natural disasters that actually continues to have a detrimental 

effect and impacts on Fiji’s livestock sector.  That is not something that is just a statement - I think 

everyone in this room needs to realise that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  issue  with  brucellosis  and  tuberculosis  has  been  an  ongoing  issue  which  Honourable 

Minister for Agriculture has been talking about it, and previous to him was Honourable Seruiratu 

who was the Minister for Agriculture – they explained this to the House time and time again.  There 

is  no  quick  fix  on  this  but  it  is  something  that  affects  the  industry.    And  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 

ultimately contributes to the significant decline in livestock numbers that are slaughtered at FMIB.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I urge the Honourable Members on the other side to please get the facts correct and tell the 

people of Fiji the truth.  You just do not come up with something and pluck it out of thin air and start 

making statements about it and start telling people that they should leave this House and leave the 

job and someone else can actually come and do it.  That is the best person for the job.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  on  Monday  this  week  Honourable  Dr.  Reddy  informed  this  august 

House that the loss of livestock amounted to 5.4 percent of the total loss from agriculture resulting 

from  </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>.  This basically amounts close to about $8 million and despite this set-

back, I wish to commend the Ministry of Agriculture and his team, Sir, for their tireless efforts in 

working  with  the livestock farmers.   I know he  gave us a very small  brief today but  maybe they

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>475 

</span></p>
<p><span>should take the time to actually sit down with him and find out exactly what is going on instead of 

asking him silly questions.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to provide my particular comments on the recommendations of the 

Standing Committee specifically with respect to No. 3 and No. 5.  Recommendation No. 3 mentions 

that “the FMIB closely work with the Ministry of Agriculture and relevant stakeholders to improve 

livestock production”.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  continues  to  provide  enormous  assistance  to  our 

livestock farmers and under my Ministry, Sir, we have financial assistance that is actually provided 

through  various  programmes  which  is  the  Northern  Development  Programme  (NDP),  Integrated 

Human  Resource  Development  Programme  (IHRDP)  and  the  most  recent,  the  Micro,  Small  and 

Medium Enterprises (MSME) concession loan which amounted to about $2.3 million.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry through MSME Fiji and cooperative businesses also provide 

training  to  livestock  farmers  on  better  understanding  their  costing,  pricing  and  ways  of  doing 

business. In this way with the right of business advisory and monitoring, small holder farmers can 

actually become commercial farmers.  We all know, Sir, when the times are good we have a tourism 

industry which is worth close to about $3 billion to Fiji and that is a huge market for our farmers if 

we do it right.  We are getting it right and we will do it right, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Recommendation No. 4 states that Fiji has the potential to develop special 

beef under its own brand.  I do not disagree with Honourable Gavoka, yes, Vanuatu has got it right 

they  do  export,  they  did  have  help  from  the  Israelis  (from  what  I  understand)  to  establish  their 

industry.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We have issues. We will deal with it and I am sure that we can develop our industry to turn 

</span></p>
<p><span>it into another huge industry for Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Recommendation No.4, basically says that Fiji has the potential to develop 

its own special key brand under its own brand of Fijian grown and Fijian made, and for FMIB to 

work closely with the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) and the relevant agencies to actually increase 

cattle production.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  agree,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  support  this  recommendation.    My  Ministry  oversees  the 

“Fijian made - buy Fijian made” campaign and I encourage small holder farmers also to visit any of 

our offices in Suva, Sigatoka, Labasa and Savusavu and apply for the Fijian grown emblem which is 

free of charge through the MSMEs.   We also encourage FMIB itself to apply for the Fijian product 

emblem.  This supports Government’s policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, aimed at promoting and raising the 

profile of Fijian products and services in the domestic, regional and also the international markets.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  noted  that  there  are  seven  operational  livestock  cooperatives  in  the 

Central, Western and Northern Division who are in  the business of cattle rearing and dairy breeding.  

Since cooperatives are actually made up of members, it is expected that these particular farms will 

grow in the future with the assistance of my Ministry and also the Ministry of Agriculture. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  as  Fijians  have  to  look  within  and 

strengthen our position also as a regional hub and the meat industry is no different.  We also need to 

look at diversification and instead of having such a huge reliance on the tourism industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The FMIB, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will play a critical role in improving the quality of our local beef 

with the correct infrastructure and consistent supply and Fiji can meet the demand from local and

<p><span>Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>international  markets.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  report  highlights  also  in  Recommendation  No.5,  the 

importance of having professional expertise at board level and developing a strategic plan to revamp 

the meat industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support this recommendation.  It is noted that the current Board of 

FMIB is made up of experts from Agriculture who have animal, finance and legal background with 

years of experience in the commercial arena.  I am sure that the Board will help shaping and carrying 

FMIB in the larger industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>To assist in the revitalisation of the meat industry the Ministry can also work closely with the 

small holder farmers, FMIB and relevant agencies to address the potential supply chain issues.  This 

may include a  creative  and more  conducive environment  for the small  holder farmers to  actually 

thrive in.  The Ministry is actually very happy to work with FMIB and I am confident that the Board 

at  FMIB  will  take  the  entity  to  greater  heights  and  expand  its  business  functions  in  protecting, 

preserving and growing the meat industry in Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister Koya for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Adi Litia Qionibaravi. You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would also like to contribute 

to the motion before the House and thank the Chairperson and the Members of the Committee for 

their report.  The recommendations are worthy to be actioned.  We learnt from the 2014 Report that 

the earlier report in 2013 had also made similar recommendations - eight years down the line.  Whilst 

we appreciate the confirmation from the Honourable Minister today for the actions that he has taken, 

we would plead with him to also look very closely into the FMIB.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I note on Page No. 1 of the Appendix to the report, Sir, in very small print it says, September 

2005 the Fiji Meats Industry was designated as a commercial statutory authority 2005 under the SDL 

Government, the Prime Minister, Qarase.  Yesterday, in this House I mentioned Mr, Qarase’s name 

and thanked him for his vision and foresight in enabling the reform of the Public Trustees Office 

from a government department to an incorporated body.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government has benefited.  The last 11 years they have received $5 million in dividend.  

Again, I refer to this September 2005 decision of the SDL Government - the designated the Fiji Meats 

Board  as  a  Commercial  Statutory  Authority.    That  would  mean  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  had 

intended to commercialise the activities of the Fiji Meat Industry Board. 

</span></p>
<p><span>From  the  2013-2014  Report  we  know  that  it  has  not  been  performing  well  -  financial 

performance has been poor.  Had the SDL Government continued, we would have seen a different 

picture today?  The government would also had continued to receive dividend if that commercial 

designated authority was also incorporated similar to what happened to the Public Trustee’s Office.  

That is my first point Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A lot has been said about the report and I am not going to repeat that.  I would just like to 

mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the major issues of concern.  The continued decline in cattle, sheep, pigs 

and goat numbers which is beyond the control of FMIB but directly affecting FMIB’s income.  I 

would like to also mention that during the SDL Government’s rule in 2005 they had also intended to 

revive the beef industry including the Uluisavou Corporation, Yalavou  Beef Scheme and the Verata 

Beef Scheme, clear intention to improve the breed and the supply of beef in the country and looking 

forward to produce quality beef to enable Fiji to export, just as Vanuatu is exporting to Japan.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>477 

</span></p>
<p><span>Just a little story that the Honourable Dr. Mahendra Reddy might want to consider.  Red Bull 

the owner of Laucala Island had imported this special bull which cost 40,000 euros to land in Taveuni.  

This special bull was given special treatment - he drank beer (ale), music was played to enable the 

bull to relax in order to produce more cross breed cattle and better quality beef - molasses and salt.  

You might want to consider the effort that was done by Mr. Red Bull in Laucala Island that which 

has allowed Laucala Island to produce their own quality beef and also increase the quality of cattle 

that is produced. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, something else that I need to say.  Mr. Simon Cole, President of the Fiji Pig 

Farmers Association had made his concerns known about importing pork from Australia at a price 

that is lower than what is sold in Australia.  This has drastically affected the pig industry in Fiji.  Mr. 

Cole is now saying that it is an additional threat to the previously robust but now fragile industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would ask the Honourable Dr. Reddy if he can also consider this importation of pork 

from  Australia,  it  is  affecting  the  local  industry.    We  need  the  pig  industry  to  also  thrive  in  this 

country.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.:</span> What I am saying is the Fiji Meat Industry Board looks after</p>
<p><span>livestock, which includes pigs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- I am just airing to the House the concerns of the President 

of the Fiji Pig Farmers Association.  .  I was just trying to impress upon the Honourable Dr. Reddy 

that he might want to consider what happened in Taveuni - the special diet and the relaxation given 

to this special breed of cattle that was introduced in Laucala Island and also consider the threat of the 

pig farmers in Fiji, given the import of the Australian pigs.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Qionibaravi for her contribution to the debate.  I 

am  very  interested  in  this  beer  being  fed  to  the  bull.    That  is  an  extraordinary  bull.    Honourable 

Members, I now give the floor to the Honourable Seruiratu.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I am worried, I think Fiji is not ready</p>
<p><span>to give beer to the bull because the farmers will take the beer not the bull.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Let us get serious, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to contribute to the motion as well.  Let me 

go back to 2004, I was flying back from Sydney, Australia after attending a course.  I flew back into 

the country  with  Major Filipe Alifereti, he was CEO of FMIB then.  During our conversation he 

asked  me  about  Verata  Beef  Scheme  that  the  Honourable  Adi  Litia  Qionibaravi  had  already 

mentioned.  “What is happening to the Verata Beef Scheme?”  We started the conversation from 

there.   

</span></p>
<p><span>During Ratu Mara’s days, when they established FMIB, it was slaughtering around 20,000 

animals in a year.  When it came to 2004, when we had this conversation, it came as low as about 

8,000 animals per year.  They also had the facility to process leather in which we fermented the hide  

and then sent it across to Australia for further processing, but that has been closed as well in 2004. 

</span></p>
<p><span>So,  the  drop  had  started  way,  way  back  then,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  totally  agree  with 

Honourable Gavoka and the other Honourable Members that we have a lot of potential.  But I want 

to focus on the submission made by FMIB on how can we increase, because their business entirely 

</span></p>
<p><a name="40">Page 40</a></p>
<p><span>478 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>depends on the number that they are able to slaughter because they are a processing entity, just like 

Rewa Rice and FSC.  What they process is dependent on what is being produced and that is where I 

want to focus my contribution on, on this motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I wish to say and I would urge all Honourable Members in the House today, if we can help in 

getting this message across to our people.  The Honourable Leader of SODELPA, always refers a lot 

to the elephant in the room.  Development is partnership and that development must not take away 

the element of self-reliance.  Unfortunately, I would say and argue that Government’s efforts have 

not been matched by the level of commitment from our farmers.  I will say that gain, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, that   Government’s efforts unfortunately is not matched by a level of commitment from some of 

our farmers.  If we are to take this industry forward, if we are to increase production, if we have to 

have this strong partnership, then we must also have commitment from all the stakeholders.  That is 

the  way  forward  for  Fiji.    Land  must  be  available,  first  and  foremost,  then  the  breeding.    The 

Government, as alluded to by the Honourable Minister, droughtmaster is already here, senepol and 

wagyu; these are the three main breeds additional to what we already have in existence.  We have the 

boer goat, we have the new sheep breed that are already here.  The breed, the nutrition, we have 

brought in legumes like </span><span>mulato</span><span> and a few others and the testing has been done.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I remember the testing that we had with one of the farmers, Mrs Khan of Emuri at Shangri- 

La.  The chef was a specialist in meat testing.  He even took the meat raw and he said, this is first 

grade meat, so it can be done.  We have the right quality, we have the right breed, we also have the 

environment, but it is that commitment that is lacking and that is unfortunate.  If we want to improve 

the output and the production and of course, addressing, we can go without the imports, definitely, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we have to take that level of commitment seriously.  Yalavou Beef Scheme, 

Verata Beef Scheme, Uluisavou Beef Scheme, now we have revived Tilivalevu and hopefully, if we 

can re-visit this and talk to the farmers.  That is our collective responsibility.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry of Agriculture is more than willing, we have now new technologies.  We started 

with  artificial  insemination.  Now,  we  have  gone  into  new  technology  on  embryo  transfer.  

Technology is already here and we have proven it successful.  He is waiting to distribute these new 

breeds, but the level of commitment, and I would urge all Honourable Members of this House, when 

we go back,  let us take this seriously because this is good for the country and this is good for our 

people.  It is good for everyone, so that we can take the industry forward.  Therefore, I would ask all 

of us to give the Ministry of Agriculture all the support that they need and ensure that we share the 

same message so that we can improve on the performance of FMIB.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The potential is there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and let us make it a reality and let us raise production 

for  the  good  and  betterment  of  our  farmers,  our  economy  and  of  course,  our  food  and  nutrition 

security policy.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for Defence and National Security for 

his contribution to the debate.  I now give the floor to the Honourable Pio Tikoduadua.  You have 

the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is time to make a short contribution to the debate that we have on 

the report of the Fiji Meat Industry Board.  I have been sitting here listening to the interventions made 

by both sides  of the House and I believe that one of the more critical issues that we have at the 

moment is the critical lack of supply of livestock meat in all regards.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="41">Page 41</a></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>479 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am a smallholder cattle farmer myself and we have worked hard to get my farm brucellosis 

and tuberculosis free.  I would like to thank the effort of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Extension 

Officers  that  have  done  a  lot  of  work,  as  stated  by  the  former  Minister  of  Agriculture  to  try  and 

eradicate this rather nasty condition that is really hanging around the neck of farmers like a big rock, 

so  to  speak.   Unfortunately, there is  not  a short term  solution  at  hand because farmers agree that 

diseases like tuberculosis and brucellosis are associated with particular areas where it is already in 

existence. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The initiative is that, to start livestock farming in places where the diseases have not been 

discovered. But at the end of the day,  I believe there still  is a whole lot more that can be done. I 

remember at one time, I raised the question, I believe it was last year to the Honourable Minister for 

Agriculture and asked him, how long will it take to try and eradicate TB and of course, brucellosis 

from our farms?   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think he did not give a very specific period, except to say that in Australia it took them about  

40 years to eradicate it.  I think that is 40 years to wait around for that is a very long time and I do 

not think it will give any comfort, particularly those who already have brucellosis and TB, that they 

will  have  a  solution  to  this  problem  with  their  own  livestock  at  the  moment.  The  Honourable 

Seruiratu also talked about these new developments in livestock - beef, goat, pigs for that matter that 

we can all exploit.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, of course, it starts with this House and it is something that we can all do but I believe a 

whole lot more commitment,  Government  has  been in  power for  a while now and  I think people 

continue to look up to the Government, especially to the Ministry of Agriculture, to come up with a 

great initiative, a greater allocation to agriculture for livestock. Sometimes we talk so much about 

trying to get so much done or produce so much meat but little is being put into it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Agriculture has been a very neglected part of our national budget and livestock for that matter 

and for the processing factory or the abattoir in nine miles to be operating only for two or three days 

in a week because of lack of supply, I think we cannot continue to go on. We are saying that we have 

this problem.  I have had the chance to look at it, there are places that have been identified in the 

West, in particular, where we could raise cattle where TB and brucellosis is not in existent and these 

are options that we could use but I think time is of the essence and the demand at the moment is to 

put more into agriculture.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We can go and talk to the people to raise cattle but we need to be able to support it as well. I 

recognise the point that has been made by the Honourable Seruiratu that Government is doing its 

part, but I think it needs to do more. It needs to do more than what it is currently doing. Obviously, 

with a lack of supply, a lot more can still be done.  We are talking about Yalavou and many of these 

beef schemes.  I know in Kumi, Verata where one used to be, this can all still be revived. I am not 

sure whether Verata is actually under brucellosis or TB but I am sure that much can still be done but 

I think with the commitment as a nation for us to come together and try and alleviate this problem.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For once, I will say, let us get behind Honourable Dr. Reddy, so that he can do his work. I am 

sure at the end of the day, we can all come here and call him into question if he is not going to do 

anything in 12 months because I do not think we have 20 years or 40 years to wait around and produce 

enough livestock to feed our own people and feed our own market.  So, there you are, Honourable 

Dr.  Reddy,  I  think  you  were  asking  for  it,  you  need  the  chance  and  I  am  sure  we  are  all  well-

committed to make sure that we all grow enough. I am sure you have some solution for goats. Many 

people are farming goats and sheep, and I plead with those that are doing that now that at least, they 

could do a little bit more than what Government is doing to help these farmers out, especially goats.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I would just like to raise, just sort of as a concluding remark and part of the reason why I 

stood up actually to make this intervention.  The FMIB abattoir and the processing plant in 9 miles 

is a bit of an issue for the local residents there because of the smell. I know this has been around for 

quite a while and it is a growing area - Davuilevu Housing at the back there, Waila is a growing area 

where people are now probably going to come and live.  But it is the stench that is coming from the 

factory that is causing a lot of concern.  Where the farm used to be, now we have the construction of 

the new Police Station,  we have the  Nasinu  Health Centre, the  Fire Brigade and  I think it is  fast 

growing to become a bigger commercial centre. I think the FMIB abattoir (processing plant) actually 

does not belong in that area.  It is an area developing into a residential area.  So I would like to ask 

the Honourable Minister concerned …. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. Dr. M. Reddy interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.:</span> But the stench is still there, Honourable Minister! That</p>
<p><span>is what I am talking about.  It is the stench.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure they can identify a place where that could go and on top of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

not enough is being done to contain the cattle that they keep there for processing.  So every once in 

a while these cattle wander into the road and they take a visit up to Davuilevu Housing, they come 

visiting next to my house … 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Maybe there under the influence of alcohol:</span></p>
<p><span>But the point I am trying to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that if they are going to keep it there, 

at least they can contain the cattle. I almost ran into one, one morning just trying to  get to work.  

Please, if Government  could  consider relocating  the factory because  I am sure it is  a concern for 

people who live up around Davuilevu Housing, Waila and of course the other side of Nakasi of the 

stench  that is coming out or that is being produced by the abattoir and processing factory when it is 

in use.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So once again,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, yes, we have a livestock problem, we do not 

have enough meat to feed our own people nor do we have the right quantity and quality  that we have  

to feed our own tourism market. We identify the need, we need to get up there as a nation and as a 

people and support our farmers. I am sure a lot more can be done. I am a very big advocate and I am 

sure and I know the Honourable Minister for Defence, his a big advocate of medium farms.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is  an  advocator  of  medium  farms;  small 

commercial easy to operate and that people can easily operate or look after.  This is the way to go, 

involve the nation, involve the people but like I said, today is one of those special days I am standing 

behind the initiative that the Honourable Minister is saying today that he is going to lead the charge 

on getting proper numbers for livestock in Fiji.  I hope that the Government is going to give him 

enough resources for him to be able to achieve those things that we would really like to have and 

produce for Fiji the livestock that it deserves for our people and for our markets.  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Tikoduadua for his contribution to the debate:</span> I</p>
<p><span>now give the floor to the Honourable Attorney-General.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-    Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  brief  and  would    like  to  talk</p>
<p><span>directly in respect of the recommendations by the Committee itself.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>481 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  respect  of  the  first  recommendation,  the  actual  Committee  was 

recommending  the  divestment  and  they  also  meant  to  say  the  privatisation  of  Fiji  Meat  Industry 

Board.  In fact, in 2010 and 2016, we actually called for expressions of interest from the private sector 

to participate in the restructure and divestment of FMIB.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, unlike what Honourable Nawaikula always seems to simplify divestment, when we 

actually divest we want to look for strategic partners and of course the whole purpose of divesting 

would be to increase the capacity and the potential of whoever is going to actually buy the shares.  It 

does not have to be completely privatised.  You can actually partially divest your shares.   And  also 

as has been highlighted by the Honourable Minister for Agriculture and the Honourable Minister for 

Defence (former Minister for Agriculture) and others that you actually need the supply chain.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As  we  found,  for  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  Rewa  Dairy  now  Fiji  Dairy,  the 

company that actually bought the bulk of the shares in fact has its own farm also.  That was part of 

the deal that they will also set up their own dairy farm so they have a constant supply of milk.    In 

the same way, if we want someone to buy the abattoir, they need to also themselves set up a beef 

farm so they can actually supply to the abattoir and of course the idea is to have food security.  

</span></p>
<p><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did not get very good expressions of interest. Many of them 

the ones that wanted to come in, wanted to firstly raise the slaughter fees, they wanted all sorts of 

assistance in acquiring land for breeding and they wanted the current legislation to be amended. Some 

of it, of course, was reasonable, they wanted exclusivity, did not want anyone else to operate as an 

abattoir for the next 30 years and they of course wanted various other protections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  lot  of  them  actually  wanted  to  buy  FMIB  primarily  the  reason  what 

Honourable Tikoduadua was saying just to buy the land because the land in Davuilevu at the moment 

is very, very much sought after.  It is prime land now. It has now become a city in its own right of 

township, in its own right, it has got a nursing station, fire station, police station, new market is going 

to come across the road, probably the bus interchange somewhere there very soon. The land value 

has gone up.  So, many of the companies that wanted to simply buy it just for the land so they could 

develop it but we are looking to someone strategic. That did not eventuate and we obviously are not 

going to sell the place just for the land because otherwise we will lose the abattoir services. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  wanted  to  make  was  that  whilst  Honourable 

Qionibaravi  talked  about  how,  there  was  all  these  foresight  et  cetera  and  Honourable  Nawaikula 

talked about the Alliance government days, yes, a lot of these organisations were set up then but the 

question that needs to be asked is how was it subsequently run; the sustainability and the management 

of it? We can be very good at opening up a new building but the trick of maintaining a new building 

is the need to be able to set aside enough money to maintain it, to do regular painting, et cetera, and 

in the same way companies need that.  I mean I can go into numerous examples of what happened in 

AFL when they used to call for tenders and there used to be a lot of political interference.  That is 

why it never made that much money. The returns were only like $1 million or $2 million a year in 

dividends.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Recently,  prior  to  COVID-19  we  are  receiving  $30  million  to  $40  million  in  dividends.  

Unfortunately,  FMIB  as  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence  has  highlighted,  a  lot  of  the 

investments, for example, the tannery machine.  A lot of it was bought, some of it was bought but 

never  used  and  in  fact  we  could  not  even  sell  it  because  no  one  in  Fiji  wanted  it.    Along  with 

acquisitions and the management was also in question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Just  very  quickly,  in  respect  the  Committee  noted  the  FMIB  Annual  Report  for  option  of 

privatisation  and  the  need  to  separate  regulatory  function  from  the  slaughter  house  and  related

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>operations.  Yes, that is true.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had in fact already engaged a consultant 

to look at the Meat Act of 1969 and FMIB, like for example what was known as “FEA” apart from 

actually providing the service was also the regulator in that particular industry.  So, you have to do 

the separation. So, now the regulatory part of it is looked after by FCCC and the actual provision of 

services is looked after by EFL.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We had engaged  a consultant,  unfortunately he  passed away,  I think everyone knows Mr. 

Julian Moti had passed away in December. He was a consultant. He was engaged to look at some of 

the laws that we wanted reviewed. We are going to now have that work completed and then of course 

we can then bring that particular Bill to Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third recommendation, the Committee recommends that FMIB 

coordinate  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  to  improve  livestock 

production. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, of course, but as the Honourable Minister for Agriculture and others 

have highlighted, when you talk about increasing livestock, there is a whole series of determinants 

that actually has an impact on your ability to increase the livestock.  Like with the sugarcane industry, 

I mean, apart from if you do not have land available, of course, you cannot plant sugarcane.  The 

other point is whether people are actually interested in that particular sector.  The average age of 

sugarcane farmers is over 55 years old now, many young people do not want to get into this sector. 

So, whether many young people actually want to get into livestock farming, that is another issue. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think Honourable Nawaikula gave us a geographical visit of Vanua Levu but the point of 

the matter is why are they not doing well is because probably those families who used to do that, are 

their descendants are no longer interested?  So, all of these factors actually have an impact.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The other most critical  impact,  of course has,  is  your  ability to  access  finance.  The most 

valuable asset any farmer has is actually the land that they lease.  If you are going to have a 30-year 

lease for agricultural purposes, no commercial bank lends money for 30 years - period.  And that is 

why you do not see any commercial banks actually participate in the agricultural sector unless the 

land in question is freehold or is for 99 years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Laws have been amended to now for iTLTB and the Lands Department to be able to lease 

lands up to 99 years for agricultural purposes.  Once you have that as collateral, you can then go and 

participate in the mainstream financial services to be able to get the capital, to be able to then plough 

back into your business because these sectors need to be run like businesses.  We cannot just have 

five cows running around here, it does not make sense. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also for FMIB, to be able to get that regular supply of animals, they need that large-scale 

investment by the private sector.  As the Honourable Minister for Defence highlighted, Government 

can only do so much.  There needs to be the appetite for those people in that industry to take that up 

apart from having the right approach to it, they also need access for finance, and the land will be the 

collateral.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, FDB et cetera can participate in that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport has also highlighted about the 

Fijian Brand, of course, we can do that once we are able to get the supply.  The last point about the 

professional expertise, they have obviously access to consultants, et cetera. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would just like to very quickly also state that there is a number of these</p>
<p><span>public enterprises that some of them are not doing well as the others.  A lot of it is to do with, for 

</span></p>
<p><a name="45">Page 45</a></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Questions  

</span></p>
<p><span>483 

</span></p>
<p><span>example, the supply chain’s access to finance, et cetera.  We need to be able to have a particular focus 

on them to be able to provide them the right level of expertise.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  assistance  by  those  members  who  have  actually  been 

appointed to the Board of FMIB. We are here to, of course, support them.  There is a desperate need 

to relocate FMIB from where it is.  It is right in the middle of a residential area, a commercial area 

and I agree with Honourable Tikoduadua.  The stench can be quite overwhelming.  We need to be 

able to address that and we need to find a sound relocated site for that and those  are some of the 

challenges and issues that the Board has to deal with and we will work with them.
