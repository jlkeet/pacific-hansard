<p>Online Learning Platforms 

(Question No. 24/2021)</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  Minister  inform 

Parliament  what  plans  are  in  place  for  online  learning  platforms  and  other  emergency 

teaching  procedures  for  students  in  the  event  of  natural  disasters  or  another  COVID-19 

lockdown?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- (Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to 

answer the question under my name by the Honourable Kepa and I thank the Honourable Member 

for the question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all aware that natural disasters are not a common occurrence to Fiji 

and the Pacific.  For a long time education has been affected by tropical cyclones and other natural 

disasters.  Last year we were affected by a new disaster, I would say, and that was COVID-19.  I 

think by now we have gotten used to the disruptions that natural disasters and other hazards bring.  

While many at times we extend holidays or school days are disrupted, we expect parents to use this 

extra  time  to  have  meaningful  engagement  with  their  children  and  that  is  an  opportunity  that  is 

presented to communities and societies.</p>
<p>But in case of the question, 19th March, 2020, we announced our first positive COVID-19 

case  and  as  an  immediate  control  measure,  we  brought  forward  our  Term  One  holidays  to  23rd 

March, 2020 and we closed our schools and extended it to 15th June, 2020.   Of course this was a 

new  issue  and  a  challenge  for  the  Ministry.  We  acted  within  what  we  had.    During  this  time  we 

developed  a  number  of  activities  to  support  remote  learning  and  home-based  learning  for  our 

students.</p>
<p>We started off with worksheets, study guides and study notes for all levels and this was mostly 

for revision.  We developed 750 videos for secondary school students with lessons which was placed 

on our educational channel throughWalesi.  We also engaged our teachers to do home visitation for 

students with special needs, of course this was on voluntary basis.  Programmes were also aired on 

FBC radio, which focused on literacy and numeracy.  A lot of teachers and the Ministry used ourFacebookpage and other social media platforms, mobile apps such asViberandWhatsAppto further 

engage with the students.  Of course, all of these were supplementary curriculum content.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, globally the education sector moved very quickly to remote learning which 

is a developed online resource, this was for the lockdown.  We are mindful that creating learning 

resources  is  very  costly  so  it  is  critical  that  we  create  affordable  and  equitable,  flexible  delivery 

options for our student should we go into another COVID-19 lockdown, which I think we all should 

pray that it does not happen.  We can use this in times of disruptions to normal delivery of education.</p>
<p>Overall experience of our staff and students during the lockdown has shown that because of 

limited internet access, lack of staff knowledge in harnessing online resources and limited internet 

availability  at  homes  and  communities  made  the  online  option  less  feasible.    Worksheets,  study 

guides and study notes prepared by teachers were more readily accepted by our students and parents.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, we have access to the Pacific Regional Channel.  This is created by the 

Commonwealth of  Learning. This  has videos-on-demand lessons in  practical  sciences, chemistry, 

biology and physics and of course mathematics for secondary schools.  These can be watched online 

or downloaded on mobile phones and watched offline as well.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>491</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, going forward, the Ministry is determined to create more online resources 

for  both  primary  and  secondary  school  students  and  our  teachers  and  staff  from  the  Curriculum 

Advisory Services are continually engaged in producing more recorded resources.  This will help 

provide the access support to our students throughout the year and will be used in times of disasters.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order for us to use more current technology-based learning resources for 

our students, we need to invest further in providing equitable internet access to schools and training 

teachers to use e-Learning tools effectively.  Several schools still do not have internet access mostly 

due to lack of connectivity in these areas.  To date we have 33 schools, apart from the 1,000 plus 

schools we have, 33 have intermittent internet access while 115 are still without internet access.</p>
<p>We are working withWalesiin trialling the provision of internet services in two schools right 

now  using  what  we  call  Very  Small  Aperture  Terminal  (VSAT).    These  schools  are  in  Noikoro 

District School in Navosa and Beqa Secondary School.  If the trials go well and depending on the 

cost progressively such technologies will be engaged to enable more remote schools to have internet 

access and connectivity.</p>
<p>A modern knowledge-based society, Mr. Speaker, Sir, thrives on the ability of its people to 

be ICT literate.  The Ministry is mindful though that learning resources particularly those brought 

from  external  sources  put  significant  financial  burden  and  do  not  necessarily  provide  effective 

learning.  This is why learning resources need to be created that are contextualised, cost effective and 

sustainable and we have the local capacity to do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by saying if the Honourable Kepa, during her time 

had done some base work for the Ministry, then it would have definitely assisted us in this century 

to take online learning to another level.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  The Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa</p>
<p>you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- A supplementary question Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Minister for 

her response and also thank the Minister for Health in having us COVID-19 contained in our country.  

However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should there be another COVID-19 lockdown because of the variants 

that are there in overseas countries - my question is especially for those disadvantaged students who 

are in the rural, remote and maritime schools who are not able to access online.  If you cannot answer 

right now, you can give me a response later as to how those students will be addressed in terms of 

their disadvantaged situation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  The Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. In response to that question, I will go back 

to what we did when we were under lockdown for three months.  Like I said, it was a very new and 

challenging  experience  for  us  but  because  most  of  these  remote  schools  were  located  in  the 

communities and were easily accessed by parents and students, we used the village and the settlement 

communities, the advisory councillors and theturaga ni korowhere resources were developed in the 

school and those parents who could not come and collect the resources from the school, we had theturaga ni koroand community members assisting us to deliver those materials to individual students.  

Of  course,  as  our  teachers  are  also  based  in  these  communities,  they  were  of  great  help  to  us  in 

ensuring  that  they  went  from  house  to  house  delivering  those  materials,  and  when  the  child  had 

finished the required activities, they were given the supplementary activities within the three weeks 

the school was under lockdown.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>So, if we have to go under another lockdown for Godâ€™s sake, then that is what we will repeat, 

because this is the only way right now we can reach our rural students.  I can assure you no child, no 

school and no community was disadvantaged when we were under lockdown for three weeks.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    We  will  move  on to  the  sixth  Oral</p>
<p>Question for today.  I now call on the Honourable Pillay to ask his question.</p>
