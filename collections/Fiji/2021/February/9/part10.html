<h3>RATIFICATION OF THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL –  
CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD ON THE SALE  
OF CHILDREN, CHILD PROSTITUTION AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That Parliament approves that Fiji ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now invite the Honourable Attorney-General and 

Minister for Economy, Civil Service and Communications to speak on his motion.  You have the 

floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-    Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.    I  would  like to  thank the 

Committee for their recommendation, that Fiji ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 

Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now as we know, Fiji has ratified the nine core international conventions 

</span></p>
<p><span>pertaining to rights.  If I could reiterate and they are as follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>

<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Convention  Against  Torture  and  Other  Cruel,  Inhumane  or  Degrading  Treatment  or 

Punishment; 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 

International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 

(ICPPED); 

Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  Against  Women 

(CEDAW); 

International  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Racial  Discrimination 

(CERD); 

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); 

International Convention  on the Protection  of the  Rights  of  All Migrant Workers  and 

Members of Their Families; 

Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the Optional Protocol we are agreeing to 

ratify as recommended by the Committee; and 

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it would be from one perspective an abomination, if anyone actually 

objected to the ratification of this Optional Protocol.  In Fiji, apart from the fact that legally, we are 

</span><span>obliged to follow the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) as a society, we are very much in 

</span><span>the protection of children.  Children are very much part and parcel of our society.  We, of course,

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 29</a></p>
<p><span>388 

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>have recently seen a number of instances where children have been put in very vulnerable situations 

where they have been exploited also and we need to be able to address that as a society.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  need  to  ensure  that  the  laws  are  in  place  and  the  laws,  in  fact,  get  enforced.  This 

ratification, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will, again, send a signal to the rest of the world that are willing to 

participate in the enforcement of these particular rights. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Fijian Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, under Sections 10 and 11, guarantees all 

Fijians freedom from slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking and freedom from cruel 

and degrading treatment.  Furthermore, Section 41 of the Fijian Constitution recognises the right of 

every child to  be protected from  abuse, neglect,  harmful  cultural  practices,  any form  of violence, 

inhumane treatment and punishment, and hazardous or exploitative labour.  It further states that the 

best interests of a child are the primary consideration in every matter concerning the child.  Therefore, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography would be most clearly 

in violation of Section 41 of the Fijian Constitution. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sections 226 and 227 of the Crimes Act 2009 respectively provide that the selling and buying 

of minors under the age of 18 years for prostitution, illicit sexual intercourse, or for any unlawful or 

</span><span>immoral purposes, are criminal offences.  Divisions 5 and 6 of the Crimes Act 2009 respectively 

</span><span>create offences with respect to slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting and trafficking in 

persons and children which also have extended jurisdiction whether or not the conduct constituting 

the alleged offences occurs in Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, this extends across the boundaries.  As we know, many countries did adopt that.  

Fiji followed suit when we actually got rid of the Penal Code and put in place the Crimes Decree 

because you could actually have Fijians committing these offences offshore.  They should be brought 

to the law.  Similarly we have people who may be committing those offences in Fiji and they will be 

equally culpable back in their own domestic jurisdictions too.  We had increased the tariff that was 

applicable.  The range is, of course, from 12 years imprisonment to 25 years imprisonment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Linked to that also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Online Safety Act which was introduced, which 

renders it an offence to post-intimate visual recording of an individual, unless that individual consents 

to the specific post that is online.  We have seen quite a lot of that.  I think once mentioned in this 

Parliament where we had in particular, a lady whose room and bathroom was bugged with cameras 

where whatever you do in your bedroom - you change, you have a shower, was all being caught  on 

camera and being live streamed.  This leads to enormous psychological and emotional impact, let 

</span><span>alone the exploitation.  But it also has applied to children.  We have also seen a couple of cases where 

</span><span>children were also filmed and the individuals or the adults who were doing that were actually selling 

those images online to offshore people who used to come to Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we have also linked to that under the Extradition Act 2003, an offence is an 

extradition offence if the conduct that constitutes the offence, if committed in Fiji would constitute 

an  offence  in  Fiji  for  which  the  maximum  penalty  is  life  imprisonment  or  other  terms  of 

imprisonment. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have, in recent times, because of the laws that have now been put in 

place where there is a lot more liberal approach to discussing these issues, has meant a number of 

individuals have come forward or their families have actually come forward and brought things like 

sexual exploitation of children, sexual assaults on children, they feel a lot more confident with the 

law and, therefore, they are bringing them a lot more forward before the law.  I think that is critically 

</span><span>important to note and we will see that.   

</span></p>

<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>389 

</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, we should not use that as an excuse or a reason to say, “Well, they are only 

doing it now because the law has been put in place.”  We need to also try and curb any new offences 

and that, of course, comes about through strategies put through the respective Ministries and different 

agencies, through the Police, of course, through our faith-based organisations and the society as a 

whole.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But  we  also  need  to  be  able  to  adopt  new  international  standards  that  can  be,  of  course, 

followed by our judiciary, our law enforcement agencies, our families, our communities and NGOs 

at large become sensitised towards and, in fact, are able to then fulfil the requirements, not just under 

the Convention itself but also the Optional Protocol that we are agreeing to ratify.  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General for his motion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this issue. I give the floor to the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. VUNIWAQA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I stand in support of the motion 

</span><span>before  the  House.  Fiji  ratified  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  (CRC)  in  1993.  This 

</span><span>Convention sets out standards and protocols to safeguard the rights and welfare of our children. As a 

signatory, Government is mandated to implement child protection laws and initiatives aligned to the 

Convention.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  is  the  agency  responsible  for 

reporting on the Convention on a periodic basis. The next State Report which was due in September 

2020 is now due in June 2022 due to changes within the CRC reporting mechanism.  Fiji signed the 

Optional Protocol which is before the House today on 16th September, 2005, but has yet to ratify it.  

If Fiji ratifies the Optional Protocol, we must then submit a report to the Committee on the Rights of 

the Child within two years, providing comprehensive information on the measures it has taken to 

implement the provisions of the Protocol. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The purpose of the Optional Protocol, as clarified by the Honourable Attorney-General, is to 

prohibit the sale of Children, child prostitution and child pornography.  It also requires state parties 

to adopt appropriate measures to protect the rights and interests of child victims at all stages of the 

criminal justice process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Optional Protocol requires state parties to: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span> at a minimum, ensure that offences related to the sale of children, child prostitution and 

child pornography are fully covered under its criminal law and  to establish jurisdiction 

over such offences when the offences are committed in its territory on board a ship or 

aircraft registered in that State; and   

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>it  makes  such  offences  extraditable  within  its  existing  extradition  treaties  and  in  any 

subsequent extradition treaties entered into.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  enunciated  by  the  Honourable  Attorney-General,  the  2013  Fijian 

Constitution,  the  Crimes  Act  2009  and  Online  Safety  Act  2018  clearly  represent  Fiji’s  position 

against the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  Thus, the ratification of this 

Optional Protocol will go a step further in showing our national commitment on the international 

</span><span>arena.  Fiji’s ratification of the Protocol will further strengthen our commitment towards safeguarding 

</span><span>Fijian children. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>I also would like to take this opportunity to thank the Office of our Permanent Representative 

to the UN Office in Geneva for the push to have this ratified, UNICEF and the AG’s Office for the 

technical and legal support to get this Optional Protocol to this stage and, of course, the Parliamentary 

Standing Committee in considering this.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  fully  support  the  motion  before  the  House,  therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  Fiji  ratifies  the 

Optional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child 

Prostitution and Child Pornography.  Thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for her contribution to the debate. I give 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor to the Honourable Salote Radrodro. You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I rise to contribute to the debate on the 

ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution 

and Child Pornography.  I also rise to support that ratification.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As alluded to by the Honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation and 

also by the Honourable Minister for Economy that Fiji ratified the Convention on the Rights of the 

</span><span>Child in 1993 and now, we are here in this House to debate on the ratification of the Optional Protocol 

</span><span>to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).  We have almost 28 years after the signing of 

the CRC, Mr. Speaker, so a question I would like to raise is, what have we achieved as a country in 

regards to the protection of our children?   

</span></p>
<p><span>We continue, Mr. Speaker, and I raise this, I know this Government and the previous one 

have  focussed  our  efforts  on  the  legislation,  localising  the  CRC  on  the  various  programmes.  For 

example, we have various programmes that pursue to protect our children under the social welfare 

system but the question I would really like to ask this House is, are the legislation and all these various 

programmes achieving the societal behavioural change that these legislations and programmes intend 

to achieve or the objectives of these legislations?   

</span></p>
<p><span>To  me  that  is  the  crux  of  these  legislations,  Mr.  Speaker.    Having  to  ratify  an  Optional 

Protocol to a main UN Convention just does not give us that good feeling that we are satisfying all 

those UN requirements or maybe UNICEF requirements which specifically look after our children.  

So, I would like to focus my contribution on the societal behavioural change that these legislations 

and programmes target to achieve.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I know there has been a lot of work done by the Government and also by Non-Government 

</span><span>Organisations (NGOs), for example, the Save the Children Fund and all other organisations that do 

undertake work in the protection of our children but as we see, we continue to have children who are 

missing in Fiji.  I know I have raised this in one of my previous contributions of our grave concern 

on our missing children and the non-action by the Government in regards to pursuing that we find 

these children. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I know there was a three-year old girl that disappeared somewhere in Veisari and up until 

now, we still do not know what has happened to that child, and that to me is important rather than 

just bringing in conventions or optional protocols to sign.  What we must be doing as a country and 

as legislators in this House is for us to be looking at - what do we achieve?  Are we achieving the 

targeted objectives of these conventions or not?   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while out in the community after </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>, I found out that we, in Fiji, have 

</span><span>a strong traditional  governance system  in  place  and that is  working together with  our faith-based 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 32</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>391 

</span></p>
<p><span>organisations.  I believe that one of the key aspects to all these conventions that we are ratifying and 

have signed this one, for example, is, how will it affect us?  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  heard  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Economy  mention  about  enforcement  of  these 

legislations and that is the key but he did not further add, neither the Honourable Minister for Women, 

Children and Poverty Alleviation, on the resources that we need as a country to be able to achieve 

the  targeted  societal  behavioural  change  that  is  needed.    Only  then  can  we  can  say  that  we  have 

achieved what these conventions are - the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and now we are 

trying to ratify the Optional Protocol, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the recommendations I would like to put on the floor now is for the Government to 

recognise the importance of community-based child protection mechanisms and work with all those 

organisations  that  undertake  these  types  of  work  and  also  to  ensure  that  they  are  resourced 

accordingly.  Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, this signing of the Optional Protocol aligned to the Convention 

on the Rights of the Child, if the Government does not accord the appropriate level of resources, not 

only to the Ministry but  also to NGOs (including faith-based organisations and community-based 

organisations), for us to be able to synchronise the formal and traditional mechanisms that are out in 

the community to be able to work better to protect our children. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I call on the Honourable Minister for Economy and also the Honourable Minister for Women, 

Children and Poverty Alleviation that we take it a little bit further and look at implementation, look 

at  the localisation of these Conventions and the  localisation of  this  Protocol,  shift  from  the usual 

social welfare assistance that we are giving, but focus more on the community-based child protection 

mechanisms that are already there and work together so that we are able, as a country, to achieve 

more  and  take  us  out  from  being  listed  under  Tier  2  of  the  United  States  Department  on  the 

Trafficking of Persons.  Thank you, Mr.  Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Salote Radrodro for her contribution to the debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Lynda Tabuya, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I rise in support of this motion to ratify the 

Optional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child 

Pornography and Child Prostitution but before I do so, Honourable Speaker, allow me to enlighten 

the  Honourable  Attorney-General.    The  SODELPA  Women  Members  of  Parliament  are  wearing 

green today in solidarity for good governance at USP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Women  stated  that  our  laws,  the  2013  Fijian 

</span><span>Constitution, the Crimes Act 2009 and the Online Safety Act 2018 clearly represent Fiji’s stand to 

combat the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the laws deal with the sale of children and child prostitution but there 

is nothing much in our laws on child pornography.  Exploitation is defined as the exploiter and the 

victim, and defined generally as the exploiter’s conduct that causes the victim to enter into sexual 

servitude.  There is also the definition of sexual service which means the commercial use or display 

of the body of the person providing the service for the sexual gratification of others. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the Honourable Attorney-General mentioned that the Online Safety Act 2018 deals with 

consent.    The miscellaneous provision,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  the Miscellaneous Offences  - section 

377(1) of the Crimes Act states that a person commits a summary offence if he or she, by way of 

trade, distributes photographs or films tending to corrupt morals.  Now, there is no definition of the 

</span><span>phrase, “tending to corrupt morals”.  So, our current laws are weak in realising the gravity of child 

</span><span>pornography and pornography in general.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 33</a></p>
<p><span>392 

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Commonwealth Criminal Court of Australia, it defines this phrase, 

“child abuse material”, which includes material that depicts a person under 18 years of age, who is 

engaged  in  or  appears  to  be  engaged  in  a  sexual  activity  whether  or  not  in  the  presence  of  other 

persons and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being in all circumstances, 

offensive. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, there is a specific offence of possession, control, production, supplying and obtaining 

child  abuse  material  through  the  internet.    I  note  that  both,  Australia  and  Fiji,  do  not  define  this 

phrase, “child pornography” in our criminal laws.  We need to define this term, Mr. Speaker, in our 

laws.  The Federal Laws in the USA define child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually 

explicit conduct involving a minor that is under the age of 18 years old.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  have  heard  in  my  statement  last  year  on  fighting  this  new  drug  -  

pornography, how the victims are getting younger and younger and it is harder to discern the age of 

the victim in the films and photos produced by the porn industry.  Now, global payment platforms 

like </span><span>PayPal</span><span>, have pulled out from porn hub because of the increasing violence depicted in the videos 

being  displayed  and  the  millions  of  videos  that  depict  adults,  role  playing  as  children  dressed  in 

schoolgirl uniforms and being exploited. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Predatory porn sites, like </span><span>XVideos</span><span>, is being called out throughout the world for profiteering 

from videos containing child sexual exploitation.  In late last year, a 15-year-old girl, Mr. Speaker, 

went missing in Florida.  Her mother found her on </span><span>Pornhub</span><span> and she was in 58 sex videos.  A 14-

year-old  girl  in  California  was  sexually  assaulted  and  the  videos  were  posted  on  </span><span>Pornhub</span><span>.    The 

offenders were arrested for the assault but </span><span>Pornhub </span><span>escaped responsibility for sharing the videos and 

profiting from them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and Honourable Members, we think that this problem is only happening in 

America, it is happening all over the world.  Fiji continues to rank high with searches in </span><span>Pornhub</span><span>.  

This is why I will continue to advocate for us to ban porn sites, like  </span><span>Pornhub</span><span> and </span><span>XVideos.  </span><span>Our 

children are getting more and more exposed freely to pornography.  Children are taking videos of 

children engaging in sexual acts and sharing it with their friends when it gets out.  Even adults are 

doing it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, rather than the law makes child pornography illegal, this terms does not even begin to 

describe the true horror that is faced by countless children every year.  When a video or a picture is 

produced and circulated, it is a permanent record of the child’s sexual abuse.  We need to protect our 

</span><span>children from this new drug.  Sexual violence against our women, boys and girls continue to rise.  

</span><span>Teenage pregnancies continue to rise.  When will we, as legislators, parents or as grandparents realise 

that it is right now in each of our children’s hands - in the smartphone, the data that we enable for the 

free and fast Wi-Fi, the internet cafes where they spend hours? 

</span></p>
<p><span>It is not for studying, it is not for research, they are on </span><span>Instagram</span><span>, </span><span>Snapchat</span><span>, </span><span>TikTok</span><span>, sharing 

questionable material.  They are being exposed younger and younger to pornography and when they 

are being lured by predators on these online platforms, their selfies and videos are being used by 

these predators to be shared on to consumers of child pornography.   

</span></p>
<p><span>No  parent  is  perfect,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but  in  my  effort  to  try,  I  will  share  a  personal 

experience.  I have six children of varying ages from 21 years to 3 years.  Every now and again, I 

conduct a random phone audit on my two teenage daughters who are 14 and 12 respectively.  Last 

weekend,  I  checked  my  12  year  old’s  smartphone  and  </span><span>Instagram</span><span>  account  which  was  open  and  I 

</span><span>happen to come across a private chat that she was having with this individual, and throughout the 

</span><span>thread the question came up in it, ‘send me a picture of you’.  Of course, my daughter did not respond 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>393 

</span></p>
<p><span>but she put a sheepish smiling emoji.  This person then went on to say, ‘do not be shy’.  And then 

she asked in turn, “How old are you?”  And he said, “I am a 41 year old single dad looking for a 

friend, can we be friends?”  Of course, I had to deal with this issue with her and the consequences. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and Honourable Members, parents and guardians, be warned, our children 

are  in  great  danger.    They  are  under  threat  more  than  ever  before  in  any  time  in  any  century.  

Pornography is the new drug.  We need to fight this new drug together.  It would take us as legislators 

to implement these laws and policies to protect our precious ones. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that with the ratification of this Optional Protocol, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government 

will really give this some teeth and define child pornography in the Crimes Act.  I also call on the 

Government to free Fiji from pornography.  For our sons and our daughters, we do need to fight this 

new drug.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Tabuya.  Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise in support of this motion.  It is 

</span></p>
<p><span>very important to be part of the global community in addressing issues like this.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  horrified  as  a  Fijian  when  a  child  is  being  sold  or  subjected  to 

prosecution or child pornography.  I used to think it was only in those areas with huge population 

and very poor countries, but I believe it is also happening in Fiji today and we need to be on guard.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the way I see it, it has to do with poverty.  Yesterday, we debated the Public 

Rental Board Annual Report and we spoke about the availability of housing in Fiji and the general 

shift  from  the  rural  areas  to  the  urban  areas,  leading  to  overcrowding.    Government  made  some 

statements yesterday that they are doing their utmost to provide housing and there are a number of 

models that are in place that we question, Mr. Speaker.  It gives us a sense of urgency.  Whatever 

model that we are trying to adopt, please, do it with a sense of urgency.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Singapore  Model  was  brought  here  about  two  years  ago  and  I  believe  some  work  is 

happening  in  that  area  but,  again,  we  ask  the  question,  “Why  is  it  taking  so  long?”    We  need  to 

provide housing to the people who are migrating to the cities where they are the most vulnerable to 

these types of practices.  My grandson goes to a school and he was saying that his friend is in a family 

of 15 and they live in one room.  That is the reality for some parts of Fiji, and that is the reality that 

contributes to what we are trying to address today.  So, I would urge everyone, the Government, let 

</span><span>us  be  part  of  their  programme  to  really  strive  hard  to  find  adequate  housing  for  everyone.  

</span><span>Overcrowding to me is a threat to us and encourages these types of practices. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also told that in some schools, the teachers are saying that some of 

these children no longer have parents.  They are being cared for by their grandparents.  We need to 

have a look at this.  I would like to ask the Honourable Minister responsible to try and carry out a 

survey because parents must be made responsible.  I think in most parts of Fiji today, you have a 

child, sometimes maybe out of wedlock and you take the child to the grandparents who will never 

say “no” to a grandchild.  But it is something that we really need to address, Mr. Speaker.  We need 

to have dialogue on this.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I remember in Singapore at one time, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew passed a law, prohibiting 

couples from taking their elderly parents to the Old People’s Home because people were just growing 

old and the young family was trying to grow their families.  What they did was, they used to park or 

</span><span>take their elderly parents to the Old People’s Home.  He said, “No, you are not allowed to do this.”  

</span><span>They passed a law in Singapore to stop them from doing that, so we may have to have dialogue on

</span></p>
<p><span>this.  If it is happening in a way that I understand it, we have to put a stop to it.  You have a child, 

you look after your child.  You do not take your child and park it with their grandparents, and this is 

something that we need to look into, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On education, my colleague, the Honourable Leader of the Opposition spoke very strongly 

on this today.  We must never cut back on education.  Education will help us escape from vulnerable 

things  like  this.    It  is  no  secret  that  SODELPA  has  a  policy  on  education  that  when  we  become 

government in 2023, we will include education all the way to tertiary level, Mr. Speaker.  We believe 

that education is the key to all of these and educated people will not allow themselves to be subjected 

to pornography, sale of children, et cetera.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, these are a number of issues that we need to address.  We support this Protocol 

but there are some underlying problems in the country that we need to address and I have highlighted 

them - housing, education and to work on the morality of the country in terms of responsibilities.  

That, Mr. Speaker, is my contribution on this today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member.  Honourable Bulanauca, you have the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also support Fiji’s ratification of the Optional 

Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and 

Child Pornography.  It is good to make laws, to follow it and to catch people who do not follow it 

but  in this instance, it is important to find the root cause as to why there is the sale of children, and 

then try to solve the problem.  It is important that we ensure that children are not sold and we ask the 

question, why sell children?  Maybe it is not happening in Fiji, I do not have any statistics on that but 

we can see that it is happening in poor countries. Why are they selling children?  No food, no money; 

that is exactly where I am going to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>People and families need food and money and that is exactly where our national development 

has to gear itself to.  To ensure that the wealth and revenue that we get filters right down to the family 

level, so that they can have food on the table, that they can have money, get their children to school 

and  to  the  health  hospitals.  They  need  food  and  money  and  that  is  the  responsibility  of  any 

government  in  the  world  to  ensure  that  the  money  comes  to  the  government  from  the  private 

enterprise and filters right down to the grassroot level whether in the urban or rural areas.  Everyone 

needs  to  eat,  everyone  needs  to  live,  that  is  the  root  cause;  the  development  of  any  government.  

Poverty in Fiji is increasing, maybe up to 40 or 50 percent.  We need to reduce that by the kind of 

</span><span>developments that we need to do here in Fiji to ensure that the money goes right down; not only to 

</span><span>the rich or the few on top, but to the grassroot level.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is important Mr. Speaker, Sir, to find out the root causes.  It is all right to have the laws 

there,  but  it  is  important  to  have  developments  to  reduce  or  stop  those  kind  of  things.    Child 

prostitution,  same  thing;  where  there  is  demand,  people  will  buy,  people  will  do it.   So  we  must 

educate our people correctly with the right morality in the public or with any government.  It is the 

first instance for the government to do that and other NGO’s, churches to continue from there. It is 

important to find out the root causes; need food on the table, we need money in the pockets and you 

must stop greed and lust arising from prostitution.  Also pornography, what are you trying to look 

at? What are you trying to view the images for?  There again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, comes to the point 

that it is important, the morality of the population of our country is very important. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Before it comes to that, in order for  you not to sell children, not to have prostitution with 

</span><span>children, not to see images and pornography, we must have the right morality in the country, we must 

</span><span>have the right spirit in the country.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to have the right spirit in any individual in any country.  We 

must have the Holy Spirit there, not the evil spirit, otherwise I will call you “satan”.  You must have 

the right spirit in Christ Jesus only, morality.  We must educate here in Fiji, that is very important to 

have education.  Education of the head of academics, education of skills (with your hands), and most 

important the education of the heart.  Not only what you can do, but you can live by to maintain the 

morality because there is no other way.  Only Jesus Christ is the way.  He is the way, the truth and 

the life.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  thank  the  Honourable  Bulanauca  for  his 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate.  I have three other speakers on my list, but the time goes on. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We will now break for lunch and after lunch I will take the next three speakers in this order: 

Honourable Ro Tuisawau, Honourable Minister for Health and Honourable Minister for Education.  

I will accommodate any others after that, but it depends on how my lunch break goes. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We will adjourn for lunch and will continue after that.

<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.32 p.m. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please be seated.  Honourable Members, we will 

continue from where we left off before lunch and I now give the floor to the Honourable Ro Filipe 

Tuisawau.  You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion 

in front of us – Ratification on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 

the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.  As I had mentioned in some of the 

previous reports we had been looking at, it would be good to ascertain or look at current status against 

certain standards or indicators in terms of legislation or ratification of protocols, conventions.  In this 

particular case, I would like to share the US State Department 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report on 

Fiji which touches on elements of this particular Protocol which we are discussing or debating today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Report divides nations into tiers based on their compliance with the standards outlined 

in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 2000 in the United States, so it ranks tiers according to 

compliance: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Tier 1- countries are those governments which fully comply with the minimum standards.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Tier 2 - governments which do not comply with all the minimum standards but are making 

significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Tier 2 Watch List  - countries whose governments do not comply fully with the standards 

but  are  making  significant  efforts  to  bring  themselves  into  compliance  with  those 

standards  and  the  absolute  number  of  victims  of  severe  forms  of  trafficking,  is  very 

significant  or  is  significantly  increasing,  and  there  is  failure  to  provide  evidence  of 

increasing efforts to combat severe forms of trafficking in persons from the previous year, 

or the determination that our country is making significant efforts to bring themselves into 

compliance with minimum standards, was based on commitments by the country to take 

additional future steps over the next year.   

</span></p>
<p><span>According to the Report, Fiji is placed at the Tier 2 Watchlist.  Interestingly, Fiji was placed 

at Tier 2, not on the Tier 2 Watchlist which is sort of another level down or which we could say had 

deteriorated.  So in 2011 to 2017, Fiji was at Tier 2 but from 2018-2020, it has moved a level down 

to Tier 2 Watchlist.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the highlights of the reason it went there, the Government of Fiji does not fully meet 

the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making significant efforts to do so.  

Those efforts include: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>initiating a similar number of investigations, compared to the number the previous year;  

increasing number of officers;  

designating an agency responsible for coordinating victim services; and 

convening inter-agency working group.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition,  Government  convicted  a  trafficker  for  the  first  time  since  2014,  however,  the 

Government  did  not  demonstrate  overall  increasing  efforts,  compared  to  the  previous  reporting 

period. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government continued to lack guidelines for victim identification; did not train Labour, 

</span><span>Customs or Immigration Officials on trafficking; and identified only one victim during the reporting 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 38</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>397 

</span></p>
<p><span>period.    Some  reports  are  just  official  complicity  impeding  anti-trafficking  efforts  because  the 

Government has devoted sufficient resources to a written plan that, if implemented, would constitute 

significant  efforts  to  beat  the  minimum  standards.    Fiji  was  granted  a  waiver  per  the  Trafficking 

Victims Protection Act from an otherwise required downgrade to Tier 3 therefore, Fiji remained at 

Tier 2 Watchlist. 

</span></p>
<p><span>These are some of the recommendations highlighted: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji needs to develop and implement formal victim identification and referral procedures 

for Police, Immigration, Customs and Labour. 

Fiji needs to proactively screen groups vulnerable to trafficking, such as foreign migrant 

workers.  

Persons in commercial sex and child labourers need to increase efforts to investigate and 

prosecute trafficking offences and convict and punish traffickers, including by increasing 

resources for the Police Human Trafficking Unit. 

Amend  trafficking-related  provisions  of  the  Crimes  Act  to  criminalise  all  forms  of 

trafficking, deliver effective training to Police Prosecutors, et cetera, 

Increase the provision of victim services, including by increasing coordination amongst 

agencies, including NGOs. 

Increase  oversight  of  working  conditions  of  foreign  construction  workers  and 

investigation  of  labour  violations  involving  children  and  migrant  workers  for  forced 

labour. 

Proactively investigate potential official complicity in trafficking-related crimes. 

Enable  identified  foreign  victims  to  work  and  earn  income,  while  assisting  with  the 

investigations. 

Take steps to implement the 2020 Anti-Trafficking National Action Plan. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of prosecution, the Government maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts 

as mentioned by the Honourable Minister.  The Crimes Act 2009 criminalises some forms of labour 

trafficking and all forms of sex trafficking.  Section 112 to 117 criminalises trafficking in persons 

but  in  consistent  with  international  law,  requires  other  transnational  or  domestic  movement  to 

constitute a trafficking offence. 

</span></p>
<p><span>These  articles  prescribe  penalties  of  up  to  20  years  imprisonment  for  movement-based 

trafficking  offences  involving  adult  victims  and up  to  25  years  for  those  involving  child  victims.  

These penalties were sufficiently stringent with respect to sex trafficking, commensurate with serious 

</span><span>crimes such as kidnapping. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Section  107  criminalises  deceptive  recruiting  for  sexual  services,  including  inducing  and 

maintaining individuals in prostitution through deceptive means.  The penalties prescribed under this 

section was sufficiently stringent and commensurate with the penalties prescribed for such crimes. 

While sections 103 and 118 criminalise slavery and debt bondage respectively, all forms of labour 

trafficking were not criminalised under the Crimes Act.   

</span></p>
<p><span>During the reporting period, the Government initiated a review of trafficking legal framework 

</span><span>with  the  assistance  from  an  international  organisation.  Police  also  initiated  investigations  of  two 

</span><span>suspected trafficking cases during the reporting period and continued to investigate three cases. The 

Government initiated prosecution of one suspected trafficker in 2018 and a case involving domestic 

child sex trafficking.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Following the formalisation  of the Police Human Trafficking  Unit,  it increased staff from 

</span><span>four  to  seven  officers.    Nonetheless  the  unit  lacked  adequate  resources  to  effectively  conduct 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 39</a></p>
<p><span>398 

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>investigations.  Police did not proactively investigate trafficking cases consistently and the lack of 

effective coordination between Police and Prosecutors continued to impair the Government’s pursuit 

of trafficking cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Still on prosecution, the Department of Immigration did not renew temporary work permits 

to  foreign  victims  participating  in  an  ongoing  police  investigation  which  hampered  the  police’s 

ability to  conduct or complete the investigation when the victims returned to their home country.  

They also continued to conduct trainings for police recruits, prosecutors, however, observers reported 

the one day anti-trafficking trainings provided to police recruits were insufficient. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Fijian  law  enforcement  continue  to  cooperate  with  South  Korean  authorities  to 

investigate leaders of a church that allegedly confiscated the passports of  its members who worked 

without  pay  in  various  companies  owned  by  the  church.    The  Government  did  not  report  any 

investigation, prosecution or conviction of Government employees complicit in trafficking offences. 

However,  some  reports  indicated  low  level  official  complicity  impeded  anti-trafficking  efforts 

including by preventing the investigation of trafficking in Chinese operated brothels.     

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of protection, the Government maintains efforts to identify and protect victims. The 

</span><span>Government identified and provided assistance to one  trafficking victim and increased from zero. 

</span><span>The Police Anti-Trafficking Unit had informal guidelines in place, however, Government officials 

did  not  proactively  screen  for  victims  of  trafficking  amongst  the  vulnerable  population  and  the 

Government  did  not  have  formal  victim  identification,  procedures  for  all  relevant  agencies  as 

mentioned. 

</span></p>
<p><span>National security: as the agent responsible for coordinating victim services, however, because 

the law did  not  specifically mandate the provision  of services to  victims of trafficking, it did  not 

allocate sufficient funds for trafficking victims and victims often relied on NGOs for services.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of prevention, the Government increased efforts to prevent trafficking.  In February 

2020, the Government convened the inter-agency working group. On human trafficking, for the first 

time  in  years  resulting  in  the  transfer  of  chairperson’s  responsibility  from  the  Department  of 

Immigration to the Ministry of Defence and National Security which oversees the Police.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of labour, Labour Inspectors also conducted 3,562 inspections and identified 41 child 

labour violations  in  terms of what  the Government  is  doing. Government  did  not  make efforts to 

reduce the standard, the demand for commercial sex acts.  It trained some diplomatic personnel on 

</span><span>trafficking but did not provide anti-trafficking training to military personnel prior to their deployment 

</span><span>abroad.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Trafficking profile, as reported over the past  years, the human traffickers exploit domestic 

and foreign victims in Fiji and traffickers exploit victims from Fiji abroad. Family members, taxi 

drivers,  foreign  tourist  businessmen,  crew  on  foreign  fishing  vessels  and  other  traffickers  have 

allegedly exploited victims from Thailand and China as well as Fijian women and children in sex 

trafficking. Traffickers exploit victims in brothels, local hotels, et cetera.  I observed a practice where 

taxi drivers reported Fijian child’s sex trafficking victims or transported them to hotels in popular 

tourist areas at the request of foreign tourists seeking commercial sex acts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just sharing this report and the Honourable Minister had asked, “Why 

are  you reading it?”  The reason  I  am  reading it is  a status  report on the implementation  of such 

protocols or conventions which we accede to or which we debate in the House. It also gives us a 

</span><span>picture of the actual state of situations in terms of particular issues such as we are discussing today 

</span><span>on child prostitution or trafficking.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>399 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  very  important,  as  I  mentioned  in  whatever  we  are  discussing  that  you  have  your 

standards, you have your indicators in which to achieve but we also need to access reports which 

gives us an assessment of a current situation of a current issue which is why I am sharing this, Mr 

.Speaker, for the enlightenment of the House and for our people so that we know the actual state of 

the situation in terms of our laws and also conventions and protocols.  With that, I support the motion 

before the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau for his contribution to the 

debate . I now give the floor to the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services. You have 

the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Thank you.  I would like to give a small contribution to the 

motion and I support the motion before the House.  The motion is to ratify the Optional Protocol to 

the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child  Prostitution  and  Child 

Pornography.    This  is  very  important.    If  you  look  at  the  whole  protocol  and  read  it,  you  would 

understand that this protocol basically supports the health of a child.  When you talk about the health 

of a child, we talk about the physical health of the child, protecting the physical health of the child, 

protecting the mental health of the child, taking the spiritual growth of the child, the development of 

</span><span>the child and also preventing the child from sexual exploitation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, it is of interest in that in the fine line, it also talks about protecting the child 

being a donor in selling the organs for organ donation and I think this is also important.  As we are 

aware that a lot of our people that actually need an organ donation mostly it is a kidney transplant, 

they go to other  countries, we want to be sure that we actually are principal in that position and we 

also believe in that position which they take with them wherever they go.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  good  thing  about  this  protocol  is  that  it  dismantles  the  platforms  that  actually 

encourages these things to happen; the platforms of encouraging sexual exploitation, the platforms 

of encouraging pornography in children, the sale of children. Not only does  it talk about it and talks 

about how we believe in the principles of not agreeing to it and that we work on the framework within 

our legislation, but also  most importantly, it talks about the comprehensive framework that needs to 

be dismantled to allow this to happen. This is actually very contemporary.  If you look at it, the laws 

are very contemporary in this nature.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  just  want  to  finish  by  raising  something  that  I  believe  is  important  and  all  of  us  here  in 

Parliament should understand that there is an African proverb that it takes a village to raise a child. 

</span><span>If you look at this African proverb, there are several languages in which this is talked about.  In some 

</span><span>languages it talks about that it takes a village to raise a child and some it says that if a mother does 

not raise a child then the tribe will raise the child.   But in the context of this, I think it is important 

to understand that in Fiji for our context, it takes this nation to raise a child.  So, it is not only the part 

of Government but it is a part of religious organisations, part of the the </span><span>tikina</span><span> and </span><span>vanua</span><span>, it is the part 

of social clubs. As a nation, we should all come together and raise a child.  I hope that when this 

protocol is actually approved by Parliament that everyone in Fiji will actually read the importance of 

this protocol and the importance of protecting our children from the abuses and also the exploitations 

that they face.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for Health. I now give the floor to the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Bulitavu. You have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to give a short contribution in 

</span><span>support  of  the  motion  that  is  before  the  House  and  also  in  support  of  the  Review  Report  to  the 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 41</a></p>
<p><span>400 

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Optional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child 

Prostitution and Child Pornography. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to understand, Honourable Members, just giving a few background on this.  The 

Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) anchors two big protocols, one is the one that we had 

ratified probably in the previous sitting, that is, Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 

the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and this is the second protocol which is 

the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child 

Prostitution and Child Pornography.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Given that we are in support of our accepting this particular protocol given that it will tell the 

world that we are serious with what we are doing and also the measures that will come in place given 

that we are accepting international best practices.  Also given are few things that was shared by the 

Honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau on the 2018 ILO Report, that was also presented to the Committee 

in its deliberation.  It was presented by the University of the South Pacific (USP) as part of their 

submission to the Committee on the background of child sexual exploitation and other things that are 

happening around in the various activities that are there.  That was presented and also deliberated by 

the Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>However,  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  is  probably,  once  we  go  into  this  and  the 

domestication  takes  place  is  the  synchronising  of  our  data  and  also  coming  in  together  as  those 

agencies  that  will  be  involved  at  implementation  level  on  the  sharing  of  information,  data  and 

information  that  will  enable  those  policies  to  be  implemented.    That  will  be  done  at  the 

implementation stage.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But,  one  other  reason  I  wanted  to  contribute  this  afternoon,  given  that  we  already  have 

acceded  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  involvement  of  Children  in  Armed 

Conflict, the other thing that probably we might know by now, this morning the Honourable Chair 

for Justice, Law &amp; Human Rights had tabled the Cybercrime Bill which was before our Committee 

and probably will be debated sometimes this week. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the Cybercrime Bills goes back to the Budapest Convention, we became signatories 

of  that  and  also  the  Cybercrime  Bill  2020.    One  of  the  good  things  that  that  particular  Bill  does 

especially in the various changes that it will do to our current laws that are in place, that is, section 

62(a) of the Juveniles Act. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Bill  will  actually  broaden  the  definition  of  pornographic  activities  and  also  other 

</span><span>activities that are involving children.  Probably we will be looking forward when we come to the 

third reading this week.  Those are some of the ramifications that that particular Bill has on this and 

has bearing on what we have and will come to implementation level.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Once  we  go  along,  given  after  adopting  this  and  other  Conventions,  this  will  enable  our 

domestic regulatory framework to be in par with international standards when we move along. Those 

are some of the things that are there and also it has bearing too in one of the Bills that will probably 

be coming tomorrow on the assessors that was moved by the Honourable Attorney-General yesterday 

and also on sexual cases where there is a need to review and make cases more consistent with the 

practices that we are doing and our commitment to international level on the various Treaties and 

Conventions that we are becoming a party to. 

</span></p>
<p><span>These are a few things, it will emulate our status in the Pacific and also showing to the world 

</span><span>that we are committed, the various Conventions that we already acceded to and the domestication 

</span><span>part and also the others that are coming in, in forms of Bills that are coming to the Committees.  We

</span></p>
<p><span>are slowing doing our domestication and we look forward for budgetary provisions, allocation and 

resources so that all of these will be implemented to achieve and fulfil the missions and visions of 

those Conventions and Protocols.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER. -  I thank the Honourable Bulitavu for his contribution to the debated.  I 

now give the floor to the Honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  R.S.  AKBAR.-    Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Honourable  Prime  Minister  and 

Honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to contribute and support the motion before the House, 

that  is,  to  ratify  the  Optional  Protocol  to  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  Child  on  the  Sale  of 

Children,  Child  Prostitution  and  Child  Pornography.    Sir,  I  think  this  subject  is  not  new  to  our 

communities  and  as  Members  of  Parliament,  I  think  it  is  very  important  that  we  rise  strongly  to 

condemn  these  acts  that  violate  the  rights  of  our  children,  whether  it  is  child  trafficking,  child 

prostitution or child pornography.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I wish to draw reference to Volume 2171, A-27531 - the Preamble, and I wish to focus on the 

</span></p>
<p><span>two following parts, and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Believing  that  the  elimination  of  the  sale  of  children,  child  prostitution  and 

</span><span>child pornography will be facilitated by adopting a holistic approach, addressing the 

contributing  factors,  including  underdevelopment,  poverty,  economic  disparities, 

inequitable socio-economic structure, disfunctioning families, lack of education, urban-

rural migration, gender discrimination, irresponsible adult sexual behaviour, harmful 

traditional practices, armed conflicts and trafficking in children.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Believing that efforts to raise public awareness are needed to reduce consumer 

demand for the sale of  children, child prostitution and  child pornography, and  also 

believing in the importance of strengthening global partnership among all actors and 

of improving law enforcement at the national level.”    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education and, I, personally stand here to condone all such 

acts  against  our  children  and  we  must  work  together  to  safeguard  Fijian  children.    Honourable 

Members before me have spoken about their support for the motion and I think we need to see more 

of that in this august House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the Ministerial level, I come across many examples of these issues from the communities 

that filter down to our schools.  I will draw the House to a specific incident that happened last year, 

when a case such as this was reported to us.  When we investigated, the child did not hesitate to say 

that he learnt it when he saw his parents.   Actually, this was the case of sexual harassment between 

students, and I am not going to say whether it was a boy or a girl.  That is why I wish to draw the 

attention to this irresponsible adult sexual behaviour and the fact that as parents, we need to be there 

to protect our children. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Within the Ministry, many a times we see that the blame is shifted to a school facility, or the 

teacher did not do that.  But we encourage all children to have the courage to come and report these 

incidences to their teachers in schools if they do not feel comfortable with any other family members.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  also  seen  rising  incidents  of  such  cases  being  reported  and  as  such,  we  have 

</span><span>strengthened our school policies.  Currently, we have a Child Protection Policy, where teachers are 

</span><span>trained to be child protection officers and because of the criminal nature of such events, there is a 24

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>hour mandatory reporting.  As soon as a case is reported to the head of school or the child protection 

officer, we report that to the Police.  We also work with the Department of Social Welfare to ensure 

that we have a coordinated approach.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  a  policy  on  Behaviour  Management  in  School,  the  Counselling Policy,  even  the 

students  come  under  a  Student  Code  of  Conduct  Policy  and  we  have  Police  Check  Policies  for 

volunteers and visitors in our schools.  Of course, there are procedures for school visitors and right 

now, we are looking at a policy that we have labelled as Parental Engagement Policy.  So lot of talk 

about awareness and we want to work with parents to advise them of the dangers that continue to 

lurk  out  within  the  communities  and  outside  of  the  school  hours.    Hopefully,  we  will  be  able  to 

implement that policy by engaging with various stakeholders during our consultation process.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but the question is, why do these things continue to happen?  This is not a 

new phenomenon.  My stand here would be as parents, as adults, as grandparents and as guardians, 

we really need to be vigilant about this technology that seems to have taken over our lives and this is 

what everyone carries. Access to technology, internet sources, applications and sites, like Honourable 

Tabuya  spoke  about  how  we  tend  to  audit  our  children’s  phone,  but  I  can  give  an  example  that 

children these days are smarter than us.  They have their phone locked up, I have the same situation 

</span><span>at home with teenage daughters.  So, how do we get to befriend our children?  How do we get to 

</span><span>know what is going on in their lives?  How do we get to know who they talk to, who they associate 

with?  How do we advise them?  How do we protect and guide them?   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think more awareness on that is needed and at schools, we are going to play our part by 

engaging more with parents from this  year, as soon as we get the Parental Engagement Policy in 

place.  But other than that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Bulanauca said ‘poverty’. No one has the 

right to sell their child to put food on the table!  I totally disagree with that. I will understand that 

poverty could be a contributing factor but that does not justify parents or adults selling their children 

or trafficking their children to put food on the table. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I will give you another example, everyone is aware of the street boys that sell pastries and 

other stuff in the afternoon.  I have a lot of stories with them.  Every time I passed by, I speak to them 

and I get to hear horrific stories about what is happening at their house. I picked up five boys from 

the street to put them back in school but unfortunately, every effort that I made has been futile because 

when they go back home, the story changes. But we are not going to give up, we have decided that 

we will go to the villages and meet these parents.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When I gave them their school stationeries and their bags, I said, “Alright, I will give you 

</span><span>shoes and uniform as well.”  I found out which school they were going to, unfortunately, I was told 

they sold their bags, but again that effort must continue.  What I am trying to say is, we must never 

give up on our young ones, and we will continue to do that.  It has to be coordinated effort. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members of this House, even if you can make one difference by reporting, by 

counselling and talking to these children, I am sure it will go a long way.  As I have said, there are a 

lot of things but my focus here is for parents, please, monitor where your children are, monitor how 

much time they spend on their phones on going through various sites, et cetera.  These children could 

be very much swayed by things that they see.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When we asked some students as to why they did that, they said, “We saw it”, or “Our friends 

told us, it is right to do  that.”  They learn all those sexual behaviours by watching, they learn by 

reading and they learn from adults.  How do we go about combating them?

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>403 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have laws, we have legislations and I think the good way forward is that, we all have 

supported that, but individually through our faith-based organisations, our communities and our own 

networks, we must ensure that as parents, we are aware and children these days talk about their rights.  

We must teach our children that rights comes with responsibilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take my seat  and strongly support the motion before the 

</span></p>
<p><span>House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts.   I now 

give the floor to the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 

Maritime Development and Disaster Management.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I also rise to contribute 

to the motion and support it as well on the motion to approve that Fiji ratify the Optional Protocol to 

the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the  Sale  of  Children,  Child  Prostitution  and  Child 

Pornography.    Again,  I  wish  to  assure  this  august  House,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  Government  is, 

indeed, committed to the rights of our children and, of course, in ensuring that it is well protected. 

</span></p>
<p><span>How, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Let us begin with the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji 

</span></p>
<p><span>which states in Section 41(1)(d): 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Every child has the right – 

</span></p>
<p><span>(d)  

</span></p>
<p><span>to be protected from abuse, neglect, harmful cultural practices, any form of 

violence, inhumane treatment and punishment, and hazardous or exploitative 

labour.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, it is not only in our Constitution, but also in the Protocols that Fiji has ratified, we 

</span></p>
<p><span>have to ensure and this is why this motion is before the House as well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the review of our national legislations and, of course, ensuring that we 

complete the ratification process.  In terms of the review of our national legislations to be used as 

opportunities  to  also  review  the  compatibility  of  our  domestic  legislations  with  international 

standards. Again, if we go through the recent Crimes Act 2009 in terms of criminalizing offences, 

such as section 114 on Trafficking in Children, section 117 is the Domestic Trafficking in Children, 

section  226  is  the  Selling  of  Minors,  Buying  of  Minors  in  section  227,  section  230  is  Living  on 

</span><span>Earnings of Prostitution, section 231 is on the Loitering or Soliciting for the purposes of Prostitution, 

</span><span>and the list goes on.  But, what I intend to say is, of course, not only in terms of commitment but in 

the ratification and ensuring that our national legislations are also reviewed and that shows our level 

of commitment, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>From the Ministry of Defence and, of course, the Police, we are doing our best and we can 

also see that in our courts, there has been success in terms of prosecution on some of the cases and I 

would not mention it but it is there in the Report.  But what I wish to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that 

the Government is doing its best but this requires a whole of nation and a whole of society approach.  

It is not only Government.  It is always easy to blame Government for everything that goes wrong in 

our country and in our society but, again, this is a whole of nation and whole of society approach.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the recent disasters and even we are still in that State of Declaration for 

parts of Vanua Levu, having discussions with the Acting Police Commissioner on the negligence on 

</span><span>the part of parents. I am saying we can have all the legislations, we can have all the resources, we 

</span><span>can have all the technology but if there is wrong attitude, then definitely it is not going to address all 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>the issues that we face and confront in our societies.  Let us take our responsibilities seriously and let 

us not only continue to put the blame on Government.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a lot said too from the other side about 

human trafficking and the fear that we will be downgraded to tier three, I must assure this august 

House that recently in the Cabinet Meeting on  26th January, 2021, Cabinet has endorsed Fiji’s first 

ever National Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy.  Of course, we have also reviewed and endorsed the 

2011 National Action Plan of Action to Eradicate Trafficking in Persons and Child Trafficking.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have a commitment and we have a deadline as well to report 

back, we have met that deadline and that was due on 4th of February, 2021.  We are honouring our 

commitment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and if I may speak on this, the strategy drives our national efforts, 

given the cross-cutting nature of this issue. Our national strategy is further supported by an organic 

National Action Plan that outlines objectives and activities that ensure our effective and coordinated 

response to human trafficking.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  strategy  and  the  National  Action  Plan,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  product  of  close 

collaboration  between  Government,  technical  and  bilateral  partners  and  most  importantly,  civil 

</span><span>society  organisations,  faith-based  organisations  and  NGOs,  such  as  Homes  of  Hope,  Medical 

</span><span>Services Pacific and Pacific Dialogue.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Tuisawau has gone to great lengths in reading out the 12 

recommendations.  Yes,    this  strategy  and  this  National  Action  Plan  have  divided  the  12 

recommendations in two major components, particularly what is within our influence and control so 

that we can quickly address those issues - five, particularly as raised in the 12 recommendations and, 

of course, there are some issues where we need to dialogue particularly with the United States of 

America because of the differences in the sets of legislations that we have and the mechanisms that 

we have to support these legislations. We cannot just bring everything from the other country and 

put it straight into our own legislations, it has to be contextualised and that is another challenge that 

we have.  But let me assure you in this august House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that that concern has been 

addressed, it is work in progress.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On Wednesday and Thursday last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first training for our officials 

on Victim Identification Training conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) 

was conducted at Holiday Inn.  We had Officials from the Ministry of Labour, FIRCS, Department 

of Immigration, Department of Fisheries, Water Police, Fiji Navy and a few others, so that has been 

</span><span>conducted .  We are also doing a data survey, together with the United Nations Office on Drugs and 

</span><span>Crime (UNODC) in the development of a database, to ensure that we capture all forms of trafficking 

in persons and inform our future efforts.  

</span></p>
<p><span>That briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the update that I wish to bring to the attention of the House 

in as far as the anti-human trafficking policy is concerned, as per the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) 

Report that has been raised before the House. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion 

before the House.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for Defence for his contribution to the 

debate.  I now  give the floor to  the Honourable  Minister for  Industry, Trade, Tourism,  Lands and 

Mineral Resources, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all believe that child 

</span><span>protection is of paramount importance to all of us.  Alluding to what the Honourable Minister for 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 46</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>405 

</span></p>
<p><span>Defence actually just said this is why we actually see it in our Constitution and we are fully committed 

to making sure the children have the support and they need to feel secure at all times.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is also one of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have ensured that the justice system 

is strong with appropriate mechanisms in place to punish offenders and bring justice to all those who 

fall victim.  This is one of the reasons why you will see within our laws that there are comprehensive 

set of laws specifically there for the purposes of protection of our children. So we have gone a long 

way towards meeting the demands that are required of us with respect to the signing of this protocol. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as identified in the report, sexual exploitation of children is linked to poverty 

and  lack  of  education,  economic  disparities,  inadequate  socio-economic  structures,  dysfunctional 

families,  urban  rural  migration,  gender  discrimination,  irresponsible  adult  sexual  behaviour  and 

harmful traditional practices. The grass root communities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in urban and peri-urban 

rural  areas  have  been  actually  socially  economically  empowered  contrary  to  the  belief  that  some 

other people on the other side and this empowerment has actually come through various Government 

programmes  that  this  Government  has  actually  put  in  place.  These  policies  and  initiatives  have 

resulted in the reduction of income inequality in Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today the Fijian Government is committed to protecting our children from 

</span><span>exploitation or abuse. Today, they are able to access the child care line to report any abuse of violence 

or exploitation and this is part of the report on page 1325. We are actually coordinating, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, and partnering with key agencies for child protection. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from a tourism perspective, Fiji has long been recognised as a safe, family, 

friendly designated for tourists.  This is something that we are actually greatly proud ourselves in and 

findings from the 2019 International Visitors Survey revealed  that it is a family friendly destination.  

The local people are friendly are the top to influencing that factors for visiting Fiji and not only is 

our friendliness but reputation as a safe destination with visitors noting an  86 percent satisfaction 

rating for feeling safe and secure while in Fiji.  That is such a commendable thing for all of us to pat 

ourselves in the back, especially in light of the fact that I have just mentioned that we have so many 

laws in place that are actually protecting our children.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to maintain this recognition, it does not only mean caring for other.  It also 

means caring for our own.  We must  extend this duty of  care to  our children, especially those in 

communities who are in one way or another actually involved in the tourism industry.  Children in 

tourism areas are especially vulnerable to physical, emotional and sexual abuse.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I want to stress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that while we may not see child safety as a major industry 

challenging in Fiji, it is never too early or irrelevant to start the conversation and by ratifying this 

Protocol, we as a country, are showing the world that we are committed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to this end, the Ministry has been working with the Australian Volunteers 

International (AVI) Child Safe Volunteering (CSV) Hub Pacific, to enhance knowledge and capacity, 

not  only  towards  keeping  children  safe  in  tourism  sector  but  to  do  no  harm  in  the  communities 

responsible to tourism.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We are working to streamline a minimum code of conduct in the industry that will look at 

how businesses can actually ensure safe tourism practices, what duty of care we have for the children 

when we take visitors into our communities and how it creates more dialogue with our grass root 

leaders.

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Children, Mr. Speaker, rely on us as adults, to keep them safe and out of harm’s way.  In fact, 

it  is  one  of  the  greatest  responsibilities  that  we  all  have  as  parents  and  as  adults.    We  carry  this 

responsibility with us at all times, no matter where and who we are.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Never before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have we actually offered as much protection as we do today 

under  the  leadership  of  our  Honourable  Prime  Minister.  We  continue  to  remain  innovative,  we 

continue  to  listen,  we  continue  to  be  progressive  and  we  need  to  be  kept  abreast  as  to  what  our 

children are involved in. We cannot do this alone.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a father also, I call upon the other side of the House, I call upon the NGOs 

and development partners, religious leaders and most importantly, parents to come together and to 

protect our children. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on a lighter note, I used to see an advertisement a long time ago that used 

to come on the television.  It says, “It is 10 p.m., do you know where your children are?” The question 

that needs to be asked now, it is 10 pm, do you know where your parents are? That is what it becomes 

of us.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So, with those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the ratification of the Optional Protocol 

</span><span>to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and I urge all parents to keep their eyes open at all times. 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister Koya for his contribution to the debate.  

I now give the floor to the Honourable Attorney-General for your right of reply. You have the floor, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like to thank all the 

Honourable  Members  for  their  contributions.  You  have  all  spoken,  of  course,  in  support  of  Fiji 

ratifying the Optional Protocol.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just for the interest of the Members of Parliament, there are certain countries that actually 

have not ratified, for example, the Convention but they have ratified the Optional Protocol.  In fact, 

the USA is one such country where they have not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child 

but they have actually ratified this particular Optional Protocol which is on the Sale of Children, et 

cetera.    It  goes  to  the  point  about  what  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence  talked  about  that 

sometimes when countries do have their own standards, they may not necessarily be reflective of 

</span><span>international    convention  </span><span>per  se</span><span>  but  would  be  their  own  standards  that  may  not  necessarily  be 

</span><span>universally applicable.  So, this is why some of these issues need to be worked through.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In case there was about one point in time that the reason why the USA apparently had not 

ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child because it does say that children have the right to 

life.  Some States within USA, can still sentence those below the age of 18  years to be executed.  

Some States do have those provisions so they would have actually been in breach of the Convention 

on the Rights of the Child and that is why they may have not ratified the particular Convention in 

question. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I want to just very quickly summarise and perhaps, respond to some 

of the issues and misconceptions that do exist.  The Honourable Tabuya used the Online Safety Act 

as the only or seemed to be in her submission the primary law that actually governs pornography. 

Well, it does not. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 48</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>407 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Online Safety Act, as she talks about, causing harm by posting electronic communication.  

However, the offences of pornography actually are within the Crimes Act, as the Honourable Minister 

for Defence highlighted in section 377.  Trafficking is within the Crimes Act, section 111, Sexual 

Offences in section 210.  What is really interesting now and many people may be lost on this  because 

before, when you have what we call a sexual offence, people used to talk about rape but if you look 

at the language now and semantics actually does matter in these  instances, is that sexual offences 

now has been augmented or increased in its scope.    

</span></p>
<p><span>For example, before rape was only seen as you know a penetration of penis in the vagina.  It 

was only seen as a one-way heterosexual relationship or act more to the point.  But now of course, 

sexual assault includes a whole range of other types of commissioning of acts that in fact, constitutes 

rape from what we traditionally knew as rape.  So, that is critically important to understand for the 

Honourable Members and I am quite happy to furnish them with that detail.  Now, that is what we 

found.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at many offences against children, it is not necessarily the penetration of the penis 

but there are other objects that are used and people get exploited also from that perspective, so she is 

incorrect in using the Online Safety Act, as the sole determinant as to or how serious we are about 

</span><span>these types of offences. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point is that, her statistics as has been questioned previously, is 

not verifiable at all.  The IT companies have also proven that and again for her to quote figures that 

she herself perhaps may have concocted is obviously not right to do so, but the reality of the matter 

of course is that, pornography is not something you want to perpetuate.  Pornography is not an act 

that you want people to adhere to or our children to look at.  The reality of the matter, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, that it is a behavioural issue.  It is a value issue.  It is how in particular, we view our children, 

how images are spread.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is why I was very concerned and it has also been brought to our attention that Honourable 

Tabuya had in the recent past, put up a post of a young girl who was naked from waist above getting 

some medical attention and putting it up as a post as “what a wonderful medical treatment she is 

getting”.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Minister for Women had actually written to her about that particular post 

and Honourable Tabuya actually then pulled down that post.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot sit here... 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- A Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Yes, you have the Point of Order. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like the Honourable Attorney-

General to withdraw that comment because the post in particular, there was a consent given by the 

parent and that was what I discussed with the Honourable Minister.  In fact, the parent took it and it 

was actually a child who was being attended to at the Sai Prema Hospital... 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  ... and she had given her consent.

<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Now,  upon  reconsideration  when  the  Honourable  Minister  reached  out  to  me  and  we  had 

discussed it personally, it was then taken down after I spoke to the parent.  So, please, you need to 

qualify what you state and not just straight out say that it was my action, even though a consent was 

given by the parent for that picture to be put up because the child was being medically examined, Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  and  it  was  about  rheumatic  heart  disease  at  the  Sai  Prema  Hospital.    It  was  about 

rheumatic  heart  disease  and  the  child  was  receiving  medical  examination  that  required  the 

examination of that condition in that state, and that was the consent given by the parent.  So, just to 

qualify that, that should not be quoted in Parliament that it was entirely my decision, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.  So, he should withdraw that statement.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you.  The Honourable Member has 

</span></p>
<p><span>a premature attitude towards many things.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. L. Tabuya interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I had not completed my sentence. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As I was explaining, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is that, Honourable Tabuya had 

posted the photo of this young lady, probably in her early teens, who was naked from waist above.  

Irrespective  of  whether  the  parents  gave  consent  or  not,  it  was  Honourable  Tabuya  who  actually 

posted it, smiling in front of this half-naked teenager. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  irrespective  of  whether  the  person  was 

getting medical attention or not, we all have to understand that as Members of Parliament, we are 

actually opinion-shapers.  We have a huge level of influence in the community, whether you are a 

backbencher, a Minister or an Opposition Member, you are a Member of this Parliament.   Therefore, 

to have those types of photographs posted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by a Member of Parliament is not only 

distasteful because it is purely for public relations perspective, but more so, here we are displaying a 

semi-naked teenager on social media. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been, for the past nearly hour-and-a-half, talking about how our 

children should not be portrayed, how images should not be portrayed and here we have a Member 

</span><span>of Parliament doing precisely that.  And if there was nothing untoward about it, she would not have 

</span><span>pulled it down.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. L.D. Tabuya interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that if there was nothing untoward 

</span></p>
<p><span>about it, you would not have pulled it down, understand that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my point.  You obviously cannot comprehend that, it is beyond a 

particular level of intellectual capacity, but this is the point.  We cannot sit here and pontificate about 

these issues, when you yourselves are going to put up those kinds of images.  Very bad taste.  The 

letter was also written and copied to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, the image was pulled 

down and I also have a copy of the post.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wanted to make is that, when we talk on the issues about 

</span><span>the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), Honourable Salote Radrodro talked about (and to 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 50</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC 

</span></p>
<p><span>409 

</span></p>
<p><span>an extent quite correctly) about identifying gaps, our adherence with the Convention on the Rights 

of  the  Child  and,  of  course,  this  Optional  Protocol  will  not  be  applicable  until  we  ratify  it,  but 

nonetheless it will come into effect.    

</span></p>
<p><span>We have to supply our report in June this year, and as she knows having worked with the 

Ministry of Women, for example, I am sure she would have worked with CEDAW, that when these 

reports are done, there is also input from Non-Governmental Organisations and their views are also 

ascertained.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  now  have  a  different  approach,  the  Honourable  Minister,  not  just  on  this  particular 

Convention  but,  for  example,  for  CEDAW,  they  reached  out  to  the  various  NGOs  and  worked 

together with them because the whole purpose of this is not for political point scoring, but to ensure 

that in the application of the provisions of this Convention whether it is the Optional Protocol or the 

Substantive Protocol, that there is a real impact on the lives of ordinary Fijians.  That is what it is all 

about.  It has a real impact on how we dispense with, for example, justice, how do we sensitise our 

different organisations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So the Judiciary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, has a National Judicial Education Committee 

</span><span>which consists of senior judicial officers and they have organised a number of trainings with judicial 

</span><span>officers, including those on the magistracy  and,  of course, the High  Court  in gender training and 

training on how to handle vulnerable witnesses including children.  The UNDP now, through the 

Access to Justice Project, provides a lot of capacity building in this respect.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Under  section  295  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  which  we  had  actually  talked  about 

yesterday to an extent, there are now applications that can be made and I remember in the late 1990s 

and 2000 where it was quite rudimentary.  If you, for example, in those days, were a rape victim and 

you had across - the witness; the main complainant, and you would have the defendant or the accused 

person, you could make an application to the Court to have some type of screen put in front or in 

between the two, so the person would not actually feel compelled to say certain things, that they will 

not feel harassed, they will not feel they are in danger or compelled to say things that they did not 

want to say.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of  course,  now,  the  Judiciary,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allows  what  you  call,  ‘Closed-Circuit 

Television (CCTV) witness statements.  So you could have the Court here, the person who could be 

the child or the rape victim  could  be in  the other room, the sexual  assaulted person  and they, by 

CCTV, questions could be asked of them and they give evidence in that manner.  In some instances, 

</span><span>of course, the Courts now through application, can also allow for video recording of those statements 

</span><span>being given. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have highlighted and also as highlighted by the Honourable Minister for 

</span></p>
<p><span>Defence about the different provisions in respect of the Crimes Act itself.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Bulitavu highlighted the issue about the assessors which is 

a fairly new amendment that we were seeking yesterday.  This is critically important, to bring about 

the level of consistency, not just in decision making, but in terms of the development of jurisprudence 

in Fiji, pertaining to areas, such as pornography, sexual offences and human trafficking.  We have 

already prosecuted successfully two cases; one of human trafficking that happened domestically and 

one through cross-border purposes.  They were successfully prosecuted by the DPP’s Office.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In presenting the amendments to the law yesterday through the Bill, we highlighted the fact 

</span><span>that by removing the assessors from the equation, we will also be able to ensure that people who are 

</span><span>not as gender-sensitive or conversely, people who would not be bringing patriarchal notions of sexual 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span> Ratification of the Optional Protocol – CRC  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>relations of the differences between men and women, the ability of children to serve their elders and 

sometimes, of course, many elders do not know where to draw the boundary.  These types of issues 

will, of course, be addressed through those amendments that we are seeking.  There maybe some of 

you who may have spoken (as I was not here from the beginning) on the Child Welfare Act where 

there is compulsory reporting by doctors, et cetera. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The DPP’s Office, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also now has a Child Protection Division, whose main 

role is to conduct criminal proceedings against sexual and other serious offences committed against 

children or matters where children are the primary witnesses.  There is a particular Child Protection 

Guideline that, in fact, addresses those matters. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think just to round off, the other matter that I wanted to highlight (I think 

some  of  the  Members  have  already  stated  that)  is  that  sometimes,  many  of  the  victims  of  child 

trafficking or prostitution tend to be by those very people with whom the children have a deep sense 

of trust.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As we have seen repeatedly, we, of course, know of cases and the Honourable Minister for 

Women would have a lot of instances where children whom, in fact, have been sexually exploited or 

</span><span>being put out on the streets by their parents or their uncles or their grandparents, or they have actually 

</span><span>been exploited in a very unsafe environment at home and then end up on the streets.  These are social 

values issues that we do need to address and they are not necessarily very simple issues but they are 

complex issues.  Of course, technology now brings another adjunct to it where it needs to be dealt 

with another determining factor in this very complex area. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  are  the  comments  that  I  have.    I  was  very  interested  in  what 

Honourable  Tabuya  said  earlier  on,  that  they  are  wearing  green  because  of  their  belief  in  good 

governance at USP.  I am glad that you are finally seeing that there is lack of governance at USP 

because  that  is  precisely  what  we  have  been  saying  -  absolute  lack  of  governance  at  USP!    But, 

unfortunately, the green seems to be worn only by the female members of SODELPA and not the 

male members of SODELPA.  That means they do not support the good governance principles at 

USP.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  for  his  right  of  reply.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Question put. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Motion agreed to.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Just a note on this Protocol. When the Honourable Bulanauca, who is not 

here  at  present,  was  making  his  statement,  he  said,  “We  must  have  the  Holy  Spirit…”’  (he  was 

pointing his hand all over the place) “…not the evil spirit…” (and he happened to be pointing in my 

direction), “…otherwise I will call you satan.”  And I said something quietly which I will now divulge 

to you.  I just said, “Miti, old boy, it takes one to know one.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter)  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, we will move on.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, to move his 

</span></p>
<p><span>motion. You have the floor, Sir.
