<p>Generic Guideline – Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)(Question No.  16/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A. JALE asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity,  Industrial  Relations, 

Youth and Sports inform Parliament whether there is a generic guideline or requirement on 

Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) for all workplaces?</p>
<p>HON. P.K. BALA (Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations, Youth and</p>
<p>Sports). – Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I also thank the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer is very straightforward.  The Employment Relations Act 2007 

provides guidelines for employers and workers in the area of equal employment opportunities at all 

workplaces in Fiji. Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the eighth Oral Question for today.  I now call on</p>
<p>the Honourable Nagata to ask his question.  You have the floor Sir.</p>
