<p>Status of the 2020 Agriculture Census(Question No.  12/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment provide</p>
<p>an update to Parliament on the status of the Agriculture Census undertaken in 2020?</p>
<p>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY  (Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment).-  Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member and his colleague for asking this question.</p>
<p>Last year just before the Census started, we had given a Census Release Plan with exact dates 

on when we would plan and how do we plan to release the papers through the process, and that is the 

process which I am going to outline.  Unfortunately, it seems that Honourable Members probably did 

not watch that clip or read that particular plan.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, before that, please, allow me to 

enlighten this House, especially the  Honourable  Members on the other side,  on the details  of the 

Census process.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  we  are  all aware,  this  exercise was  carried  out  for the first  time everthrough  a  handheld  device  survey  solution  software  which  kind  of  sped  up  the  process  and  alsoallowed live feed of the data to our Head Office, the Census Operations Centre.  With this online 

system  in  place,  the  expectation  was  high  that  the  data  should  be,  of  course,  released  as  per  the 

timeframe that we released.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in doing so, we considered the scope of the coverage, the quality of the data 

collated  through  identification  of  outlays  or  possible  outlays  and,  of  course,  to  reduce  numerous 

human errors as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to share with this august House that our National Statistics Office, 

the Bureau of Statistics, conducted the Population and Housing Census in 2017 through this particular 

software and only managed to release the demographic findings this year.  So, they undertook this 

work in 2017 and then in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, so we are well ahead in terms of releasing the 

findings on a timely manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must admit that after the data collection period at the end of February lastyear,  we  started  the  compilation  of  the  data.    Our  team  worked  very  closely  with  the  Food  and</p>
<p>Page 72</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>Agriculture Organization (FAO) experts who were seconded to our office, but, of course, we were 

affected by the pandemic last year, but that did not really stop us from meeting the timeline.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have done the preliminary round of analysis, and I must say that we have 

got four Reports, so the report of the particular census is in these four parts or chapters.  The 2020 

Agriculture  Census  General  Table  will  give  you  the  general  descriptive  of  the  entire  survey  as 

surveyed  agriculture  households.    Then  we  have  got  the  2020  Agriculture  Census  Enumeration 

Boundary Report, then we have the 2020 Agriculture Census Gender Analysis and we will have the 

2020 Agriculture Census Administration Report.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are hoping that our submission will go to Cabinet, probably in the next 

sitting  and  then  from  there,  we  will  have  stakeholder  meetings  and  workshops  by  Divisions  as 

planned  towards  the  end  of  February.    So  by  the  end  of  February,  we  should  wrap  up  the 

consultations,  then  through  Cabinet,  we  will  table  the  Census  findings  in  the  March  Sitting  of 

Parliament.  That  was the plan that we had released last  year and that is  the timeline that we are 

following.  So official release to be shared with the National Statistics Office, again, at the end of 

March this year and then we will do a more detailed analysis with FAO of the data following that. 

So all the tables in these four sections will be released by end of March.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is just for the background.  We were able to capture 70,991 households 

with a total population of 300,861.  Some households have multiple farms in one household, so we 

recorded a total of 83,395 farmers in our details with 86 percent male and 14 percent female-headed 

households or female farmers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the process and timeline and we will adhere to it strictly, despite all</p>
<p>the challenges that we have faced.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Saukuru,  you  have  the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Can  the  Honourable 

Minister  inform  Parliament  whether  the  IT  company  (Pacific  Technologies)  had  facilitated  their 

agricultural census or was it appointed through the normal tender process?</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no idea about that IT company.  He should 

send the question later on, I will find out.  The question was about the timeline we expect to releasethe  census  data.    I  do  not  know  what  is  wrong  with  him  asking  about  some  kind  of  obscure  ITcompany.</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- You are quite right, Minister.  It has got nothing to do with the original 

question.  The supplementary question is related to the original question and that is completely out.  

We move on.</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- A supplementary question.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- What are you on the floor for?</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- I wish to ask a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>Page 73</p>
<p>432</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I will give you the opportunity for a supplementary question.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Can the Honourable Minister advise the House how much is the</p>
<p>cost of the survey and who paid for it?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I will let you handle that, Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether they go through the Budget, 

every time he is harping about the agriculture budget. There was money allocated in the Budget and 

we were also assisted with an allocation from FAO to meet the salary and expenses of the expertise 

from the FAO Office.</p>
<p>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- How much?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Radrodro, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the Honourable Minister 

for  the  update.  Just  a  supplementary  question;  in  talking  about  farmers  who  are  included  in  thissurvey, have you clearly demarcated the farmers onvakavanuabasis and the farmers on leaseholdbasis?</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a question on the land tenure system.  He 

is talking about leasehold land andmataqaliland, that should be able to capture that.  There is  a 

question. You can sort it out and do an analysis by that column and the result is there. In fact, one of 

the tables will present that â€“ the land tenure system. Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We will move on.</p>
