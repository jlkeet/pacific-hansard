<p><span>Current Economic Performance and Outlook for the Fijian Economy 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I rise to provide an update 

on the current economic performance and outlook for the Fijian economy and Government’s financial 

performance for the first six months of the 2020-2021 Financial Year, which is from August 2020 to 

January 2021.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are well familiar with the realities of the crises by now.  Due to this 

once-in-a-century COVID-19 pandemic, the Fijian economy is estimated to have had its largest ever 

economic decline of 19 percent in 2020, equivalent to a loss in GDP of over $2 billion.  This follows 

a marginal contraction of 0.4 percent at the end of the nine years of the consecutive economic growth 

that we have had (which was of course unprecedented).  

</span></p>
<p><span>We have recovered from ten figure hits to our GDP in the past such as </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, but what 

makes this crisis more painful is its uncertain nature.  The length of border closures is extending into 

</span><span>some of our more extreme forecasts, and the impacts of </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> as well as other disasters 

</span><span>(we have got one forecast now perhaps, to come at Category 1 at this point in time) have dealt us 

devastated blows at a vulnerable time.  Considering the damage done as well as the uncertainty ahead, 

our GDP is not likely to return to pre-COVID levels for, at least, the next three years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, business activity is down across most sectors.  The tourism sector remains 

the hardest hit.  Visitor arrivals in 2020 declined by 84 percent to around 147,000 visitors, similar to 

arrival levels during the 1990s.  Meanwhile, the numbers to start off 2021 mirror visitor arrivals in 

the  19th  century  and  without  the  economic  ripple  effects  of  tourism,  we  have  recorded  reduced 

demand and lowered activity economy-wide. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from  tourism,  overall  investment  activity  is  also  greatly  subdued.  

Apart from the slowdown in Government’s capital investments (for obvious reasons), some major 

construction  projects  have  also  slowed  down.    However,  the  new  tax  incentives  and  measures 

announced in the 2021 financial year in particular for the private sector, has buoyed domestic investor 

confidence.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  marked  double  digit  contractions  in  net  VAT  collections.    Weaker 

</span><span>consumer demand is also reflective of the near zero activity in the tourism sector and supply chain 

</span><span>disruptions, to some extent.  Weak demand has also seen inflation remaining in the negative in the 

last 15 months.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  inflation  has  been  negative  since  October  2019  with  January  inflation 

recorded at a negative 1.3 percent.  If we are stuck in this situation for months more or even another 

full year, we risk erasing much of the progress we have worked for years to achieve, as our economy 

slowly slips back in time and falls in size.  But even as the timeline for  reopening of borders has 

dragged on, another has accelerated.  Effective vaccines have been developed at an astonishing pace 

and they are demonstrably protecting populations from this pandemic. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we spoke on the urgency of procuring and rolling out COVID-

19 vaccinations.  Immunising our citizens alongside the developed world and ensuring our place in 

the  world’s  recovery,  are  our  top  priorities  in  the  near  term.    At  the  moment,  that  is  the  clearest 

</span><span>economic policy we can pursue and registration for vaccinations is the single greatest contribution 

</span><span>every Fijian can make to revive our economy.   Not only will it protect us and build confidence that 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>we can safely be part of the tourism industry’s global revival, but the biometric technology we are 

using to ensure vaccines are administered on a consistent medically sound timeline, will allow Fijians 

to travel around the world as well.  In short, it is the path back to normalcy and we must walk it 

together.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, labour market conditions have been fragile with over 100,000 jobs affected 

both,  in  the  formal  and  informal  sector,  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  COVID-19.    While  some 

employees have returned to work, many are still unemployed or on reduced hours and are receiving 

unemployment assistance through  the Fiji  National  Provident  Fund (FNPF) with  the Government 

backup.  So far, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of $206.7 million has been paid out to members.  Of this, 

Government  has  directly  paid  out  $94.5  million,  including  $30.6  million  from  the  COVID-19 

Response Budget and $63.9 million from the 2020-2021 financial year.   

</span></p>
<p><span>A total of $100 million is budgeted for this initiative in this financial year (2020-2021) which 

includes  the  $5  million  set  aside  for  retraining  and  reskilling  of  affected  employees  with  the  Fiji 

National University (FNU).  The FNU has provided a proposal for funding, which is currently being 

assessed by the Ministry of Economy and which will be rolled out very soon. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  note  that  Government’s  share  of  pay-outs  have  been 

</span><span>increasing since the start of this initiative. Under Phase 1, Government top-up accounted for only 

13.5 percent of the total payment, while under the recent round four of Phase 2, Government has paid 

out  around  80  percent.    Moving  forward,  Government  will  pay  the  bulk,  if  not  all,  as  members’ 

General  Accounts  get  depleted.      We  are  currently  reviewing  the  assistance  to  ensure  it  remains 

sustainable and at the same time, provide targeted assistance to those who are most affected.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the balance of payments’ front, foreign reserves remain at a comfortable 

level  of  around  $2.2  billion,  sufficient  to  cover  6.7  months  of  retained  imports.    This  has  been 

underpinned by a strong foreign reserves position prior to COVID-19 and the current low demand 

for imports and increased offshore borrowings by Government which more than offsets the decline 

in tourism earnings and the sluggish export receipts. 

</span></p>
<p><span>While  foreign  reserves  remain  comfortable  for  the  time  being,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need 

proactive and sustainable measures to address the underlying balance of payment challenges.  The 

export sector has to be enhanced, new foreign drive to investments enticed, the tourism sector rebuilt 

and, of course, diversified.  Much needed productivity improvements across the economy to regain 

its competitiveness is critically important.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Monetary  policies  stance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  continues  to  be  accommodative  with  a  large 

surplus liquidity of over $880 million in the financial sector, which will help keep interest rates low.  

Lower interest rates will play an important role in the long term recovery of the economy when credit 

risk normalises in a post-COVID-19 environment.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  financial  sector  continues  to  be  sound,  backed  by  the  strong  capital 

positions of banks.  The banks and financial institutions have also undertaken large amounts of loan 

provisioning to account for the increased likelihood of payment defaults due to the COVID-19 crisis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) is continually monitoring the situation and will mitigate the 

risk of cotagent effects to the finance sector, especially the non-bank financial institutions which are 

exposed to higher risks. To support those customers facing difficulties in loan repayments, financial 

institutions have agreed to provide relief with principle and interest repayment holidays until March 

</span><span>2021.  Government has also passed a new law through this Parliament to allow homeowners to have 

</span><span>increased access of up to 50 percent of their FNPF Reserved Account for home loan repayments.   

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements  

</span></p>
<p><span>371 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, economic recovery is largely dependent on the safe reopening of borders 

and  post-COVID-19  economic  recovery  strategies.  A  significant  number  of  fiscal  measures, 

including large tax cuts and regulatory reforms were announced as part of the financial year 2020-

2021 Budget.  These measures were designed to raise the competitiveness of the tourism industry in 

preparation for border reopening and to also incentivise domestic and foreign investments into the 

country.  More importantly, those measures were introduced to provide confidence levels in a period 

of  uncertainty  and  give  Fijians  access  to  goods  on  reduced  prices  to  ease  the  cost  of  living  and 

improve socio-economic conditions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the development of a vaccine, there is still a number of 

uncertainties  which  we  have  to  encounter.    For  example,  when  will  countries  or  which  countries 

would allow their citizens to travel freely?  When would borders fully open?  Which conditions will 

be placed on travel and what type of other additional requirements will be placed?  

</span></p>
<p><span>Given these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, growth in 2021 had been earlier projected to range anywhere 

around 1.6 percent  to  8  percent,  depending on the timing of borders’ reopening  and the potential 

number of visitor arrivals.  For 2022 and 2023, growth was expected to range from around 4 percent 

to 8 percent.  However, these projections are currently under review.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new projections will be released in the coming months as we get more 

certainty.  To give an example, if we get ourselves all vaccinated and if Australia is still vaccinating 

or they may say,  “If  you  go to  Fiji,  you still have to  come back and  be  quarantined”, but  maybe 

people from USA may get vaccinated, so we may get arrivals from USA.  So all of this can change, 

the segment in the tourism sector, which ones will be targeted, where will the source markets be - all 

those are very much up in the air and I am sure a lot of these can get resolved in the next few months.  

This is why we made the point yesterday, we need to be ready and all of us need to be vaccinated. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now also discuss about the state of Government finances and fiscal 

performance  for  the  first  half  of  the  2020-2021  financial  year.    The  Government’s  total  revenue 

collection  for  the  six  months  stood  at  $964.8  million  while  total  expenditures  amounted  to  $1.5 

billion.  This resulted in a net deficit of $545.8 million or 5.5 percent of GDP.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, total revenue for the six months was above the forecast by $107.3 million 

or 12.5 percent.  This is attributed to the higher than expected collections from both tax and non-tax 

revenues.  Tax revenue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was above the forecast by $26.7 million or 3.6 percent, 

while non-tax revenue exceeded estimated collections by $80.6 million or 64.2 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, total revenue collection of $964.8 million for the first six months represents 

around 57.7 percent of the annual projected revenue of $1.6 billion.  Based on this trend, we remain 

on track to realise the projected revenue collections for the 2020-2021 financial year and most likely 

surpass the forecast. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we compare these figures to the period prior to pre-COVID, it 

is  still  much  lower  than  that.    As  highlighted  in  the  last  two  Budgets,  the  COVID-19  crisis  has 

severely impacted Government revenue, as the tourism sector came to a standstill.  Business activities 

slowed down, trade flows declined and domestic demand plummeted.  Monthly tax collections since 

April 2020 have averaged around 50 percent lower than, of course, the same period in 2019 (those 

were pre-COVID days). 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the haemorrhaging of tax revenues, there is some outstanding 

</span><span>VAT refunds which FRCS is now playing catch-up on.  There is also some film tax rebates that are 

</span><span>also in arrears and we have now, for example, with the “</span><span>Survivor Series</span><span>”, a recent agreement where 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 13</a></p>
<p><span>372 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>they have very kindly agreed to have those rebates paid over a period of five years, and we can still 

get some production back into Fiji which will generate, as we know, a lot of jobs in the rural areas, 

all subject to the health protocol measures that need to be put in place. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the higher than budgeted non-tax revenue collection is largely attributed to 

the  one-off  grants  received  during  the  first  half  of  the  financial  year  related  to  COVID-19  and 

cyclones.  A total of $78.4 million has been received in the form of grants, the first half of this fiscal 

year.  The sources have been the European Union, Indonesia, Australia and the Asian Development 

Bank (ADB). 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of expenditure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, total expenditure for the first six months amounted 

to $1.5 billion, around $470.4 million or 23.7 percent lower compared to the forecast for the period.  

The total expenditure in the six months represents around 41.1 percent of the total annual budget.  

Compared to the same period, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, total expenditure for the six months is 

down by $195.6 million or 11.5 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>While Government has had a satisfactory fiscal outturn for the first six months in the financial 

year, fiscal risks remain for the second-half of the financial year, associated with natural disasters, 

</span><span>cyclones,  flooding  (we  still  have    up  until  the  month  of  April),  rehabilitation  of  schools  and 

</span><span>infrastructure, timing of vaccine acquisition and risks associated with contingent liabilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of financing, a gross borrowing of $2.75 billion was budgeted for 

the 2020-2021 financial year.  This included; $1.4 billion to be sourced externally, $940 million to 

be sourced from the domestic market and utilisation of around $400 million cash balance carried over 

from the previous financial year, which we had accumulated in a nice little deposit for the refinancing 

of the Global Bond.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms  of external financing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government  has, in  the first  six months, 

accessed a total of $530 million from the ADB and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).  

This includes; $424 million from ADB and $106 million from AIIB.   Currently, a total of around 

$710 million external financing is being finalised with the World Bank, ADB and JICA. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Preparations  and  discussions  for  these  loans  are  progressing  well  and  on  track  with  draw 

down likely in the coming months.  Other external loan-funded capital projects will continue to be 

drawn down, based on the rate of the project implementation.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, external 

financing budget for this fiscal year remains on track.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of  the  planned  $940  million  in  domestic  borrowings,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  has 

already raised around $193.8 million in the first six months of this fiscal year, based on the financing 

needs.    While  we  have  noted  some  tightening  in  the  domestic  market,  the  higher  than  budgeted 

revenue collections and potential expenditure savings will mitigate this.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Government debt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, stood at around $6.875 billion, equivalent to 69.5 percent 

of GDP; domestic debt at $5.095 billion, equivalent to 51.5 percent of the GDP; while external debt 

was around $1.78 billion, equivalent to 18 percent of GDP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may recall that Fiji had a downward trajectory  with regards to debt, 

which fell from 56.2 percent in 2010 to 43 percent in 2015.  Then came, of course, </span><span>TC Winston, </span><span>the 

rebuild from which drove up expenditure.  In fact, we endured 13 cyclones since 2016, 13.5 actually 

if you count </span><span>TC Bina</span><span>.  Still, we managed a prudent debt to GDP ratio through that period, but the 

</span><span>impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are further reaching than any single cyclone, or even 13 of them.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 14</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements  

</span></p>
<p><span>373 

</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike in the aftermath of the storm, revenues have also been repressed by this pandemic for 

months, while GDP is steadily in decline so, therefore, we have got a double whammy in respect of 

measuring the debt to GDP ratio.  With the budgeted level of borrowings for this fiscal year, the debt 

levels are projected to increase to around $8.3 billion or over 83 percent of GDP at the end of July 

2021.  A full 14 percentage points of that increase alone is attributed to the decline in our GDP.   

</span></p>
<p><span>External debt is projected to increase to 26.1 percent of GDP, while domestic debt is projected 

</span></p>
<p><span>at 57.3 percent of GDP.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Contingent Liabilities, stand at $1.45 billion, equivalent to around 14.7 percent of GDP.  This, 

of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir includes Government guaranteed debt of $832.9 million, callable ADB 

and World Bank subscriptions of $515.5 million and other implicit liabilities of $103 million.  There 

is also guarantees to FSC. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first six months of the 2020-2021financial year, revenue 

collections have been above its forecast, while expenditure trend is slightly lower than the forecast 

for the first  six months.  External  financing remains  on track.  While there  is  some tightening in 

domestic  financing,  they  will  be  offset  by  the  higher  revenue  collections  and  some  savings  in 

</span><span>expenditure.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, we remain on track as per the 2020-2021 financial year Budget. We know we have 

covered a tremendous amount of facts and figures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we can all expect that in the 

usual manner.  Hopefully, they will not be this time, turn into a political football by the usual suspects, 

regardless of the economic context of this pandemic.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But we want every Fijian to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who is watching, we understand what 

these figures really mean and we understand the state of our recovery.  We understand it means jobs 

for our people, we understand it means dignity and security, and that is why our economy’s revival 

is the most critical priority on our agenda.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That is why we are advocating so forcefully, to  secure vaccines now and roll them out as 

quickly as we can.  We need everyone to enlist in that national effort because the only way we can 

come out stronger from this crisis together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, (I am about to finish) is to be able to 

get on this agenda. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy has already started preparations for the upcoming 

</span><span>2021-2022  Budget,  which  will  be  announced  in  June  2021.    Cabinet  has  already  approved  the 

</span><span>financial  year  2021-2022  Budget  Strategy,  and  the  Ministry  has  met  will  all  the  Permanent 

Secretaries on last Friday, to provide an update on the guidelines for the formulation of the 2021-

2022 Budget.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We have started receiving submissions from the public.  We are also planning more of our 

online and face to face budget consultations, as well as a series of budget chat forums, where we will 

facilitate  an  online  conversation  on  the  state  of  the  economy  and  our  economic  recovery.    Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, we encourage all those interested to join us before we make the announcements.  Thank 

you.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank the Honourable Attorney-General for his 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As per the Standing Order, I now call upon the Leader of the Opposition or his designate.  I 

</span></p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Honourable Nawaikula.

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  I  wish  to  make  a  short  reply  to  the  Statement  given  by  the 

Honourable Minister for Economy.  Very clearly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been listening and we 

hope that the whole of Fiji and the media is listening to that Statement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The point is this, we are in an economic crisis but we need not be told, we already know about 

this.  The review from the Reserve Bank of Fiji in December has stated that all major sectors were 

operating very badly, including agriculture and fisheries.  The collection of VAT was down and we 

were told from the Government sources that they were in a crisis meeting.  The Government needs 

about $500 million revenue, to sustain itself in the month and we were drastically below that. And 

you know, because the Cabinet has said once or twice in relation to that, to discuss the way forward, 

and you cannot find a solution.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We know all those problems and we do not need to be told.  The challenge for us is to identify 

the problem so that we can achieve what the Honourable Minister has related to as our economic 

revival.  We need to identify what is the problem, and the problem is the Honourable Minister.  The 

problem is him, and I know that the Honourable Ministers will agree with me.  Let me clarify that, 

why he is the problem.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  his  problem  is  that,  he  decides  everything  by  himself,  he  does  not  take 

</span><span>advice, he does not rely to the experts, and that has been happening to this country since 2006 and 

that is how he speaks for themselves.  Before even coming to COVID-19, in 2017, our revenue was 

clear.  In 2018, it went down to $3 billion, in 2019, it went down to $2 billion ($1.6 billion) and the 

reason for that is, there is only one person on that side.  He does not even listen to all of you.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We do not have a planning office as before.  In Ratu Mara’s time, a planning office is really 

</span></p>
<p><span>important because that is where you have the extracts.     

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- That is the reason.  The Auditor-General will also support me.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- The findings of the Auditor-General in relation to the Ministry of 

</span><span>Economy is that, these were done </span><span>ad hoc</span><span>.  There is no procedure.  There is nothing there.  On the 

</span><span>audit, even on the aid from overseas, the Auditor-General says that the Ministry of Economy does 

not have a procedure.  Everything is </span><span>ad hoc</span><span>.  It is because that he does not rely on advice.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We need to change the Minister for Economy.  Obviously, there are other good people there.  

He has had 14 years now and we all know where he has taken us - down the drain.  He has sold all 

our assets - FEA, Fiji Ports, so what is left?  All these things were there from Ratu Mara’s time for 

our children but they have used it.  Not “they” but “him”.  So to identify the problem, the problem is 

the Minister because he does not take advice and you agree with me, I know.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- You have all agreed with me.  Honourable Ministers from that 

side all agree with me.  We need to change the Minister for Economy.  We need good ideas, we need 

</span><span>to listen to the experts who know how to take us through this. You should stop blaming COVID-19.  

</span><span>We should blame the problem and the solution is, let us have a new Minister for Economy.

<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Niko Nawaikula for his contribution to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party.  You have 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Economy for his update.  I think he has provided a generally fair report on the assessment of the 

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our economy and I think we need to look at where this crisis 

is going and how we can deal with it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I have to  say this, that while we have had a 19 percent  contraction, our 

economy was already in a contractionary mode, even before COVID-19.  I must say that some of our 

GDP figures, I have always suspected, were inflated and what that means, Mr. Speaker, is that our 

recovery  back  to  pre-COVID  GDP  could  take  three  to  five  years.    That  is  why  I  think  it  is  very 

</span><span>important for us to have a recovery plan, not for three years but for five years because the impact of 

</span><span>COVID-19 is very, very serious.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think a lot of people cannot imagine the impact this might have, not in the next two years 

but probably in the next five years.  When you have this kind of crisis, Mr. Speaker, if you look at 

crisis in the past, in the history around the world, there are three things that governments always do 

and target very, very specifically.  The Honourable Minister rightfully talked about reduce demand, 

weak demand - it is correct.  The problem in the economy is one of demand, it is not a problem of 

supply.  We have to look at how we can create the demand.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, even people who have income, even people who can spend are not spending.  

So it is not just people who do not have income but it is people who actually have income who are 

not spending because the expectation of what happens in the future determines what people do today 

and  people  expect  things  to  deteriorate  in  the  future.  The  natural  disasters  are  compounding  that 

further. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There  are  three  things,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  I  think  the  Government  ought  to  very,  very 

carefully plan in its recovery budget.  One, of course, is education.  When you have a crisis and when 

</span><span>you have hundreds of thousands of people looking for jobs, unemployed, under-employed, you do 

</span><span>not want to reduce the budget for education or curtail access to education in any particular way at 

any level.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think there are people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who would have lost jobs, who would want free 

training, who would want to go back to university.  We must make sure that whatever we do, if we 

have to cut budget of the government in other areas, we put money into education.  We put money 

into the schools, we make sure that parents actually get supported because when we support education 

in that way, there will be income space for parents and the society as a whole, to spend somewhere 

else.  When you spend in education, you are actually creating demand in the economy.  It helps the 

economy.   I am very upset Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am very surprised that the government in its last 

Budget tried to curtail accessibility to TELS loan.  I think we should open up as they did in 2018.  

This is the time to open up the floodgate for our students to get into tertiary institutions and to schools. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The second thing we need to ensure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is health.  We must make sure that we 

</span><span>have panadol, diabetes tablets and basic medicine in all the health centres and hospitals around the 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>country because that is where the poor are going to spend their money, if it is not available.  If you 

provide them there, then they have money to spend somewhere. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you put money into the pockets of those in the lower income, they spend 

almost all of it or more than 90 percent of it.  You put money into the pockets of the rich, they are 

holding  it  back.    I  know,  we  had  duty  reduction,  why  would  they  want  to  give  $40,000  in  tax 

concession to a businessman who can already afford to buy a $200,000 land cruiser?  We must make 

sure that we put money right now into the pockets and hands of the poor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The third thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is we need to look at how we can support income and what 

the Government  has right  now in terms  of income support is  not enough.  There are hundreds of 

thousands  of  people  who  cannot  access  FNPF.    That  is  why  I  am  saying,  any  external  financing 

source must factor in how much money we can get to put into the pockets of the people.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For the next two to three years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to look at those three sectors.  We 

must  make  sure  that  our  recovery  package  is  based  on  those  three  things;  support  for  education, 

support for health and income support for the middle class and below, because that is the surest way 

in which we can create demand in the economy.  That will have a ripple effect, it will have a multiplier 

</span><span>effect, it will help us grow our GDP, it will help increase our revenue because when people spend, 

</span><span>VAT collection will go up and money actually goes back to the Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think the Government needs to cut its expenditure.  Why do we have 10 or 11 Assistant 

Ministers?  They can live on $50,000 now. We cut that expenditure and put every dollar that we can 

save  from  Government’s  excessive  expenditure  into  hospitals  and  health  centres.    The  hospitals, 

Honourable Minister, do not have panadol! They do not have panadol, so you should concentrate on 

that.

<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- The Speaker will tell me, not you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- You put panadol and diabetic tablets in the hospitals, 

</span></p>
<p><span>that is your job. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude, we need a five year 

</span></p>
<p><span>recovery package.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Put panadol and diabetic tablets in hospitals. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party for his 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate. 

</span></p>
