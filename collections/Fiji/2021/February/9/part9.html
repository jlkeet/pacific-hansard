<h3>PARIS DECLARATION ON THE INTERNATIONAL SOLAR ALLIANCE – 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That  Parliament  approves  that  Fiji  accepts  the  Amendments  to  the  Framework 

Agreement  of  the  Paris  Declaration  on  the  International  Solar  Alliance  (ISA)  of  30th 

November, 2015. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 22</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>381 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.-  I now invite the Honourable Attorney-General  to  speak to  his  motion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.    I  will be  very brief in my 

introductory  remarks,  as  this  particular  Amendment  to  the  Framework  for  the  Agreement  was 

actually sent to the Committee which has fully endorsed the ratification to the Amendment to the 

Framework Agreement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just very quickly, by way of introduction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the International Solar Alliance 

(ISA)  was  officially  launched  through  the  Paris  Declaration  by  the  Indian  Prime  Minister, 

Honourable Sir Narendra Modi, and the French President, Honourable Sir Francois Hollande, at that 

point in time at the margins of the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) in Paris. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The ISA aims to provide a dedicated platform for cooperation amongst solar resource-rich 

countries where the global community, including bilateral and multilateral organisations, corporate 

organisations, corporate industries and other stakeholders can make a positive contribution to assist 

and help achieve the common goals of increasing the use of solar energy in meeting energy needs of 

prospective alliance member countries in a safe, convenient, affordable, equitable and sustainable 

</span><span>manner. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, there is a need to also harmonise, not just this technology but also 

the solar finances and the innovative capacity across all the different countries.  Fiji, of course, with 

its framework and its objective in respect of doing as much as possible in the mitigation space, our 

target of net zero initially by 2050 and, of course, our Honourable Prime Minister, in the COP 22 in 

Marrakesh in Morocco in September 2015, deposited the Instrument of Ratification during the 5th 

Meeting of the International Standing Committee of ISA in New Delhi.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these amendments actually now cater for a wider group of people and a 

number of parties and a number of members to this particular Agreement and, therefore, we seek the 

ratification of that which we are  glad  that the Committee  has  actually  agreed to.  Thank  you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion.  Honourable Minister 

</span></p>
<p><span>for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources, you have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to stand in support of the 

motion that is before the House, supporting the Amendment that Fiji be part of this Amendment on 

the Framework Agreement for the International Solar Alliance (ISA). 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji has been a member of this organisation for some time and it has been born out of the 

leadership of the Honourable Prime Minister in terms of issues relating to climate change which, in 

turn, has led to calls around the world for us, as a planet, to move more towards renewable energy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In Fiji’s case, the ISA has been something that has been very useful to us.  As the Honourable 

Attorney-General has pointed out, the ISA was initially conceived to be an alliance of those countries 

that are within the two tropics because they have a lot of sunshine but now is being opened up to all 

the member-countries of the United Nations so it gives an opportunity for all the parties that want to 

move this agenda for renewable energy to become involved in this phase. 

</span></p>

<p><span>382 

</span></p>
<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>In Fiji’s case, we have particular targets to do with renewable energy and that is, we should 

be approaching 100 percent renewable energy by the year 2030, which means moving more of our 

power-generation away from fossil fuel and more towards hydro and solar.  We have seen over the 

past few years that there has been a lot of investments into hydro.  Now, we need to ram up the issues 

around getting more solar into the ground in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As has been pointed out also, as of September 2019, this Framework Agreement had been 

signed by almost 80 countries, but only six had ratified it.  This new Amendment that we are talking 

about here, the Framework Agreement of the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance 

has  already  been  ratified  by  12  countries.    Ratifying  the  Amendment  Framework  will  provide 

furtherance  in  Fiji  to  continue  establishing  networks  and  develop  synergies  with  ISA  member 

countries  and  partners  to  help  achieve  Fiji’s  efforts  in  a  sustainable  and  targeted  manner  for  the 

energy sector. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The ISA provides opportunities for member countries to access their technical programmes 

within  ISA  which  includes;  scaling  solar  appliances  for  agriculture  use  -  using  solar  mini-grids; 

scaling rooftop solar and scaling solar e-mobility and storage.  All of these things are very important, 

especially for island countries like us and I think, very importantly, it allows us access to their three 

</span><span>cross-cutting programmes which includes: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>affordable finance because this is always going to be a big challenge in terms of putting 

the solar system into any country and getting the finance for it; 

online information and communication platform; 

capacity building; 

standardization; and research.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Ratifying the amended Framework Agreement will additionally reinforce Fiji’s commitment 

towards climate change and reiterate Fiji’s demonstration of climate change leadership.  Thank you, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Bulitavu, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion which is before the 

House  and  I  thank  the  Committee  for  completing  that  Report  and  agreeing  in  consensus.    The 

importance of this Framework Agreement on the Paris Declaration of International Solar Alliance 

</span><span>was first brought in by the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC) in 2015 and, again, 

</span><span>signatures were open for the Framework in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2016. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The importance of this great alliance was the brainchild of the Indian Prime Minister, Mr. 

Narendra Modi, who had brought this up and also how that benefitted us.  I think there is an ongoing 

programme currently in our Government’s National Policy in terms of our Barefoot College and also 

a  big  arrangement  of  technical  help  and  assistance  to  encourage  and  upskill  our  rural  people  in 

moving into renewable energy, moving away from fossil fuel. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think the effects of climate change in Fiji, as we all know, most of the main energy lines are 

</span><span>down after any cyclone or depression or any other climate or weather change that affects us.  So, one 

of the greatest needs that arise is energy and I think solar is the way forward and it really helps people 

who live in rural areas and those in urban areas to stay connected in terms of charging their mobile 

phones, lights, et cetera, that are used for household activities. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 24</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>383 

</span></p>
<p><span>This is a very important Agreement and also the domestication of this.  The various measures 

that come with it and also other technical aspects of this Agreement will come in the funding that 

will help us especially as a vulnerable country to climate change, given our ability to adapt to changes 

brought to us today, given the effects of climate change.  This is something that we can use to mitigate 

and also adapt to what we are currently facing. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Those are some of the things I would like to share, our view from the rural community and 

also the people out there on how they will actually benefit after we agree to this. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Bulitavu  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Aseri Radrodro, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  just  want  to  join  my  fellow 

colleagues in thanking the Committee for having a bipartisan report on this motion.  After hearing 

everything that has been mentioned, I just want to request updates, once we adopt this Amendment, 

in terms of the capability and the resources that we have on the ground.  Do we have the resources to 

start implementing this solar project, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 

</span></p>
<p><span>I will give an example.  When we visited Vio Island which is one of the beneficiaries of the 

programmes of DiCaprio Foundation, when we visited the villagers, their houses were installed with 

solar which is part of the COP 23 succession, but they had limitations in terms of the usage of solar.  

They could not fully utilise the electricity in their homes - they could only use it for light which is 

what had been allowed for them to use when the solar was installed.  If they have further requests to 

use the fridge or television, they will have to request the provider to be given the ‘okay’ to use solar 

power for other things, apart from the lights.  Those are some of the experiences that we found out 

when  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  did  a  follow-up  on  the  solar  installation  at  Vio  Island  in 

Lautoka, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, it is always a huge funding requirement to install solar as a 

start-up capital  and to  do it on a commercial basis,  I think it is  going to cost  millions of dollars.  

Whether the Government  or the EFL  will be able to  assist  villages or the companies that will be 

conducting  this  exercise,  together  with  the  Government  on  an  independent  power  producer 

arrangement or PPP arrangement, is something that this House will probably need to be advised of 

and informed once we ratify this Agreement.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Radrodro.  Honourable Minister for Defence, you 

</span></p>
<p><span>have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute and, 

</span></p>
<p><span>of course, support the motion and thank the Committee for the work they have undertaken.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I rise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, having been a member of the Presidency Team for COP 23 and also 

as the Minister responsible for rural development, where such new innovations and technologies will 

be very helpful for us, not only in terms of honouring our commitments, particularly our international 

commitments as per the Paris Agreement, but with sustainable development as well in our rural Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  definitely  we  need  these  new  technologies.    On  the  issue  raised  by  the 

Honourable Radrodro, I know that even for now, with the Rural Electrification Programme under the 

Ministry for Infrastructure, we do provide lights only for the communities, but there are avenues as 

</span><span>well in which we can expand.  That basically means more panels and, of course, storage capacities 

</span><span>as well, particularly on batteries.   

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 25</a></p>
<p><span>384 

</span></p>
<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The good thing is that, technology keeps improving.  I just noted very lately that there is a 

new  generation of batteries coming online now,  that will address most of the issues in the initial 

technology  and,  of  course,  once  we  have  access  to  that,  it  will  bring  a  lot  of  benefit  to  our 

communities.  Not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the good thing is that, as technology improves over 

time, costs are getting lesser.  That is perhaps beneficial for us when we want to access those new 

technologies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On  our  commitments,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  had  cyclones  recently,  climate-induced 

disasters  and  this  is  why  we,  as  with  vulnerable  and  developing  countries,  want  to  develop  and 

progress.  We also need to be mindful of the fact that we need to be clean in terms of our energy use 

and, of course, access such technologies that will support our commitment, particularly as the first 

country that ratified the Paris Agreement and our role, not only globally but in the region.  We need 

to be leading by example as well and that is why such commitments need to be honoured and we also 

need to live by it.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The work of the Climate Champion is very much involved in the implementation of the Paris 

Agreement.  It is about the new innovation, it is about the new technology and how this technology 

can be shared, particularly with developing countries.  I had the opportunity to visit the ministry in 

</span><span>India way back in 2017 on a Climate Champion meeting.  I was surprised to see that India has a target 

</span><span>to reach by 2022, to provide 220-plus (I do not have the actual figure) gigawatts of power by solar 

energy.  Of course, for us, perhaps it is only megawatts that we will need.   

</span></p>
<p><span>When I was in India in 2017, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had already achieved about 60 gigawatts 

of power generated through solar.  I hope that through the membership and through the partnership, 

we  will  access  the  benefits  of  the  technical  programmes  and,  of  course,  it  helps  us  as  well  in 

qualifying for funding because of the partnerships that we have.  I very much look forward to perhaps, 

a few megawatts in Fiji.  Vanua Levu perhaps, needs a lot of this new technology, as well our outer 

islands.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On rural development benefits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had discussions with one of my former 

schoolmate recently.  He came from New Zealand on holiday recently and he wanted an ice plant on 

his island. In our discussions, I suggested to him why an ice plant when we have new technologies 

now and I was referring to, “all that you will need now is solar energy, with battery storage.  You can 

go straight into refrigeration, cold storages through solar energy generated by solar and you do not 

need ice plants.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  terms  of  economising  but  at  the  same  time  addressing  our  development  needs  and  fast 

</span><span>tracking the programmes, particularly in the agriculture sector or the primary industry sector, as I 

always and often mention in this House, agriculture and fisheries products are perishable.  When it 

loses  its  quality,  it  loses  its  value  and  the  rural  communities  in  Fiji,  once  they  have  more  of  this 

technology, they will contribute more into the economic growth and the development of this country 

and at the same time the economic empowerment of our people.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I fully support the motion before the House and I look forward to the day in which we will 

</span></p>
<p><span>have more of this through the partnerships that we have with our key partners.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution to the debate.  I give 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor to the Honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.  You have floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on solar energy.  

</span><span>As explained by the Honourable Ministers, it is  quite critical to our nation in terms of renewable 

</span><span>energy targets as a replacement to fossil fuel.  I commend the initiatives on solar energy. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 26</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>385 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  2018,  just  prior  to  the  Elections,  I  was  on  Beqa  Island.    There  was  a  quite  intensive 

preparation and also installation going on just before the elections.  I commend the Government on 

that, and the time was probably related to the elections, but I see that it really benefited the people in 

terms of lighting, especially the students and also in relation to that, there was no power generation 

in terms of diesel on the island.  It was quite a critical alternative. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other issue in terms of solar is the battery.  There is one or two villages had quite outdated 

batteries and that is probably an issue which the Ministry needs to review in terms of solar energy 

and the storing of power in terms of the usage of solar.  I understand it is great to have these kinds of 

international  agreements  and  protocols,  et  cetera,  with  not  only  this  particular  one  but  also  with 

international renewable energy organisation overall. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of the National Development Plans (NDP), I suppose the question is how does this 

contribute or can we look at monitoring and evaluation and how does these kinds of international 

arrangements  impact  on  our  overall  targets?    In  terms  of  renewable  energy,  does  some  of  the 

strategies set in place implement, research, data collection, investment identification programmes to 

accelerate  renewable  energy  share  in  electricity  generation,  net  metering  for  small  companies  or 

households to feed excessive electricity from renewables and economically justified, Fiji interact of 

</span><span>pricing  network,  undertake  start  and  development,  independent  power  producer  framework  and 

</span><span>establishing  transparent  process  for  procurement  of  new  lasted  capacity  from  independent  power 

producers.  The question is, to what extent has this been achieved, in terms of our renewable energy 

targets?   

</span></p>
<p><span>There is the issue about the number of Nabou Biomass and we made a visit there, the Standing 

Committee on Economic Affairs.  When we made the visit, it was not operating, some of the issues 

relating to that is the supplier of biomass material.  There was an arrangement with regards to planting 

biomass material beside the plant, but that somehow did not come through.  I suppose that is the 

independent power producer which we need to relook at.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the moment, it is still there, but not operating and I am urging the Ministry to relook at 

that in terms of the supply of biomass.  If the Ministry could partner with the Provincial Councils in 

terms of looking into a logistic arrangement on the supply of biomass from the nearby provinces of 

Nadroga, Ba and even, Serua.  The biomass, especially on waste biomass materials which are not 

useful or considered as invasive species such as African tulips. 

</span></p>
<p><span>That is some of the solar targets we have there, solar number of areas, annual targets 15, up 

</span><span>to 2022, 2017 to 2022 and then we have renewable energy in electricity generation which is from 67 

</span><span>percent up to 81 percent in 2020.  Renewable energy in solar energy consumption which is supposed 

to be related to what we are discussing today, 13 percent in 2015 to 18 percent in 2020.  The number 

of solar home systems installed is 2,500 per annum up to 2021 and 2022.  It would be good to assess 

the  impact  on  this  particular  types  of  initiatives  on  our  annual  targets  in  terms  of  our  National 

Development Plan. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I, again support the motion at hand, given the importance of renewable energy to our nation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau for his contribution to the 

</span></p>
<p><span>debate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There being no further wishes to take the floor, I give the floor to the Honourable Attorney-

</span></p>
<p><span>General for your right of reply. You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members for their support for Fiji to ratify this amendment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker. Sir, just some of the points or the issues that were raised by some of the speakers 

but very interesting, we are talking about renewable energy and one thing I just noticed earlier on 

this morning, looking across the table and talking about renewable energy, we are talking about green 

and it is interesting that all Honourable Members across on the other side are wearing green today - 

Honourable Kepa, Honourable Qionibaravi, Honourable Radrodro, Honourable Tabuya, and this is 

completely a coincidence that I am also wearing green. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue about Vio Island, Honourable Aseri Radrodro raised the issue 

about how they need to get permission because it is a centralised system.  When you have standalone 

solar systems, obviously you know what the capacity is. When you have a centralised system with 

battery  operation,  then  you  cannot  just  have  one  person,  for  example,  fixing  the  entire  big  deep 

freezer, et cetera, which will actually be to the detriment of all the other users.  So it is a community-

driven centralised system where people need to know exactly what energy requirements are there.  

So there is nothing negative about that, but it is also about community sharing.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just in respect of that, I just wanted to highlight as a result of that Vio Island 

</span><span>programme, we have already identified five other sites that will actually be electrified through solar 

systems  and  these  are  very  remote  areas.  There  is  one  in  Sawaieke  Village  in  Gau,  Lomaiviti;  

Yadrana Village in Lakeba, Lau; we have one in Nabuyanitu Village in Navosa; the Bainimarama 

Primary School which is very remote in Noikoro, Navosa;  we have one in Nagado, Ba; there is a 

particular  village,  Dridrisina  Settlement  and  this  actually  will  be  at  a  cost  of  FJ$1.8  million  and 

completely funded by the UK Government. When you have these types of projects and  you have 

these pilot projects that are run well, it needs to be administered well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>An NGO that is working with us in respect of these projects.  People need to also contribute 

towards these centralised systems of solar energy provisions because they need to have a stake in it. 

In  areas  where  people  are  just  simply  given  this  system,  they  do  not  actually  look  after  the 

infrastructure at all, so they need to be able to contribute towards that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The issue about these types of agreements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Honourable Minister for 

Defence,  National  Security  and  Policing,  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 

Management  highlighted  that  access  to  finance  is  critically  important.  When  you  belong  to  these 

international treaty framework member countries, then you are able to access finance and  you are 

</span><span>able to fund these projects.  Of course, Fiji like many of the other Pacific Island countries, do not 

</span><span>have vast tracts of land that can simply be given away where solar panels are put everywhere.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We do not have that sort of vastness of land but we have what we call photovoltaic projects. 

The one that we are talking about now which is being funded through the Green Climate Finance, 

including some  funding  by the Fiji  Development  Bank  and also  by the Koreans is  what  we have 

talked about this in this Parliament which is going to be carried out in Levuka.  So, you will actually 

have  the  solar  panels  on  top  and  then  you  basically  have  your  agriculture  below  that.  It  is  better 

utilisation or optimum utilisation of the land.  

</span></p>
<p><span>With those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank everyone for their support and as 

has been stated by all the other Honourable Members, we need to take advantage of this and we need 

to be clever about it.  It is not only giving people access to electricity which they do not enjoy, it also 

has the double whammy effect, in the sense that it also reduces our carbon footprint by accessing 

</span><span>renewable energy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.
