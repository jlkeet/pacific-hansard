<p>Groundwater Boreholes - TC Yasa and TC Ana(Question No.  13/2021)</p>
<p>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 

Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  the  impact  ofTC  YasaandTC  Anaon  the 

groundwater boreholes in Bua and Macuata?</p>
<p>HON.  J.  USAMATE  (Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and 

Mineral Resources).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our country has been devastated by these cyclones and we 

know that a lot of our people have been affected in terms of their sources of water.   Most of our 

people in the country get water from surface water. There is quite a few that get their water from 

groundwater and the Mineral  Resources Department  within  the Ministry  has the  responsibility  of 

looking after these groundwater sources.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the cyclone, the Ministry put together a team of around eight technical 

officers who were deployed to the North to carry out the damage assessments and also to attend to 

the  repair  works  and  the  maintenance  of  existing  boreholes  and  their  reticulation  or  distribution 

systems. They had to deal with damages, such as broken pipelines, damaged solar panels, the roofs 

of the pump houses were blown away and broken controllers.</p>
<p>In total, they looked at 14 boreholes, 11 of them in Bua and the other three in Macuata.  InBua, they included the Ratu Emeri Primary School, Navasua Government Station, Kiobo Village,</p>

<p>Waisa  Village,  Nasaisaivua,  Wailailai,  Natokalau,  Raviravi,  Navatu,  Kubulau  District  School  in 

Kubulau and the Lekutu Government Station.  They looked at three other sites in Macuata, including 

Navukebuli, Qelemumu and Yaro Village on Kia Island. So, these were the areas that they had to 

repair the boreholes and also the reticulation systems or distribution systems.   All those boreholes 

were repaired and water restored in nine villages, one settlement, two schools and two Government 

stations which benefitted slightly below 900 people.  Other than labour costs, it cost the Ministry 

slightly above $50,000.</p>
<p>Apart from the 14 boreholes that were affected, the teams were also deployed to small islands, 

such  as  Yadua,  Druadrua  and  Kia  Island,  to  conduct  borehole  assessments.  While  flushing  the 

borehole, for instance, at Yaro Village on Kia Island, they noted a lot of debris inside the borehole. 

They put a camera down and they found two-metre wooden logs in the middle of that borehole.  So 

I  had  to  discuss  it  with  the  village  elders  and  they  have  decided  to  decommission  that  particular 

borehole to avoid any health issues that might arise from people drinking the water.</p>
<p>We are currently now organising another team to conduct more groundwater assessment post-TC Anain the next few weeks, to ensure that those who do drink from these boreholes have access 

to water.  On Saturday I was in the island of Galoa. They had to re-establish that submarine pipeline.Unfortunately, the pipeline is broken again, so one of the things that we have to do now is to re-establish their submarine pipe cabling that is bringing water across from the mainland to Galoa.  In 

the meantime, there is a borehole there, so we are trying to get that borehole running again just to 

make sure that the people on the island can have access to some safe water. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on. For the fifth Oral Question for today, I</p>
<p>give the floor to the Honourable Salote Radrodro to ask her question. You have the floor, Maâ€™am.</p>
