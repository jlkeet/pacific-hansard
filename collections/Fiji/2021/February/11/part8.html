</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - 2017 Audit Report on the General Administration Sector - 

Standing Committee on Public Accounts 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Mr:</span> Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Committee’s  Review</p>
<p><span>Report on the 2017 Audit Report on the General Administration Sector.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Report  covers  the  audit  results  of  all  Government  Ministries  and  Departments  listed 

under the General Administration Sector. This is the second volume of the five volumes that were 

referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The Report shows the financial performance of the various Ministries and Departments that 

were covered under this Sector and the audit issues identified at the time the audit was conducted.  

The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  had  issued  audit  opinions  on  23  Financial  Statements  of 

Ministries  and  Departments  in  the  General  Administration  Sector  for  the  2016-2017  Financial 

Year.

<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  in  its  communication  to  the  Ministries  and  Departments,  requested  for 

updates  on  the  progress  that  they  have  made  in  implementing  the  audit  recommendations,  and 

actions taken to address the issues that were identified during the time of audit. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  important  to  note  that  Ministries  and  Departments  that  were  scrutinised  by  the 

Committee  were  not  invited  for  an  interview  because  of  the  COVID-19  restrictions  that  were  in 

place at that time, but were requested instead to provide written responses on the audit issues that 

were raised in the Auditor-General’s Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  fact,  there  are  matters  that  still  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  recommendations  and  the 

Committee’s observations for the audit issues identified within the 23 Ministries and Departments 

for  the  2016-2017  financial  year.  Out  of  these  23,  17  Ministries  and  Departments  were  provided 

with unqualified audit opinions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Of some  concern, however, was the six Ministries and  Departments  which were provided 

with qualified audit opinions. The qualified audit opinion report emanated from issues ranging from 

unsubstantiated  and  unreconciled  general  ledger  account  variances,  accounting  irregularities  in 

account  balances,  non-disclosure  of  account  balances,  board  of  surveys  either  not  carried  out  or 

carried out but losses were not approved or not recorded as losses to Government, as stocktaking 

was not carried out.     

</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, the Committee identified and highlighted that capacity building is an inherent 

issue  with  accounting  officers  who  lack  basic  fundamentals  skills  required  for  reconciling  and 

maintaining  accounts,  lack  of  basic  financial  reporting  trainings,  lack  of  monitoring  and  clear 

supervision by Manger Finance and Senior Management.  

</span></p>
<p><span>This  Report  contains  a  few  recommendations  and  observations  made  by  the  Committee. 

These recommendations have been made in good faith and we urge the relevant party to which the 

the  general 

recommendation 

recommendations made to the various Ministries and Departments are as follows:  

</span></p>
<p><span>to  consider  and  respond  accordingly.  Some  of 

</span></p>
<p><span>is  made, 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

<p><span></span><span>

<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Ministries  giving  grants  to  ensure  that  the  OAG  audits  the  entities  that  receives 

Government grant;  

</span></p>
<p><span>Annual Reports should be requested as part of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for 

Chief Accounting Officers for the various Ministries and Departments; 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministries and Departments to also consider gender budgeting; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministries  and  Departments  to  provide  annual  updates  and  achievements  on  funds 

appropriated for the National Development Plan (NDP) and Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs) related programmes and projects. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition  to  the  above,  the  Committee  also  endorses  the  following  recommendations  to 

</span></p>
<p><span>address the audit issues that were raised: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Ministry  of  Economy  should  increase  staffing  and  resources  in  their  Internal  Audit 

Division  in  order  to  be  able  to  conduct  (quarterly  and  bi-annual)  internal  audit 

inspections to all Ministries and Departments;

<p><span>Ministry of Economy should conduct regular and timely training for Financial Officers 

on  Financial  Management  Information Systems  (FMIS)  and ensure that the system  is 

compatible with the actual operations of the Ministries and Departments; 

</span></p>

<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Earlier  in  2020,  the  Committee  had  visited  SCGF’s  Headquarters  in  Lautoka  to  better 

understand its functions and operations. The Members met the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and 

his team and were provided with a comprehensive presentation on the mandate of the organisation 

and the progress that have been made over the years. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members  of  the  Committee  were  made  aware  of  the  substantive  internal 

reforms  that  had  taken  place  over  the  period  of  the  Report.    This  was  done  to  ensure  that  the 

internal policies and procedures align with the mandate of the organisation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>During its meeting with the SCGF Team, the Committee was pleased to note that our sugar 

industry  has  received  various  forms  of  support  from  international  bodies  such  as  the  European 

Union,  to  assist  towards  cane  planting  programmes.  The  Committee  strongly  believes  that  such 

initiatives  will  take  the  industry  forward,  and  encourages  SCGF  to  continue  to  explore  similar 

opportunities  with  other  international  development  agencies  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the 

sugar industry. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee noted that South Pacific Fertilizers Limited (SPFL) is a subsidiary of SCGF 

with  SCGF  holding  92.6  percent  shares  and  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Council  (SCGC)  holding  7.4 

percent.  During the period of review, SPFL had borrowed funds for procurement of raw materials 

for supply of Government-subsidised fertilisers to farmers.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee noted that  all borrowings had been repaid  as  at  31st December, 2017 and 

commends  the  Fijian  Government,  SCGF  and  SPFL  for  ensuring  reliable  supply  of  fertilisers  to 

farmers.  Furthermore, while the Committee appreciates the introduction of Bundled Insurance in 

2018, it believes that SCGF should explore other non-covered areas, such as natural disasters.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to all stakeholders for their 

valuable  input.  The  Committee  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  CEO  of  SCGF  and  his  team 

members for being prompt in answering the various queries and questions raised by the Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 

produced this Report - the Deputy Chairperson, Honourable Veena Bhatnagar; Honourable George 

Vegnathan;  Honourable  Inosi  Kuridrani  and  Honourable  Ro  Filipe  Tuisawau.    I  also  take  this 

opportunity to thank our parliamentary staff who had given us invaluable support.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Review Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>of the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2009–2018 Annual Reports to Parliament.  

</span></p>
