<h3>AMENDMENT TO THE 2021 PARLIAMENT SITTING CALENDAR</h3>
<p><span>AMENDMENT TO THE 2021 PARLIAMENT SITTING CALENDAR  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I move:</p>
<p><span>That  Parliament  adopts  an  additional  sitting  week  of  Parliament  from  17th  May, 

</span></p>
<p><span>2021 to 21st May, 2021. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak on</p>
<p><span>his motion.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  LEADER  OF THE GOVERNMENT  IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as all 

Honourable Members may be aware, Standing Order 22(1) states that the Business Committee must 

recommend to Parliament a programme of sitting periods for each session of Parliament or each 12-

month sitting period of Parliament, whichever is the shorter.  Standing Order 22(3) further provides 

that  on  being  adopted  by  Parliament,  the  sitting  programme  operates  subject  to  any  decision  of 

Parliament to the contrary. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  such  regard,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Business  Committee  convened  and  undertook 

discussions  on  a  proposed  additional  sitting  week  in  the  month  of  May.    The  rationale,  for  the 

information  of  all  Honourable  Members,  Parliament  on  Tuesday,  8th  December,  2020,  approved 

the  Sitting  Calendar  for  the  year  2021,  a  proposal  which  had  been  agreed  to  at  the  Business 

Committee  Meeting  on  26th  November,  2020.    At  that  same  meeting,  members  of  the  Business 

Committee raised their concerns with respect to the high number of Committee Reports that were 

pending debate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>After much deliberation on the issue, the Business Committee agreed to dedicate a special 

sitting to debate and clear all the Committee Reports, and the sooner the better, so that Parliament 

could  ensure  that  the  debates  on  the  Reports  would  still  be  relevant.    The  special  sitting,  Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  would  mainly  focus  on  clearing  all  the  pending  Committee  Reports,  as  Parliament 

does not wish to have reports spilling into different years, as it has become evident in some of the 

parliamentary  debates that issues have become highly politicised, as opposed to  focussing on the 

contents  of  the  Reports.    As  of  to-date,  Parliament  has  a  total  of  75  Committee  Reports  that  are 

pending debate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  commend  the  Standing  Committee  for  the  extensive  work 

undertaken  to  produce  those  Reports  but  at  the  same  time,  Parliament  has  an  obligation  to 

undertake and complete debate on those 75 Reports, as well as the others which would be tabled in 

the March and April Sittings.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is pertinent that Parliament approves 

the additional sitting week from 17th May, 2021 to 21st May, 2021, to clear all those Reports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I wish to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the special sitting week will not deal with the usual 

pertinent parliamentary business, such as Questions, Bills, et cetera, but that it would only focus on 

debate on all the Committee Reports which are pending debate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to put on record that there were no objections from 

the members of the  Business Committee and, therefore,  I  plead with  all  Honourable Members to 

approve the proposed additional sitting week.

commend  this  motion  to  Parliament  and  I  hereby  seek  support  from  all  Honourable  Members  to 

approve the proposed additional sitting week of 17th May, 2021 to 21st May, 2021, to be included
