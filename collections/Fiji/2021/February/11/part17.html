REPORT 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move:</p>
<p><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  review  of  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  2017 

</span></p>
<p><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 13th May, 2019.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  now  invite  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social</p>
<p><span>Affairs to speak on his motion.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the University of the South Pacific (USP) is a non-

profit educational institution.  It was established under the Royal Charter 1970.  The USP also has 

the  Pacific  Technical  and  Further  Education  (Pacific  TAFE)  to  provide  alternately  pathways  to 

higher  education,  as  well  as  the  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  (TVET) 

Programmes. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The core functions of USP is to deliver quality education that enables its graduates to inherit 

knowledge, skills and abilities to effectively and sustainably address the social and economic needs 

of the Pacific region.  The University also has a mandate to undertake research that is relevant to 

the  region  and  supports  policy-level  dialogue  and  decision-making  that  affects  the  lives  of  the 

Pacific people.

<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee,  upon  referred  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  2017  Annual  Report 

invited  its  senior  officials  on  Tuesday,  19th  March,  2019,  for  a  public  hearing.    During  this 

meeting, Officials from the University enlightened the Committee on: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span> its new income streams; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)  

</span></p>
<p><span>the  lead  role  in  engaging  with  member  countries  and  finding  solutions  on  major 

development  challenges  in  the  areas  of  education,  climate  change,  oceans,  marine, 

renewable energy, public administration, digitalisation, gender and health; and  

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)  

</span></p>
<p><span>how the University’s overall operations are aligned to the Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs), and the measures that are being taken to progress the SDGs. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific’s  achievement  of  the  year  was  the 

graduation  of  4,182  people;  2,425  females  and  1,757  males.    Many  of  those  graduates  were 

Government  employees,  who  immediately  began  to  contribute  to  their  country’s  development.  

Other  new  graduates  look  for  or  created  new  jobs.    Graduates  with  disabilities  proved  that  with 

support and determination, challenges can be overcome. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank you for the opportunity.  Thank you Sir.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion</p>
<p><span>and I now give the floor to the Honourable Viliame Gavoka.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to touch on some of the 

recommendations  by  the  Committee.    The  first  one  says,  “The  University  must  ensure  prudent 

financial  management  in  its  operations,  for  example,  in  the  recruitment,  appointment  and 

employment  of  its  staff  and  the  compliance  of  its  operational  activities  to  the  financial 

administration  and  management  policies  that  uphold  best  practices.”  That  is  Recommendation 

Number  1,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Recommendation  Number  5  says,  “The  University  to  better 

coordinate with the Department of Immigration for visa extensions…” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  you  read  Recommendation  Number  1,  the  Committee  is  saying 

virtually  that  it  needs  to  ensure  prudent  financial  management,  especially  the  recruitments, 

appointment  and  employment  of  its  staff.    This  is  the  Committee  of  this  Parliament  making  this 

recommendation.  When you look at the USP saga that is very much in the news, it is very much 

related to the human resources element at the USP.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  this  BDO  Report  and  this  Report  had  highlighted 

anomalies  in  the  human  resources  at  USP,  and    this  was  the  crux  of  the  matter  that  led  to  the 

debacle that has led to what we have today. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  know  what  the  Professor  Pal  was  trying  to  do.      The  Council  had 

commissioned  this  BDO  Report  which  appeared  to  have  not  been  made  available  for  general 

consumption.  And here we have a situation where this particular gentleman was bundled out of the 

country  because  he  was  trying  to  attend  exactly  to  what  the  Committee  is  recommending  in  its 

Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The other side is saying that there are other things involved in all these, and let us hear them 

- outline and clarify exactly what it is. We wanted to debate on this issue on Monday, we wanted to 

ask some questions on this but we were not allowed to.  So, it is good that today we have this, that 

</span></p>

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>569 

</span></p>
<p><span>we  can  hear  what  it  is  that  has  been  a  mystery  to  most  people  but  only  clear  to  the  FijiFirst 

Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Do not waste your time, Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of concern to Fiji. I read this article in 

the </span><span>Fiji Times </span><span>yesterday or the other day where (I think) the Honourable Minister for Economy was 

saying, “We do not have any crisis at USP.”  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.:</span> In relation to the deportation, yes.</p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- He said, “We don’t have any crisis at USP.” And here is Professor 

Pal, saying only yesterday, “It is my belief that if I need to move to Samoa to run the University, 

we will make it work.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> And FijiFirst is saying, “Where is the crisis?”</p>
<p><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- This is the Head of the University with the support of the Council 

saying, “I can move to Samoa”.  He is saying it!  And the FijiFirst Government is saying, “There is 

no crisis.” 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, be that as it may, there is a crisis at USP and the FijiFirst Government is trying</p>
<p><span>to tell this country that there is no crisis and that they are in the right.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It is interesting here that says, “... the University to better co-ordinate with the Immigration 

Department.”  Of course, as you know, a representative from the Office of the Prime Minister sits 

in  the  Work  Permit  Committee  in  the  Immigration  Department.    I  actually  feel  sorry  for  this 

gentleman that everything was stacked against him, Mr. Speaker.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>HON. V.R.  GAVOKA.-  I  have been reading  commentaries from within  the region,  from 

New Zealand and  Australia and all they are saying is that, Fiji tends to lose out of all this debacle.  

And  here  we  are,  FijiFirst,  burying  its  head  in  the  sand  and  saying,  “Nothing  like  that  is 

happening.”  There is even talk of countries in the Pacific relocating their students away from Fiji 

to other universities.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> Can you believe that? They are saying, “That is okay”.</p>
<p><span>You did not start the USP?  You were born yesterday.  You just came yesterday.  The USP 

</span></p>
<p><span>is the pride of the Pacific, it is the pride of Fiji.

<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-   You clowns are now saying that  you  can take  it away:</span> I mean,</p>
<p><span>that is what you are saying. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> You are unbelievable!</p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have never met a bunch of clowns like the ones</p>
<p><span>I am seeing now in the FijiFirst.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. V.R. GAVOKA.:</span> People tried for so long to make the USP work and here  you are</p>
<p><span>saying, “We will withhold the $30 million and let them go to wherever.”  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. R.S. AKBAR.:</span> No!</p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is exactly what you are saying, “We will withhold whatever 

millions dollars and then they can go wherever.”  Can you imagine the attitude that we are seeing 

here, Mr. Speaker?  

</span></p>
<p><span>Let  it  be  made  very  clear  today.    SODELPA  will  do  everything  possible  to  keep  the 

integrity of USP the way it was meant  from  the beginning.   Let  that be very  clear today.  Let  the 

whole of Fiji know that.  SODELPA will preserve USP in its entirety.  SODELPA will do that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we met  with  the Supervisor of  Elections and his  team  last  week and he 

said,  “The  earliest  for  elections  may  be  July  2022  and  the  latest  may  be  January  2023”.    I  think 

everyone  is  keeping  their  fingers  crossed,  please,  make  it July  2022.    We  want  these  people  out.  

The sooner we get them out, the better. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  tragedy  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that,  while  they  are  neglecting  this  problem  at  the 

USP, other players in the region are trying to move USP away.  They have been distracted by what 

is believed to be the protection of their own people within USP.  That is what is being alleged here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish that the approach could be more mature, more responsible in 

the  spirit  of  keeping  the  Pacific  community  intact.  I  do  not  know  if  they  know  that  back  in  the 

1970s,  the  Pacific  Community  used  to  operate  under  ‘The  Pacific  Way’.  This  was  Ratu  Sir 

Kamisese Mara, this was the way he set things up.  Today, Mr. Speaker, the Pacific Islands Forum 

(PIF) is disintegrating under the watch of FiijFirst.  Four or five countries have pulled out of PIF. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="73">Page 73</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>571 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  It  is  because,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  way  they  have  neglected  the 

relationship in the Pacific; they have neglected it.  In the past, as you may remember, Mr. Speaker, 

Fiji hosted the Forum here and it was the understanding that Fiji would not put up a name for the 

Secretary-General.    Other  island  countries  would  have  it,  Fiji  would  host  the  Forum.  That  is  the 

way  Ratu  Sir  Kamisese  Mara  set  it  up,  that  is  the  way  the  Community  worked,  the  Pacific  way.  

The problem with FijiFirst is they cannot keep a relationship, nurture it or develop it, they cannot 

do  it.    Everyone  they  come  into  terms  with  falls  by  the  wayside.  That  is  the  problem  with  the 

FijiFirst Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish that we leave USP and the Council to do their work.  Let the 

chips fall where they fall.  If Professor Pal says we need to do this, the Council needs to throw all 

these  out.    Do  it,  let  the  chips  fall  where  they  fall.    Not  all  these  reports  of  the  Honourable 

Attorney-General trying to insert himself into the process at the USP and trying to undermine the 

Council  of  Ministers.    I  mean,  this  is  reported  widely  in  the  country.    Can  you  just  pull  back, 

people, and respect the integrity and the independence of USP.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I hope I am not having a dialogue with the deaf here. I hope people can hear 

what I am saying and protect what is so precious to us - USP.  That is something that we all want to 

keep in Fiji, Mr. Speaker.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The people are watching.  The repercussions, if USP falls apart, is huge in many ways, Mr. 

Speaker.    So,  please,  FijiFirst,  you  are  in  the  driver’s  seat  now  for  a  while  until  July  when  the 

people of Fiji are going to throw you out, but just try and hold things together.  Do not destroy what 

others have built with sacrifice over the years.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Gavoka:</span> Honourable  Usamate,  you  have  the</p>
<p><span>floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving us one of the clowns the space 

to speak today.  I was not going to speak because I think we have diverted from what we are talking 

about in terms of this Report.  But on the first recommendation, this side of the House completely 

agrees with this recommendation, that the University must ensure prudent financial management in 

its  operation,  for  example,  in  the  recruitment,  appointment  and  employment  of  its  staff  and  the 

compliance  of  its  operational  activities  to  the  financial  and  administration,  management  policies 

that uphold best practices.  This side of the House completely agrees with that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- We completely agree with it:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you have an organisation like the university, 

you have a Council, as a Government we only operate in the Council. We do not go and dilly dally 

in all the operational activities in the institution, just like as you do for any other company.

<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>If  you  are  looking  at  the  integrity  of  recruitment,  et  cetera,  I  think  the  other  side  of  the 

House is just talking what the Professor who has just left is talking about.  But if you read today’s 

paper, this is a group of academics at USP talking about some of the things.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Government Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> This is in today’s paper. Let me just say some of the things that is</p>
<p><span>here. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject)  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  just  reading  an  article  from  today’s 

newspaper, these   group of academics at  USP in  writing in  one of the paragraphs here, they say, 

and I quote from today’s </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“When  he  took  office,  the  University  budget  was  in  a  strong  financial  position 

and had achieved resounding success in the achievement of international accreditations 

for its programmes…” 

</span></p>
<p><span>International accreditation is not an easy thing to do. Anyone that has worked in an institute 

tertiary learning knows that.  Washington Accord and all of these accords, they are not easy things 

to do, and it take you years to build an institution to be able to get that.  So that is what it is saying 

here in today’s </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“When he took office, the University budget was in a strong financial position 

and had achieved resounding success in the achievement of international accreditations 

for  its  programmes  and  was  attracting  considerable  investment  from  international 

funding agencies for its research.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  University  is  now  in  financial  trouble,  not  least  because  of  the  lack  of 

confidence  arising  from  the  constant  internal  divisions  that  Professor  Ahluwalia  has 

created and promoted.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am a graduate of the University of the South Pacific.  It is a great University, it has produced a lot 

of people in this room who are graduates - Members on both sides of the House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Including you too, Honourable Member, all of us.</p>
<p><span>We want that University to make sure that it can deliver the best.  The governance is good, 

the  management  of  finance  is  good  and  everything  is  good.    Profession  Ahluwalia  has  done  his 

report and you have been convinced by that report. But what happened to the report that was done 

by Mr. Mahmood Khan  the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee.  What happened to that 

report?  If we want to talk about good governance and finance, let us get everything on the cards 

and talk about it.  Do not just listen to one person talking.  Do not just be convinced by what comes 

on social media.

<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>573 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We need to dig and get to the bottom of it.  This side wants USP to 

work well, to work within its mandate, we want it to have a good leadership and that is what this 

side of the House will continue to work for. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Honourable  Member  was  talking  about  the  selection  of  the  Secretary-General  for  the 

Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), but what the Honourable Member does not know is that, 

when they were looking at the selection of the candidates for a Secretary-General, there was only 

one country in the Pacific that did not push for its own candidate.  That country only pushed for the 

most meritorious person to be awarded this position. Why?  Because we are in the middle of great 

troubles in the Pacific now.  We have climate change, we have all of these things happening around 

us.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We have seen a lot of the regional plans that we wanted in the Pacific have not been brought 

to fruition - the Pacific Plan, and all these things.  They come up and they disappear.  So, what is 

Fiji pushing for?  Let us go for the most meritorious person to fill this role.  That is what we want 

too.    Every  other  country  was  pushing  for  its  own  candidate.    Fiji  took  a  principle  stand.    Our 

principle stand is, let us go for the most meritorious and as a result of that, when the other countries 

did not go ahead with that move, we decided to withdraw our candidate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  is  what  Fiji  stood  for.    Fiji  stands  for  regionalism,  this  side  of  the  House  stands  for 

regionalism.  This side of the House stands for a strong University of the South Pacific with good 

leadership and good financial management.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Usamate:</span> I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Leawere.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir.  I rise to speak on the Report of the 

Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the 2017 Annual Report of the University of the South 

Pacific  (USP).    From  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  the  Members  of  the 

Committee for this Report, and also all the staff and students of USP for keeping the pride of our 

regional university intact which is, unfortunately, not the case now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The University of the South Pacific, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has a unique setup of 12 nations in 

partnership for higher education for their people, and USP empowers Pacific States to achieve what 

is so profoundly expounded in the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN Agenda 2030, which 

was captured by the Charter of USP more than 50 years ago. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  institution  of  higher  education  has,  perhaps,  played  a  more  defining 

role in the decolonisation and development of the Pacific States than this institution.  It has been the 

engine room of our region and the testimony of our bondage as an ocean of many nations, sharing 

similar needs and wants.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, anything that happens at USP is not only a 

public or institutional issue, but a regional matter of concern. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji, as the home of USP, should be more concerned than the rest of the nations as we have 

a  responsibility  to  enable  the  University  the  necessary  freedom  and  scope  of  work  with 

independence which was there before and is compromised now with the suppression of the BDO 

Report and deportation of Vice-Chancellor Ahluwalia last week.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue that the Report fails to expound is the amount of debt owed 

by the Fiji Government in terms of loans and scholarships our students have taken to attain higher 

education at USP.  The Government must come out clean on these fees which are in arrears.     

</span></p>
<p><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has been known as the comforter but the biggest 

hypocrite  when  it  comes  to  the  implementation  of  the  ideals  and  principles  of  good  governance.  

That is now proven by its all-out efforts at USP to bar the coming of the BDO Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I challenge this Government.  Assuming that the year under review is part 

of the BDO Audit Report, it should bring the Report to the public limelight, if there is nothing to 

hide.  It is not their money but taxpayers’ funds involved here and they have every right to know 

and question about it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Fourthly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  alluding  to  the  question  of  the  safety  and  security  of  our 

academics  and  students  at  USP,  given  the  midnight  arrest  and  deportation  of  Vice-Chancellor  

Ahluwalia, it becomes important that we discuss about the safety and security of those who teach 

and learn there.  That may not have been a grave issue then as it is, but now it has been aggravated 

by this Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me refer this House to the message by Mr. Winston 

</span></p>
<p><span>Thompson on the last paragraph, which I would like to quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The  staff,  students  and  the  communities  in  USP’s  12-member  countries  have 

</span></p>
<p><span>brought us a long way from humble beginnings.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have come a long way, indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 1970 and it is sad to say, we have 

shattered  our  humble  beginnings  by  riding  roughshod  over  the  happenings  at  USP.    Despite  this 

humble beginning, USP will lose its member countries due to the recent  deportation of the Vice-

Chancellor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that short contribution to this debate, I must say that we must make 

every effort to restore the pride of USP in Fiji as in the yesteryears and bring those guilty offenders 

related  to  financial  management  to  the  courts  and  secure  our  lecturers  and  students  there.    This 

seems to be the distant goals under this Government, but I call upon the people of Fiji to achieve 

that by their ballots in 2022.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Leawere for his contribution to debate:</span> I give</p>
<p><span>the floor to the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services.   You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just want to make a short</p>
<p><span>contribution to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  again,  we are looking  at  this Report which was for the  year  2017 and  I 

completely agree, I mean, a lot of us here have had some interactions at USP.  I spent a year at USP 

and I found it very useful.  Having said that, we all are very interested in the future of our children 

and my  younger brother and sister, as well as my daughter went to USP, so it is an institution of 

learning that we completely support.  We want the best for the University.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We are also to be mindful of the fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that things that were being discussed 

from  the  other  side,  many  of  us  here  would  have  been  overseas,  either  schooling  or  working 

overseas, and there is  a particular work permit  and that work permit  has its rules and regulations 

and the Minister or the Ministry responsible deals with that. That was dealt appropriately through 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>575 

</span></p>
<p><span>that pathway.   As you kept on saying, there has to be a separation of power.  The separation of the 

authorities that exist within the State, the Executive Arm, Parliament of the Legislature and also the 

Judicial System.  And if we are questioning the work of one part of the Arm of the State, like we 

have  seen  over  the  last  few  days  in  the  discussions  that  had  been  happening,  then  that  is  not 

actually strengthening what we want to continue to do as a young democracy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  also  want to  say  at  this juncture, that there is  a lot of people listening 

here  today  who  may  not  have  gone  to  USP  and  they  have  contributed  very  widely  to  the 

development of this nation.  Most of those frontliners who are looking after us, go into quarantine 

for  28  days  and  after  they  spent  14  days  with  their  children,  many  of  them  never  went  to  USP.  

They  went  to  FNU,  TISI  Sangam  and  the  University  of  Fiji.    Those  institutions  also  deserve  our 

respect and recognition.  Are we saying that USP is the only institution in this nation that can bring 

out doctors, nurses and engineers?  If it is, then all of you on the other side are blind.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Those frontline workers are listening here tonight will tell  you that FNU has done a great 

job  and  so  as  the  University  of  Fiji,    and  the  TISI  Sangam  has  done  a  good  job  and  the  Central 

Queensland University when it was here, so that is something that we must remember.  We want 

the  best  for  our  children  because  ultimately  at  the  end  of  the  day,  they  are  our  future  and  that  is 

what this Government wants.  It wants this institution to be stronger and better.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to finish with this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a sovereign nation.  The decisions 

by the Micronesian nations, they are their own sovereign decision, we had nothing to do with it.  I 

can also tell you this, that having been in WHO, having been in the Pacific Minister’s meeting of 

Health, I can tell you that we disagree many times.  We do not agree on everything, every Minister 

here will tell you.  It is not as rosy as you may think.  There are times that we disagree, and there 

are  times  when  the  Micronesian  nations  take  their  stand.    There  are  times  when  the  Melanesian 

nations take their stand, and the Polynesian nations take their stand.  If you think the Pacific way is 

actually  all  rosy,  it  is  not.    We  have  our  own  differences  and  we  have  to,  because  we  are  all 

sovereign nations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.:</span> They  have  taken  a  sovereign  decision,  Honourable</p>
<p><span>Gavoka, and that is their sovereign decision. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-    We  respect  their  decision,  they  have  taken  a  sovereign 

decision, but  does it mean that we take away our sovereignty because of them?  No, it does not!  

Fiji has to make its own sovereign decision and our children who are at USP will judge us on the 

sovereign decisions we made.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate:</span> I</p>
<p><span>give the floor to the Honourable Tuisawau.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion 

at hand, particularly the recommendations which have been read out by our Honourable Members 

in terms of prudent management, good governance, and also I note that highlighted up to page 15

<p><a name="78">Page 78</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>of the Report  is  good  governance  and the  governance structure of the University.   I also  note on 

page 109 of the Annual Report staff costs in terms of Academic and comparable staff, and we have 

been discussing today about USP regarding relocation and some Honourable Members on the other 

side are encouraging that. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.:</span> No, we are not!</p>
<p><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  In  terms  of  the  crisis  at  USP  which  they  are  saying  is  not  a 

crisis, there was just a recent statement by the Samoan Prime Minister, Mr. Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele 

Malielegaoi, 100 percent willing was what he said to make the move from Fiji happen.  Samoa is 

referred in the region as the leading player when it comes to national issues in the Forum and the 

family as a whole.  This is the view of a national leader, I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“Many  big  organisations  have  actually  left  Fiji  in  a  similar  fashion.    I  think 

Samoa must take the lead when regional issues surface that will compromise the mutual 

benefits and interests of all forum countries.”    

</span></p>
<p><span>He cited Samoa’s track record, et cetera, and he stated:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“Fiji’s  unstable  political  history  and  perceived  military  strongmen  culture  is  well 

</span></p>
<p><span>documented”.   

</span></p>
<p><span>This is the Prime Minister of Samoa, Tuilaepa today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>“Evidenced  by  multiple  military  coups  over  the  years  that  has  undermined 

democracy  in  the  country,  the  historical  actions  are  comparable  to  those  committed 

against Professor Pal.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>From Dr. Sitiveni Ratuva, an Academic in New Zealand, who said and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“They  still  have  a  military  regime  kind  of  mentality.  When  they  run  out  of 

options,  they  just  go  for  what  they  know  which  is  the  force  or  some  semblance  of 

force.  I am talking about international leaders and Academics.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  relation  to  the  Financial  Report  and  the  issues  being  mentioned  on  good  governance,  I 

think the fundamental problem here is that, the other side of the House cannot accept that Professor 

is a whistleblower. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  You  have  a  whistle-blower  policy  in  all  organisations,  for 

example,  FIRCS,  et  cetera,  so  why  do  you  not  accept  what  he  reported?    Is  it  because  some  of 

whom he reported  are part of  your FijiFirst Party?   That is the fundamental explanation.  Let me 

share some of what he has highlighted and which happened throughout this Annual Report, and that 

is why they are highlighting those issues. 

</span></p>
<p><span>If  you  look  at  the  recommendation  on  human  resource  management,  recruitment  policies, 

remuneration needs to be streamlined and that is exactly what Professor Pal had raised and there are 

various reasons,  up to  nine or ten, which he has  highlighted.   Let  me just highlight  one which is 

relating to  the former Vice-Chancellor when he applied for Professional  Development  Leave and 

then that was not supposed to be granted because it was less than 24 months away from his end of 

contract.        The  other  thing  is,  he  claimed  for  per  diem  which  was  not  allowed  under  the 

</span></p>
<p><a name="79">Page 79</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>577 

</span></p>
<p><span>Regulations and that was approved by Pro-Chancellor, Winston Thompson.  That is the issue here 

because everything is intertwined. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There was another case regarding a particular staff who is no longer there, but who has now 

been taken in by the FijiFirst Government into the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Board (TSLB) 

as a Board Member.  His contract was not renewed by USP.  He was first appointed at USP in 2009 

at Grade 5/Level 6 and offered a three-year contract later through the Appointments Committee and 

he requested a job title change to Manager and then the title changed to CCE Manager.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Then he was appointed again to Band 2/Step 1 of the professional level scale. A 12-month 

contract was issued from 1st April, 2011 to 31st March, 2012 as direct appointment, not advertised. 

Was  there  any  Appointments  Committee?    Again,  contract  renewed  to  move  to  a  renewable 

contract.    Note,  that  direct  appointment  is  converted  to  three-year  renewable  without  any  normal 

recruitment process, so this is what we are talking about here in terms of what is happening at USP.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In September 2012, his salary moved up to $69,258 and several increments, and there was 

another letter issued approving a monthly allowance of $3,600, indicating that a job evaluation had 

been recommended, but none was done.  No job evaluation, there was no record of that and then he 

was appointed as Director.  There is no evidence of approval of this title change and no evidence of 

the post of being Director created and that was not even advertised.  This is what we are trying to 

emphasise here. His salary within the time I am specifying had moved from $28,174 to $138,700 

within six  years, without following the procedures and he  was  getting more than the professorial 

scale, so that is what we are trying to highlight.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  various  other  cases.  There  is  another  relating  to  a  Manager 

Payroll.  This  person  was  appointed  and  salary  was  at  $58,066  and  during  the  period  of  review, 

made representation directly to the Vice-Chancellor, without going through the line manager.  This 

person  was  provided  an  allowance  and  received  back  pay  of  $63,000,  claiming  that  she  was 

performing higher duties. I mean, I am just highlighting some but there are various other cases.   

</span></p>
<p><span>What  I am  saying is  that, Professor Ahluwalia  is  a whistle-blower, who exposed all  those 

irregularities. What is the role of Pro-Chancellor, Winston Thompson and the Deputy Chair of the 

Audit and Risk Committee, Mr. Mahmood Khan, who was appointed to that Committee?   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Deputy Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee is a New Zealander (I do not know), 

but  he  came  to  Fiji  and  is  probably  related  to  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Economy.  He  was 

appointed  to  that  particular  Committee  and  all  they  did  was  block  the  investigations,  and  this  is 

documented.  I  am  not  talking  out  of  thin  air.  This  is  documented  in  a  summary  by  the  Manager 

Assurance  and  Compliance  and  reported  to  the  Council  for  interference  and  restrictions.  

Investigators from the Assurance and Compliance Unit were denied access to records because the 

Pro-Chancellor, Winston Thompson, instructed that his approval was required.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Pro-Chancellor dictated how the investigation on Professor Ahluwalia’s allegations was to 

be conducted and was communicating with the person being investigated, so the whole thing is a 

mess.    It  is  just  compromising  the  investigation  and  this  is  not  only  from  Professor  Ahluwalia’s 

report, it is also confirmed if you read the BDO Report.  It confirms a few of the things which had 

been mentioned, so misleading Council members.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The case of the person who is now appointed by the FijiFirst Government to the TLSB, his 

contract was not renewed.  He applied for a promotion based on that he had achieved a PhD, but it 

was found out later on that his thesis was a student’s who had reported to him.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Go  outside  and  say  that:</span> What  you  are  trying  to  say  is  a</p>
<p><span>pack of lies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That was what was reported.  What I am trying to say here is 

that, the whole circle of whistle-blowing and obstruction to investigation is linked to Professor Pal 

Ahluwalia’s deportation because he was supposed to make a report and then he was deported.  He 

was issued with three different letters based on Section 13 of the Immigration Act and probably on 

the  plane  (I  am  not  sure),  issued  with  a  warrant  of  detention  to  the  Commissioner  of  Prisons  to 

detain him, and  then a removal order signed by Mr. Yogesh Karan.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what  I am saying is that the whole USP saga is really  a sad situation in 

which our country has  reached.   If  you also  look  at  the way they were detained, or the way they 

were arrested and deported, it is totally very un-Pacific. Here, they are talking about Pacific unity.  

You  only  read  about  those  things  in  the  Middle  East,  maybe  in  Lebanon  or  Iraq,  moving  into 

someone’s house at midnight, detaining them and rushing them to the airport at 120 kilometres an 

hour and putting them on another plane.  What is our country coming to? That is what I am trying 

to ask? Are we in a democracy? Are we in a dictatorship?  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Prime Minister, you need to tell us right now where are we moving to with this 

kind of abuse in the process of law, and they were not even given due process to respond or to get a 

lawyer and that is the situation right now.  They need to answer to that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  terms  of  the  governance  of  USP,  their  actions  is  worse  than  what  is  happening  at  the 

Pacific Forum -  you are breaking up USP.  Not only that, the repercussion has also gone into the 

Pacific  Islands  Forum.  You  will  recall  after  the  2006  </span><span>coup</span><span>,  Sir,  what  happened?    Fiji  was 

suspended  by  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  and  what  did  they  do?    They  formed  the  Pacific  Islands 

Development  Forum  which  is  still  there  and  if  you  look  at  our  budget,  we  are  still  funding  it.  

Where are the development funders who are supposed to fund it? They have removed themselves. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.:</span> Because they do not believe in that regional organisation which</p>
<p><span>was created by the FijiFirst Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  is  the  situation,  Sir,  regarding  USP.    I  urge  the  Government,  please,  refrain  from 

moving to total dictatorship.  We are going into an election and refrain from deporting people in the 

middle of the night or arresting them. We, as a nation, seriously!  But some of you are laughing, but 

for our citizens it is a very disturbing thing.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Even some of the officers who went there took photos and that was on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> - Professor 

Pal Ahluwalia sitting there, they were surrounding him and he was not dressed up properly. They 

even followed his wife into the bedroom and they were observing her while packing her stuff. What 

are the women on the other side saying about the treatment of Professor Ahluwalia’s wife in terms 

of her dignity? 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Get your facts right.  It was a female Immigration Officer:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Her dignity was  totally downgraded that evening:</span> They  were</p>
<p><span>also reports of bruises…

<p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.:</span> … so I do not know what is the next step here.</p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  yes, it is a glossy report but  within the period of this review and before 

and after all those things were happening, culminating on what happened to Professor Ahluwalia, I 

urge the leaders on the other side - look at yourself, look within your heart, is this the right way our 

nation should be going or not?  It is not, because that is not the way we, Pacific Islanders, should be 

acting - the way it was dished out to Professor Pal Ahluwalia that night.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Tuisawau  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister Reddy, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I just want to make a very short contribution but</p>
<p><span>before that, if you look at this, this about the USP 2017 Annual Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Members from the other side said that we should not interfere with USP’s 

internal operation matters.  But look at them and look at their contributions - they are talking about 

promotions, salaries, increment, individual detailed university matters. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  are  getting  another  investigation  report  and  reading  it  out  page  by 

page without talking about 2017 USP Annual Report.  This is the calibre of Members we have on 

the other side.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, university is an institution of higher education -</p>
<p><span>USP, FNU and University of Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary objective of universities is three-folds - teaching and learning, 

research  and  publication,  and  consultancies.    Consultancies  may  be  about  20  percent,  40  percent 

teaching  and  learning,  40  percent  research  and  publication.    Universities  are  the  place  where  we 

have got experts - authorities in different fields.  Experts who are expected to undertake research 

based on scientific methodology and publish it, subject to peer review. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  university  academics  are  required  to  publish  an  internationally  ranked 

journal  in  their  respective  areas,  whether  it  is  science,  social  science,  arts,  law,  et  cetera.    If  you 

look  at  the  2017  Annual  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  say  the  USP  academics  have  done 

remarkably  well  in  terms  of  undertaking  basic  subject  matter  and  disciplinary  research,  and 

publishing  ranked  reference  journals.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  missing  is  the  link 

between research and policy making.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  governments  throughout  the  Pacific  require  very  close  interactions 

between  researchers  and  academics  and  policy  making,  so  that  our  policy  making  is  sharp.  

Whenever  we  put  out  an  announcement  about  a  particular  policy,  or  about  a  particular  Bill,  the 

university  academics  in  the  respective  areas  are  expected  to  at  least  hold  panel  discussions, 

symposiums, conferences, or debates so that we can get a consensus view from the campuses.    

</span></p>
<p><span>These  are  the  experts  out  there  who  we  are  required  or  supposed  to  supplement  but 

unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  see  a  very  limited  number  of  this.    In  fact,  I  have  not  seen 

debates and the last debate I know or I was involved in, was the debate on the National Minimum

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Wage at FNU Campus.  I was one of the debaters and also a Professor of Economics from USP – 

we hardly see debates.  Debates are where you hold a particular position or view, you debate it out 

with someone who has an opposing view. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how many panel discussions we see in our days on critical policy issues? 

How  many  seminars  we  see?    Quite  a  bit  but  we  see  is  the  lack  of  interactions  between  policy 

makers  and  research.    I  must  commend  the  researchers  at  FNU,  USP,  University  of  Fiji  for 

undertaking research and publication but I think they can do more by ensuring that the findings that 

they have done, particularly with respect to problem solving research so that we can utilise that and 

make sharper policy making.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  the  place  where  new  knowledge  is  created  and  no  country,  no 

society can progress without backing from the people, authorities and experts who are supposed to 

create  new  knowledge.    And  every  university,  FNU,  University  of  Fiji  and  USP  is  creating  new 

knowledge on a daily  basis. They  published  general  articles, monographs, book chapters,  articles 

and it is quite encouraging to see these young people, professors, academics at the University of the 

South Pacific, Fiji National University and University of Fiji.  Some of them are publishing future 

articles and newspapers of their views.  I must commend and thank them for doing that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example our strategic plan at the Ministry of Agriculture, we gave it to 

the  expert  at  FNU  Agriculture  College  for  their  viewpoint.    We  have  the  Environmental  Council 

where we have experts from USP and FNU sitting in our National Environment Council.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  experts  from  USP,  FNU  sitting  in  our  ODS  Council.    We  look  forward  to 

interacting with them and we will continue to seek input from them.  These are the authority and 

we  are  providing  them  with  grants.    We  support  the  existence  of  these  institutions  and  we  will 

continue to do that.  I want to assure that they will continue to have our support, </span><span>albeit</span><span> what other 

are saying on the other side.   

</span></p>
<p><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  University  academics  who  have  done  excellent 

research in 2017 in this Annual Report.  I want to encourage them to do more research and have 

this interface between the policy making and research.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Dr. Mahendra Reddy for his contribution to the 

debate.    I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts.    You 

have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution to the University of 

the South Pacific Annual Report 2017.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been much discussion and I do 

not  see  it  to  contribute  to  the2017  Annual  Report,  however  I  would  like  to  talk  on  that  Annual 

Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Annual  Report  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  highlights  several  achievements  for  the  University 

which demonstrate the achievement against the strategic plan targets, 81 percent of the targets was 

met in the first two years and that is on page 7 of the Annual Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition  to  this,  other  achievements  were  reported  because  of  the  commitment  and 

energy with which the staffs were engaged with their work.  These included innovation patents, a 

number  of  awards  won  by  the  staff  and  students,  the  registration  of  the  marine  collection  with 

global biodiversity information security, USP’s registration with the Oracle Academy, et cetera.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>581 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we go along with the Report, we see that the Report talks about limited 

financial resources, the need to generate commercial revenue and what projects could be taken up 

by  the  University  to  generate  sustainable  commercial  income  generations.    It  does  talk  about  the 

need for additional assistance from our development partners, the need for more academic staff and 

HR issues.   It  is  also  important  to  note that the report talks about  to  do this, it contributes to  the 

disruptions  in  teaching  sometimes,  when  we  do  not  have  adequate  staff  and  work  permits  are 

required and not processed in time. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Coming  to  work  permits,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Members  on  the  other  side 

mentioned  about  Professor  Ahluwalia  and  his  deportation.    It  should  be noted  that  every  country 

within its sovereignty has its own immigration laws and every person who comes into a country on 

a work visa must abide by that.  We kept on going about the BDO Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is part of the university council, and that is something that you must 

know.    Fiji  cannot  usurp  the  powers  of  the  council,  we  have  12  member  countries  as  part  of  the 

USP council, with Australia, New Zealand and other members as observers.  Fiji has five members 

representing the council. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, there is no way that representatives of the Fijian Government can ever usurp the 

powers of the council.  We hear the word BDO Report.  Can I just make a comment on that?  When 

the  BDO  Report  was  released,  it  was  the  council’s  decision  not  to  release  the  BDO  report.    Fiji 

have no part in that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I have heard it from my position as the Minister for Education.  There is a conspiracy, they 

think Fiji is conspiring not to release the BDO Report.  That Report was released to the council, it 

was  the  council  who  decided  to  appoint  a  three  member  commissioners;  Fiji,  Cook  Island  and 

Samoa  were  appointed  to  be  part  of  the  commissioners  and  then  they  appointed  a  three  member 

committee who were supposed to do the investigation about the findings of the BDO Report.  So, 

that is how it is. 

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  not  that  Fiji  or  the  Fijian  Government  wanted  to  hide  the  Report.    Whatever 

malpractices were found in the Report, the Commission was supposed to address that and bring to 

the council’s attention as to how we can improve on HR policies, the issues there were HR.... 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.-</span><span> </span><span>Yes, governance, finances and it was all policy matters.  So it was the 

Council’s decision.  Can we put that matter to rest saying, Fiji did not want the BDO report release.  If 

the  Council  wanted  the  report  released  they  could  have  released  it.    We  have  to  understand  that  the 

Council is governed by the USP statutes.  Fiji Government does not make the rules for the Council to 

operate.  And again there was a mention that Samoa wanted the Campus to shift to Samoa.  That is the 

Council’s decision which will govern by the statutes.  Neither Fiji nor Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands or 

Nauru can do things on their own.  Well, what they can do is to support for that.  But everything has to 

be governed by the USP statutes that is written.  That is the truth. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Then there are calls from people for the Minister of Education, ‘we have a complaint,’ the 

Ministry nor the Government interferes with the internal governance issues with the USP.  We do 

not  deal  with  what  the  VC  is  doing  we  do  not  dictate  what  the  PC  is  going  to  do  or  whom  they 

appoint  and  whom  they  terminate.    All  we  want  is  whoever  is  in  that  position  to  practice  good 

governance.  That has been always our stand.   

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>If  I  can  inform  the  House  for  the  last  Special  Council  Meeting  we  had,  we  said  that, 

whatever the Council decides, it has to be within the ambits of the statutes.  The Council also has 

processes to follow, whether they want to give Professor Ahluwalia a new contract, whether they 

want to give him an amended contract or whether they want him to be in Samoa, Tonga or Nauru, it 

has to be within the statutes of the USP Council.  So that is the fact, Honourable Members. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Here we are going about accusing the Fijian Government or accusing the representatives of 

the Fijian Government of doing things which is not even within our powers.  If you read the BDO 

Report, I do not know what reports  you are reading.  Honourable Leawere  said, “Make the BDO 

Report known,” Honourable Tuisawau says, ‘He is quoting from the BDO report.’  It is already on 

line,  it  was  leaked  the  very  day  the  Council  had  it,  even  when  the  Council  told  its  members  this 

report is not to be released, but it was leaked so what is there to hide.  Whatever you are quoting is 

from the BDO Report and it is a national report, there is nothing to hide. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to that.   A lot of these countries who are trying to say that 

the  University  should  be  shifted  to  Samoa,  we  must  not  forget,  Solomon  Islands  has  its  own 

university, Samoa has its own University, we have our own University but  I have never seen the 

Honourable Members on the other side talk with the same passion for the Fiji National University, 

never.    And  here  we  are  talking  about  regionalism.    Yes,  we  want  our  University  because  our 

students benefit from that, whether it is USP, whether it is FNU or whether it is the University of 

Fiji, we want good governance.  Whoever is appointed and whoever is terminated, the process has 

to be followed, that is all we are asking for.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Two days ago, I was asked about a complaint that was received regarding the appointment 

of a new person at USP. I said, “Look as a Minister, I have no say in that, if you have complaints 

about someone’s appointment go to the PC.”  The USP has its own grievance process mechanism, 

so  to  come  here  and  say  that  the  Fijian  Government  is  usurping  the  powers  of  the  University 

Council is such a rubbish.  It is not a right place to say it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  am  not  here  protected  by  the  parliamentary  privileges,  but  people  let  us  talk  about  the 

truth, and that is the truth about the USP Council.  So should that the Council on Tuesday, we are 

meeting again, say this is going to happen: Professor Ahluwalia will be given a new contract, but it 

has to be with the concurrence of the Council and followed the process.  If it is alright to give well 

that  is  the  Council’s  decision.    We  need  to  know  how  the  Council  operates.    It  operates  on  a 

different platform with its own rules and sets of regulation that guides our work.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  issue  that  caught  my  attention  was,  accommodation  for  USP 

students.  It is not only accommodation for USP students, our FNU students always struggle to find 

accommodation here so the recommendation is for the University to work ways where the students 

could  be  provided  with  a  reasonable  accommodation,  and  of  course,  you  and  I  both  know  that 

accommodation in Suva is very expensive.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The need for more academic staff,  I think this is 2021, the Report is 2017, a lot of things 

have happened, a lot of progress must have been made that will be when we see the Report being 

tabled for the coming 2019 and 2020. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, with that, I take my seat and thank you very much.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister,  Honourable  Attorney-General,  you</p>
<p><span>have the floor.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>583 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  for  her 

comments.  I just wanted to very quickly highlight a few things and one aspect that the Honourable 

Minister  highlighted  which  is  very  important  is  student  accommodation.    Unfortunately,  none  of 

the Honourable Members from the other side actually spoke about student accommodation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think SODELPA is saying that they will make everything free right up to university.  They 

did not talk about university accommodation and that is one of the greatest prohibition in respect to 

allowing students to travel to universities, of course, now with digital access but nonetheless, face-

to-face education is critically important.  There has been some talks with FNU to be able to engage 

the private sector to provide university accommodation.  Honourable Professor Prasad and others 

who obviously have properties around USP know that providing student accommodation can be an 

extremely lucrative business. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is  that,  there was  some analogy drawn  between 

the  Pacific  Island’s  Forum’s  (PIF)  withdrawal  at  USP  and  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  has  addressed  that.  

Obviously, we have got nothing to do with it.  I do not know how many Honourable Members from 

the  other  side  actually  bothered  to  look  at  the  USP  Charter.    This  was  actually  set  up  during  the 

British days, towards the end of our Colonial era.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if  you look  at  the  composition  of the Council, it still remains the same.  

The  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  will  tell  you  that  at  one 

point in time, there was some talk about reviewing the membership of the Council right from those 

days  in  1969  when  it  was  formed.    We  have  the  one  person  appointed  as  Pro-Chancellor,  Vice-

Chancellor,  Deputy  Vice-Chancellor,  one  person  will  be  appointed  by  the  Government  of  the 

Commonwealth of Australia, one from  the British Solomon Islands, one from the Government of 

Cook  Islands  and  five  persons  to  be  appointed  by  the  Government  of  Fiji,  one  person  will  be 

appointed by the Government of Gilbert  and Ellice Islands, of course, this is Kiribati and Tuvalu 

now, Nauru, the British Resident Commissioner in New Hebrides, of course, that is now Vanuatu – 

all    these  things,  of  course,  would  change;  one  person  appointed  by  the  Government  of  New 

Zealand, but the composition still remains the same, notwithstanding the fact, as you find in most 

types  of  organisations  where  the  countries  that  actually  give  very  large  contributions  have  some 

form of say or a much more significant say because of the contributions they make. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  Fiji’s  case,  of  course,  we  are  the  largest  contributor,  anywhere  between  $32  million  to 

$36 million, we give as a grant.  The next highest grant, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Solomon Islands at $2 

million.  So a difference of about $34 million between the grants that we give and the grant that the 

next largest country gives on the Council at USP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that, these are the hard core changes in the 21st 

century that have not been taken into account.  Student population at the University is comprised as 

follows: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>Fiji 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Solomon Islands 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Vanuatu 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Kiribati 

</span><span></span><span> </span><span>Tonga  

</span></p>
<p><span>- 

- 

</span><span>- 

</span><span>- 

- 

</span></p>
<p><span>55 percent; 

19 percent; 

</span><span>8 percent; 

</span><span>6 percent; and 

5 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The others are quite minimal, Samoa and all the others.  A lot of the Samoans go to New Zealand 

</span><span>because of their relationship, they have formed a colony of New Zealand. 

</span></p>
<p><a name="86">Page 86</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  to  very  quickly  highlight  and  just  to  add  to  what  the  Honourable 

Minister for Education has highlighted.  Someone said that I had sneaked my way into the Council.  

The Fijian Government has five positions in the Council and they can send whoever they like.  We 

have had money issues and the Permanent Secretary for Economy goes and sometimes I go.  The 

Honourable  Minister  for  Education  goes  and  her  Permanent  Secretary  goes.    We  have  appointed 

other  people  on  the  Council  that  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  recommends.    We  have 

Fay Yee and Mahmood Khan on the Council, so there are five members.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On  Friday  the  other  day,  when  the  Permanent  Secretary  (PS)  for  Education  and  I  had  to 

leave, there was talk that we had fled the meeting apparently because we had to go to a PS meeting, 

we were replaced by someone from the Ministry of Education, the Assistant Minister and someone 

from  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General,  so  there  is  nothing  untoward  about  it.  It  is  all  very 

conspiratorial type of theories that are coming out.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that, the USP Council, at the moment, is deeply 

divided, there is no doubt about that, in the manner in which the University should progress. The 

USP Council is deeply divided in the way forward and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the deportation of 

the former Vice-Chancellor, it is quite clearly stated in his contract that should his work permit be 

cancelled or no longer be in place, the contract automatically comes to an end.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  discussion  on  Friday,  unfortunately  for  five  hours,  went  on  whether  the  contract  was 

still  in  place  because  Nauru  wanted  to  amend  the  contract.    So  our  argument  was,  “You  cannot 

amend  a  contract  that  has  already  been  terminated.”  You  can  only  amend  something  that  is  in 

existence.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The USP’s lawyers are Munro Leys and they gave a legal opinion that said that 95 percent 

they thought the contract was terminated because of the revocation of the work permit. That was 

the  position.  All  we  argued  on  Friday,  because  some  members  wanted  him  to  be  immediately 

brought  back,  all  we  said  was  that  there  are  various  standard  operating  procedures,  the  various 

regulations that should be followed.   We  actually,  as  Council  members  representing  Fiji,  do  not 

want to prejudice who was going to be appointed the Vice-Chancellor. We simply said, “Follow the 

process. Contract is terminated.  You want to appoint a new Vice-Chancellor, follow the process. 

Advertise  whatever  you  need  to  do  as  stated  in  the  various  procedures.”  The  Council  has  a 

committee that they can appoint and they may recommend to short circuit the process.  It is up to 

them, as long as everything is above board.  

</span></p>
<p><span>In respect of the University moving to somewhere else, obviously the statute here is in Fiji.  

But we note that Samoa has in place a USP Act of 1977. That is probably because they have got 

one  of  the  Campuses  and  I  understand  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  Honourable  Dr.  Reddy 

may have been the students over there.  That is why they are so close to each other as they spent 

time together in Samoa.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Laughter) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why they probably have it, but the creation of the Charter itself is 

under Fijian law and there are various parameters to that, that needs to be adhered to.  Bulk of the 

assets of the University of the South Pacific is at Laucala Bay Campus.  A number of the assets of 

the  Laucala  Bay  Campus  have  been  put  up  because  of  the  bilateral  relationships  that  the  Fijian 

Government  has  had  with  other  countries  and  have  asked  them  to  put  up  various  infrastructure 

within the Campus too. That is the reality on the ground. That is the legal position, and that is what 

we have been doing. 

</span></p>

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>585 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can be here for the next two hours to tell you exactly what the saga has 

been. Now, I was berated for saying that there is no saga. I was asked in the context, again, about 

the deportation and  I said that as a result  of the deportation, there is  no saga.  There is  no crisis.  

That has a life of its own.  But the actual saga and crisis at USP is actually about good governance.  

That is why when Honourable Tabuya, on the other day, said that they were wearing green which is 

about good governance, I said, “Well great, because there are governance issues.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee is not appointed by me or the Minister 

for  Education  or  by  Fiji,  he  was  actually  appointed  by  the  Council.    Mahmood  Khan  has  been 

practicing in New Zealand for nearly 40 years.  He is a former Fijian citizen.  He has got back his 

citizenship and based on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they appointed him the  Chairperson  of the Audit 

and  Risk  Committee,  very  simple,  and  he  worked  together  with  the  lady  from  Tonga,  whom  I 

forgot her name.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reality  of  the  matter  is  that,  the  Pro-Chancellor,  Mr.  Winston 

Thompson,  has  raised  a  number  of  issues  that  have  been  not  congruous  with  the  practices  of  the 

past  in  the way the  governance structure has been in  place  and the  relationship between the Pro-

Chancellor  and  the  Vice-Chancellor.    As  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  highlighted,  the 

BDO Report was proceeded by a report that was done by Professor Ahluwalia himself. And one of 

the protagonists that the BDO actually highlighted, who had a sum of about $1.4 million, one of the 

academics  that  Honourable  Ro  Tuisawau  failed  to  mention,  when  BDO  actually  asked  Professor 

Ahluwalia why was not he included in that, he said, “he helped me write the report.” I was there at 

the Council Meeting when he said that - Arvin Patel.  He said, “He helped me write the report.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  knows  him  very  well.  This  is  to  do  with  consultancy  fees.  

Honourable Professor Prasad used to do consultancy too and the share of fees with the Academic, 

why should we pay it to the University.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Chorus of interjections) 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order!</p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  why  the  USP  Council  was 

concerned about the release of the Report initially was because Professor Ahluwalia’s report was 

written and accusations were made without the supposedly accused persons being given a right of 

reply.  That is natural justice.  If we are going to accuse someone by saying, “you were paid this 

much  consultancy  fees  of  $40,000”,  that  person  should  be  given  the  right  to  explain;  very  basic.  

They were never done.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when that report was done and the BDO Report came out and this is the 

report that was in fact written in respect of the BDO Report. The BDO Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

contrary  to  the  hype  created    by  the  VCP,  no  fraud  was  discovered  and  most  of  the  supposed 

mismanagement was within  their delegated powers of the then Professor Chandra.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  BDO  recommended  that  the  policies  and  procedures  around  finance  and  human 

resources management must be updated and strengthened. The Council resolved to appoint a three-

Minister Committee which the Honourable Minister for Education alluded to, to in turn appoint a 

three-member Commission.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The three-member Committee was the former Prime Minister of Cook Islands, now the new 

incoming  Secretary-General  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum;  the  former  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of 

Samoa, who has resigned since then; and myself.  And then we appointed a Commission and the 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – USP 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Commission  of  late,  has  handed  down  their  report  and  they  have  identified  gaps  as  to  how  they 

could be addressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in relation to the BDO Report which everyone is going on about it.  

Honourable Tuisawau knows full well, he was talking about Hasmukh Lal in respect of the matters 

that he raised. This is the CEO of Pacific TAFE. I understand Honourable Tuisawau applied for a 

job there, probably he was not shortlisted, and maybe that is why he is a bit concerned about that.  

He knows full well also that the matter is before the courts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  make  one  point;  I  am  personally  aggrieved  by  the  manner  in 

which, without any proprietary, the name of Winston Thompson has been berated in  all of these. 

He was a former Ambassador of Fiji, he was the Chair of the University Grants Committee from 

2006 to 2015.  Subsequently, the Council unanimously appointed him twice as the Pro-Chancellor 

of USP.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  remember  when  all  of  the  shenanigans  took  place  when  this  BDO  Report  came  out,  et 

cetera, we were in the Nadi Council Meeting, and the way that the former Vice-Chancellor carried 

on, Winston Thompson said to me, “I want to resign because I have never seen such behaviour.  I 

want  to  resign.”  I asked  him and said, “Please, stay on board because there is  no one else.”  We 

were more concerned about the University in terms of the funding we were giving in excess of $30 

million.  He was the only gentleman at that point in time, whom we could actually put some trust in 

because he knew the system. He was also the Chairman of the Grants Committee, which is made up 

of all the different countries that contribute towards the University’s funding. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  subsequently  also,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee 

raised  with  the  Council  a  number  of  anomalies  that  were  taking  place  under  Vice-Chancellor 

Ahluwalia.    Various  appointments  were  taking  place,  not  adhering  to  the  requirements  and 

regulations. These are individuals’ names, Sir, which I am not going to read out. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Despite  conflicts  of  interest,  again,  people  who  did  not  meet  the  requirements  were 

appointed,  contracts  were  renewed.    People  who  were  appointed  to  new  positions  which  is  for  a 

three-year contract should have been advertised externally, meaning outside the University, but it 

was only advertised internally and people were appointed. The basic MQRs were not met.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  direct  appointments  are  allowed  for  non-academic  staff,  however, 

DHR ignored this and contravened this process and has appointed staff.  It has nothing to do with 

Vice-Chancellor Ahluwalia but the DHR.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Policy followed by Dean to select and recommend a candidate to fill a vacancy of Head of 

</span></p>
<p><span>School, Vice-Chancellor Ahluwalia refused to follow the process. The list goes on.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our position, Mr. Speaker, was that the Pro- Chancellor and the Chairperson of the Audit 

and Risk Committee have raised these issues.  All we simply said, “Please, like we appointed BDO, 

appoint an independent group of persons or a company or an organisation or professional outfit, to 

look at issues raised by the Audit and Risk Committee Chairperson.”  It is a very simple request. 

This happens all the time. The Chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee reports directly to the 

Board.    If  you  are  in  a  company,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  will  report 

directly to the Managing Director because of the role that they play. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because there is a lot of cajoling going on, refused to do that.  

That  is  all  we  wanted,  independent  group  appointed.    Please,  whatever  the  findings  is,  we  will 

follow it.  We said, “Unless and until this is done, we are not going to give the grant.

<p><span>Review Report - USP 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>587 

</span></p>
<p><span>Then,  of  course,  some  of  the  members,  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education  will 

highlight,  that  Nauru,  Tonga  and  Samoa  said,  “We  will  have  a  bilateral  meeting  with  Fiji  on  the 

side to discuss this.” We said, “We are quite open, please let us do that.”  To-date, they have not 

done  it.    There  are  some  very  unhealthy  relationships  between  people  on  the  Council  and  the 

former Vice-Chancellor - very unhealthy relationships.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the position.  The position pertaining to the governance structures 

at USP has got nothing in law to do with him and his wife’s deportation.    They are two separate 

matters altogether.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Department of Immigration has already issued a statement on that and the photos are 

actually quite evident of what happened.  They, in fact, assisted with the packing, et cetera.  We did 

not  say  that,  Honourable  Tuisawau.  They  were  checked  in,  et  cetera.  They  went  into  the  VIP 

Lounge.  This is not someone being scuttled away in the middle of the night, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 

that has got nothing to do with this Report in 2017.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Annual Report 2017 is all about governance, financial accountability and what we are 

saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  that, that is precisely what  we want.   We are not  saying, “Take USP 

away as you have been trying to portray.” All we are simply saying is that wherever the University 

is, whatever form it takes, it must have good governance structures in place.  Otherwise, there will 

be a natural death to it.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General:</span> Last speaker before the Right</p>
<p><span>of Reply.  Honourable Salote Radrodro, you have the floor. You did ask. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. S.V. RADRODRO.:</span> Yes, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I did not forget you:</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.:</span> Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.</p>
<p><span>I  agree  with  our 

recommendations.  I  belong  to  that  Committee  but  upon  hearing  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Education’s  comments,  I  would  like  to  make  a  request  to  the  Honourable  Minister.  If,  in  your 

position as a Member of the Council ensure that the BDO Report come as part of the next Annual 

Report for the University of the South Pacific and be presented together to Parliament so that the 

BDO Report can go to the Committee and then be scrutinised together with the Annual Report of 

the University of the South Pacific.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In that way, Mr. Speaker, we will be able to really know the content in our official capacity 

as  Members  of  Parliament  and  in  our  official  role  as  member  of  the  Committee  to  scrutinise  the 

BDO  Report,  together  with  the  Annual  Report  of  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  in  the 

upcoming one.  That means that it will be the 2018 Annual Report and if the Honourable Minister 

for Education could make that request to the USP Council to include the BDO Report with the next 

upcoming Annual Report of USP so that it could go to the Committee and we can scrutinise them 

together and make our recommendations to Parliament in our report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Salote  Radrodro:</span> I  give  the  floor  to  the</p>
<p><span>Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for your right of reply.
