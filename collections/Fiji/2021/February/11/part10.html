</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji’s National Ocean Policy 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  inform  at  this 

February  session  about  Fiji’s  National  Ocean  Policy  (NOP),  a  guiding  blueprint  designed  to 

holistically protect and govern all of Fiji’s ocean and marine resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As an archipelagic nation, our ocean defines us, and not just our borders. For thousands of 

years,  the  ocean  has  provide  a  sustenance  and  fill  the  livelihoods  of  our  people  and  in  doing  so, 

helped our economy thrive. Today, we are able to put a number on that immense impact.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Studies indicate that in 2014, Fiji’s  marine ecosystem services would have been valued at 

approximately FJ$2.4 billion.  Anecdotal evidence which suggest that had the world’s economy not 

been crippled by COVID-19, these numbers would have been much higher still in 2020.  But as we 

note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to continue to tap into this bounty that nature provides us, our ocean must 

not be raided and pillaged for the economic benefit of a single generation.  Above all else, we must 

ensure that any and all investments in the ocean space are sustainable.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Ocean-based  development  needs  do  not  only  be  aligned  to  our  national  development 

aspirations  but  also  operate  within  our  international  climate  commitments  and  promote  the 

protection and restoration of marine resources in a way that will boost the regenerative capacity of 

our 1.3 million square kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  ocean  is  intrinsically  linked  to  our  identity  as  a  Small  Island 

Developing State, but we cannot let that name fool us.  When it comes to our ocean space under 

which we have a complete jurisdiction, nothing is small about Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our EEZ is 70 percent larger than our landmass and when it comes to the size of the EEZ, 

Fiji has the 26th most expensive patch of planet under our protection.  With these statistics in mind, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must see our true potential as a big ocean State, one with significant potential 

for a very big, very vibrant and very blue economy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the massive socioeconomic  prosperities being held in the depths of our ocean, our 

marine  biosphere  is  under  constant  threat  due  to  global  warming  -  a  global  emergency  threat,  as 

vulnerable  people  on  its  frontlines  know  too  well,  is  resulting  in  rising  sea  levels,  ocean 

acidification  and  mass  coral  bleaching.    Unregulated  mining  activities,  land  development  and 

pollution are major threats as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji’s ocean has also been subject to trans-border crime, overfishing, illegal, unreported and 

unregulated fishing and many other forms of mismanagement, contributing to the decline in marine 

and an increase in border security threats.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such threats underscore the diverse spectrum of complex ocean issues that 

our  development    agenda must address,  if  we  are to  create  a sustainable, inclusive,  resilient and 

low  carbon  future  for  all  Fijians.    That  is  why,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  has  not 

been resting on its laurels and is taking decisive action to these pressing threats to our ocean.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Back  in  2017,  Fiji  recognised  the  importance  of  mainstreaming  oceans  into  global 

discussions  on  climate  change  and  launched  the  Ocean  Pathway  Partnership  during  the  first  ever 

United Nations Ocean Conference in New York.  This is reinforced by Fiji’s COP 23 Presidency to 

the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2017 and showed the 

world that we are pioneers when it comes to protecting our oceans. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji  went  on to  reemphasise the need to  strengthen the nexus between oceans and  climate 

during COP 25 in Madrid, where climate negotiators successfully garnered international support to 

include  oceans  as  part  of  the  UNFCCC  agenda.  But  here  at  home,  we  recognise  the  obstacles  to 

effective and congruent oceans management.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Historically,  Fiji’s  marine  sector  has  long  operated  in  policy  silos.    Multiple  Government 

agencies  are  mandated  to  administer  and  regulate  piecemeal  segment  of  Fiji’s  marine  ecosystem 

through  numerous  plans,  policies  and  strategies.    There  has  been  no  overarching  national  policy 

that provides a similar coordination point to effectively plan, allocate and manage resources for the 

broader sustainable management of Fiji’s ocean space.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The need for an overarching domestic policy that holistically guides the ocean action and is 

well aligned to Fiji’s international climate commitments made it clear that we needed to develop a 

national  policy  as  our  blueprint.    So,  following  indepth  discussions  with  relevant  Government 

agencies, the Ministry of Economy commenced the comprehensive drafting process of the NOP  in 

2019.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the formulation of the NOP took over a year to complete, as it took many 

rounds  of  inclusive  comprehensive  consultations  between  and  among  Government  and  Non-

Government  stakeholders  -  11  rounds  of  stakeholder  consultations,  comprising  the  three  open 

public consultations, and these took place from October 2019 to November 2020.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To  ensure  that  our  eventual  Policy  would  complement,  not  compete  with  the  existing 

policies and legislation, the overall development of the NOP was guided by a steering committee 

consisting  of  key  Government  agencies,  selected  from  the  following  existing  Marine  Affairs 

Committees, the:   

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Protected Areas Committee through the National Environment Council of the Ministry 

of Environment;  

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Maritime Affairs Coordinating Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; 

(3)</span><span> </span><span>Marine Protected Areas Technical Committee of the Ministry of Fisheries; and 

(4)</span><span> </span><span>Marine  Spill  Pollution  Advisory  Committee  of  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Tourism and Transport. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while many minds and voices went into the policies formulation, I would 

like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  and  remember  one  in  particular,  the  late  Lieutenant 

Commander Silipa Tagicaki Kubuabola, who passed away earlier this month as the highest ranking 

female officer in the Fijian Navy.  Her input towards the formulation of the NOP was invaluable 

and  I  am  sure  she  would  have  been  delighted  to  operationalise  it.    Lieutenant  Commander 

Kubuabola will be sorely missed in this process.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  having  elaborated  the  development  of  the  NOP,  please  allow  me  to 

highlight the key features of the NOP.  The vision and mission of NOP are respectively to achieve a 

healthy ocean that sustains the livelihoods and aspirations of Fiji’s current and future generations, 

and to secure and sustainably manage Fiji’s ocean and its marine resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the NOP will achieve its vision and mission through seven strategic goals.</p>
<p><span>These are: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Cooperation  -  to  harmonise  and  promote  an  integrated  and  cooperative  national 

approach  to  managing  the  ocean  in  a  manner  that  promotes  security,  strive  to 

sustainability and ensures prosperity for all Fijians.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>509 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sustainability  -  to  protect,  restore  and  improve  ocean  ecosystems,  climate  services 

and  biodiversity  so  these  benefits  contribute  towards  a  fair  and  equitable 

participation  in  sharing  of  benefits  for  current  and  future  generations  through  the 

sustainable  management  of  100  percent  of  Fiji’s  ocean  within  the  national 

jurisdiction. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)  

</span></p>
<p><span>Security  -  to  safeguard  assets  and  ensure  regulatory  compliance  for  the  multi-

dimensional  maritime  security  of  100  percent  for  Fiji’s  ocean  within  its  national 

jurisdiction. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(4)  

</span></p>
<p><span>People  -  to  promote  a  people-centred  approach  to  ocean  management  by  sharing 

benefits in an equitable and inclusive manner that respects all rights. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(5)   Development  -  to  establish  a  solid  foundation  for  sustainable  development  that 

includes  facilitating  ocean-based  opportunities  and  innovations  to  ensure  healthy 

ecosystems and secure economic livelihoods. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(6)   Knowledge - to integrate traditional knowledge, heritage and cultural practices with 

scientific knowledge to provide a holistic platform that can meet the contemporary 

challenges of the ocean. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(7) 

</span></p>
<p><span>Advocacy  -  recognising  both,  the  connectivity  of  oceans,  the  need  for  ambitious 

management of the ocean and deepened understanding of the ocean climate nexus.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  NOP  lays  out  how  Fiji  can  engage  in  regional  and  global  advocacy  that  aligns  with  and 

fortifies the ongoing seven endeavours.  Those are the seven key issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Each  of  these  goals  has  an  inter-dependent  set  of  activities  and  a  10-year  implementation 

plan which identifies co-ordinating agencies that will effectively carry out these activities through 

their respective mandates. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  implementation  plan  is  the  operational  backbone  of  NOP  and  will  be  the  proxy  for 

multiple  Government  agencies  to  coherently  implement  sustainable  ocean  actions  through  33 

outcomes and 86 indicators allocated across key implementation Government agencies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Given that 20 percent of the Fijian population live within one kilometre of the coastline and 

76  percent  within  five  kilometres  not  recognising  the  intrinsic  connection  Fijians  have  with  their 

marine biosphere, in doing so, it places consistent community engagement and collaboration at the 

heart of this implementation plan.  This is exemplified by the establishment of the annual Talanoa 

Dialogue on oceans, which will be a forum to discuss matters of importance in the ocean sector and 

provide accountability to the public on progress to operationalize NOP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two flagship outcomes of NOP are to declare 30 percent of Fiji’s EEZ 

as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), with 100 percent sustainable management of our EEZ by 2030.  

These targets are consistent with Fiji’s global commitment, such as SDG 14 - Life below water, and 

the 30by30 Initiative led by the Government of the United Kingdom. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NOP has a government structure.  In recognising the complexities of our 

ocean sector and underscoring the importance of a whole of government approach to achieve Fiji’s 

blue  economy  ambitions,  NOP  creates  a  robust  governance  and  institutional  arrangement  that 

brings together existing national committees working across the seven strategic goals.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The NOP will be overseen by the National Ocean Policy Steering Committee made up of 14 

Permanent Secretaries.  The Steering Committee will also include senior technical representatives 

of  selected  agencies,  including  non-government  organisations  from  the  private  sector,  academia 

and civil society, as needed with an observer status. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Existing  national  committees  that  address  marine-related  activities  will  be  requested  to 

deliver specific outputs and updates to the steering committee in order to facilitate the delivery of 

the  activities  set  out  in  the  10-year  implementation  plan.    The  implementation  plan  will  be 

monitored  and  evaluated  through  an  annual  progress  report,  and  a  five-year  review  report  to  be 

developed by the Ministry of Economy, on behalf of the Steering Committee, in its capacity as the 

Steering Committee Secretariat and custodian of NOP. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s NOP will be enshrined into law also through the upcoming Climate 

Change  Bill,  as  we  merge  the  ocean  climate  nexus,  and  create  an  enabling  environment  to  boost 

ocean health and curb the growing impact of climate change on our fragile marine biosphere.   In 

particular,  Part  13  of  the  upcoming  Climate  Change  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Oceans  and  Climate, 

emphasises the need to protect Fiji’s existing maritime boundaries and marine resources, including 

blue  carbon  stocks,  such  as  mangroves  and  seagrass  meadows.    This  section  creates  the  legal 

mandate  for  Fiji  to  designate  30  percent  of  its  EEZ  as  MPAs  by  2030  and  achieve  100  percent 

sustainable management of our EEZ, as we had mentioned earlier on.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  economic  standstill  that  has 

followed in its wake, makes the need for sustainable economic management even more clear.  Fiji’s 

ocean health simply cannot be compromised.  For the preservation of our economy, our livelihoods 

and our culture and heritage, we must protect this vitality and the bounty it provides. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look ahead in kick-starting the 2021  UN Decade of Ocean Science, 

Fiji’s new national initiatives, such as the ban of single use plastic bags,  our 10-Year Moratorium 

on Seabed Mining and the recent ban on polystyrene or Styrofoam, are more significant steps in the 

right direction to achieving a blue recovery. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  this  respect  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  currently  talking  to  the  UK  Government  in 

furthering  talks  regarding  issuance  of  blue  bonds.    I  would  like  to  just  hold  up  this  particular 

Oceans Policy, it will be available on the website and I urge all Honourable Members of Parliament 

to, please, go and read this.  You can have an input, as you know that we will be having widespread 

consultations,  as  I  have  just  highlighted,  on  a  yearly  basis  and  this  is  an  effort  that  requires  a 

national approach to preserve this much valuable asset of ours.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Attorney-General for his Ministerial Statement:</span></p>
<p><span>I now call upon the Honourable Rasova to speak in reply.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- </span><span>Bula vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you very much for having me 

speak  on  this  topic.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 

Economy for the wonderful Ministerial Statement on Fiji’s National Ocean Policy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  provide  a  response  to  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and 

Minister  for  Economy  on  Fiji’s  National  Ocean  Policy,  the  guiding  blueprint  designed  to 

holistically protect and govern all of Fiji’s ocean and marine resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, we can all agree that Fiji is, indeed, blessed with large areas of ocean and</p>
<p><span>maritime resources which it has both rights to use but a responsibility to manage.   

</span></p>
<p><a name="13">Page 13</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>511 

</span></p>
<p><span>I note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the primary purpose of the National Ocean Policy is to guide 

the  Fiji  Government  towards  integrated  oceans  management  and  more  coordination  across 

Government,  including  all  stakeholders,  in  better  decision-making  processes  for  all  matters  that 

could affect Fiji’s ocean or natural resources. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries is well grounded and mandated under the Marine 

Spaces  Act  Cap  158A,  the  Offshore  Fisheries  Management  Decree  2012  and  its  consequent 

Regulations  of  2014,  to  carry  out  conservation  and  management  of  fisheries  resources  within  its 

Exclusive  Economic  Zone.    The  question  begs,  why  is  the  Ministry  of  Economy  interfering  into 

matters that could be handled and coordinated by the Ministry responsible? 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe  that  more  time  should  be  provided  for  the  consultation  on  the 

Policy.  This  would improve the Fiji  Government’s vision and also  ensure that it ties  in  with the 

Pacific  Region’s  push  for  a  sustainable  blue  economy  to  the  benefit  of  the  people  of  the  Pacific 

Islands. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir,vinaka vakalevu.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I thank the Honourable Rasova for his contribution and I now give the</p>
<p><span>floor to the Honourable Tikoduadua.  You have the floor Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Thank you Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Minister for his Ministerial Statement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  now,  it  is  quite  normal  for  us  to  feel  suspicious  whenever  the 

Honourable Minister starts passionately postulating about new initiatives, particularly for this issue, 

which one would think that the Honourable Minister for Fisheries would tell Parliament about.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now,  I  am,  in  fact,  reminded  of  the  same  gusto  that  we  heard  on  the  Environment  and 

Climate Adaptation Levy (ECAL) and then the plastic bag levy.  The ECAL funds turned out to be 

an  additional  source  of  funds  for  Government’s  infrastructure  development,  and  the  plastic  bag 

debacle  spiralled  into  a  mess  with  a  50  microns  debate.    I  am  sure  the  Honourable  Minister  for 

Agriculture, Waterways and Environment remembers this vividly.  Similarly, the same excitement 

over the Green Bonds that has long fizzled out, and Parliament has had no update about it in a long 

time.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  know  that  the  Ocean’s  Policy  is  a  year  overdue.    This  really  points  to  the  complete 

</span></p>
<p><span>disorganisation of this Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday, the Honourable Minister told Parliament about a new carbon agreement that has 

been signed with the World Bank.  It appears that all the initiatives relating to carbon trading are 

being rolled out in an ad hoc and haphazard manner.    

</span></p>
<p><span>An agreement was signed with the World Bank.  Now, where is our law that should set out 

the scientific  and technical  parameters of that  agreement,  and be the basis of what  is bought  and 

sold?   

</span></p>
<p><span>So  far  the  nation  has  seen  two  drafts  of  the  Climate  Change  Bill,  and  public  consultation 

seems to be happening in a bubble.  We know what that usually means, they will take the Bill only 

to those who are friendly to their ideas.  Bring the Bill to the House and let it go through the proper 

and thorough Parliamentary Committee process!

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>On  the  Oceans  Policy,  we  are  all  aware  that  a  healthy  ocean  is  integral  to  the  lives  and 

livelihoods  of  our  people,  but  how  healthy  are  our  coral  reefs,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir?    How  are  we 

managing ocean pollution and over-fishing domestically and internationally?  How effectively are 

we  monitoring  the  dumping  of  toxic  substances  and  runoffs  that  are  carried  from  the  waterways 

into the ocean?  Are we protecting a deep sea hydrothermal vents adequately?  The second Climate 

Change Bill has dropped all the references to a 10-year moratorium on deep sea mining that was in 

the previous version of the Bill.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Some years ago the National Federation Party (NFP) had asked the Honourable Minister for 

Fisheries for an overarching study of the state of Fiji’s oceans.  Those kinds of indications can help 

us understand where the challenges are, and where the national resources could be directed.  If we 

do not get that kind of assessment, this is what will continue to happen - the Government will get 

distracted by the latest fads that are only linked to money. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  oceans  are  heating  up.    We  see  that  already  in  the  rise  in  coral 

bleaching  and  the  steadily  increasing  assault  of  extreme  weather  events  here  in  Fiji.    But  if  we 

tinker  about  with  economic  interests,  like  carbon  trading,  without  addressing  the  fundamental 

issues of global warming, all these initiatives will come to naught. We will spend it all on disaster 

relief  and  rehabilitation  efforts,  and  rebuilding  infrastructure,  while  the  essential  obligations  of 

education, healthcare and employment are wilfully ignored.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We are aware that the main interest of the Ministry is for blue carbon trading possibilities, 

specifically  on  mangroves,  seagrasses  and  saltwater  marshes.    In  fact,  the  Honourable  Minister 

himself said it yesterday, and I quote from page 445 of yesterday’s </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The  market  opportunity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  great.    Carbon  markets  are 

continuing to experience steady growth, despite the global economic contractions caused 

by COVID-19.”   

</span></p>
<p><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  need  a  lot  more  convincing  on  the  sincerity  of 

intentions  about  oceans  protection  and,  I  am  sure,  so  too  will  traditional  fishing  ground  owners.  

</span></p>

<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue from where we left off before 

refreshment  and  I  now  call  upon  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence,  National  Security  and

You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Emergency Operations – TC Yasa and TC Ana 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the 

opportunity to give a Ministerial Statement on Government’s response to the two recent Tropical 

Cyclones - </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, that struck parts of Fiji Group on 17th December, 2020 and 31st 

January, 2021 respectively.     

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  in  this  new  norm,  disaster  risk  is  taking  on  new  forms  and  magnitude  - 

increasingly  complicated,  more  frequent  and  intense.  We  have  had  more  than  10  cyclones  in  the 

last few years and </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> is the second Category 5 Cyclone to hit Fiji since </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  destruction  caused  by  these  natural  hazards  caused  serious  implications  on  our 

communities,  the  national  economy  and  our  development  aspirations.  This,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 

underlines the need to have a robust systemic national response, together with the co-operation and 

assistance of our friends and partners.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On  emergency  operations,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  briefly  highlight  the  actions  and 

arrangements immediately before, during and immediately after the disaster and I will start with </span><span>TC 

Yasa</span><span>.  Let me begin with the warning arrangements and the level of preparedness.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  earlier  in  October  last  year,  the  Regional  Specialized  Meteorological 

Centre (RSMC) in  Nadi  released the region’s cyclone season forecast.  The forecast  predicted the 

likelihood of three to  six tropical  cyclones forming in  the  region  to  the  West  of the  International 

Dateline, of which one to three are likely to be categorized as severe. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Severe </span><span>TC 

Yasa</span><span>  happened  to  be  the  first  for  the  season  and  was  the  strongest  cyclone  since  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  in 

2016 and has become Fiji’s second severe cyclone within a span of five years.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, severe </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>, a Ccategory 5 Cyclone had initially unleashed its wrath 

in  the  North-Western  part  of  Fiji  before  it  made  landfall  in  Vanua  Levu  on  the  evening  of  17th 

December, 2020, causing widespread devastation. The super storm then moved across the Eastern 

Division,  impacting  the Lomaiviti  and  the  Lau  Groups.  The  Cyclone  with  hurricane-force  winds, 

flooding  and  storm  surges  caused  widespread  destruction  to  public  infrastructure,  homes  and 

buildings and livelihoods in the severely affected areas.  Following the advice provided through the 

Special Weather Bulletins by the Fiji Meteorological Office, Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) 

were activated.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On  the  EOC  activation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  given  the  lessons  learnt  from  </span><span>TC  Winston, 

</span><span>Government activated its disaster response mechanisms swiftly.  From the cyclone alerts received 

well  before  the  cyclone  passed  through  Fiji,  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office  (NDMO) 

activated its National and Divisional Emergency Operation Centres to monitor the situations, plan 

and coordinate emergency response efforts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  NDMO,  together  with  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Services,  constantly  issued  mass  rapid 

messaging  to  the  general  public  through  SMS,  television  and  radio  to  alert  communities  in  their 

preparations and provide advice on cyclone safety precautions.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  emergency  operations  for  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  was  fully  activated  by  the  National 

Disaster Controller, who is also the Permanent Secretary responsible for Rural, Development and 

Disaster Management on 15th December, 2020, as </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> was approaching the Fiji Group from 

the North West. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the accuracy in forecasting the cyclone track from our Fiji Meteorological 

Office,  coupled  with  increased  volume  of  awareness  on  our  mass  media  from  the  NDMO, 

contributed  significantly  to  the  level  of  preparedness  in  our  people.    Homes  were  reinforced  and 

secured, evacuation centers occupied, protection of properties and livelihoods and the adherence to 

safety measures and movement restrictions.  These initiatives are commendable, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me touch on the state of emergency and the declaration of natural disaster.Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, given the severity of the looming cyclone and the anticipated level of damage and destruction it 

will  cause,  on  16th  December,  2020,  Cabinet  approved  the  Declaration  of  a  Natural  Disaster  in 

respect  of  the  whole  of  Fiji.    Therefore,  Sir,  all  emergency  operations  carried  out  henceforth 

focused primarily on the protection of life and property, the restoration of essential public services 

and the provision of immediate relief to disaster victims in the affected areas. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Affected areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were categorised into zones according to the cyclone path, 

and red zones being the areas worst affected.  Because  </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> made a landfall on Vanua Levu, 

areas  classified  as  red  zones  were  the  whole  of  Bua  Province,  consisting  of  the  nine  Districts 

(</span><span>Tikina</span><span>) namely; Dama, Lekutu, Navakasiga, Bua, Vuya, Solevu, Nadi, Wainunu</span><span> </span><span>and Kubulau; in 

Macuata,  the  four  Districts  of  Seaqaqa,  Macuata,  Sasa  and  Wailevu;  and  in  Cakaudrove,  the 

Districts of Wailevu and Savusavu.  Those red zones, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were given the highest of 

priorities in the allocation of resources and conduct of relief activities.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Following  the  declaration,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  operational  design  was  quickly  planned 

which basically defined the operational timeline and phases, key events and decision points and the 

end  state  to  be  achieved.  Consideration  was  also  given  on  worst  case  scenarios  and  three  key 

decision points for the Commissioner Northern were particularly identified: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span><span>(2)</span><span>
</span><span>(3)</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak; 

an outbreak in LTDD; and  

in the event of another disaster, that will bring cyclone and flooding.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  wish  to  focus  on  the  immediate  response  taken.    As  alluded  to 

earlier during the week  by the Honourable  Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Enviroment, 

immediately  on  the  day  after  the  cyclone  on  the  first  chartered  flight  to  Labasa,  four  Cabinet 

Ministers (Honourable Attorney-General, Honourable Minister for Education, Honourable Minister 

for Agriculture and the Honourable Minister for Defence and Disaster Management) took the flight 

to  Vanua  Levu,  together  with  senior  representatives  from  key  partner  stakeholders  and 

organizations  for  an  initial  assessment  and  provide  leadership  and  support  to  our  officials  and 

partners in the North.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For  NDMO,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  accompanied  by  the  Commanding  Officer  3FIR,  Lt. 

Colonel Aseri Rokoura, and following our briefing by Commissioner Northern Division, our initial 

reconnaissance was aimed at assessing the status of accessibility of the main supply route between 

Labasa and Nabouwalu, identification of Forward Operating Bases (FOBS), secure warehouses for 

storage purposes and availability or otherwise of support services and capabilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Indeed, I am pleased to inform this august House that in a span of only 48 hours, the main 

access  road  from  Nabouwalu  to  Labasa  was  cleared  and  fixed  to  make  accessibility  easier  for 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>515 

</span></p>
<p><span>Government’s  response  efforts  to  commence  immediately.  This  also  enabled  the  mobilization  of 

resources for the restoration of essential services, such as water, electricity and communication.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Forward Operating Bases (FOB) were identified at  Lekutu Government Station as well as 

Kubulau  Government  Station.    To  complement  the  limited  storage  facilities  at  Nabouwalu  and 

Kubulau,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  two  multi-storage  units  provided  by  World  Food  Programme  (WFP) 

were erected in each of the two sites as warehouses.  Basically, the idea was that, because Bua was 

badly  covered  and  because  of  the  restrictions  in  some  areas,  particularly  with  flash  flooding  at 

Kubulau, they focused on the two Districts of Kubulau and Wainunu and, of course, in Lekutu, the 

two Districts of Navakasiga and Lekutu and the remaining five Districts or </span><span>Tikina </span><span>were handled by 

the team in Nabouwalu.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  once  the  Nabouwalu-Labasa  main  supply  route  became  accessible, 

Government’s first deployment to the North departed Suva on the night of 19th December, 2020, 

arriving in  Nabouwalu  on the afternoon of Sunday, 20th  January, 2021,  taking across emergency 

food, ration supplies and non-food items to most affected communities in Vanua Levu.   

</span></p>
<p><span>More than 120 personnel from the following agencies were part of that 120 men and women 

deployment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  RFMF,  Fiji  Police  Force,  Water  Authority  of  Fiji,  Energy  Fiji 

Limited,  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  Lands  Department,  Forestry,  Fisheries,  Agriculture,  Health  and 

Ministry  of  Infrastructure.    Non-Government  Organisations,  such  as  Empower  Pacific,  Save  the 

Children’s Fund, Medical Services Pacific and of course, other civil society organisations as well. 

These  agencies  were  part  of  this  deployment  to  conduct  initial  damage  assessments,  distribute 

emergency food ration supplies and to also provide immediate assistance needed in affected  areas 

on Vanua Levu. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday,  there  was  a  lot  of  discussions  about  psycho-social  support  and,  of  course,  all 

those agencies looked into their respective areas.  Also on psycho-social support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

I  also  wish  to  brief  this  august  House  that  psychologists  from  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  also 

deployed their team to the North to assist those who are already on the ground.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was one of the largest teams we have ever deployed from Viti Levu to 

support emergency operations in the Northern Division, as most of our people on the ground have 

been severely affected as well.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the major focus in Vanua Levu for the first 48-72 hours was to conduct 

the  initial  damage  assessment  and  the  restoration  of  essential  services,  particularly  road,  land 

access,  water  and  electricity  and  the  protection  and  safety  of  those  affected,  especially  those  in 

evacuation centres and the distribution of the limited non-food items that was pre-positioned by the 

Fiji Red Cross initially. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  were  fortunate  that  within  24  hours  after  the  cyclone  hit  Fiji,  the 

Australian Defence Force P-8 Aircraft and the New Zealand Defence Force-C130 Aircraft and the 

locally based LifeFlight Fiji provided aerial assessments over Vanua Levu and Koro, as well as the 

other islands in the Eastern Division. This made it easier for NDMO to determine the magnitude of 

the devastations to  better plan and coordinate rapid  deployment of immediate relief and response 

efforts to the severely affected areas.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  five  days  after  we  initiated  our  first  deployment  to  the  North,  the  first 

deployment  to  the  Eastern  Division  left  Suva  for  the  Lomaiviti  Group  on  22nd  December,  2020, 

followed by a deployment to the Lau Group on 24th December, 2020. The transportation of relief 

supplies  to  the  Eastern  Division  was  made  possible  through  the  provisions  of  five  Government

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>vessels which took across more than 150 personnel to conduct emergency food ration distribution 

and damage assessments in villages in the Lomaiviti and Lau Groups. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the teams deployed to the East were, for the first time, issued tablets and 

wifi,  to  carry  out  damage  assessments  on  digital  platforms  that  fed  directly  onto  an  online 

dashboard  that  presented  results  in  real  time.  This  was  the  first  of  its  kind  through  a  partnership 

with  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (UNOCHA),  the 

NDMO and the Bureau of Statistics. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to food ration supplies, non-food items  were also distributed 

by Government to all affected communities to help support and address their needs in the aftermath 

of </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>. These items included; tents, tarpaulins, shelter tool kits, mosquito nets, hygiene kits, 

kitchen  sets,  emergency  response  kits,  sanitary  packs,  buckets,  mother-infant  kits,  bottled  water, 

chainsaws and generators, to name a few. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before we were, again, hit by </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, Government has distributed a total 

of  47,000  emergency  food  ration  packs  worth  $4.1  million  where  31,000  was  distributed  to  the 

Northern  Division;  2,000  to  the Western  Division;  and  13,000  to  the  Eastern  Division.    Included 

with those were the 26,000 non-food items that were distributed across the four Divisions for  </span><span>TC 

Yasa</span><span> alone.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Let  me  touch  on  the  impact  of  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  immediately  after  the  storm 

passed,  close  to  23,413  Fijians  were  temporarily  relocated  to  456  evacuation  centres  -  74 

evacuation  centres  in  the  Northern  Division,  192  in  the  Western  Division,  139  in  the  Central 

Division and a total of 51 evacuation centres in the Eastern Division.  Sir, 48 hours after the storm 

passed the Western Division, this number dropped to 16,937 Fijians in 312 evacuation centres, as 

opposed to the initial 456.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  based  on  the  damage  assessment  conducted  to  date,  an  estimation  of 

139,000  people  and  around  31,000  households  were  directly  affected  by  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>,  with  losses 

estimated at  around $500 million.  A total of 6,184 dwelling houses were partially damaged, and 

2,141 completely destroyed across the four Divisions, as follows:  

</span></p>
<p><span>Northern Division - 1,862 fully destroyed and 5,837 partially damaged; 

 Eastern Division - 277 fully destroyed and 310 partially damaged; and  

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>
</span><span>(2)</span><span>
</span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Western Division - 2 fully destroyed and 37 partially damaged.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  education  sector  was  also  severely  impacted  by  the  recent  Cyclone 

with more than 90 schools damaged across the country, and the Honourable Minister has already 

made a Ministerial Statement and answered questions to that effect as well.   However, I wish to 

add that in the initial planning, particularly on Phase 2 after the initial restoration, one of the key 

decision points was for schools to commence during Phase 2 which was on the rehabilitation and 

recovery period and schools were earmarked to open on 18th January, 2021.  I must, again, applaud 

the efforts taken by all the stakeholders that ensured that we meet that deadline and enabled us to 

achieve that key decision point, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I also wish to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Republic of the Fiji Military Forces 

(RFMF) and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Engineers for the reconstruction, particularly on 

temporary  fixes  and  most  of  those  temporary  fixes  are,  in  fact,  permanent,  apart  from  the  fully 

destroyed, and those with structural damages that will be considered later on as the normal part of 

development activities.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  health  sector,  extensive  damages  were  made  to  25  of  its  health 

facilities  in  Macuata,  Cakaudrove,  Bua  and  Taveuni.    Despite  those  challenges,  the  Ministry  of 

Health  and  Medical  Services  continued  to  work  against  the  odds  to  ensure  basic  health  services 

were  still  available  to  affected  Fijians.    We  supported  the  Ministry  of  Health,  particularly  in 

containing  Leptospirosis,  Typhoid,  Diarrhoea  and  Dengue  Fever  (LTDD)  in  the  North,  we  are 

thankful that it is still at manageable level now and there is no outbreak.  We hope and pray that it 

will  continue  to  be  so,  so  that  we  are  not  distracted  with  the  line  of  operation  that  we  have, 

particularly for </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> respectively.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  agriculture  sector,  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture, 

Waterways and Environment has already briefed this august House on the damages recorded and 

also,  I  must  add,  that  the  NDMO  is  working  very  closely  with  the  team  on  the  ground  to  assist 

where  possible  because  food  security  is  very,  very  critical  and  not  t  only  that,  because  of  our 

transition into livelihood and the empowerment of our rural farmers and fishermen. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of the huge devastation in the Northern Division and the expiry of 

the initial 30-day Declaration for the State of Natural Disaster for the whole of Fiji on 14th January, 

2021,  Government,  through  the  endorsement  of  Cabinet,  announced  the  extension  of  the  30-day 

Declaration only for the Northern Division, effective from 15th January, 2021.  The extension was 

approved by Cabinet in accordance with section 17 of the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 

and upon the advice of the Emergency Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The extension was also foreseen as a proactive measure to allow Government to continue to 

efficiently and effectively coordinate the response phases for </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and to assist with the early 

recovery  phase  of  important  sectors,  such  as  education,  health,  housing  and  food  security.    Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, Fiji was, again, caught in the direct path of </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, 16 days into the extension of the 

30 day Declaration for the State of the Natural Disaster for the Northern Division and only one and 

a half months after </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> hit Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now touch on </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>.  As forecasted back in October, during </span><span>La 

Niña</span><span>  events,  Fiji  usually  experiences  elevated  rainfall  activity.    The  climate  models  were  also 

favoured for above normal rainfall over majority of the Fiji Group during the months of October to 

December and January to March  seasons.  With the  </span><span>La Niña</span><span> event  established and in  view of the 

rainfall outlook, there is an elevated risk of flooding in Fiji over the current wet season.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  exactly  what  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>  brought  to  Fiji,  although  only  Category  2 

Cyclone she brought a lot of rainfall that caused major flooding and associated hazards, including 

landslides  and  damages  to  infrastructure  across  the  four  Divisions  and,  of  course,  in  the  other 

sectors as well. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently the NDMO is wrapping up the initial damage assessments and 

detailed  damage  assessments  for  communities  affected  by  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>.    A  total  of  6,500  households 

have been assessed in the four Divisions and about 31 houses confirmed as fully damaged.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  wake  of  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>  a  total  of  378  evacuation  centres  were  opened  in  all  the  four 

Divisions with a total of 3,186 evacuees sheltered. Let me assure this august House because it was 

initially  identified  as  a  key  decision  point  for  the  Commissioner  Northern  Division,  on  what  is 

happening  now  in  the  Northern  Division.    We  are  running  on  two  parallel  lines  so  that  the 

immediate relief and responses for </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> are addressed and then we will get back onto the main 

line of operation which is the continuation of </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  conclude  by  saying  that  since  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>,  we  have  deployed  an 

additional 40,000 ration packs about to be distributed now particularly in the island communities of 

Vanua Levu and the mainland as well; 2,000 was distributed in the Western Division, particularly 

for  those  in  the  evacuation  centres;  2,000  to  the  Central  Division;  and  36,000  to  the  Northern 

Division.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  wish  to  acknowledge  all  our  partners,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir;  the  Australian  Government,  the 

New Zealand Government, the Republic of China and all those that assisted the Government of Fiji 

in our efforts to restore normalcy back to our communities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me just conclude and once again would like to express Government’s utmost gratitude 

and  appreciation  to  the  development  partners,  NGOs,  business  communities,  first  responders  and 

individuals  for  the  support  and  assistance  rendered  to  our  affected  communities  in  their  times  of 

need.    Again,  I  applaud  the  Vuvale  Partnership  with  the  Australian  Government  and  across  the 

Tasman  as  well  for  all  their  assistance.  The  New  Zealand  Government  stepped  in  with  aerial 

surveying expertise and, of course, they continued to replenish us.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  we speak,  yesterday there was another aircraft that landed from  New 

Zealand that brought in some of the much needed equipment that we asked for, particularly to help 

in our cleaning up of the schools - water pumps, high pressure water blasters and foggers, so that 

we can continue with the clean-up of schools so that schools will resume.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight and acknowledge the sacrifice and commitment 

shown  by  the  disaster  frontline  workers,  who  worked  tirelessly  day  and  night,  sacrificing  their 

Christmas  and  New  Year  in  order  to  help  affected  families  who  were  traumatised  by  the 

devastation of the Cyclone.  This display of sacrifice and commitment shown by our fellow Fijians 

working in severely affected areas was a testimony of human compassion in the face of adversity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me to speak in this august 

House  and  present  a  report  on  the  emergency  response  in  the  recent  catastrophic  events  that 

confronted our beloved Fiji.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker.

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- I rise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to respond to the Honourable Minister’s 

Ministerial Statement.   I thank the Honourable  Minister for covering the emergency phase of the 

natural  disaster, starting  from  our preparedness  phase right  to  the responses that have been done. 

Also, the current status of moving towards rehabilitation and restoration. 

</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, I would like to thank the disaster frontline workers, who all sacrificed and gave 

their life to the duty that they were called for by serving the people out there in the rain, during the 

adverse  weather  in  trying  to  relocate  people  to  higher  grounds  and  also  evacuating  them  to 

evacuation centres.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  also  thank  the  NDMO  for  the  various  text  messages  and  the  Fiji  Meteorological 

Services  for  the  weather  updates.    It  gives  very  formative  information  to  the  people  on  what  to 

prepare for, what to do and what to expect. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  speak  from  the  perspective  of  one  of  the  areas  affected  by  both,  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  and  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>.  

One thing that  these  cyclones really taught  us in Vanua  Levu was to  be  prepared, not  only to  be 

prepared but how to construct our houses to be cyclone resistant.  I think that is an area that needs

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>519 

</span></p>
<p><span>to be properly reviewed and probably have to look into other laws concerning village bylaws and 

other  things  that  govern  the  construction  of  our  houses,  given  that  these  cyclones  will  frequently 

come, given the climate change effects that we have.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On food rations, I think the Honourable Minister, had answered a question that was in our 

Order  Paper  yesterday  with  regards  to  the  complaints  mechanism  that  are  in  place.    There  have 

been issues, and people  need to  be patient.   I have spoken with  the District  Officer  Macuata  and 

other  Government  Officials,  even  members  of  the  public  are  also  complaining  and  bursting  out 

publically, but they need to be patient because things will come.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There  are  other  operational  gaps  that  could  be  improved  later  in  terms  of  assessment.    I 

think, for the assessment team coming to the area, there is a need for a coordinated effort between 

the </span><span>Turaga-ni-Koro</span><span> and all those who are there to identify the houses that were partially and wholly 

affected, those who might need help and those in the evacuation centres.  TheNDMO has those data 

and information that will be fed into the system by the </span><span>Turaga-ni-Koro</span><span>.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We thank the development partners and others who came in, the Good Samaritans, like the 

NGOs,  friends  and  also  religious  groups,  to  give  those  food  ration.    Also  the  Red  Cross  with 

donation of tents, mosquito nets and solar lights, things that are mostly needed in those times. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Probably,  the  issue  now  for  Vanua  Levu,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  would  be  road  access.  The 

Honourable  Minister  is  fully  aware  of  how  we  can  continue  to  have  road  access  into  towns, 

especially  in  getting  food  supplies  into  villages  and  accessing  hospitals  and  other  public  services 

which will be needed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Water  supply  is  very  important.  I  think  there  is  a  big  issue  in  Labasa  on  our  main 

connection in Macuata. I think a proper and new system has to be put in place where repairs need to 

be done, given the constant effects of the climate that has happened. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other thing that probably Government can look into is food security.  I think for most of 

our  plantations,  after  food  rations  finish,  the  cassava  will  also  be  hard  and  will  become  what  we 

term in the Fijian language as </span><span>kadrala</span><span>.  I think there needs to be other things that should come in, 

probably  seedlings  and  plant  suckers,  to  get  in  fast  crops  that  will  help  secure  food  security  for 

those in the rural areas, and also for those in the rural areas who provide vegetables to the Labasa 

and Savusavu markets.  Those are some of the things that we face right now.  There is now lack of 

vegetables and other crops in the Labasa Market and we look forward for the various measures that 

will be put in place, to help them survive so that the Northerners and those affected will not be left 

behind. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, we thank the Australian Government and New Zealand Government for their help in 

assisting our Government in responding to the disasters and we look forward for better partnership 

in the future.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu,</span><span> Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Bulitavu  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate:</span> I</p>
<p><span>now give the floor to the Honourable Qereqeretabua.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I wish to begin 

my response by  registering our sincere thanks to the Honourable Minister for his  quick action  in 

responding to our calls to him, to have some assistance sent to a community in Wainunu, which had 

missed out on aid in the aftermath of severe </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.  Thank you, Honourable Minister. 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the worse-affected  areas  of  Lekutu,  Bua,  Dreketi  and  Seaqaqa,  many 

have lost their entire homes.  As you know, we tragically lost four lives to severe </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.  Crop 

damage has been extensive, many families depended on this, not only for daily subsistence but also 

for income.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It  will  take,  at  least,  six  months  for  many  to  get  back  on  their  feet  and  in  a  post-disaster 

situation, these farmers have no money.  They must urgently look after their own families, rebuild 

their homes and the buildings in their communities.  They are not able to simply go into town to 

buy more seedlings and materials with which to raise them, they need help - quick help to get back 

on their feet with seedlings, land preparation and basic tools, so that they can quickly rehabilitate 

their farms. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In Lekutu and Nasarowaqa, Mr. Speaker, Sir, areas that where we met a parent who told us 

that their food crops had been extensively damaged that it was difficult for them to feed themselves 

and  their  families,  or  to  provide  lunch  for  their  children  to  take  to  school.    It  is  evident  that  in 

several schools, help must be provided directly to schools in the form of food.  Parents are willing 

to help in food preparation and cooking, if they have the material made available to them. 

</span></p>
<p><span>However, the Government needs to act now for the longer term.  For crops to be harvested 

in a few months’ time, they must be planted now.  For school children to complete their lessons and 

pass their exams, help must be given now.  For farmers who must be able to plan ahead for the next 

crop and the next cane payment, they must receive help now.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Critical to all these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is information.  If people know what is happening and 

what will be made available, they can move forward with confidence.  If they know ahead of time 

how Government is going to help them, they can plan ahead and set aside time to use the support 

that Government will give them.   

</span></p>
<p><span>If  people  know  when  they  will  get  help  with  building  materials  and  resources,  the 

community  can  organise  themselves  to  provide  labour  and  plan  for  their  work.    If  farmers  know 

that they would be helped with seedlings and tools, they can prepare their land.  If teachers know 

when help will come to their schools, they can prepare their lessons and plan for how to make up 

for loss teaching time and last of all, the lesson that all of us know from our own professional lives, 

from being in business on our own, the discipline of planning ahead means that we are forced to 

think about the best use of our own resources.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Too often, unplanned disaster relief has meant too little too late - support being provided at 

the wrong times and in the wrong order.  People are forced to change their own plans for self-help 

because  what  has  been  promised  by  Government  has  not  arrived.    Often,  they  have  wasted  their 

own  money  on  food  or  building  materials  or  transport,  only  to  find  out  that  the  same  support  is 

coming to them.   

</span></p>
<p><span>What I am asking for, is for Government to give Parliament and those affected by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>

and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, a proper plan on how help will be given.  A proper plan will set out the information 

that the Government has learnt from the disaster including, who has been affected and how.  It will 

tell us how Government has consulted with the affected communities and others who are available 

to  help.    It  would  help  us  in  detail  about  what  will  be  provided  to  each  affected  community.  

Importantly, it would tell us with reliable information when that help would be delivered.  A proper 

plan  would  tell  us  how  the  Government  is  working  with  NGOs,  community  groups,  aid 

organisations and a lot of businesses, to  make the best  use of all community  resources,  and even 

here, Mr. Speaker, there are problems.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>521 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  now  want  to  focus  on  the  cooperation  between  Government  and  Non-

Governmental  Organisations  (NGOs)  and  CSOs.    Complementary  work  is  important,  more  so  in 

response to disasters.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  terms  of  response,  the  focus  of  CSOs  and  NGOs  are  prioritised  to  community  need.  

When  NGOs  are  funded,  the  NGOS  are  not  in  any  position  to  compete  or  take  a  mandate  of 

Government.  The NGOs work in thematic areas, including but not limited to safety and protection, 

food security and livelihood and water, sanitation and hygiene.  The NGOs are accountable to their 

donors.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It  is  vital,  therefore,  for  Government  to  work  with  NGOs  on  a  level  of  mutual  trust,  Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir.    It  would  be  more  conducive  to  fostering  an  environment  of  mutual  trust,  if 

Government refrain from using the authority card when dealing with NGOs because the NGOs are 

all working in Fiji for the benefit of all Fijians.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all our civil society, NGOs, business houses, faith-

based  organisations  and  each  and  every  one  here  and  overseas  for  the  love  shown  for  families, 

villages and other communities impacted by recent disasters.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Qereqeretabu for her contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, we move on.  I now call on the Honourable Minister for Commerce, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Trade, Tourism and Transport to deliver his Ministerial Statement.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Economic Recovery &amp; Ongoing Support - COVID-19, TC Yasa and TC Ana 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  Honourable  Prime  Minister, 

Honourable  Ministers,  Honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  fellow  Fijians,  I  thank  you  for 

giving me this opportunity to take the floor to make this Ministerial Statement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to start by saying to all of us - we should realise how incredibly blessed we are 

as a nation and as Fijians.  We are blessed because there are thousands, if not, millions of people 

who are still confined to their homes around the world, people who still do not have the luxury to 

carry  out  everyday  activities,  like  go  to  a  bar  after  work  or  even  go  to  the  movies  with  their 

families. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  not  sure  but  I  may  be  the  first  Member  of  Parliament  to  actually 

experience the Fijian quarantine facilities and process and I can tell you that it was seamless, from 

the time I actually departed Nadi International Airport to when I was transferred and quarantined in 

one of our Government designated facilities.  Not only did these frontliners show diligence, detail 

and professionalism, it was done in the true </span><span>Bula </span><span>spirit, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  And I stand in this august 

House sincerely thanking those unsung heroes, not only for the level of care they actually showed 

to me but to the countless number of Fijians and visitors alike. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since Fiji’s borders closed in March 2020, our focus was on stopping any 

possible importation and community transmission of the COVID-19 infection, while ensuring that 

we actually and safely bring Fijians back home and resuming safe economic activity.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  not  an  easy  job  but  we  are  doing  it  anyway  and  we  are  doing  it 

successfully.  This  is  why  reckless requests to  ask that the curfew be lifted, have no place in  the 

current COVID-pandemic environment.  That particular curfew had been put in place and careful 

thought  had  been  given  to  it.    We  must  remember  that  at  the  forefront  of  our  minds,  is  the

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>protection of every single citizen in this country and we are not out of the woods, so these requests 

that come for curfew to be lifted, you should realise what  you are asking for.   It is as reckless as 

you can be at the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  guided  by  the  Fijian  COVID-Safe  Economic  Recovery 

Framework.    It  is  under  this  Framework  that  businesses  started  to  open,  children  returned  to 

schools, domestic and international travels started somewhat and families were re-united.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Cabinet mandated the COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce  (CRMT) which 

has  been  engaging  stakeholders  from  across  all  the  sectors  to  help  in  our  economic  recovery.  

Under  their  management,  we  have  implemented,  managed  and  mitigated  risks  under  each  of  the 

three phases of the Framework.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To-date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CRMT has allowed safe entry of close to 100 pleasure crafts 

under the Blue Lane Initiative of which eight were super yachts, that is, 400 passengers and crews 

arriving and currently exploring our shores, Mr. Speaker.  With the positive socio-economic impact 

of the Blue Lane on Denarau, we have also been exploring the potential of Savusavu as a port of 

entry so that the benefits that come with it are actually shared. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  boost  economic  activity,  investments  and  business  confidence,  we 

approved  74  applications  which  is  the  400  high  net  worth  and  technical  persons  under  the 

significant economic value adding.  Of these 400, approximately 150 technical experts have entered 

Fiji  to  support  major  capital  projects  worth  over  a  billion  dollars,  creating  employment  for  more 

than 600 Fijians.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the academic or education bubble, we have actually facilitated safe 

entry of the first group of international students with the second expected by mid this year.  So, we 

are  essentially  promoting  ourselves  as  a  safe  destination  to  study  in,  whilst  engaging  in  tourism 

activities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji has also been able to market, Mr. Speaker, Sir, its aviation academy by engaging pilots 

to  undertake  training  in  Nadi  and  the  first  batch  of  pilots  successfully  completed  training  in 

November 2020, with the second anticipated to arrive this month. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the pandemic, film productions in Fiji and generally throughout the 

world  were either postponed or  cancelled.   In a  concerted effort to  support our film  industry, we 

have approved a number of productions  under  Film  Fiji  which is  expected to  generate  about  $30 

million in economic activity and more importantly, about 400 local jobs.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  mentioned  earlier  on  during  the  week,  Sir,  </span><span>Survivor</span><span>

will be filming in Fiji with crews expecting to arrive in the next few days.  They have to stagger the 

way they actually come because most of the crews are sitting in different parts of the world but all 

done under the guidance of the Ministry of Health.  We follow the necessary protocol to protect our 

own citizens.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also embarked on the luxury Vacation in Paradise where tourists 

can safely enter and holiday in Fiji, with the quarantine period being part of the holiday experience.  

Domestically, we have been able to open up restaurants, hotels, pubs and bars and, in fact, we have 

had  new  businesses  open  up  over  the  past  few  months.    Sir,  17  local  businesses  that  previously 

operated as nightclubs have remodelled and actually opened as taverns and re-employing about 172 

Fijians.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>523 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these travel pathways and bubbles were facilitated strictly in compliance 

with  our  standard  international  arrivals  protocols,  subject  to  strict  entry  conditions  -  COVID-19 

pre-departure testing, 14-day quarantine on arrival in Government designated quarantine facilities 

and border quarantine exit testing.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, creating a globally consistent approach to balancing risk, mitigation with 

economic recovery while prioritising health and safety is not easy, but we have done a phenomenal 

job.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to actually stress how much work has been put in by the CRMT, 

the  RFMF,  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  and  the  private  sector.    It  is  not  easy 

facilitating  and  managing  the  safe  entry  of  all  those  individuals  and  it  requires  a  great  deal  of 

detailed and logistical planning.  This is why I have said at the beginning, reckless requests do not 

do us any good. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  have  all  heard  this  week,  our  Care  Fiji  Commitment  and  Travel 

Ready Programmes have both recently received global recognition.  We have prepared our industry 

well and rightfully so, because the world is watching.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, every single one of us in this room and every Fijian watching should be 

proud of what we have actually accomplished and not just take it for granted.  We are an extremely 

lucky population around the world.  Of course, we can never be too prepared. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, todate, Tourism Fiji has 187 nominated Wellness Ambassadors with about</p>
<p><span>162 of the Ambassadors successfully completing their training programme.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  significant  demand  for  ‘Work  from  Home’,  a  new  segment  of 

tourism  has  actually  been  realised  -  Remote  Workers.    Fiji’s  unique  positioning  as  a  COVID-

contained tropical destination has given us the opportunity to explore this market. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regionally, we are in initial discussions with our Pacific neighbours, such 

as Nauru and New Caledonia,  on establishing quarantine free travel.   Technical  Working Groups 

will be established to develop operational matters and health system preparedness. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have not forgotten the Bula Bubble, in case the other side of the House 

is  actually  wondering.    Fiji  is  in  high  level  discussions  with  our  Australian  and  New  Zealand 

counterparts, to actually see if we can facilitate quarantine free travel.  Again, this cannot happen 

overnight and there are a whole host of things to consider, and we will continue to lobby for travel 

with our largest markets. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  going  forward,  we  will  continue  to  work  with  the  industry  through  the 

Tourism Recovery Team to  address  operational  challenges and border re-opening strategies.  We 

will also continue to refine and align our Economic Recovery Framework to ensure that we actually 

leverage our current positions to stay ahead of other global tourism destinations. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  initial  stages  of  COVID-19,  our  most  immediate  priority  was  to 

financially equip those Fijians and businesses who needed it most.  The pandemic has affected all 

and its impact is actually wide and far reaching.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  Government,  we  cannot  be  ill-equipped  when  dealing  with  this 

prolonged crisis.  We need reforms that consider the long term needs of our economy, if we are to 

build back stronger.  This Government has the foresight, and saw the need much earlier to forge a

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>more  sustainable  and  inclusive  way  forward,  and  we  have  not  lost  momentum,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 

despite the two cyclones that we have actually just had. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government,  in  the  past  two  years,  has  taken  bold  steps  to 

implement reforms to make doing business in Fiji much easier.  These reforms also will essentially 

form the blueprint to our roadmap to economic recovery.  Businesses have never been freer to try 

fresh ideas and reconsider margins and get creative in how they actually operate.  We want more 

self-starters,  new  business  activities  and  more  opportunities  to  do  business.    That  is  why  we  are 

ensuring our systems and approval processes are streamlined and overall transaction costs and time 

taken is actually minimised. 

</span></p>
<p><span>A key part of our reforms has been a step towards digitalisation of the business registration 

process, bringing tax registration online, with plans to digitalise the building permits process in one 

year.  We have also fast-tracked and streamlined the approval process for obtaining a construction 

permit  for  commercial  or  industrial  purposes  by  establishing  through  the  Building  Permits 

Evaluation Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  taken  proactive  steps  to  remove  the  administrative  burdens  and  reduce 

bureaucratic  obstacles  to  fast-track  approval  processes,  especially  for  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 

Enterprises (MSMEs).  There is now no longer the need, as we all know, for a business licence or 

actual renewal. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  amongst  the  most  vulnerable  and  the  most  important  have  been  our 

MSMEs.  Why?  Because  they  are  actually  the  foundation  of  our  economy.    Therefore,  the 

accelerated and equitable recovery of the economy must stem from ground up.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As  earlier  alluded  to  in  this  Parliament,  support  to  MSMEs  has  been  ongoing.    With  our 

targeted programmes and focussed on those who need it the most, the Fijian Government has paid 

out close to $30 million to more than 5,500 MSMEs as part of the MSME Concessional Loan.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Our hand-holding advisory and business training has actually allowed us to train over 2,000 

</span></p>
<p><span>MSMEs in the most rural communities and we will continue to do so, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as policy makers, we must create an enabling environment, equipped with 

the right resources and access to finance to thrive. There are so many examples that I can provide 

of how we have made positive impacts, but I will name a few.  

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the successful recipients of the micro enterprises loan of $7,000 was actually able to 

purchase some new tools for his business to secure bigger construction jobs and now, keeps nine 

Fijians employed in the West.  

</span></p>
<p><span>A mother of two, who was actually laid off, who is now able to start a poultry business to 

</span></p>
<p><span>sustain an income and support her family.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There was a former finance officer, who used to be in the hotels.  He started a bakery and 

that produces 300 bread loaves a day and looks to expand by adding a second bakery in Rakiraki 

Town, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  are  just  some  examples  of  success.  Investments,  domestic  and 

foreign,  are  critical  for  the  growth  of  industries  and  the  introduction  of  new  industries,  moreso 

during this time when we actually need new investments.

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry has significantly progressed regulatory  reforms in  the area  of investment, in 

response  to  the  needs  of  the  modern  investment  climate.  We  will  soon  have  a  new  investment 

legislation and structure.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also, the recently signed Trade and  Investment Framework (TIFA) with 

the United States is built on the foundation to enhance economic opportunities for sustainable and 

inclusive  development  between  the  two  countries.  The  TIFA  will  provide  a  strategic  framework 

and  principles  for  dialogue  on  trade  and  investment,  with  an  objective  to  increase  economic 

opportunities  between  Fiji  and  the  US.    It  will  be  an  avenue  to  strengthen  cooperation,  facilitate 

market  access  for  goods  and  capitalise  business  to  business  linkages  and  strengthen  capacities  in 

the areas of trade and investment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic, coupled with far too frequent natural disasters, is a human 

crisis and it is actually costing lives. This means any development agreement investment no matter 

how big or small, needs to carry with it the principles of sustainability.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji along with Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway, Costa Rica and Iceland have launched 

negotiations  on  an  agreement  on  climate  change,  trade  and  sustainability.    What  this  means,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, is we are driving a transformative approach that mutually enforces trade, climate and 

environmental policies with sustainability at its core. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing climate change is and will continue to be Fiji’s utmost priority.  

Fijians have been known as resilient  people but  it has not  always been  by choice.  Today, it is  a 

matter of survival for us. The hurt that has been caused by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> has no dollar value   

and can never truly be measured.  

</span></p>
<p><span>When  there  is  a  declaration  of  a  state  of  emergency  for  a  cyclone,  Government  Shipping 

Services  (GSS)  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  transportation  of  officials,  business  sectors  and  health 

experts, utility officers for relief distribution and rehabilitation works. The GSS, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

has  since  its  existence,  been  deployed  to  supply  essential  relief  items  and  supplies  to  the  outer 

islands impacted by these storms. We have not only been connecting islands but also Fijians who 

rely on maritime connectivity.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GSS and also private commercial operators have been instrumental in 

providing relief and emergency items in the aftermath of the tropical cyclones.  If we look at  </span><span>TC 

Harold</span><span>, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana,</span><span> more than 40,000 people were assisted, more than 30 tonnes of aid 

distributed, including food and non-food rations, tarpaulins, tents, hygiene and emergency response 

kits.  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, GSS has carted more than two million litres of water to the 

maritime islands during the dry and drought seasons.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government has and always will continue to ensure that every 

Fijian  has  reasonable  access  to  transportation.  The  Government  Shipping  Franchise  Scheme 

(GSFS) provides services to about 10 uneconomical routes which I have actually mentioned earlier 

on, last year, Sir, which is the only means to access goods and services to thousands of Fijians in 

the maritime region.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has invested $2.6 million towards this Scheme this year and 

through the efforts and commitment of the Fijian Government, we have been able to increase the 

budget for the Scheme and increase the number of routes to be serviced.  This is an indication of 

the importance of our maritime islands to this Government.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  prioritising  the  safe  passage  of  vessels  post-cyclone,  we  also  worked 

closely  with  MSAF  to  ensure  our  aids  to  navigation,  like  lighthouses  and  beacons,  are  in  good 

working  conditions  for seafarers.   Planned maintenance for Cakau Momo, Wakaya Reef,  Levuka 

leading  lights,  North  Ovalau  and  Koro  Island  are  actually  underway.    We  have  also  attended  to 

lighthouses in Lami, Momi, Levuka, Navula Passage, North and South Thurston, Lami Lower Lead 

and Vio Red Lighthouse. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji and the rest of the world remain in choppy waters due to COVID-19, 

but we must all stick together because this is a long hard road.  We will continue to link and market 

Fijian  businesses  locally  and  abroad,  and  collaborate  with  the  Fijian  tourism  sector  to  ensure 

accelerated recovery, whilst sustaining livelihoods for all Fijians.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I thank the Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport for</p>
<p><span>his Ministerial Statement. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to Honourable Tuisawau.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement 

by the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  I note that he has raised 

a few issues  around health  and  I was wondering  whether he has become the Minister for Health.  

All the other issues raised are things we already know, it is acknowledged but it is nothing new. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that we all agree that we are living in extraordinary times 

and  it  is  sad  that  Honourable  Ministers  on  the  other  side  are  living  in  a  dream  world.    The 

Honourable Minister does not talk about boosting the economy and he does not seem to understand 

the state of the economy pre-COVID 19 and now, and continues to pontificate without addressing 

the fundamentals. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government says that the Fijian economy is in line with the 2021 Budget.  We all know 

that the economy was already in recession four years ago but despite the economy in recession, the 

Government  continued  to  be  bullish  on  our  expenditure  and  refuse  to  consolidate  Government 

finances.  The Ministerial Statement confirms this trend. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian economy experiences its largest  ever economic contraction in 

2020  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  -  it  is  a  cover  up.    The  sequence  of  events  following  the 

impact of COVID-19 on the economy and people’s livelihood, the devastation inflicted by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>

and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, have worsened the people’s hope in rebuilding their lives and that of their families to 

normalcy.  I believe the worst is still to come.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  must  recognise  and  be  thankful  to  our  frontline  workers  who  have  sacrificed  family 

time and comfort, to ensure that the pandemic is contained through initiatives as mentioned by the 

Honourable Minister in terms of procurement of vaccines, et cetera.  I urge the Government to take 

a more cautious and phased approach rather than trying to fast-track the opening of our borders to 

allow tourists, yachts, et cetera.  The lives of our citizens matter more than trying to bring in those 

tourists.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that, we would not be putting all our eggs in one basket, we 

have  very  little  control  or  no  control  at  all  of  the  processes,  procedures,  standards,  protocols  in 

different  jurisdictions.    Therefore,  we  must  always  be  conscious  and  vigilant  in  our  efforts  to 

contain the pandemic.

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>527 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  do  not  have  the  capacity  in  terms  of  facilities  and  resources  to  be  able  to  effectively 

cope with the second wave.  I believe our ability to cope, if there is another outbreak due to laxity, 

will  be  disastrous  from  our  already  overstressed  health  system  and  lack  of  our  support 

infrastructure. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the latest report issued by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) clearly indicates 

that  global  economic  conditions  remain  fragile  due  to  the  daily  increase  in  COVID-19  cases  in 

many parts of the world.  The Bula Bubble as already mentioned, we do not know when that will 

happen, given the current news that we have about these various strains. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The largest ever economic contraction in 2020, as stated by the Honourable Minister, poses 

the greatest challenge for a narrow-based economy like ours.  The performance of key sectors of 

our  economy  continues  to  decline  and  unfortunately,  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Commerce, 

Trade, Tourism and Transport has not mentioned it. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Our visitor arrivals have declined and if you look at the Budget document, there are some 

projections there which are totally way out of line and they have not corrected it in terms of visitor 

arrivals.  Electricity fell by 10.12 percent; cement, -4.1 percent; gold, -10.5 percent; timber, -11.4 

percent and mahogany, -22.5 percent.  The only sector that grew is the agriculture sector.  There is 

also a decline in consumption spending which has led to reduction in VAT collections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  have  taken  time  to  highlight  sector  performances.    The  decline  of  performance  in  those 

key  sectors  have  implications  on  employment  opportunities  and  Government  finances.    Today, 

more  than  120,000  people  have  lost  their  source  of  livelihood  mostly  in  the  tourism  sector  as 

mentioned.  These observations have not been noticed by the other side of the House.  These are 

based  on  the  analysis  and  date  from  the  Bureau  of  Statistics,  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  but  it  is  not 

plucked out of thin air.  It is unfortunate that the Honourable Minister for Trade continue to turn a 

blind eye on the sound advice that is necessary for adjustments in terms of our moving forward.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government finances are in a precarious state, Government debts increased four folds; 

from $2.5 billion in 2006 to almost $9 billion today.  Instead of consolidating finance, Government 

has continued spending on the consumption and continued borrowing finance consumption driven 

economy  rather than encourage capital  formation.  These debts  to  be refrained, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

and it is no use pontificating about all these initiatives when this debt continues to grow. So, we are 

currently in a debt, Sir, which continue to spiral downwards.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the sake of our nation and our people, I call on the Government again 

to take a more bipartisan approach to work with the common goal with all of us including, not only 

us,  but  also  the  private  sector,  Civil  Society  Organisations,  trade  unions  and  have  a  national 

economic summit which they have refused to do until now. The problem is, they think that they are 

always right and they will never listen to the other side or any other sectors of our society. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Minister,  what  happen  to  the  $1,000  cash 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution that they were distributing prior to the 2018 Elections.  Will that happen again or not? 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  question,  I  have  there  was  no  initiative  or  something  on  youth  business.   What 

about youth employment for cash?  There are a lot of civil project works that need to be done and 

we  can  employ  our  youth  in  that,  given  the  high  unemployment  of  our  youth  and  the  restriction 

placed on the scholarship by the Honourable Minister of Economy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution and to end, I would like to ask the other side of the 

House  what  is  happening  to  the  homes  rehabilitation  and  repairs,  in  terms  of  the  two  cyclones,

<p><span>Ministerial Statements 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>where  is  the  programme?    Is  there  any  programme  being  formulated?  The  last  time  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>

came, the initiative was taken up by the private sector and there are problems with those, in terms 

of delivery, unavailability of material, et cetera.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  all  these  point  to  the  problems  with  the  public  sector  review,  doing  away  with  the 

hurricane  relief  department,  the  public  sector  reforms,  in  terms  of  moving  a  lot  of  roles  for  the 

PWD to the Construction  Implementation Unit,  without the proper expertise in  that unit and also 

the tenders which delays a lot of things. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  that  is  my  contribution  and  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  and  hope  that  all  our 

</span></p>
<p><span>contributions today will be taken into account in moving forward. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Ro Tuisawau for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I now give the floor to the Honourable Leader of the National Federation Party.  You have 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable 

Minister  for  his  Statement.    In  fact,  some  of  the  plans  and  processes  that  he  has  outlined  are 

important  and  they  need  to  continue  with  that.   We  need  to  plan  those  things,  but  much  of  it,  of 

course, is continued upon when and how the borders open, when and how we are going to get our 

tourists back into the country. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the survival of the tourism industry, as we all know, is at stake.  We have 

no  choice,  but  also  we  cannot  wait  much  longer  to  ensure  that  our  hotels  and  the  other 

infrastructure, I mean, if the period that we are looking at or hoping in which we would be able to 

get  tourism  back  on  track  to  some  extent  is  unpredictable,  we  do  not  know  and  there  is  a  lot  of 

uncertainty  out  there.    Therefore,  I  think  it  is  important  for  us  to  ensure  that  we  are  ready  -  our 

investors  and  operators  in  the  tourism  industry  are  ready  to  receive  tourists  whenever  this  global 

crisis ends. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of our tourism industry in this country 

operates are Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and much of that 80 percent SMEs are actually 

owned by Fiji  citizens.  In fact,  much of the employment within the tourism industry, if  you add 

them altogether – if you look at all the big operators, the large hotels, and then you look at those 

employed in the SMEs, they probably represent about 70 percent to 80 percent of the workers.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is    not  only  the  responsibility  of  the  Honourable  Minister 

responsible for Tourism and I can understand why he would have concentrated on looking at some 

of the plans, proposals  and facilitating investment  in  that sector, and as  I have said, they need to 

carry that on.  But I think the bigger responsibility of ensuring that thousands of workers, any SME 

in the tourism industry which is struggling today and which need to be supported, I do not see any 

kind of comprehensive plan or a process where they can get the help.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  remember,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  had  suggested  a  worker  solidarity  fund.    I  mean,  the 

Government reduced the FNPF contribution and is saving close to about $4 million to $5 million a 

month.    So  there  are  many  workers  out  there  who  do  not  have  access  to  what  the  Honourable 

Minister was saying.  I mean, there are some good examples of that $7,000, $14,000, $21,000 loan 

scheme that SMEs could get but it is a very small amount.  Many thousands (I know) are out there, 

struggling to make ends meet.

</span></p>
<p><span>High Court (Amendment) Bill 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>529 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for the Government to consider a fund for all 

those workers  who have lost jobs,  who are struggling to  put  food on the table.   I was told by  an 

NGO representative in Nadi and she was complaining to us about everyone concentrating in Vanua 

Levu and not worried about how parents were struggling to get their children to school.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Hon. R.S. Akbar interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  can  hear  the  interjection  from  the 

Honourable  Minister  for  Education.    Perhaps,  she  cannot  see  some  of  those  through  her  heavily-

tinted Prado.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Let me also quote this figure, Mr. Speaker. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 

(HIES) Report has just come out on Monday and the survey was conducted in the period February 

2019 to February 2020, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  What it shows, of course, is 

that, Fiji’s official poverty head count rate for 2019 and 2020 is estimated at 29.9 percent, almost 

an increase of about two percent from the last Household HIES in 2013 and 2014. 

</span></p>
<p><span>What  this  means,  Mr,  Speaker,  is  that,  if  you  look  at  about  30  percent  of  those  below 

poverty line at any time,  in this country about 20 percent to 25 percent of individuals or families 

are on the margins of poverty.  And I think what has happened in the last one year because of the 

pandemic and because thousands of people have lost jobs, the poverty rate, Mr. Speaker, could be 

well be over 50 percent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  think,  Government  should  not  ignore  that,  but  should  come  out  and  look  at  a  package 

which, I said the other day, on health, education and income support.  This is what we need to do 

until we get the economy back on track, until the pandemic is over because these three focus areas 

will help sustain the economy and will create a level of demand that will be sustainable and we can 

carry on until we see the light at the end of the tunnel when this pandemic is over.  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> I thank the Leader of the National Federation Party for his contribution</p>
<p><span>to the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable  Members,  that  ends  the  Ministerial  Statement  and  the  debate  on  the  Agenda 

</span></p>
<p><span>item.  We move on. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members,  I now call upon the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for 

</span></p>
<p><span>Economy, Civil Service and Communications to move his motion.  You have the floor, Sir.
