<h3>NATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEM BILL 2020</h3>
<p><span>NATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEM BILL 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the Resolution of Parliament 

on Friday, 11th December, 2020, I now move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That the National Payment System Bill 2020  (Bill No. 48/2020) be debated, voted 

</span></p>
<p><span>upon and be passed.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the debate is limited to one hour, pursuant to the 

Resolution  of  Parliament.    I  now  call  upon  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  to  speak  on  his 

motion. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. By way of brief background, 

the National Payment System Bill 2020 was tabled in Parliament on Friday, 11th December, 2020, 

as  Bill  No.  48  of  2020  and  was  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on Justice,  Law  and  Human 

Rights  for  review.    Following  their  consultations,  the  Standing  Committee  tabled  their  Review 

Report on 9th February, 2021, which is earlier on this week. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scope of the  Central  Bank’s powers regarding payment services has 

evolved  quite  tremendously  over  the  past  number  of  years,  mainly  driven  by  the  continuous 

evolution of the market and the growing importance of payment systems to financial stability.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  past,  the  Central  Bank  would  only  focus  on  systematically  important  payment 

systems.  Nowadays,  their  focus  includes  a  broad  range  of  providers  for  those  payment  services, 

thus  further  elevating  and  enhancing  the  regulatory  tools  in  widening  the  objectives  of  their 

mission.    This,  in  particular,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  includes  non-financial  institutions  involved  in 

payment services, either directly as a payment service provider, or as an agent of a payment service 

provider, or by outsourcing via a payment service provider.  This is due to the fact that the safety 

and efficiency of the payment system requires monitoring of all relevant factors and actors in the 

market, including those not traditionally covered by the Central Bank’s supervision, and things like 

M-PAiSA comes to mind.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, interestingly enough, even after COVID-19, there has been a huge influx 

of payments from overseas through the M-PAiSA system. So a lot more families and friends who 

live  overseas  are  now  sending  smaller  amounts  and,  in  fact,  the  number  of  remittances  have  not 

dropped significantly.  The additional focus on retail payment, Mr. Speaker, empowers the Central 

Bank  to  also  address  consumer  protection  issues,  to  ensure  the  fair  treatment  of  payment 

instruments uses regardless of the nature of payment.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Central  Bank  has  started  to  generally  refer  to  the  national  payment 

system as an autonomous concept to exercise general oversight powers of the whole sector.  This 

means  that  the  Central  Bank,  in  addition  to  the  regulation  of  payment  system  instruments,  is  in 

charge of facilitating a payment system strategy for the country.  It also permits the Central Bank to 

establish  general  guidance  principles  for  the  market,  to  permeate  not  only  its  direct  action 

regulating the market, but also that of any other relevant stakeholder, including the private sector.

</span></p>
<p><span>National Payment System Bill 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  (RBF),  of  course,  is  our  Central  Bank  and  it 

follows  regulatory  trends  in  line  with  international  standards  and  best  practice.    I  think  someone 

from  the back mentioned  about  the green bonds, which is  very much active in  the London Stock 

Exchange - not just the green bonds but other bonds, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They are what we call, debt 

securities market, that includes Government Bonds and Treasury Bills, and as such are issued under 

physical paper-based certificate forms.  So, in other words, it gets typed in the typewriter, they fill 

out the names and give a physical certificate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>What will happen through this National Payment System with the technology it can adopt 

under that is that, it will introduce what we call the dematerialisation of securities, in other words, 

securities  are  actually  held  in  electronic  form  through  the  implementation  of  central  securities 

depository, an Automated Transfer System which, of course, impacts the timeliness and efficiency 

of  the  trading  support  and  development.    Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  leads  to  the  liquidity  of  the 

financial  securities  market,  which  also  enhances  secondary  market  trading  which  we  have  talked 

about on a continuous basis.   

</span></p>
<p><span>All  of  these,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  aligns  to  Government’s  5  to  10  Years  Development  Plan, 

including the 20-Year Development Plan.  Interestingly enough, the other Pacific Island Countries 

are trying to  also implement  this and  they  include;  Samoa, Vanuatu,  Solomon  Islands and Papua 

New  Guinea.    We  need  to  do  this  very  quickly  because  we  actually  want  to  stay  ahead  of  the 

ballgame.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General:</span> Honourable  Members,  the</p>
<p><span>floor is now open for debate on this motion.  Honourable Bulitavu. You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise, again, this afternoon to give 

my short contribution on the Bill.  I think other Honourable Members who would like to speak after 

me would also give their views on what they perceive on the Bill, but I will report as a Member of 

the Committee and also after reviewing this particular Bill and conducting public consultation with 

various stakeholders, that should not try to prevent other Members who might also want their views 

known in the debate. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There were issues on certain words and phrases in the Bill and the interpretation provisions.  

I think the Committee came up with  the opinion that the Bill  was drafted following international 

standards regarding the payment system and I think that is well covered. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As we all know and as the Honourable Attorney-General has alluded to, the Reserve Bank 

of Fiji (RBF) will be the regulatory body that will be looking after the Bill and also administering 

it.  There were views shared to the Committee that excessive powers were given to the RBF in their 

regulatory powers, but we thought that there are necessary safeguards in the Bill that covers that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, it mirrors international best practices and it will enable Fiji’s payment system to be in 

line  with  international  standards.  Not  only  that,  the  National  Payment  System  will  also  create 

stability  in  our  national  financial  system  and  also  create  investor  confidence  and  economic 

development  for  those  who  want  to  come  to  Fiji.    We  need  economic  development  as  a  nation 

moving forward.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As the Honourable Attorney-General has alluded to, it also mirrors down to achieving our 

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims and also towards our National Development Plan, and 

a well-functioning regulated financial sector is the key driver to any economic development.

<p><span>National Payment System Bill 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>565 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Bill will bring the necessary regulatory framework, as I have said, which is envisioned 

to improve efficiency and stability.  Those were some of the things that we saw were important for 

us to raise from the Committee’s view and also from those who came to provide submissions.  Post 

Fiji came and other financial providers that were there, will be part of this in the implementation 

stage.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We see the purpose of improving our financial sector and our payment system in Fiji which 

can directly be linked to the social, economic and political development of our country.  Therefore, 

as  a  Member  of  the  Committee,  given  that  we  had  consensually  agreed  on  the  Bill  and  we  are 

reporting back to Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing the Committee to  travel  around the country 

and interact and accept  presentations and submissions from various stakeholders, especially those 

financial institutions on the Bill.  We thank the Secretary-General, the Parliamentary staff, the other 

Honourable Members and the members of the public who came to hear and gave their views.  This 

has allowed the Committee to form an opinion and make a comprehensive report to Parliament and 

we are satisfied that the Bill, as presented, is alright.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu,</span><span> Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Bulitavu for his contribution to the debate:</span></p>
<p><span>I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and 

</span></p>
<p><span>Community Development.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to contribute to the</p>
<p><span>motion that is before the House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Payment System Bill  2020 is an important Bill designed to 

ensure Fiji’s banking, payments and security systems effectively respond to the ongoing evolution 

in modern payment practices across the globe. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current tech-savvy generation is driving demand for a quick seamless, 

personalised and better national payment system.  This has led to many countries around the globe 

trying to develop and implement a modernised real-time payment system with the ultimate vision to 

drive  change  from  traditional  payment  systems,  such  as  cheques,  credit,  debit,  prepaid  card,  et 

cetera.  The transition can contribute to an enabling environment in which consumers,  merchants, 

financial institutions and the Government can make payment at the drop of a hat, either locally or 

globally.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  development  of  an  efficient  national  payment  system  is  crucial  for  Fiji  to  develop  a 

smart  economy  and  promote  real-time  payments  24/7,  365  days.    This  would  not  only  enhance 

economic activity but will also help achieve broader societal objectives, such as improving access 

to financial services to all Fijian citizens, hence strengthening the financial inclusion and payment 

ecosystems.  It will enable safe and reliable digital transactions.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  national  payment  system  will  enhance  convenience  and  efficiency  for  both,  the 

consumers  and  businesses.    It  will  provide  an  open  and  interoperable  national  e-payment 

infrastructure.  The national payment system will reduce the cost of exchanging goods and services.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  consumers  are  now  making  regular  payments  to  a  plethora  of  service 

providers  in  Fiji  and  internationally.    They  are  doing  this  in  a  multitude  of  ways  that  we  could 

never have imagined five years ago.

</span></p>
<p><span>National Payment System Bill 2020 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the benefit of the digital world we live in, but it also means there 

needs to be increased vigilance and adequate oversight behind the scenes.  Consumers need to be 

confident,  as  they  undertake  transactions,  knowing  that  their  payments  and  their  rights  while 

making those payments are protected.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Consumers  must  know  that  there  is  adequate  security  covering  the  electronic  transfer  of 

their funds.  They need to be confident that the use of the latest technology by service providers in 

areas, such as storing of money on electronic devices, will be regulated through the strength of this 

legislation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consumers  also  need  to  know  that  there  are  rules  in  place  to  protect  them  when  error  or 

fraud  occurs  in  the  payment  system.    Increasingly,  the  speed  and  efficiency  of  the  payments  and 

security system is, of course, essential and this Bill will underpin this reform with a strong set of 

rules within a regulatory framework   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Payment  System  Bill  2020  brings  together  all  of  these 

elements, and I congratulate everyone behind the scene for identifying the breadth of issues and the 

need for this change.  I thank them for delivering a comprehensive legal instrument to protect Fiji’s 

economy, the payment securities and banking systems and last, but not least, our consumers.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House.  Thank you.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for her contribution  to the debate:</span> Is</p>
<p><span>there anyone else wishing to take the floor?   

</span></p>
<p><span>That  not  being so,  I invite the Honourable Attorney-General  for his  Right of Reply.  You 

</span></p>
<p><span>have the floor, Sir.

<p><span>Honourable Members for supporting this Bill.    

</span></p>
<p><span>I  have  nothing  further  to  comment,  but  just  to  say  essentially  that  the  passing  of  this  Bill 

will allow the RBF to very quickly adopt those technologies within the legal framework that will 

actually put us in a much better space in the financial system and the ease of doing business, as well 

as  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  our  citizens  and  also  making  Fiji  a  hub  of  financial  activity.
