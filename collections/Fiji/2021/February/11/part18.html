<p><span>REVIEW REPORT - OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER 2015 ANNUAL REPORT 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I move:</p>
<p><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report of the Office of the Prime Minister 2015 

</span></p>
<p><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 14th May, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  now  invite  the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on</p>
<p><span>Justice, Law and Human Rights to speak on his motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  take  this  opportunity,  as  the 

Member moving the motion, to make a small contribution on the Committee’s Report on the Office 

of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As a way of brief background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Prime Minister is driven 

by the vision of having a better and modernised nation State, achieved through strong and robust 

leadership and fair development for all. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  2015  Annual  Report  was  referred  to  the  Standing 

Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights in the last term of Parliament and then reinstated in 

this new Parliament and referred to the current Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  is  primarily  responsible  for  providing  sound  policy, 

administrative and technical support to the Head of Government, the Honourable Prime Minister.  

It  also  engages  with  international  and  regional  development  partners,  civil  society  organisations 

and the private sector.  Just  as the previous Committee, the current  Committee was mandated by 

Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back to Parliament on its findings. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Gathering from the Annual Report of the Office, 2015 had numerous highlights from being 

responsible for providing support services to the Honourable Prime Minister in his first year in that 

role in a democratically elected Government to various contributions to the governance, economic 

and socio-cultural sectors.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  reviewing  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  2015  Annual  Report,  the  Committee  noted 

that  one  of  the  key  achievements  was  on  its  accountability  framework  which,  according  to  the 

Office of the Prime Minister’s 2015 Annual Corporate Plan, includes: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>facilitation in decision-making;  

support for civil society;

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>589 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>improve co-operation with international and regional agencies; and  

client complaint investigation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  noted  the  previous  Committee’s  deliberation  which  highlighted  a  few 

pertinent issues, which the previous Committee discussed extensively with the Office of the Prime 

Minister and is covered in this Committee Report.   These pertinent issues, include: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>the utilisation of the approved budget; 

the forms of complaints received by the Office; 

the details and status of the Vatukoula Social Assistance Trust Fund; and 

clarification on certain perceived financial anomalies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  sought  clarification  from  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  held 

discussions regarding the same.  This provided the Committee an indication of all the work carried 

out by the Office of the Prime Minister in meeting its commitments and its vision and mission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  also  took  into  consideration  the  requirements  of  the  Standing  Orders  of 

Parliament with  respect  to  the principles of  gender equality.   Therefore,  as part of the discussion 

with  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  it  was  encouraging  to  note  how  the  principle  of  gender 

equality was reflected in the Ministry, beginning with one of the vital parts of an institution which 

is Human Resource.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the conclusion of the review, my Committee established that the response provided by 

the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  on  issues  raised  about  the  Report  was  satisfactory  and  had 

provided  the  needed  clarification.    The  Committee  also  provided  one  key  recommendation  the 

Committee had put forward for the consideration by the Office of the Prime Minister.  

</span></p>
<p><span>With  those  few  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  urge  the  Honourable  Members  of  this 

august House to take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report, and to show support for the 

motion before the House.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Deputy Chairperson:</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  Honourable Prime 

</span></p>
<p><span>Minister, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.:</span> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to speak on the motion</p>
<p><span>by the Honourable Sharma.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Prime Minister remains unique, in the sense that it does 

not solely focus on executive support to me as the Head of the Government and Cabinet, as is the 

case with other Offices of the Prime Ministers around the world.  The Office of the Prime Minister 

is  also  responsible  for  policy  analysis,  managing  pension  payments  for  former  parliamentarians, 

former  Prime  Ministers  and  Presidents,  implementation  of  community  projects  through  Small 

Grants Scheme (SGS) and providing subvention funds to minority communities.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  2015,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  also  had  a  monitoring  role, 

monitoring  and  implementation  of  all  Government  Departments  through  their  respective  Annual 

Corporate Plans.  My Government has an Open Door Policy and I am proud that our ears are open 

to the concerns of ordinary Fijians.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister’s  Client  Services  Unit,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  receives  and 

addresses  complaints  from  the  public,  ensuring  that  complaints  are  taken  seriously  and  then 

recorded and retained so that programmes and processes can be improved.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2015 alone, my Office received more than 1,000 complaints from members of the public, 

civil  society  and  the  private  sector.    Land  cases  were  a  major  source  of  complaints  received, 

followed by labour issues and FNPF requests for withdrawal.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Media  Unit  also  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  informing  the  public  of  how  Government’s 

activities affect  them by engaging through the Fijian media, radio  talkback show and community 

consultation meetings.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review highlighted that the Office of the Prime Minister achieved one 

of  its  key  objectives,  the  development  of  the  Accountability  Framework  which  aims  to  facilitate 

sound decision-making, support for civil society and improved cooperation with international and 

regional agencies.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  respect  to  gender  equality,  I  am  particularly  proud  that  the  Report 

shows there is an equal percentage of women and men employed by the Office.  I believe that the 

Office of the Prime Minister ought to lead the way in modelling gender equality.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  achieved  an  excellent 

performance rating in 2015.  Thanks to the timely and effective implementation of programmes and 

projects.  Assisting the education of underprivileged children in our society was part of our agenda 

in 2015 and the MOU with the Foundation for the Education of the Needy Children in Fiji (FENC 

Fiji)  was  signed  for  a  total  grant  amount  of  $200,000  and  in  all,  1,117  students  were  assisted 

through FENC. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In terms of development co-operation assistance, the Office coordinated the implementation 

of five projects with the assistance from China at a total cost of approximately $67 million.  This 

assistance funded the completion of key projects, such as: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span><span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>the new Somosomo Hydro Power Supply in Taveuni, Cakaudrove;  

agriculture development in Vanua Levu; 

a mushroom cultivation project in Legalega, Nadi; and the  

reconstruction of Stinson Parade and Vatuwaqa Bridges. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With regards to the SGS, we funded a total of 123 projects from a budgetary allocation of 

$7 million.  My Government regards spending on education as the best investment we can make in 

the future of the country.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, a majority of the projects implemented under 

the SGS were from the Education Sector.  However, community and settlement development and 

integrated development were also supported from the SGS. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, priorities for SGS funding were identified during my official tours to the 

various  Divisions  and  from  having  face-to-face  discussions  with  communities  and  institutions, 

which  I  have  continued  to  carry  out  over  the  years.    These  projects  all  have  some  degree  of 

urgency,  they  are  all  verified  by  Divisional  Commissioners  and  endorsed  for  submission  to  my 

Office  for  further  assessment,  verification  and  compliant  with  proper  Government  procurement 

processes before final  approval.  This has been an important means of providing urgently needed 

improvements to local communities quickly and efficiently.

<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>591 

</span></p>
<p><span>As is usually the case with projects carried out under the SGS, there were no provisions for 

those projects in the 2015 Budget,  yet they were extremely important to  local communities.  The 

SGS allowed us to be responsive, and it still does. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  immediately  after  the  2014  General  Elections,  I  established  the 

Implementation  Coordination  Office  (ICO),  mainly  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Ministry’s 

Corporate and Strategic Plan.  The ICO monitors Ministries and Departments and key stakeholders 

of Government, to ensure that key programmes and activities are implemented effectively and meet 

their  intended  objectives  and  that  the  funds  allocated  to  Ministries  and  Departments  are  well 

utilised.  This has resulted in 36 percent average ACP implementation level across Government.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  addition,  a  Public  Relations  and  Media  Unit  was  established  to  conduct  consultations, 

focussing  on  the  endorsed  2013  Constitution.    A  total  of  300  consultations  were  carried  out, 

involving approximately 10,000 people in all Divisions, including Rabi and Kioa. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Finally,  the  needs  and  welfare  of  minority  communities  in  Fiji  are  well  protected  and 

catered for by my Office.  Minority communities, such as Rotuma, Rabi, Kioa and the Melanesian 

</span><span>Vasu-i-Taukei</span><span> received the sum of $464,000 for their operational and development initiatives in the 

period under review. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Office  will  always  faithfully  oversee  the  consistent  execution  of 

programmes and implementation of policies to improve the lives of Fijians.  It must ensure strong 

leadership and uphold high standards of public service.  My Government will leave no one behind 

in  our  journey  towards  a  better  Fiji,  and  my  Office  will  continue  to  carry  out  its  duties  for  the 

betterment of all Fijians.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Based on those explanations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, support the motion.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON.  SPEAKER.:</span> I  thank  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  for  his  contribution  to  the</p>
<p><span>debate.  Honourable Jale, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  JALE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  wish  to  thank  the  Chairman  and  the 

Members  of  the  Committee  for  the  Report  and  I  hereby  support  the  motion.    There  has  been  a 

marked  improvement  in  the  submission  of  Annual  Reports  from  what  I  have  been  observing.    I 

think  it  was  a  concern  sometimes  in  the  past,  but  there  has  been  a  marked  improvement  on  the 

timely submission of Reports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  regards  to  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office,  although  we  are  debating  the  2015  Annual 

Report, I have noted recently, that there have been new Reports that have been tabled in this House 

and  I thank the Honourable Ministers for the  work that  you have done in bringing the  reports of 

your Ministry in a timely way to the Parliament, so that we can scrutinise and understand how the 

budget that had been allocated to your ministry, has been spent.  I thank you for that.  

</span></p>
<p><span>One  of  the  suggestions  that  I  want  to  put  through  to  improve  this  timely  submission  of 

annual reports, it was not being done before or it has not been done, maybe the key result areas in 

the  performance  agreements  for  the  Permanent  Secretary  needs  to  have  “timely  submission  of 

annual reports to ministers” as one of their indicators - I am just putting that to  you.   I think the 

Report is quite elaborate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Prime Minister has also divulged further on what the Office of the Prime 

Minister has been doing and producing the service and helping the people of Fiji through what is 

expected  of  that  particular  Office.  As  far  as  transparency  and  accountability,  I  think  that  is  an 

</span></p>
<p><a name="94">Page 94</a></p>
<p><span>592 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>important  element  of  scrutinising  annual  reports,  88  percent  of  the  budget  of  the  Office  of  the 

Prime Minister was utilised in 2015.  There have been explanations as to the reason why the others 

were not used.  There were 16 other matters that needed clarification and I noted from the Report of 

the Committee that those were also addressed by the Office of the Prime Minister.  Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, that is all in my contribution. Thank you very much.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Anare Jale:</span> Honourable Mitieli Bulanauca, you</p>
<p><span>have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will just refer to a few concerns 

here  by  the  Committee.    One  clarification  on  the  form  of  complaints  to  the  Office  of  the  Prime 

Minister,  mostly  referring  to  family  and  housing  assistances  and  referred  to  Ministry  of  Women, 

Children and Poverty Alleviation. The concern here is, have they been resolved or not. It is just that 

they  have  put  it  in  their  Report,  it  appears  that  there  is  no  feedback  whether  they  have  been 

resolved or not.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly,  on  clarification  of  the  criteria  and  procedure  followed  with  respect  to 

reengagement of employees after reaching the age of 55.  It is important to set a criteria to be met 

by all those engagements. It appears that the criteria is not clear to ensure transparency and to avoid 

nepotism  as  is  quite  prevalent  in  public  service  departments  and  various  commercial  entities  that 

we do have.  To me, rather than just having a working age of  55, it is  better to  just have a clear 

criteria of health and performance, and they push on.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Thirdly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  concern  of  the  Committee  is  the  clarification  on  the 

Mahogany  Industry  Council  and  the  issues  being  faced  in  relation  to  the  issuance  of  mahogany 

licences.      This  is  dealt  with  by  the  Mahogany  Industry  Council  of  which  the  Honourable  Prime 

Minister  is  the  Chairman  and  Honourable  Attorney-General  is  a  member,  and  facilitated  through 

the  Fiji  Hardwood  Corporation  Limited.    Although  this  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  four  years 

behind (2015), so that emphasises that you need the annual reports soon after the year ends, in the 

first year or in the second year.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Also, particularly for this mahogany industry, the production has dropped during the year.  

In 2010 – 96,000 cubic metres, 2011 – 46,000 cubic metres, 2014 – 54,000 cubic metres, 2015 – 

52,000  cubic  metres.    It  has  dropped.    Let  me  also  tell  you  that  the  figures  after  2015  has  even 

further dropped - from 52,000 cubic metres in 2015 to 18,600 in 2016.  In 2017, only 2,000 cubic 

metres. That is the year they reviewed the licences and they stopped the operations. Why stop the 

operations?  You  can  do  your  review  but  keep  the  operations  going.  In  2018  only  15,000  cubic 

metres. In 2019 only 15,000 cubic metres but 2020, I do not know yet, but we will know soon.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2015  the  export  volume  also  dropped  from  25,000  cubic  metres  to 

18,000  cubic  metres.    To  go  further  than  that,  last  year  it  went  down  to  10,000  cubic  metres.  

Again,  it  is  a  drop  during  the  period  of  the  report  and  it  also  dropped  after  that.    Export  value 

increased from $30 million to $36 million in 2015 and then dropped after that to $10 million or $12 

million.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Even though the report lapsed in 2015, I am focusing onto the future.  Whatever weaknesses 

that we may have in the past I am trying to highlight that we need to improve into the future.  We 

need to ask why we are dropping in production export value, when we have the best plantation in 

the world here in Fiji.  Is it due to high log prices?  I see that they dropped the prices in 2020 by 30 

percent but still that is not enough to stimulate the industry into operation then to performance.  

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Member, just stick to the report for 2015.</p>
<p><a name="95">Page 95</a></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>593 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking on the drop of production in 

the period of 2010 to 2015 and the various questions that need to be asked to improve in the future.  

Is there availability of market or lack of it?  Do you need competition for that demand?  Is there a 

high cost of doing businesses that they do not agree?  Stringent licence conditions or stringent tax 

conditions? Whether the Fiji Hardwood Corporation and industry structure may be inadequate, they 

need review.   

</span></p>
<p><span>High  cost  particularly  in  the  forest  activities  for  example  in  the  cartage  area,  the  milling 

area, and the processing area in  the timber  yard, also  need  efficiency in  all areas.   Although we 

need  efficiency  of  the  mills  to  increase  the  recovery  rate  from  34  percent  to  50  percent,  now  we 

should  be  aiming  at  55  percent  to  60  percent  in  the  next  five  years  so  that  we  can  have  more 

volume for export.  It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to notice the reduction in production, export 

volume and value and make our ways to improve into the future. Any help to finance machines and 

equipment for landowners has not been done since the SDL Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we need is a petition for a Parliament Standing Committee to inquire 

into the mahogany industry and come up with recommendations. They can recommend what Acts 

or  laws  need  to  be  amended  or  have  new  laws.      They  can  come  to  Parliament  with 

recommendations to the Executive on how departments, ministries or commercial companies of the 

Government can improve on their performance, production, processes and systems.  They can also 

refer  to  the  Judiciary  whatever  is  needed  to  be  referred  there,  be  it  a  criminal  case  or  criminal 

actions  within the industry to  be referred to  the Police or FICAC, or to  Court. That  is  the way it 

should go, we need that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Just to finish, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is being done now for the </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> damages and the 

fallen mahogany trees?  I understand that 30 percent of mahogany in Wainunu forest, which is the 

third biggest forest in this country, has fallen.  Also in Dreketi, 20 percent of mahogany has fallen 

down - has there been any survey on that?  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Why  was  there  no  survey?    Do  you  know  the  effect  this  will 

make to the industry?  What is the value of those damages?  Have salvage operations been done or 

not?  For the pine and native timber as well  - we need some information. So it is important, Mr. 

Speaker.,  Sir,  that  while  I  am  emphasising  the  concerns  raised  by  the  Committee  on  the  2015 

Report, I am highlighting what we need to do to improve our production into the future.  Thank you 

Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">HON. SPEAKER.-  I thank the Honourable Bulanauca:</span> I give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p><span>Bulitavu. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- </span><span>Vinaka Vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to give few comments 

on our Committee Report.  I thank the Honourable Bulanauca for creating that laughter especially 

when we have been sitting for long.  But back to the Office of the Prime Ministers Report - this is 

the  2015  Annual  Report  and  I  just  want  to  confirm  that  the  2016-2017  Annual  Report  has  been 

deliberated by the Committee.  It has been reported back to the House awaiting a future debate and 

also the 2017 and 2018 Office of the Prime Minister Annual Review Report has been reported back 

after deliberation by the Committee.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  issues  raised  by  the  Honourable  Bulanauca,  I  think  once  we  come  to  those  Annual 

Reports we will see the improvements because it is quite an old Annual Review Report and again 

when we come to that, you will see that most of those issues have been attended to.

<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are thankful to the Office of the Prime Minister especially the Permanent Secretary for 

always giving time to come to the Committee to present,  especially the officers that represent the 

Office of the Prime Minister to come and present on the Report especially the Deputy Secretary for 

the  Policy  Division,  Deputy  Secretary  for  Development  Cooperation  and  Facilitation  Office  and 

also the Deputy Secretary of the new Division, International Cooperation and Corporate Services.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The information that they provide to the queries by the Committee helps the Committee to 

formulate the Report at the end of the day.  But you have seen various issues that were coming up 

in terms of the Client Complaints Unit and I think that has been reduced, given the various issues 

received by the unit and also directed or referred to the various agencies that need to deal with it 

within the relevant authority. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One good thing too is that we were able to raise the issue with the Deputy Secretary on the 

formation and also the structure of our Annual Reports given that the Office of the Prime Minister 

as  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  has  alluded  to,  frequently  has  Cabinet  meetings  and  also 

meetings with other line ministries so that a standard Annual Report is given.  The targets are also 

specified in terms of the SDGs and also their targets in the National Development Plan (NDP) and 

also  the  key  indicators  pertaining  to  their  vision  and  mission  which  makes  it  easier  for  the 

Committee to report back to the Parliament as assigned. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  are  thankful  that  the  government  subvention  continues  for  the  various  small  multi-

ethnic  groups that  are there,  and  also  the  continuation of the Small  Grants Scheme that has been 

helping communities in terms of seawalls and other things.  Those are some of the things that have 

been done and the community is happy given the frequent questions being asked to all Members of 

Parliament, despite the political party they belong to given that they are real issues that they face, 

and that has been attended to.  We are thankful to the officers from the Office of the Prime Minister 

who handle and see that those have been attended to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  issue  that  was  raised  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  was  in  terms  of  the 

Gender  Equality  Policy.  I  think  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  has  got  a  50/50  percent 

representation  of male and female  and  I think they  are showing and leading by  example to  other 

Ministries.  Those  are the things and other challenges would probably be coming in later Annual 

Reports that will be coming for review and also various measures that have been put in place.   I 

think  all  Honourable  Members  need  to  support  the  Office  of  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister’s 

Office 2015 and we look forward for debate for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Annual Review Report 

which the Committee has already deliberated on and it is also before Parliament. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu,</span><span>
