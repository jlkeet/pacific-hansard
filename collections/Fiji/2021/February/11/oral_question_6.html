<p>Assessments Undertaken During Natural Disasters 

(Question No. 34/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural 

and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update  Parliament  on  the  types  of 

assessments undertaken by the Ministryâ€™s Drone Team during natural disasters?</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- (Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 

Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I 

thank the Honourable Member for this question.  This is one piece of a gadget that really excites us 

and,  of  course,  it  really  helps  us  a  lot  in  the  work  that  we  undertake  at  the  National  Disaster 

Management Officer (NDMO).</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>The  new  emerging  technology  on  drones  are  being  used  worldwide  in  the  areas  of 

humanitarian  response  and  rapid  situational  assessment.    We  are  thankful  to  the  Australian 

Government and the New Zealand Government for providing us with two drones.  The type that we 

have are the multirotor drones.</p>
<p>In terms of how it is being utilised in terms of assessments during disasters, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, one is on aerial surveys and assessments.  Although we have fixed-wing aircrafts or the rotary-

wing aircrafts that help us in this as well, we are glad that this is also available to the Ministry to 

complement  the  work  undertaken  by  other  capabilities  that  are  usually  provided  to  us  through 

assistance.  We first used this aerial assessment in Nabukelevu-i-Ra, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the 

landslide.  It allowed us to capture the hard-to-access areas, considering the safety of our people as 

well.  This was also used during the assessment of the Draubuta landslide up in Navosa in 2019.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during post-TC Saraiin December 2019 in Kadavu, we also utilised this 

and  we  found  out  that  drones  really  accelerate  the  situation  assessment,  information  sharing, 

prioritisation, decision making and, of course, it is very cost effective.</p>
<p>Also  with  the  use  of  photogrammetry  software,  our  geospatial  team  are  able  to  do  risk 

assessments and disaster preparedness.  What they do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is with the software, they 

analyse the elevation and generate to 3D models, and we are now able to demarcate areas within 

communities that are exposed to coastal inundation.  A few villages in Vanua Levu were affected - 

Kia  and  most  of  the  coastal  villages,  and  we  deployed  this  in  Vanua  Levu.    In  terms  of  risk 

reduction  and  preparedness,  we  should  be  able  to  provide  some  information  to  our  coastal 

communities in advance.</p>
<p>I did mention yesterday about the training that we do in local communities, particularly with 

Disaster  Risk  Management  trainings.    Recently,  with  trainings  that  were  conducted  in  2020, 

particularly in the Province of Tailevu and in Rotuma, the drones were used to map the evacuation 

routes  for  the  communities  so  that  they  can  easily  identify  routes  that  are  safe  for  them,  should 

there  be  a  need  for  them  to  use  it  because  we  have  found  out  that  through  drones  and  data 

manipulation, we are able to scientifically prove why a route is safe for evacuation.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the safe alternative tours, information is captured in real time 

during situations where our personnel maybe exposed to risk.  Most recently, in the Korosomo Slip 

in Macuata, while the area is still heavily soaked and there were more risks of further landslides, all 

that  we  had  to  do  was  to  fly  the  drone  into  the  area  because  it  was  unsafe  for  the  team  to  move 

closer.</p>
<p>That very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have stated, is a good piece of equipment to have 

and with the expertise that we have, together with the technical training, we should be able to do 

more and also utilise better if the need do arise.  Of course, it helps us as well in terms of disaster 

preparations.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister, we will move on.</p>
<p>There has been a change in the next Oral Question.  I will give the floor to the Honourable</p>
<p>Saukuru to ask the question.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
