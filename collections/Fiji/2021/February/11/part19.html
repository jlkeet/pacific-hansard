<h3>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-</h3>
<p><span>The  issues  raised  by  the  Honourable  Bulanauca,  I  think  once  we  come  to  those  Annual 

Reports we will see the improvements because it is quite an old Annual Review Report and again 

when we come to that, you will see that most of those issues have been attended to.

<p><span>Review Report – Office of the Prime Minister 2015 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>11th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>We are thankful to the Office of the Prime Minister especially the Permanent Secretary for 

always giving time to come to the Committee to present,  especially the officers that represent the 

Office of the Prime Minister to come and present on the Report especially the Deputy Secretary for 

the  Policy  Division,  Deputy  Secretary  for  Development  Cooperation  and  Facilitation  Office  and 

also the Deputy Secretary of the new Division, International Cooperation and Corporate Services.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The information that they provide to the queries by the Committee helps the Committee to 

formulate the Report at the end of the day.  But you have seen various issues that were coming up 

in terms of the Client Complaints Unit and I think that has been reduced, given the various issues 

received by the unit and also directed or referred to the various agencies that need to deal with it 

within the relevant authority. 

</span></p>
<p><span>One good thing too is that we were able to raise the issue with the Deputy Secretary on the 

formation and also the structure of our Annual Reports given that the Office of the Prime Minister 

as  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  has  alluded  to,  frequently  has  Cabinet  meetings  and  also 

meetings with other line ministries so that a standard Annual Report is given.  The targets are also 

specified in terms of the SDGs and also their targets in the National Development Plan (NDP) and 

also  the  key  indicators  pertaining  to  their  vision  and  mission  which  makes  it  easier  for  the 

Committee to report back to the Parliament as assigned. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We  are  thankful  that  the  government  subvention  continues  for  the  various  small  multi-

ethnic  groups that  are there,  and  also  the  continuation of the Small  Grants Scheme that has been 

helping communities in terms of seawalls and other things.  Those are some of the things that have 

been done and the community is happy given the frequent questions being asked to all Members of 

Parliament, despite the political party they belong to given that they are real issues that they face, 

and that has been attended to.  We are thankful to the officers from the Office of the Prime Minister 

who handle and see that those have been attended to.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  other  issue  that  was  raised  by  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  was  in  terms  of  the 

Gender  Equality  Policy.  I  think  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  has  got  a  50/50  percent 

representation  of male and female  and  I think they  are showing and leading by  example to  other 

Ministries.  Those  are the things and other challenges would probably be coming in later Annual 

Reports that will be coming for review and also various measures that have been put in place.   I 

think  all  Honourable  Members  need  to  support  the  Office  of  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister’s 

Office 2015 and we look forward for debate for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Annual Review Report 

which the Committee has already deliberated on and it is also before Parliament. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu,</span><span>
