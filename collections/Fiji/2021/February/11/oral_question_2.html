<p>Pacific Labour Scheme - Australia  

(Question No. 30/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SIGARARA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity,  Industrial  Relations, 

Youth and Sports inform Parliament which sectors in Australia are Fijians engaged in under 

the Pacific Labour Scheme?</p>
<p>HON. P.K. BALA (Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations, Youth and 

Sports).-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  also  thank  the  Honourable  Member.    Fiji’s 

participation  under  the  PLS  was  formalised  through  the  signing  of  a  Memorandum  of 

Understanding (MOU) in 2019, as part of the Vuvale Partnership Agreement.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 

acknowledge  the  continued  support  from  the  Australian  Government,  for  inviting  Fiji  to 

recommence this programme again in august last year.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>597</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Fijian workers are currently working in three sectors under the Pacific</p>
<p>Labour Scheme (PLS) on a three year contract.  These sectors are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meat works; 

Hospitality and Accommodation; and  

Aged Care.</p>
<p>There is a total of 564 Fijian workers employed in this sector.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  the  number  of  our  Fijians  currently  employed  under  the 

PLS, my Ministry is also preparing more workers for other upcoming labour mobility programs, as 

follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another 88 Fijians under the PLS Programme are expected to depart next month; 

70  Fijian  workers  are  expected  to  be  engaged  under  the  Australian  Seasonal  Work 

Programme also departing next month; 

71  Fijian  seasonal  workers  under  the  new  Seasonal  Work  Programme  is  expected  to 

depart next Thursday, 18th February, 2021.</p>
<p>These are all returning workers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as requested by the New Zealand employers.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  all  are  aware  of  the  high  demand  from  Australia  for  Fijian  meat 

workers  under  the  PLS  and  following  a  number  of  concerns  from  our  local  industry,  staff  of  my 

Ministry  are  finding  ways  to  plug  the  gap  left  by  some  of  our  experienced  workers  who  went  to 

work  under  the  PLS.    This  resulted  in  an  Expression  of  Interest  for  basic  meat  works  and  other 

short courses that was advertised late last year as part of my Ministry’s commitment to re-skilling 

and up-skilling some of our workers affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>In  trying  to  address  the  needs  of  our  local  meat  industry,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry 

partnered with the National Training and Productivity Centre (NTPC ) and Fiji National University 

(FNU), and have conducted two training sessions in this regard.  The NTPC is also working closely 

with  the  meat  industry’s  stakeholders,  including  the  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Board  (FMIB)  on  the 

utilisation  of  some  of  their  existing  facilities  and  resources  for  the  practical  aspect  of  the  basic 

training in the meat industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at times ,when our local industries are facing some challenges, our LabourMobility Programme is a great opportunity for all Fijians to work together and support this pathwayto  enhancing  local  skills  upon  these  workers  returning  home,  and  also  supporting  our  Fijian 

economy through remittances.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Leawere,  you  have  the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister 

for what he has said in the House.   My question to him is, are these workers under the PLS Schemecontributing to their FNPF?  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The answer is very straightforward, no.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Anare Jale, you have the floor.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON.  A.  JALE.-  For  the  workers  who  have  served  for  more  than  12  months  and  have 

families in Fiji or are married, do they have a provision in the contract to come back after a year to 

see their family?</p>
<p>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I do not think any request has come to us 

so far under this programme because instead of three  years, they want  five  years.  So as of now, 

there  has  been  no  request  but  if  there  is  any  request,  definitely  my  Ministry  will  deal  with  the 

employers and we will make sure that  that particular person comes and  visits the family.   Thank 

you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Honourable Minister says that 

the demand is in three areas; meat workers, medical and aged care. Are there opportunities for other 

sectors, Honourable Minister?  Is there a dialogue to expand this?</p>
<p>I ask, Mr. Speaker, because I believe there is also a demand for some technical builders and 

maybe,  electricians  and  plumbers,  et  cetera.    So,  is  dialogue  also  heading  in  the  direction  of 

broadening what would be required in Australia?</p>
<p>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Thank  you.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Honourable  Member.  

Through dialogue and negotiations, we have managed to engage our Fijian workers in these three 

sectors  and  dialogue  is  continuing  with  the  other  employers  to  see  how  we  can  send  our  Fijian 

workers in other areas as well.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will move on.</p>
