<p>Reduction in Production Cost and Yield Improvement  

(Question No. 35/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Page 107</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>605</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry 

and  Foreign  Affairs  inform  Parliament  on  the  measures  that  have  been  taken  recently  to 

reduce cane production costs and improve yield per hectare?</p>
<p>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA  (Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Sugar</p>
<p>Industry and Foreign Affairs).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  by  Honourable  Kuridrani  which  was 

raised  by  Honourable  Saukuru.    My  Government  is  deeply  vested  in  increasing  cane  yield  per 

hectare and we have supported several strategies through the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) and the 

Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF), which are aimed at increasing productivity and ultimately 

reducing  average  cost  by  hectare.    The  reason  being,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  that  puts  more 

money in the pockets of our cane growers which is what our support to that industry is all about.</p>
<p>As we are all aware, this is a tough time for cane growing.  Our climate is changing and that 

has  had  serious  impacts  through  stronger  storms,  longer  droughts  and,  of  course,  as  we  are 

experiencing  now,  a  lot  of  flooding.    Poor  drainage,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  led  to  waterlogged  farms 

which has depleted soil health due to rising soil salinity.</p>
<p>Of the 13 cyclones that have struck us since 2016, Mr. Speaker, six have directly impacted 

sugarcane farms -TC Winston, TC Keni, TC Josie, TC Harold, TC Yasaand, of course, the latest 

one -TC Ana.Apart fromTC Anafor which the damage assessment is  yet to be completed, the 

five cyclones have cost the total damage and loss of $255 million to the sugar industry.  Of this, the 

total sugarcane crop loss was over $85 million.</p>
<p>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, the cane industry is not changing as quickly as 

the climate but we have made progress.  Specifically, we have managed to improve yield, so when 

times are good, we get more out of our farms.  From an average yield of 38 tonnes per hectare in 

2016, the yield has increased to 46 tonnes per hectare in 2020, which is an increase of 21 percent in 

the yield.  The total cane production has also increased from 1.39 million tonnes in 2016 to 1.81 

million tonnes in 2019, 1.73 million tonnes in 2020; an increase of 30 percent.</p>
<p>Following Category 5TC Winston,my Government has provided direct assistance to build 

resilience  by  increasing  cane  yield  and  cane  production.  Over  the  past  five  years,  nearly  $100 

million  worth  of  assistance  has  been  provided  to  support  cane  planting  grants,  weedicide  and 

fertiliser subsidy programmes for inputs.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  backed  by  cane  planting  grant  assistance,  a  total  of  18,821  hectares  of  cane 

was planted over the past five years.  The Ministry of Sugar Industry has also assisted growers with 

$40,000  each  to  procure  a  total  of  25  tractors,  along  with  implements  to  assist  them  in  land 

preparation. Another 239 growers were assisted with farm equipment and implements.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  also  funded  research  and  development  and  technology  transfer 

activities  of  SRIF  to  provide  quality  services  to  farmers  with  90  new  commercial  cane  varieties, 

and  we  expect  to  release  another  two  promising  varieties  within  three  years.    Breeding  new 

varieties  is  not  an  easy  process.  It  takes  a  minimum  of  12  years  to  release  a  new  variety  after 

undergoing many trials but it is a critical step to boost the climate resilience of our cane.</p>
<p>Sir, SRIF has also surveyed all major pests and diseases affecting the sugarcane belt areas to 

prevent the spread of diseases, such as leaf gall and ratoon stunting disease which, if not controlled, 

have the potential to kill off crops, resulting in an up to 30 percent loss in sugar production.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF carries out around 2,000 soil and leaf analysis projects annually. To 

extend  its  outreach,  it  has  opened  a  new  analytical  laboratory  in  Labasa,  cutting  down  the 

turnaround  time  significantly.    Previously,  samples  were  sent  to  Lautoka  for  analysis  but  now,  it 

happens on site for Labasaâ€™s farmers.  Sir, SRIF also carries out trials on new weedicides, fertilizer 

and other products that impact cane yield.</p>
<p>In terms of technology transfer initiatives, SRIF has planted 90 grower demonstration trials, 

planted  and  distributed  700  tonnes  of  hot  water  treated  disease  free  seed  cane  in  nurseries, 

improved  soil  health  initiatives  and  trained  FSC  farm  advisors  and  farmers  on  new  innovative 

technologies since 2016.   To further increase yield and reduce production costs, we are focusing on 

farm  advisory  services,  technology  and  transfer  services,  research  and  development,  farmer 

trainings, ratoon management, the adoption of best management practices and the enhancement of 

soil health.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  the  FSC  and  SRIF  restructured  its  field  division  and  restored  farm  advisory 

services last year to make sure our farmers can stay well-informed on industry best practices. There 

are now 28 dedicated farm advisors in all the three Mills. These advisors are well-trained and serve 

as  the  ground  link  between  growers  and  SRIF.    They  deliver  quality  services,  such  as  timely 

ordering  of  fertiliser,  analysis  of  soil  heath  and  crop  nutrient  requirements,  weed  control,  crop 

varietal propagation and also conduct various trainings through field demonstrations and in-house 

exercises. Essentially, they provide expertise for  our growers.   Since 2016, over 60  Farmer Field 

School plots have been set up in various sectors and 11 training sessions have been conducted by 

SRIF and FSC, serving over 1,000 growers.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  best  farm  management  practices  are  practices  that  help  maintain 

sustainable  sugarcane  production,  while  minimising  loss  of  yield  and  soil  resources  to  increase 

production.    The  combination  of  high  quality  advisory  services  and  farmers  training  has  brought 

exceptional  results  on  cane  yield.   A classic example is  the results achieved by the Tunalia Joint 

Venture Farms.  With the adoption of  the best  farm management practice, they have recorded an 

average yield of 126 tonnes per hectare from 15 hectares, with the highest yield of 167 tonnes per 

hectare on one of the plots and the lowest at 81 tonnes per hectare.</p>
<p>Efforts have also been made to improve depleted soil health.  From last year, the SRIF and 

FSC  have  been  promoting  the  use  of  legumes  as  a  cheaper  technology  to  enhance  soil  fertility, 

reduce import cost and increase yield by 15 percent to 20 percent. This process, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

known  as  green  manuring,  has  been  supported  by  technology  trials  conducted  by  SRIF  which 

achieved an encouraging average yield of 137 tonnes per hectare.  Through the assistance of cane 

planting grant, a total of 70 hectares of the targeted 284 hectares of green manuring legumes have 

been planted in the current planting season.</p>
<p>Mill mud application is another method which has been implemented since 2019.  Mill mud 

contains soil from the sugarcane that enters the mill, sugars and bagasse particles and lime which is 

used  in  the  clarification  process  and  used  as  a  soil  conditioner  or  fertiliser  as  it  contains  a  high 

amount  of  plant  nutrients.    It  quickens  the  turnaround  in  soil  health,  thus  rapidly  improving 

sugarcane yield both, from fallow land and ratoon cane.  A total of 73,430 tonnes of mill mud have 

been supplied to cane farms with the assistance of Government funds over the past two years.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ratoon comprises 90 percent of the total area under cane.  Therefore, the 

focus is to properly manage this ratoon to increase yield.  Research shows gap filling exercises can 

increase yield by 25 percent, if ratoon is managed well after harvest.  The FSC is now aggressively 

implementing its ratoon  management project and identifying farms with large gaps.  Growers are 

being advised to fill gaps with single set planting material.</p>

<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>607</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FSC  is  targeting  a  total  of  8,000  hectares  for  ratoon  management  to 

increase  yield  from  46  tonnes  to  51  tonnes  per  hectare,  and  to  achieve  a  minimum  increase  of 

40,000 tonnes from this targeted area.  Improving yield starts with quality seeds, apart from the 700 

tonnes of hot water treated seed cane that was distributed to cane farmers by SRIF.</p>
<p>They  have  also  established  the  tissue  culture  laboratory  in  2019.    Tissue  culture  is  the 

technology that produces clean and quality planting materials for growers to spur the rapid spread 

of sugarcane for distribution.  Sir, SRIF has produced 11,000 seedlings last year and is planted in 

Rarawai and SRIF Drasa Estate Farms with tissue culture seedlings.</p>
<p>Severe losses caused byTC YasaandTC Anahave been a serious setback and this will not 

be the last storms to affect this industry.  But we have not wasted any time in helping our farmers 

recover and we stand committed to  building their resilience to  changing  climate. The Ministry is 

acting as proactively as possible to respond to the needs of Vanua Levu farmers with an allocation 

of  $4  million.   The  FSC  is  also  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Waterways  to 

identify  and  clear  in-field  and  main  drains  to  address  the  long  standing  issue  of  waterlog 

farms.  Meanwhile, the damage assessment forTC Anais in progress by our FSC Team.  Base on 

the initial reports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will then identify how we can best assist affected 

farmers.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we not only going to respond,  but we are going to press ahead with our 

efforts  to  raise  the  bar  for  productivity,  increase  the  area  on  cane,  improve  yield  and  reduce 

production costs. The Ministry has been enticing new farmers to venture into cane farming and to 

bring more land under cane farming.  Through its new Farmers Assistance Programme, 268 farmers 

have been assisted to acquire cane farms.  Through this programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, new land has 

been brought under cane farming that has contributed to the overall increase in production.</p>
<p>To produce better crop deal, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC will ensure that the seasonal plant cane 

cut-off dates are strictly followed whereby fallow planting will be allowed only from 1st March to 

30th  June and replanting  will be allowed from  1st  August  to  31st October each  year.  Again,  the 

results  are  best  seen  at  the  Tunalia  Joint  Venture  Farms,  which  strictly  followed  the  seasonal 

planting programme. Their success speaks for itself.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FSC  has  also  been  promoting  commercial  farming,  large  farms  have  a 

comparative  advantage  of  scale  as  per  unit  costs  are  lowered.   To  date,  five  joint  ventures  have 

been established that produced a total of 12,900 tonnes of cane  collectively in 2020.  In addition, 

the Committee for the Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL), through the Ministry of Agriculture, has 

been activated to identify all vacant land that can be brought under sugarcane cultivation.</p>
<p>Additional training sessions, Mr. Speaker Sir, have been planned for growers to increase the 

take-up  of  best  management  practices  and  the  transfer  of  the  best  technology  we  have 

available.  With all those efforts taken together, Mr. Speaker, I am confident that we can increase 

the  overall  yield,  cut  production  costs  and  put  more  money  in  the  pockets  of  our  hardworking 

growers, with all considered as priority number one.</p>
