<p>Development of Davuilevu Subdivision - China Railway Group 

(Question No. 31/2021)</p>
<p>HON. M. BULANAUCA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development  provide  an  update  to  Parliament  on  the  current  subdivision  development  in 

Davuilevu by China Railway Group?</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR  (Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development).-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Housing  Authority  of  Fiji  obtained  development  lease  for 

53.42 hectares of land in Davuilevu from the Methodist Church of Fiji on 27th February, 2017. The 

Scheme Plan was prepared in-house by the Housing Authority of Fiji Team with a lot yield of 573. 

This includes 520 residential lots, 42 duplex housing lots, four commercial lots, three civic lots and 

four parcels of land for the Public Rental Board (PRB).</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Scope  of  Works  based  on  the  development  design  includes; 

earthworks,  road  works,  stormwater  drainage,  water  supply  pipelines  and  sewerage,  kerb  and 

channel footpath, driveways and streetlights. The tender was called for this project in July 2017.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the China Railway First Group was awarded the tender on 1st December, 

2017. The civil works was expected to complete in September 2019, however, this was revised to 

May 2021.  Approximately 90 percent of the civil works has been completed.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>I  also  like to  inform the House that  Davuilevu is one of the six sites identified by  IFC to 

provide  models  for  affordable  and  climate-resilient  homes  for  low  and  middle  income  families. 

Davuilevu  will  be  redesigned  to  produce  1,500  houses  and  flats  under  the  IFC  programme.    Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for his question.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.  Honourable  Tikoduadua,  your</p>
<p>supplementary question?</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  ask  a  supplementary 

question  to  the  Honourable  Minister.    Last  year,  I  raised  a  similar  question  on  this  matter  but 

because the problem has kind of exacerbated, I would like to ask the question again.</p>
<p>Sir, just to put it into perspective, the sediments from the construction goes into a creek that 

passes through and it might take a part of what is already being developed.  Every time it rains, it 

floods the homes of people who are housed along the creek, and it is getting worse by the day.</p>
<p>I had asked the Honourable Minister the last time what she would do about it, so I would 

like to ask the Honourable Minister again. What is there in place for those who are already there in 

terms of the flooding that continuously happen and it gets worse every time? I witnessed this duringTC  Anathat  even  the  formal  settlements  at  the  end  were  all  flooded.    It  is  nice  to  have  climate-

resilient homes but the impact of that is flooding the rest of everyone elseâ€™s home down the river. 

That is the question, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  also  received  numerous 

complaints relating to flooding in that area. We also had some first-hand experience of flooding in 

Waidamudamu Settlement and often, fingers point towards the Davuilevu development.</p>
<p>Based on the complaints, the Ministry carried out a detailed flood assessment for the area by 

engaging  the  services  of  the  Ministry  of  Waterways.  The  Ministry  of  Waterways  provided  its 

assessment report and one of the recommendations in the report is to control the silt discharge from 

the Davuilevu development area and this was communicated to the Housing Authority of Fiji.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Housing  Authority  has  implemented  a  short-term  mitigation  plan  by 

installing  channel  silt  traps  which  are  cleaned  on  a  regular  basis  to  avoid  the  washdown  of  clay 

particles. There are also some medium term solutions that they have identified, which is installing 

silt fence and planting vetiver grass  along vulnerable corridors.  I also understand there are some 

issues with the culvert as well which needs to be replaced, but all these information is with Housing 

Authority and they have started working in providing a redress to the community who often suffer 

from the flooding of that particular area.</p>
<p>The  Ministry  of  Housing  will  continue  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  these  remedial 

actions recommended in the report that we have obtained. We will make sure that the cause of the 

flood is addressed.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Is this another supplementary question?</p>
<p>(Hon. Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua interjects)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I will allow it; only once.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>11th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Only  once,  thank  you,  Sir.  The  question  to  the 

Honourable Minister; is the Housing Authority considering compensating those victims who have 

suffered from the previous floods under the recommendations of Housing Authority?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Just like any other organisation, they 

do  have  a  complaints  handling  mechanism.    Based  on  the  complaints  handling  mechanism,  they 

will  handle  the  complaints,  so  I  recommend,  Honourable  Member,  to  put  their  complaints  to 

Housing Authority.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank  you.  We will move on to the fourth Oral Question for today. I 

call  on  the  Honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleavitaion.    You 

have the floor, Madam?</p>
