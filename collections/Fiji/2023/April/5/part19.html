<br/></span><span>Translation  of  the  Honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs  and  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts’ 
<br/>iTaukei speech in reply to Oral Question No. 67/2023 by Honourable A. Tuicolo.  
<br/>(Ref:  Page 946-948) 
<br/></span><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  raised  by  honorauble  Tuicolo  on  whether 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government will continue with the equal distribution of lease money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me begin by providing some context to that policy.  The previous Government’s decided to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>change distribution formula in 2010 based on the principle of equality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Native Land (Leases and Licences) (Amendment) Regulations 2010 was the basis for the 
<br/>equal lease distribution policy.  This was to be effective from 2011.  However, due to logistical issues, 
<br/>the policy was finally implemented in 2015. It took five years to roll it out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTLTB  now  distributes  over  $100  million  equally  in  lease  money  annually  under  the  current 
<br/>policy.  What do we have to show for it? After 7 years, the positive effects of the policy on the itaukei 
<br/>should now be very clear. But sadly, this is not the case.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If anything, it has supported the culture of individualism which is against the grain of iTaukei life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are better and stronger when we do things together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous lease distribution policy was under the 1984 regulations.  After iTLTB deducts its 
<br/>admin cost known as poundage, 5 percent would go to the Turaga iTaukei, 10 percent to the Turaga ni 
<br/>Yavusa, 15 percent to the Turaga ni Mataqali. The remaining 70 percent would be shared equally amongst 
<br/>the remaining land-owning unit members.  The current policy distributes it equally amongst the LOU 
<br/>after iTLTB deducts its admin cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me provide some context to the old distribution formula. It recognized the biblical principle 
<br/>of  first  fruits.    It  recognized  that  our  tribal  leaders  must  serve  their  </span><span>vanua  </span><span>through  our  traditional 
<br/>governance system.  It recognized that we the iTaukei exist communally and the  </span><span>solesolevaki </span><span>custom 
<br/>holds us together.  I want to quote from a iTLTB Review Report in 2006 by boardroom practice of New 
<br/>Zealand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The origin of the [old policy] is that in former times, chiefs at various levels provide 
<br/>protection and security for their people and in return the people provided fruits of the first 
<br/>harvest or fish or like items. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The principle was one of mutual understanding with a two-way flow between the people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and their leader.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has the equal lease distribution policy done? It applied the principle of equality without a 
<br/>situational  analysis  on  what  was  the  rationale  behind  the  previous  lease  distribution  policy.    In  the 
<br/>process, it significantly contributed to the breaking down of the iTaukei society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Decisions have context. Chiefs were empowered under the previous policy because they have a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>duty to do. The current lease distribution policy dis-empowers them. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A direct effect was highlighted in my response on the vacant chiefly titles last week. 53 percent 
<br/>of the total chiefly titles in Fiji are vacant.  It essentially means that 53 percent of the iTaukei are without 
<br/>leaders from a traditional governance perspective.  The good news is that the coalition government will 
<br/>address that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  speaker,  a  priority  item  under  the  Coalition Government’s  Manifesto  is  the  review  of  the 
<br/>equal lease distribution policy.  In January when i visited the iTaukei Land Trust Board as part of my 
<br/>familiarization tour, I instructed them to carry out an impact evaluation of the policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on the outcome of that exercise, I will recommend to Cabinet how to restructure the lease 
<br/>distribution formula to recognize and support the i Taukei </span><span>vanua</span><span> structure, Without denying iTaukei who 
<br/>reside in Fiji access to their lease entitlement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  Parliament  will  recall  that  on  14  may,  2015,  the  Turaga  Vunivalu  na  Tui 
<br/>Namosi,  Ratu  Suliano  Matanitobua,  presented  a  petition,  signed  by  446  members  of  the  public,  for 
<br/>parliament to instruct iTLTB to stop and review the effects of the lease distribution to personal accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  impact  evaluation,  I  have  directed  iTLTB  to  undertake  will  essentially  quantify  those 
<br/>benefits. For example, “assist LOUs to contribute to growth of small businesses and micro enterprises if 
<br/>they think of establishing them from lease monies received”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How many small businesses have been established and how has it benefitted them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  perceived  benefits  are  redundant  because  of  the  counter  effects  of  the  equal  lease 
<br/>distribution policy.  For example, it hasn’t enhanced good leadership within the LOUs. The vacant chiefly 
<br/>titles I had mentioned earlier points to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, iTLTB’s submission also highlighted criticisms and concerns from LOUs on the equal lease 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>distribution policy. They are genuine concerns which the Coalition Government will consider.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cabinet recently endorsed Fiji’s support of the United Nations Declaration on 
<br/>the Right of Indigenous Peoples or UNDRIP.  Fiji was way ahead of other countries before UNDRIP was 
<br/>adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, some policies adopted over the past 16 years including the equal lease distribution are 
<br/>against  the  UNDRIP.    The  effects  of  the  equal  lease  distribution  policy  are  self-evident.  It  will  be 
<br/>reviewed and restructured under an equitable arrangement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I started with equality and ended with equity. This is the difference. Equality is giving everyone 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the same pair of shoes while equity is giving everyone a pair of shoes that fits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
