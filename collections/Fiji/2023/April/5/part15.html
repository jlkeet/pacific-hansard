<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Parliament: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supports the Forum Leaders desire to secure our Pacific Ocean’s future and condemns 
<br/>any action that will threaten it; and 
<br/>calls  on  our  partner  Governments,  including  international  agencies  to  ensure  the 
<br/>protection of our oceans and its resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Forum Leaders’ call 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to secure our Pacific Ocean’s future and condemn any action that will threaten it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  might  seem  incongruous  that  the  Minister  for  Trade  and  Investment, 
<br/>normally we are accused of being capitalists, but I would be talking about the environment but let 
<br/>me assure you, Sir, that the two are very much interconnected and that is why I am rising today to 
<br/>move this motion with honour, Sir.

<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>903 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  understand  that  we  cannot  achieve  this  goal  alone,  thus  I  call  upon  all  our  partner 
<br/>governments, international agencies, to ensure the protection of our oceans and its resources.  I am 
<br/>sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that every honourable Member in this Parliament can agree on this.  We are 
<br/>all passionate about our natural resources and any threat to our resources that raises red flags threatens 
<br/>our very existence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As guardians of the ocean, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our way of life is underpinned by the ocean.  Our 
<br/>culture,  food,  livelihood  and  national  economy  rely  on  our  oceans.  The  guardianship  is  central 
<br/>because the ocean provides half of our breathable air and provide food security and livelihood.  The 
<br/>survival and wellbeing of the Pacific Ocean is linked very much, Sir, to the survival of our planet 
<br/>and thus, should be a concerned for every global citizen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am hoping that this august Parliament will send in one loud and clear voice send a message, 
<br/>“that the Pacific Ocean should not be seen as an easy and convenient dumping ground for  unwanted 
<br/>and dangerous material and waste that other bigger nations produce and would not want to use in 
<br/>their own ecosystems”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We, the defenders of the ocean, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>small, but our voices can be loud and effective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  internationally,  thankfully  our  voices  are  being  heard.    A  recent  </span><span>Time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Magazine</span><span> article dated 6</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“But Pacific Island nations have particular reason to be anxious. There is a noxious 
<br/>legacy of nuclear testing in the region, and other countries have historically treated the 
<br/>Pacific as a dumping ground for their waste.  The US conducted 67 nuclear tests in the 
<br/>Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1957 and disposed of atomic waste in Runit Dome, 
<br/>where it’s still stored.  That testing led not only to forced relocations,  but also to increased 
<br/>rates of cancers.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a concern that the Dome is leaking and that rising sea levels 
<br/>might impact its structural integrity.  France also conducted 193 nuclear tests from 1966 to 1996 at 
<br/>Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls in French Polynesian.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  a  recent  press  conference,  in  the  absence  of  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister, I expressed my honest views about Japan’s decision to discharge ALPS treated water from 
<br/>the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean.  I said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it 
<br/>so safe, why do they not use it on their own farms in their own country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Japanese Government announced on 13</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2021 its basic policy to discharge 1.5 
<br/>million  tonnes  of  Advance  Liquid  Processing  System  (ALPS)  treated  water  from  the  Fukushima 
<br/>Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean rather than release it by vapour.  According to 
<br/>Japan, Sir, its basic policy is based on over six years of comprehensive study and research by experts, 
<br/></span><span>reviewed by the International atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and engagement with other parties’ 
<br/></span><span>concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Subject  to  the  approval  of  its  nuclear  regulation  authority,  namely,  Tokyo  Electric  Power 
<br/>Company Holdings (TEPCO), it will conduct discharge into the Pacific Ocean, envisaged to place 
<br/>approximately after two years, and over period of up to 40 years the discharge.  This announcement, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is shocking, and will directly impact the Pacific Region.  We must not rest on our 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>laurels and sit on this invisible fence about the ongoing nuclear legacy facing our region.  Simply, 
<br/>Sir, we must not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  as  the  Pacific,  cannot  be  continued  to  be  made  the  dumping  ground  of  the  so-called 
<br/>bigger  nations.    The  social  and  economic  impacts  of  this  irresponsible  behaviour  is  catastrophic, 
<br/>particularly to our vulnerable communities.  As we all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our vulnerable coastal 
<br/>communities and their marine life will definitely be impacted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, needless to say, coastal communities survive on marine life, not to mention 
<br/>the impact of radioactive chemicals that can have on our people.  Internationally, Fiji is recognised 
<br/>as a popular tourism destination and well-known for its sun, sand and sea.  If this release occurs, 
<br/>there may be an impact on our tourism earnings.  We cannot let this happen, we have to protect what 
<br/>is ours.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must commend the recent efforts of the Pacific Islands Forum 
<br/>(PIF) to raise concerns and seek more information and consultation with Japan before a decision is 
<br/>made by the Japanese Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are hoping that at some point, the Pacific Forum Leaders may get access 
<br/>to the results of this testing and understand what it says.  That is why our regional position should be 
<br/>one of solidarity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Forum Secretariat for immediately communicating and raising awareness on this 
<br/>issue with members and the general community through media statements, expressing concern over 
<br/>Japan’s decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In February this year, the Prime Minister of Cook Islands, the honourable Mark Brown, led 
<br/>the delegation from the Forum to Tokyo to convey our concerns and request all Pacific Leaders for 
<br/>the deferral of Japan’s planned discharge of treated nuclear wastewater in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what we need - we need on every platform possible collectively to 
<br/>continue to raise our voices, but more importantly, we must protect our oceans.  Regionally, we have 
<br/>a 2050 Strategy for a Blue Pacific Ocean and such actions will threaten that mission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must not fail to recollect the PALM 9 commitments and the thoughts of 
<br/>PIF Leaders.  Do we really want to imperil our Blue Pacific, the health and security of our people?  
<br/>We need to have demanding dialogues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to guide our decision on this discharge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the Pacific’s Special PIF Leaders Meeting in Nadi in February this year, the Forum 
<br/>Leaders supported the importance of science and data to guide this decision and they are continuing  
<br/>dialogue  with  the  Japanese  Government  about  the  discharge.    Like  as  I  said,  from  my  personal 
<br/>opinion, if it is safe, use it in your own country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had expressed my stance on this release as I have mentioned, and it is incumbent for us as a 
<br/>region to have a shared understanding on the implications.  Our regional position and Fiji’s position 
<br/>must be one of the same opinion as we progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is our time to secure the future of our Pacific Ocean through concerted 
<br/></span><span>effort,  commitment  and  investment  in  our  ocean  and  lands.    Our  policies,  partnerships  and 
<br/>investments  must  be  farsighted.    We  must  protect  the  region’s  biodiversity  and  reaffirm  the 
<br/>importance  of  ensuring  international  consultation,  international  law  and  the  independent  and 
<br/>verifiable scientific assessments under the PALM 9 declaration.

<div><span>         Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>905 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I wish to reiterate that the ocean is our greatest natural 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resource and the Pacific’s sanctuary.  Let us protect our oceans to protect our future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members before I  offer the floor for debate on the motion,  I 
<br/>would like to inform you that we have nine speakers and the list has been supplied by honourable 
<br/>Whips on both sides.  The order is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Naupoto; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S. Kumar; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Hon. K.K. Lal; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services, and Transport; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J. Usamate; 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Leader of the Opposition; and  
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise in support of the motion that is  before us.  
<br/>Sometimes, we think of our ocean as a faraway place, but the reality is, it extends to the water that 
<br/>laps your feet when you walk on the beach.  I think like the Amazon jungle, it has been said that it is 
<br/>the lungs of the world, I think our ocean is in the same way, it is the lungs to us small island States.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our ocean connects us.  Our Pacific Ocean is becoming, if not the richest ocean compared to 
<br/>the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, simply because the other Oceans are surrounded by big population 
<br/>bases that have the capacity to explore the resources from their ocean while we, in the Pacific, are 
<br/>small island nations and in the process, we manage to preserve and conserve the resources that we 
<br/>have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a share of that Ocean that is being talked about today, the Pacific 
<br/>Ocean.  We have 1.3 million square kilometres of it.  Sir, 12 miles from the shore is the territorial 
<br/>seas  which  is  almost  an  extension  of  our  land,  and  then  188  miles  is  normally  known  as  the 
<br/>international waters but combined becomes our EEZ, which is 1.3 million square kilometres.  That, 
<br/>in comparison to our land area, which is 18.27 thousand square kilometres, it is by far the biggest 
<br/>resource that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ocean is a live entity and in my 20 years of working there as a sailor, I understand it very 
<br/>well as a live entity.  It is a provider - provides for food, sustenance, provided for my food when I 
<br/>was a kid on the most beautiful island in Fiji called Vatoa, it was the playground for me when I grew 
<br/>up, and it provided the money for my education when I went to secondary school.  When I joined the 
<br/>Navy and spent those years, I usually tell people, “Maybe it is the ocean claiming back its pound of 
<br/>flesh from me.  It is the giver, and it is also a taker.  It has eaten away chunks of our shoreline.  It 
<br/>takes lives and ships for that matter.  Our tuna fishery here in Fiji in that 1.3 million square kilometres 
<br/>of ocean, employs people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I always see the fisheries sector as a sector that picks up those that other sectors would not, 
<br/></span><span>as sailors to go out and brave the rough seas, to go and fish and it is a sector or an industry that picks 
<br/>up all those whom we would have, otherwise, leave behind and allows them to improve the living 
<br/>standards of their families.

<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, the target tuna species is Albacore, one of the best in the world.  Albacore is the white 
<br/>meat  tuna  that  you  will  see  when  you  buy  tuna  and  the  Northern  part  of  the  Pacific  it  is  mostly 
<br/>skipjack that turns into the light meat tuna that you see. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our ocean also is part of the bigger connection of oceans that allows 90 percent of world trade 
<br/>to happen.  We, in Fiji, are signatories to so many Conventions that relate to the ocean - the United 
<br/>Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Fiji is very much a big part in the creation of 
<br/>that  Convention;  we  are  signatory  to  the  International  Convention  for  the  Safety  of  Life  at  Sea 
<br/>(SOLAS), the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) which 
<br/>is the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution, and we do it because as I have said, the ocean is 
<br/>really the lungs for us.  It allows us to survive.  It determines the type of weather that we have.  The 
<br/>temperature of the ocean heats up too much, hot air begins to rise, cold air comes in to replace it, 
<br/>cyclone begins to fall. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Pacific Ocean must be left as it is, must be.  It must be left as pristine as it is and we 
<br/>cannot  definitely  allow  those  from  other  countries  or  those  developed  nations  as  a  result  of  their 
<br/>development, then come and dump their waste on us.  It cannot, we rely on it so much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amazingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the way the ocean behaves, I remembered we were rescuing 
<br/>these two girls from Vanuavatu, we were not too sure whether one of them was alive but we knew 
<br/>that one was.  In the most difficult of circumstances, the ocean was so angry and as we were trying 
<br/>to rescue them, the small little punt that they were in was almost flipping over, half-filled with water 
<br/>and at the background you see this huge wave picking this up and then beginning to flip the boat.  
<br/>And this is me on the ship and I am talking to ocean, “Please do not, please do not” and to that warm 
<br/>feeling that you have when you see the boat flipping slightly, the two were still on the boat.  We 
<br/>managed to rescue these two girls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wrote a story about it and it is, perhaps, the best ever moment of my career as a sailor, I was 
<br/>rescuing these two girls.  But that is the ocean, it gives, it takes.  We need to keep our Pacific Ocean.  
<br/>It is so connected that it has to be dealt with regionally because what happens in the ocean of another 
<br/>country affects us too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they overfish in one part of the Pacific Ocean, it affects the stock that we have.  In Fiji, 
<br/>we have a pocket of high seas just above our EEZ, commonly referred to as the common heritage of 
<br/>mankind, it belongs to everyone.  But if you overfish in that pocket of high seas, the resources in our 
<br/>EEZ which has a boundary to it is also affected. So, when we deal with matters relating to the ocean, 
<br/>we cannot afford to deal with it as individual nations.  We are so connected that it can only be dealt 
<br/>with regionally because what happens in one affects the other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  our  responsibility,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  here  in  Parliament,  every  person,  every  older 
<br/>generation that was served so well by our ocean like me, like most of us sitting here, we must make 
<br/>sure that our ocean remains that excellent service provider.  Our ocean is a big sequester of carbon 
<br/>through the planktons that live in the warmer waters.  If we begin to pollute our ocean, we are not 
<br/>sure whether these planktons will live and then it affects the amount of carbon that our oceans can 
<br/>sequester, so it is our responsibility.  In my view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, the current generation, must 
<br/></span><span>make sure that we leave the ocean behind to provide that service that we so much enjoy to the highest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  intend  to  suspend  proceedings  for  lunch  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will resume at 2.30 p.m.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  make  contribution  on  the  motion  by  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises, and Communications on the Pacific Ocean’s future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ocean is the largest ecosystem on earth and it is the planet’s life support 
<br/>system.    For  far  too  long,  many  people  assume  that  ocean  was  limitless  and  immune  to  human 
<br/>impacts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific Ocean is  the world  largest  ocean and plays a crucial role in  global economic, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>social and environmental systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  Island  Forum  (PIF)  Leaders,  a  regional  intergovernmental  organisation, 
<br/>recognises the importance of securing the ocean’s future and have highlighted this as a priority in 
<br/>their agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017, the PIF Leaders launched the Blue Pacific Continent Concept which seeks to enhance 
<br/>specific regionalism and promote a collective and sustainable approach to ocean  governance. The 
<br/>Concept recognises that the Pacific Ocean provides significant cultural, economic and environmental 
<br/>benefits to the region, hence the Leaders aim to protect these resources through effective management 
<br/>and conservation efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific Island Forum Leaders have also identified several key challenges that need to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addressed to secure the Pacific Ocean’s future including overfishing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensuring the protection of our oceans and, yes, resources is critical to the 
<br/>sustainable development of our planet.  A healthy ocean regulates climate and reduce climate change 
<br/>impacts.  Hence, here are some ways in which we can achieve this: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Adopt sustainable practices which includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reducing waste; 
<br/>conserving water, and 
<br/>reducing carbon emissions to help to keep our oceans clean and healthy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Establishing Marine Protected Areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where fishing activities and other harmful activities are limited; and 
<br/>can help protect the biodiversity and ecosystem of our oceans 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Regulation of fishing activities - governments and international organisations can regulate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fishing activities to prevent overfishing and reduce bycatch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Advocacy and awareness: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People can raise awareness about the impacts of marine pollution and climate change 
<br/>on our oceans; and 
<br/></span><span>Advocating for better protection and conservation of marine resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Scientific research and data sharing - research and data can help us in better understand the 
<br/>impact  of  human  activities  on  oceans  and  its  ecosystem  so  that  effective  and  informed 
<br/>policies and actions can be taken. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Collaboration and partnership – Government, the private sector, civil society organisations 
<br/>and  individuals  should  collaborate  and  form  partnerships  to  develop  and  implement 
<br/>effective strategies for protection and conserving our oceans and its resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Waste management - proper waste management practices including recycling as well as 
<br/>avoiding the use of plastics and other non-biodegradable materials can help in minimising 
<br/>the amount of waste that ends up in the ocean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  -  we  can  reduce  our  carbon  footprint  using 
<br/>renewable energy, public transportation and reducing reliance on single use materials. This 
<br/>can help to mitigate the effects of climate change which affects the health of our oceans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Reducing oil spills - companies involved in oil drilling and transportation should be held 
<br/>accountable for their actions and should implement proper safety measures to prevent oil 
<br/>spills in the ocean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(10)</span><span> </span><span> Economic  incentives  -  it  can  be  provided  to  companies  and  individuals  that  promote 
<br/>sustainable  practices  and  conservation  of  marine  resources.  These  incentives  can  help 
<br/>promote  sustainable  development  and  support  the  livelihood  of  local  communities  that 
<br/>depend on marine resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to take immediate and long term action to mitigate these issues and 
<br/>promote responsible environmental practices to ensure a healthy and sustainable future for the world’s 
<br/>largest ocean.  Allow me to quote Sylvia Earle, and I quote:  “With every drop of water you drink, every 
<br/>breath you take, you're connected to the sea.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I support the motion by the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also contribute to the debate and support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have always maintained that the island countries of the Pacific can create 
<br/>great wealth for themselves by harvesting the resources from the ocean.  I remember some time ago 
<br/>when  I  was  a  hotelier,  there  was  a  conference  in  my  hotel  that  brought in  countries  into  Nadi  to 
<br/>discuss about the tuna arrangement at that time.  And I remember one of the resource persons from 
<br/>New Zealand who knew me and I knew him very well said, “Bill, the island nations are not getting 
<br/>a fair price for their fish”, and it has always stuck with me, Mr. Speaker, and the more I get into this, 
<br/>the more convinced I am that if you are able to secure a fair price for the harvest from our ocean 
<br/>which is feeding millions of people in the Northern part of the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had mentioned two days ago in my Ministerial Statement, when I went to Doha for the 
<br/>Lesser  Developed  Countries  Conference,  three  of  our  neighbouring  countries  are  in  the  LDCs  - 
<br/>Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Solomons. These are three countries with very fertile seas for tuna and the 
<br/>like, Mr. Speaker, and yet they are there as lesser developed countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have raised this within our Cabinet that we need to perhaps, take a leadership role in this 
<br/>and create the kind of dialogue that will raise the profile of this globally and for the island countries 
<br/>to start harvesting their sea resources in a manner that creates the wealth that they deserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I always go back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
<br/>(OPEC).  They formed OPEC in 1960 and people were extracting oil from their countries, yet they 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>909 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remain poor.  Until around about 1972 or 1973 when they decided to start taking control of their oil 
<br/>resources. And what we see today, Sir, the wealth that we now see in the Middle East is because they 
<br/>decided to secure a fair price for their oil collectively.  The whole world was benefitting from their 
<br/>oil, yet they were remaining poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was in Doha, I was told that 50 years ago, Doha was a small fishing village, but today 
<br/>it is a metropolis - one of the most modern in the world.  And it is because of that, when they realised, 
<br/>“We are giving our oil away too cheaply.  The world needs it, so let us get a good price for it”, and 
<br/>their decision is evident in the way they have developed up to this day.  And I believe, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>the same can be done for our small island nations.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I shared with the Parliament the other day that I had audience with the Deputy Secretary-
<br/>General to the United Nations, Ms. Amina J. Mohammed, and I raised this with her.  I said, “please, 
<br/>see if we can alleviate this dialogue into the United Nations and start having this conversation on 
<br/>how the island countries can uplift their economy by getting a fair price for their resources, tuna in 
<br/>particular, and other species of seafood.”  That to me, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the ocean 
<br/>today, there is so much focus now on the Pacific Ocean, that wealth must translate to the betterment 
<br/>of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have heard people who fly over that area, they see all these huge ships and they are like 
<br/>factories, fishing in the waters of Kiribati and Tuvalu and manufacturing whatever they catch in those 
<br/>big ships.  People have shared that with me, one of the High Commissioners was telling me that.  So, 
<br/>you ask the question, if this is happening in their seas in the EEZ, why are they poor?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  part  of  the  dialogue  today  is  to  look  at  the  ocean  from  that  economic 
<br/>perspective and in a direct way, to benefit our island neighbours, and Fiji will benefit from it also 
<br/>because we are the port nearest to them.  This is where we can carry out repairs, replenishment of 
<br/>supplies, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As already stated,Mr. Speaker, we want to see those boats back into Suva.  There used to be 
<br/>about 400 vessels here every year.  The FijiFirst Government had made some changes and they have 
<br/>all gone to Pagopago.  We are told that it is easier to go back to home base, it is not true because they 
<br/>have relocated to Pagopago.  We need them back in Suva.  So, when fishing begins to translate to 
<br/>wealth for our neighbouring countries in the manner that is fair, Fiji will benefit from it.  They will 
<br/>come to Fiji as a base.  As we all know, it has happened in the past - change of crews.  They come 
<br/>here at Nadi Airport and they fly back to their home base.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion, we do not want anyone to be dumping anything in the 
<br/>ocean and for me, I look at it from an economic perspective and I think if we support this initiative 
<br/>that we get fair price, our country and our region as a whole will benefit from it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I last spoke with the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Amina Mohammed, she was also 
<br/>quite impressed with the unity that we now have in the PIF.  They have noticed this, and then she 
<br/>just said to me, “I wish the whole world could follow what you have done in the Pacific.  There is so 
<br/>much  turmoil  around  the  globe.    I  wish  they  would  follow  the  example  of  what  you  have 
<br/></span><span>accomplished in the Pacific region”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, with unity, will be our strength, as it protects our ocean and at the same time, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>make sure that we benefit from it economically in a direct manner that I believe is still lacking today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution in support of this motion.

<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion that is before Parliament.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rise to speak about one of the most important bodies of water on our planet, the Pacific Ocean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean on Earth, covering over 60 million square miles and 
<br/>spending over one-third of the Earth’s surface.  It is home to a vast array of marine life and supports 
<br/>countless human communities around the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  this  vital  resource  is  under  threat  and  it  is  our  responsibility  to  protect  it.  
<br/>Unfortunately, the Pacific Ocean is facing a growing number of threats.  One of the biggest threats 
<br/>to the health of the Pacific Ocean is pollution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every year billions of tonnes of plastic waste, oil and other pollutants are dumped into the 
<br/>ocean, causing devastating harm to the marine life and ecosystem.  For example, plastic pollution has 
<br/>been found in the stomach of over 90 percent of all seabirds and it is estimated that by 2050, there 
<br/>will be more plastic in the ocean than fish, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate change is also having a profound effect on the Pacific Ocean.  Rising sea levels and 
<br/>increasing temperatures are causing coral reefs to bleach and die, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and are disrupting 
<br/>the migration patterns of marine species.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ocean acidification caused by this option of carbon dioxide from 
<br/>the  atmosphere  is  making  it  harder  for  marine  organisms  to  build  shells  and  skeletons  which  is 
<br/>affecting  the  entire  food  chain.    So,  what  can  we  do  to  protect  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  ensure  its 
<br/>continued health for the generations to come?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must congratulate the FijiFirst Government for introducing the Fiji Oceans 
<br/>Policy.  It was and is a remarkable initiative that will significantly enhance Fiji’s oceans’ governance 
<br/>framework  and  promote  sustainability  in  the  area.    The  FijiFirst  Government  had  taken  many 
<br/>initiatives to ensure that its domestic laws were aligned with international legal obligations to protect 
<br/>and manage the worlds’ ocean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Among these initiatives is the Ocean and Climate Change Policy which outlines the country’s 
<br/>action and policy for achieving sustainable oceans and climate resilience.  The implementation of 
<br/>this Policy is  vital  as it provides a coordinated  approach to  ocean management, conservation and 
<br/>development.  It highlights the need for the Fijian Government to work together with stakeholders in 
<br/>ensuring the sustainable use of ocean resources for the present and future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Ocean Policy aims to address many issues that threatened the ocean, 
<br/>including  climate  change,  overfishing,  pollution,  illegal  unreported  and  unregulated  fishing.    The 
<br/>Policy recognises the importance of addressing these challenges in promoting ocean sustainability in 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Policy’s implementation involve the  use of advanced technology, the 
<br/>inclusion of traditional knowledge and raising awareness about the significance of oceans in Fiji.  
<br/>These  actions  will  lead  to  the  development  of  a  robust  ocean  management  framework  that  will 
<br/></span><span>effectively  regulate  all  ocean  activities,  promote  conservation  and  support  the  sustainable  use  of 
<br/></span><span>ocean resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speakers, Sir, this Policy provides economic opportunities for Fijians while ensuring the 
<br/>long-term  sustainability  of  the  fishing  industry.    By  promoting  sustainable  fishing  practices,  the 
<br/>Government  can  attract  more  eco-friendly  tourism  and  increase  its  revenue,  while  protecting  its 
<br/>precious ocean resources.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>911 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Fiji’s Ocean Policy is an excellent initiative that has significantly boosted 
<br/>the  sustainability  of  Fiji’s  oceans.    It  is  a  critical  step  towards  achieving  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 14, which focuses on life under water.  The FijiFirst 
<br/>Government has set an excellent example for other countries and also for the Coalition Government 
<br/>to follow, and I hope that this Policy will soon become a model for sustainable ocean management 
<br/>worldwide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other initiatives undertaken by the leadership of the FijiFirst Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was to address ocean conservation and management, and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>establishing Marine Protected Areas and promote community-based sustainable fisheries 
<br/>management; 
<br/>to  be  actively  involved  in  the  regional  and  international  initiatives  to  combat  illegal, 
<br/>unreported and unregulated fishing; and  
<br/>to launch an initiative commonly known as the Mangrove Management Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speakers, Sir, Fiji has a strong commitment in reducing marine pollution.  The FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government banned the use of single use plastic bags and straws and a levy was put on plastic bags.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  is  actively  participating  in  the  UN  Global  programme  for  action  for  the  protection  of 
<br/>marine  environment  from  land-based  activities.    The  FijiFirst  Government  has  ensured  that  its 
<br/>domestic  laws  were  consistent  with  the international  legal  obligations  on  ocean  conservation  and 
<br/>management, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  (UNCLOS), and the 
<br/>Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the climate change policy represents a significant step towards fulfilling 
<br/>Fiji’s international obligations on ocean conservation and management.  The Policy recognises that 
<br/>the  ocean  is  crucial  to  the  wellbeing  and  livelihoods  of  people  in  Fiji,  as  well  as  to  the  global 
<br/>ecosystem.    It  sets  out  actions  to  enhance  sustainable  management  of  marine  resources,  reduce 
<br/>pollution and promote marine biodiversity conservation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  collaborative  efforts  and  partnership  with  stakeholders,  Fiji  has 
<br/>taken a leadership role in addressing these global crisis.  The FijiFirst Government’s effort to promote 
<br/>sustainable  development,  combat  illegal  fishing  and  protect  marine  habitants  are  very  much 
<br/>commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speakers,  Sir,  nuclear  waste  dumping  in  the  ocean  is  a  grave  environmental  concern.  
<br/>Nuclear waste is the byproduct of the nuclear power plants which is highly radioactive and dangerous 
<br/>to human and marine lives.  The disposal of such waste is a significant concern for nations worldwide 
<br/>and especially the Pacific countries, as it poses severe threat to the human health and the environment.  
<br/>Nuclear waste dumping in the Pacific Ocean has become a significant concern and measures must be 
<br/>taken to address this issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific Ocean is a vast body of water that connects many nations around the world, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir,  and many countries have used it as a dumping ground for their nuclear waste.  This has 
<br/></span><span>led to severe environmental concerns as nuclear waste can cause devastating effects on marine life, 
<br/>ecosystem and human health.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nuclear waste deposit in the Pacific Ocean is not 
<br/>limited to any particular area.   It spreads throughout the ocean and the site of the largest man-made 
<br/>nuclear disaster, Chernobyl, is also situated near the Pacific Ocean. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has made a firm stand in its decision to ban nuclear waste dumping in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>its waters.  Fiji has taken steps to ensure that water surrounding it are free from nuclear waste.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has always been a ban on the entry of any ship carrying radioactive 
<br/>material into our waters.  The ban includes ships carrying nuclear waste, ships used in nuclear tests 
<br/>and ships carrying radioactive material for research purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s stand to ban nuclear waste dumping is commendable as it shows its 
<br/>commitment towards protecting the environment and marine life.  Fiji should not compromise on the 
<br/>safety of its people and the environment.  The ban on the nuclear waste dumping is an essential step 
<br/>towards a sustainable future.  It is crucial that other countries follow Fiji’s example and take steps to 
<br/>prevent nuclear waste disposal in the ocean.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the effects of nuclear waste on the ecosystem can be severely long lasting.  
<br/>Governments around the world must take action to ensure that nuclear waste is disposed often in a 
<br/>responsible and safe manner.  The oceans are one of our planet’s most valuable resources and we 
<br/>must protect them from any harm caused by human activities, including nuclear waste dumping.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speakers,  Sir,  the  participation  and  facilitation  of  international  agencies  and  partner 
<br/>organisations and partner governments have been and is critical in achieving these goals.  The pooling 
<br/>of resources, sharing of knowledge and the expertise has provided Fiji with the necessary spot for 
<br/>tackling these issues head-on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the best way forward is for the Coalition Government to continue with the 
<br/>work  FijiFirst  has  done  to  further  strengthen  its  partnership  with  international  agencies  and 
<br/>governments.   By working together, we can ensure the protection and preservation of our oceans 
<br/>and resources for the future generation.  With those words, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  there  has  been  a  slight  reshuffle  and  I  will  be 
<br/>offering  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  now  and  is  to  be  followed  by  honourable 
<br/>Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend all the speakers - honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from both sides of Parliament for their support.   T 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, his motion is one that the Government expected to be taken up at a common 
<br/>cry for consideration of our environment.  The dealing with the discharge of what we now still call 
<br/>contaminated water from the nuclear plant in Japan and when we look at the history of Japan, we are 
<br/>touched by the fact that they were the first to be bombed, by a very high yielding bomb that ended 
<br/>the World War II.  Since then, they have suffered.  The same with Germany, Sir.  They have suffered 
<br/>since the end of World War II.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While they were hamstrung, they were given a period of reparation where they had to pay so 
<br/>much initially to the legal nations and the United Nations for the damages caused during the War, 
<br/>they were forbidden from building up their military capabilities.  They were allowed to develop their 
<br/></span><span>own self-defence capabilities, and while they were doing that, they developed their own engineering 
<br/></span><span>capabilities and became phoenix in their own right in manufacturing, the development of technology, 
<br/>et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, as the world moved away from war-like developments of 
<br/>nuclear, atomic and hydrogen energy into the use of these sources of energy in development of the  
<br/>the industries, they got into an accident.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>913 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are very sympathetic to our concerns and like all of these international concerns, we 
<br/>have to rely on the experts or the universally acclaimed or acknowledged experts, in this case the 
<br/>nuclear energy agency.  We are relying on them to give us the word that it is now safe to discharge 
<br/>these water into the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure, Sir, the Japanese would not want to discharge into the Pacific if they knew it was 
<br/>not safe because they will be the first shoreline affected by the discharge.  But we would like to be 
<br/>assured, and all the countries in the Pacific, particularly the Pacific Island Forum countries would 
<br/>like to be assured that it is safe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the PIF Leaders Retreat in Nadi earlier on in the year, there was common cry, ‘If it is safe, 
<br/>keep it’.  We have received some expert advice that it is safe and there are others saying, it is not 
<br/>safe.  It is the same as COVID-19 when WHO said, “It is okay to use these vaccines” and some other 
<br/>authorities said, “No, it is not right.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The doctors and international law students in Parliament would know that those experts are 
<br/>immune from prosecution.  If they give the advice, you cannot go and prosecute them.  If they say it 
<br/>is safe and we use it and we find out that it is not safe, you cannot go and sue the pharmaceutical 
<br/>companies, like not being able to sue the vehicle manufacturers for the accidents you have on the 
<br/>road.  You may be able to sue the driver, but you cannot sue the manufacturer of the car.  These are 
<br/>the sort of things that the world is going through at this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must be very cautious as we debate this in this Parliament.  I am sure other countries in 
<br/>the region are watching us when we can come up and be united with a concerted effort to pass this 
<br/>motion - a motion cautioning our friends, the Japanese. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Japan is  a very sizeable contributor to our development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and on our our 
<br/>bilateral  relationship,  we  do  not  want  to  hurt  that  relationship.    On  our  regional  concern  for  our 
<br/>neighbours in the Pacific, we do not want to hurt them by saying, “Alright, we are sure that it is okay, 
<br/>let us tell them it is alright.”  We may think it is safe, but the region is still unsure, so let us tread 
<br/>cautiously.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the international scene, the honourable Leader of the Opposition had been identified as 
<br/>Champion of climate change and global warming.  We have been talking all the things that have 
<br/>happened.  Some of us read the </span><span>Bible</span><span>, some of us read the </span><span>Koran</span><span>, some read the Hindu religious 
<br/>books, and we have our own interpretations of creation, the wisdom of creation and the dangers that 
<br/>have affected the perfection of creation by perhaps, the greed of humankind.  We look at and we 
<br/>marvel at the sequence with which the Creator created.  First of all, there is water, and then the light, 
<br/>and then the grass and all those things, and then the animals.  Imagine if the animals had come before 
<br/>the grass.  Imagine if the human beings were created before the other things, how would we survive?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  try  and  get  back  to  the  wisdom  of  creation  and  try  and  dovetail  our  need  for 
<br/>development and also our need to make the environment habitable for all of us  - not only human 
<br/>beings but also for the animals who help provide food for us (we are not kind to them) but there are 
<br/>considerations we have to make.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we, the Republic of Fiji, can show that we can have this bipartisan approach at this 
<br/>universal requirement, we are creating an image of a responsible nation.  We have come out of some 
<br/>very dark years in our development.  From 1987, 2000, we are just moving away from that and it is 
<br/>time for us to say, “We are here, we have developed, do not mind our past, look at where we are 
<br/>going to the future.”

<div><span>When  we  have  these  responsible  debates,  we  show  ourselves  as  progressive  thinkers, 
<br/>objective  thinkers, and show that we can lead our country, we can lead the region, we are a reasonable 
<br/>player in the world, very soon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, people will open us for us, countries will open up 
<br/>to us.  We are worried about the size of our economy, that can grow.  We have bilateral, regional and 
<br/>international cooperations with our bigger partners in the development of the universe and our region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for this motion. I thank all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members who have contributed in support and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion.  I do not think there 
<br/>is anyone in this country or in any small island State in the Pacific or the world for that matter that 
<br/>would not support this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think as the honourable Naupoto has so eloquently described today the importance of this 
<br/>Ocean for us, not  just in terms  of its physical  terms  but  in terms  of our very essence of being  as 
<br/>Pacific Islanders and as island people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific,  we  know  it  matters  to  us  for  all  sorts  of  different  reasons  -  for  our  past,  our 
<br/>heritage and also for our future. That is what it is for us - our climate and food security.  We know 
<br/>that it makes up half of the earth, that is ocean, and it is home to more marine species than any other 
<br/>ocean basin on the planet - actually the home to more, and it provides 70 percent of the verbal fish 
<br/>catch.  So, it is not only important for environmental issues but also economically in the supply of 
<br/>fish which is our very source of protein for people all over the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific has  most of  the islands of any other  Ocean.   The figure that  I have is  around 
<br/>25,000.  It is bigger than the total size of all the Continents on the Earth combined.  So, I was thinking 
<br/>about what the honourable Prime Minister was saying, being here in Fiji we are asked to be part of 
<br/>the other countries to be actually stewards of this great Ocean.  We are put in place to be stewards of 
<br/>this Ocean.  The deepest spot on the Earth can be found in the Pacific - the deepest ravines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rainwater, drinking water, weather systems, climates - they are all ultimately provided and 
<br/>kept in balance by the ocean and, of course, also the Amazon Forest, which has been described by 
<br/>others as the lungs of the Earth, making sure that life can be sustained into the future.  We rely on it 
<br/>as a major source of the  food that we eat  and even for oxygen that is  produced.  Oxygen is  also 
<br/>produced by all of these green things that we breath.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know all the changes that are coming, some of them are induced by climatic changes and 
<br/>I think the ones that have been discussed at length today is man-made.  We also know about this 
<br/>warmer atmosphere.  We all know about the changes to our global climate, oceans are becoming 
<br/>warmer, more acidic, and when you have warmer oceans, it means stronger cyclones.  That is what 
<br/>it means - higher sea levels and larger changes in precipitation patterns.  When the rain falls, it falls 
<br/>very  intensely  in  a  very  short  period  of  time  and  I  think  the  Minister  responsible  for  Disaster 
<br/>Management will be very familiar now with the impact this is having all across our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that the extent of our future climate change depends on what we do with the 
<br/></span><span>greenhouse gas emissions and we as a country, our leaders, have been at the forefront of this fight 
<br/></span><span>because we know that the more we emit, the larger the changes will be.  People are saying in the 
<br/>world now, 1.5 is probably gone.  So, I mean that is, I do not know. Sometimes when I think about 
<br/>it,  I  prefer  not  to  think  about  it  -  what  it  means  for  my  grandchildren  and  my  grandchildren’s 
<br/>grandchildren. But I think for us, the feelings that have been expected by the Pacific Island Forum 
<br/>Leaders is that we, in the Pacific, need to remain strong and reach out together as it is critical.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am glad to see that we had the Forum Leaders Meeting in February this year. When we 
<br/>were in Government, our Prime Minister had one in June or July last year where there was gathering 
<br/>together so we need to maintain that togetherness of all island countries, not only in the Pacific, but 
<br/>across throughout.  This is very important because we are small island nations but that combined 
<br/>working together can have an impact on things that are happening around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition talked about the Association of Small Island States 
<br/>(AOSIS) and Small Island States work together to get oceans onto the global agenda.  So, it actually 
<br/>had  an  SDG  on  its  own  and  that  shows  what  can  happen  when  Small  Island  States  with  small 
<br/>population bend together and are able to project what they want. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can remember being at the Paris in 2015 when the Small Island States were trying to push 
<br/>this agenda and it was very, very difficult - about oceans and about 1.5.  It did not get through but I 
<br/>think, at the end of the day, we managed to get  it as part of the SDG.  And I am glad to see the 
<br/>developments that Fiji had a part to play.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Suva Agreement of September 2015 which articulated some of our major concerns and 
<br/>which other countries in the Pacific signed on to, to express our concerns about what is happening 
<br/>and the kind of messages that we, as a region, needed to pass on to the world so that the world could 
<br/>decide to take actions on things that can have an impact on us here in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had an Ocean Conference that we co-chaired with Sweden in 2017.  So, Fiji has been 
<br/>right there in the battle to preserve oceans.  We have all the oceans work that we have done with 
<br/>AOSIS. Over the past years, we have had the COP23 Presidency and we have been able to push very 
<br/>strongly for this agenda.  Of course, during our advocacy and working with G77 in China we have 
<br/>been able to use that platform to push the agenda of the Oceans. I think that has been a good platform 
<br/>that  the  FijiFirst  Government  has  built  over  the  past  years  and  we  look  forward  to  this  current 
<br/>Government to continue that fight and make sure that you continue to take it to another level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we have worked hard to make sure that the Island States get the benefits.  There is this 
<br/>separation between LDCs and countries like ourselves. So, LDCs get special concessiond in terms 
<br/>of loans, et cetera. We have worked very hard to make sure that some of those concessions were also 
<br/>given to us, not because we are an LDC but because of our vulnerability. We fought on the basis of 
<br/>vulnerability.  We are a very vulnerable island nation,  even though we are not LDC,  give us those 
<br/>concessions.  It was a long hard battle but we got there, and that is why we are beginning to get some 
<br/>of those concessional loans because of our extreme vulnerability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today’s issues are the preservation of the Pacific Ocean.  As I have said, it influences the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>global climate, it is a largest ocean, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Preservation of oceans is not something that we can own it, we need to battle it out on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>global front – the SDGs, et cetera, at the UN, but we also need to battle on it at home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are lot of things happening in our country.  We are talking about tourism as a biggest 
<br/>earner of income for Fiji. We know what is happening to our coral reefs. Coral reefs are dying in a 
<br/></span><span>lot  of  parts  of  Fiji.  Sea  levels  are  rising  which  has  an  impact  on  our  infrastructure,  fisheries 
<br/></span><span>acidification, coral bleaching, sediments killing the reefs - we have seen this in Nadi in particular 
<br/>where the sediments, cutting of trees, agriculture brings the sediment down as an impact on all of 
<br/>those areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there are also a lot of things that we need to do in-country to try to address these things.  
<br/>But when we try to address them, there is a price to pay because a lot of people will resist the things 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we have to do. If you have to cut down indiscriminating cutting of trees or agricultural prices, 
<br/>there is a price to pay in those things. There will be a push back on those things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think as we are looking at the global agenda, we also have to think seriously about what we 
<br/>need to do in-country, and it is not an easy thing to do but we will have to go against what a lot of 
<br/>people want for their own personal interest. Sometimes, what is best for their own interest is not what 
<br/>is  best for the interest of the country at large. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think there is going to be something, that over time, Government will have to take the bull 
<br/>behind the horns and must be become a catalyst for the change that will impact on peoples lives by 
<br/>doing the necessary things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just like this Government did in terms of </span><span>Walesi</span><span>. We took the bull by the horn, we grapple it, 
<br/>but we made sure we push that through. Sometimes you have to do that. So, be strong, do not give 
<br/>up as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica said you are thinking of giving up,  do not 
<br/>give up, be strong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am supporting the motion but I am just giving some encouragement because of our linkages 
<br/>too, he knows. But toda,y we are talking about the nuclear threat.  I remember when I was a student 
<br/>at USP, together with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad, we used to fight against 
<br/>this nuclear thing. We marched on the street of Suva.  I do not know whether the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Infrastructure remembers this - marching the streets against nuclear threat is beginning to come 
<br/>up again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there has always been this stride.  We remember the Green Peace/Rambo warrior. Now,e 
<br/>we have this particular issue. I have listened very carefully to what the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>has talked about, the Fukushima Wastewater. As he has said, some people say it is safe, other people 
<br/>say it is not safe. I think for me, Japan is such a strong allie of us, but whatever happens, it must not 
<br/>be at the expense of our people.  So, we have to be perfectively sure - absolutely 100 percent sure if 
<br/>that wastewater is going to have an impact on the ocean and us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have also been thinking about these AUKUS nuclear submarines. While they do not carry 
<br/>nuclear war heads,  they do have nuclear things in them and I hope that those nuclear submarines 
<br/>might not have an accident which then might lead to some radiation type of things, so that is another 
<br/>issue.   I know our Government is committed to that in partnership with the Australia, but we have 
<br/>to be very careful that the protocols or whatever need to be maintained, so that our oceans and our 
<br/>people are not harmed by the potential of nuclear radiation in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  things  that  we  have  fought  very  hard  for,  and  I  think  we  need  to  keep  on 
<br/>strengthening this, is our fight for loss and damage.  I remember in Paris, the fight for loss and damage 
<br/>we never got an inch.  Loss and damage when we say, the countries that caused the calamity because 
<br/>of their greenhouse gas emissions should pay some compensation to us who are suffering the brunt 
<br/>of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For many years it did not move but now it is beginning to move.  Now, finally, it is beginning 
<br/></span><span>to  move. So, I encourage the Government,  as you go out  there, please, fight on the behalf of the 
<br/></span><span>people of the Pacific to move that loss and damage forward so we can get some of that money across 
<br/>to help our community, and we here on our side will offer our support in that battle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing that I wanted to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I talked about the importance to fight 
<br/>the nuclear impact on our people, the need for us to remain strong, not only as a country, regionally 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>917 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but with all other island States.  That is why AOSIS is very important. That is why it also important 
<br/>to align ourselves with big blocs that have a lot of power in the world, such as G77 and China.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this afternoon, the honourable Prime Minister has talked about Japan and 
<br/>Germany.    In  the  aftermath  of  the  World  War,  they  were  completely  devastated,  but  we  had  the 
<br/>victors in the war.  I think one of their benefits during that war is that, the people that have victory 
<br/>over them came to help them. We had the Marshall Plan in Europe that led  to the resuscitation of 
<br/>Germany. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  had  the  same  sort  of  assistance  given  by  the  Americans  to  Japan  that  led  that 
<br/>transformation in that country so it became an industrial super power over time.   I think we need 
<br/>something like that for the Pacific Island nations. We need someone somehow to get that injection 
<br/>of funds or expertise to help us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been an interesting suggestion made by Mia Mottley, the Prime Minister Barbados. 
<br/>We have been following what she has been talking about over the past few months, talking about 
<br/>building  a  coalition  of  nations  committed  to  overhauling  the  financial  systems  in  the  world  and 
<br/>unleash trillions of dollars to address this.  She is talking about World Bank and IMF because these 
<br/>funds are managed by those people.  There needs to be a revolution in the way they address those 
<br/>issues so that fund can be used to help us who are facing these calamities today.  And the outcome 
<br/>of that is called the Bridgetown Agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bridgetown  Agenda  is  designed  to  reform  the  World  Bank  and  the  International 
<br/>Monetary Fund. These are institutions set up at the end of World War II and the powers that be are 
<br/>the ones in Europe who were involved in that world war so all of the parameters and how it operates 
<br/>is towards their benefit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it has been about a revolution.  I would suggest also that the Government seriously look 
<br/>into the BridgetownAgenda and how we can also join that battle so that we can begin to get these 
<br/>funds to assist us in our battle to preserve the ocean for our current generation and the generations to 
<br/>come, that one day our generation will ask us, what did you do for the Pacific Ocean?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may, please, forgive me if I go a few minutes extra 
<br/>on this because this is a passionate call on behalf of all Fijians. I say that, Sir, because I was actually 
<br/>a part of the discussions when it had actually commenced with respect to Japan’s request. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to quote something, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that everyone in Fiji can know what it is like 
<br/>to be the recipient of what happens when you store nuclear waste.  I am actually quoting from the 
<br/></span><span>Washington Post</span><span>. This was an article that was actually published more than three years ago, and I 
<br/>quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“At 6:45 a.m. on March 1, 1954, the blue sky stretching over the central  Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ocean was split open by an enormous red flash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within seconds, a mushroom cloud towered 4½ miles high over Bikini Atoll in the 
<br/>Marshall  Islands.    The  explosion,  the  U.S.  government’s  first  weaponized  hydrogen 
<br/>bomb, was 1,000 times as powerful as the “Little Boy” atomic bomb blast that flattened 
<br/>Hiroshima - and a complete miscalculation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>918 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scientists had underestimated the size of what became known as the “Castle Bravo” 
<br/>test, resulting in an explosion that was 2½ times larger than expected.  Radioactive ash 
<br/>dropped more than 7,000 square miles from the bomb site, caking the nearby inhabited 
<br/>islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Within hours, the atoll was covered with a fine, white, powder-like substance.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just from that message, you will understand what can happen if you are the 
<br/>recipient.  Along the same lines, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a message then that was reiterated by 
<br/>the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on a tour of the Pacific Islands to discuss climate 
<br/>change.  Again, I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In Fiji on Thursday, he told a crowd about the huge “a kind of coffin” built by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>US in the Marshall Islands to house the deadly radioactive debris from the 1980s.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The structure, however, was never meant to last.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a reason for me quoting this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Today, due to disrepair and rising sea tides, it is dangerously vulnerable. A strong 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>storm could reach the dome, releasing the deadly legacy of America’s nuclear might.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, this is very important Sir, again, I have not finished the quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In 1980, a massive concrete dome – 18 inches thick and shaped like a flying saucer – was 
<br/>placed over the fallout debris, sealing off the material on Runit.  
<br/>But the $218 million (£172 million) project was only supposed to be temporary until a more 
<br/>permanent site was developed, according to </span><span>The Guardian</span><span>.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fellow Members of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, this is a quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That dome is the connection between the nuclear age and the climate change age.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a quote from an Australian broadcaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, just to put it into perspective, the ABC, according to a 2017 report, said that the fallout 
<br/>included Plutonium-239, an isotope that is one of the world’s most toxic substances and this is what 
<br/>should hit onto us and one with a radioactive half-life of 24,100 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the request that has been made by Japan, they are friends of ours, they are 
<br/>development partners of ours, but you must remember for years and years, we in the Pacific Islands, 
<br/>have been in control of some of the largest ocean in the world that we have always have the smallest 
<br/>voice.  In any forum, we were stepped on, moved aside - no more, Mr. Speaker, no more!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot let this happen; we must not let this happen.  It is imperative upon us, we do not 
<br/></span><span>need the scientific results on this.  We have to be the protectors of our ocean.  We have to ensure that 
<br/></span><span>our future generations are protected and the reason why Mr. Speaker, is exactly what I just said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, many years later, now what has transpired is that particular dome is leaking.  It is leaking, 
<br/>we  are  18  inches  away  from  absolute  disaster  in  the  Pacific  Ocean.    Guess  what,  Mr.  Speaker?  
<br/>Everyone has washed their hands off it because of the documents that were signed when the Marshal 
<br/>Islands became free from the United States and it had covered, it had future proofed itself. So, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>919 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>US is no longer responsible for it.  But they do not have the necessary funding to ensure that, that 
<br/>leakage does not go into the ocean.  It has been raised; it is something that the Forum is very well 
<br/>aware of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the hard reality of what happens when there is nuclear waste that you 
<br/>have to deal with.  And the honourable Minister is actually correct, if in their opinion, it is safe to do 
<br/>so, what is the harm in the release in their rivers and streams?  Why our Pacific Ocean?  That is the 
<br/>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, I have been a part of the discussions on this right from the outset 
<br/>and  I  know,  Sir,  that  there  are  conflicting  scientific  reports  that  say  one  thing  and  the  other  says 
<br/>another.  How are we to ascertain what is going to happen to our future generations?  We live by the 
<br/>sea, we eat from the sea, we rely on the sea.  Many countries do not actually realise that, but it is a 
<br/>source of literally everything for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a decision that is actually quite simple and Fiji, as the champion of the course of climate 
<br/>change, we have been at the forefront of discussions.  We should not even blink when making and 
<br/>deciding as to what the answer should be to the request. Simply flat, “No”, because we are still not 
<br/>sure of what may happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Secretary-General for PIF actually made a statement just recently and he gave a piece in 
<br/>the newspaper. I think it is actually quite important that everyone is quite aware of, and he gave an 
<br/>opinion on this.  He said that over the past 20 months, Pacific Island Forum members have actually 
<br/>been in dialogue with the Japanese Government with respect to all these, but he raised some issues 
<br/>that are quite correct.  He said that the discussions in the past year have actually not been encouraged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are serious information gaps that  exist and grave concerns with  the proposed ocean 
<br/>release.  Simply put, of course, more data is needed before any ocean release should be permitted.  
<br/>But despite this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Japan is continuing the plans with respect to discharge in the spring 
<br/>of 2023.  These are the words of Secretary-General from PIFS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relying on the next four years of discharge to figure it out, that is about as dangerous that 
<br/>you can get.  We must not forget also that we have to uphold the commitments with respect to the 
<br/>Treaty of Rarotonga, which is quite important.  We cannot allow nuclear waste to go into the ocean, 
<br/>that is one of our obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, and I quote this and I think Parliament and everyone in Fiji needs to hear this. We 
<br/>respect Japan for all that is, but there was a conversation according to the Secretary-General that was 
<br/>heard, it is not a new one, it was about four decades ago, and he refers to it by saying: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Forum leaders also urged Japan and other shipping States to store or dump 
<br/>their nuclear waste in their home countries rather than storing or dumping them in the 
<br/>Pacific.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A mere four years after that political statement in 1985, the Forum welcomed Japan’s Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister’s statement that Japan had no intention of dumping radioactive waste in the Pacific Ocean 
<br/></span><span>in disregard of the concern expressed by the communities of the Region.  The decision for any ocean 
<br/>release should not only be a domestic matter for Japan, but a global and transnational issue that should 
<br/>should give rise to the need to examine issue in the context of obligations under the international law.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned by honourable Usamate, Vanuatu took it upon themselves on 
<br/>behalf of the Pacific and we supported them, who went to the ICJ to get a decision with respect to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>920 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Protection of Pacific Ocean and its Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>climate change and the catastrophic events that come out of climate change and who is going to be 
<br/>responsible for it.   And I know that they got a positive response from the ICJ with respect to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these things matter, Mr. Speaker, and in order for us as responsible citizens of Fiji and 
<br/>the Pacific Island Forum and as protectors of the ocean, we need to say, ‘no’.   It is as simple as that.  
<br/>There is no waiting for the scientist to come up because the scientist can tell you one thing today and 
<br/>another thing tomorrow.  There is too much unknown quantity with respect to nuclear waste ater 
<br/>being pumped into the Pacific Ocean.  It cannot happen, Mr. Speaker.  It is something that would be 
<br/>a legacy that we would leave behind as Fijian people for our generations in the 30 years, 40 years or 
<br/>50 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of everything that I said, Sir, on behalf of everyone here and our  leader, I want to 
<br/>thank the honourable Minister for raising this motion and I want to tell all Fijian people, this is the 
<br/>one time you will get a thousand percent support from this side of Parliament with respect to this 
<br/>motion.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I support the motion wholeheartedly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion at hand.  I 
<br/>note the various opinions that have been expressed.  Of course, it is very important for, we, as Pacific 
<br/>Islanders  to  understand  the  subject  matter  and  how  critical  it  is  to  share  this  not  only  within  our 
<br/>Parliament,  but  also  with  our  people  and  with  the  Pacific  regarding  the  plans  to  dump  nuclear 
<br/>wastewater.  It presents a clear and present danger with the people of the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been various opinions expressed on this, not only in the international media but 
<br/>closer to Japan.  For example, there was one opinion in the Korean news agency, stating that there 
<br/>are, at least, five options for dealing with nuclear contaminated water from the Fukushima Nuclear 
<br/>Plant, including evaporating and storing it underground.  But the Japanese Government chose the 
<br/>cheapest and fastest way and it has not prioritised reducing the damage to human health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  also  the  opinion  that  the  Japanese  Government  has  ignored  domestic  and 
<br/>international opposition in terms of dumping of contaminated water and it is putting ahead economic 
<br/>interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  also  the  issue  regarding  international  geopolitics  regarding  the 
<br/>Japanese and the West, including the US and the UK.  Those are also issues which might be hindering 
<br/>what we are talking about today - prioritising our environment and our Pacific Islanders and Pacific 
<br/>Islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the dumping of nuclear waste into the ocean, it has been happening for a long time 
<br/>with the nuclear powers - the US, UK, Russia.  For example, from 1946 to 1993, 13 countries used 
<br/>ocean disposal as a method to dispose of nuclear waste of approximately 200,000 tonnes, sourcing 
<br/>mainly from medical research and mostly from the nuclear industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members have said some research in the issue and it is important 
<br/></span><span>that we also understand that in terms of the seriousness of the issue and also from the perspective of 
<br/></span><span>what the Japanese authorities are saying.  Let me read out what they are saying, I quote:

<div><span>“There  have  been  claims  to  clarify  that  all  traces  of  highly  radioactive  elements

<div><span>It should be noted that less radioactive elements of tritium and radioactive isotope of hydrogen, 
<br/>which the Japanese claimed to pose a low risk to human health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The US Secretary also stated it lauded Japan for its transparent efforts in following globally 
<br/>accepted standards of nuclear safety.  Again, as already expressed, there are various opinions and it 
<br/>is a concern for us that those opinions have been expressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  share  this,  in  the  same  article,  it  states  that  the  storage  tanks  at  Fukushima  held 
<br/>wastewater  that  have  been  contaminated  with  nuclear  types,  such  as  cesium,  et  cetera,  including 
<br/>protonium. The Japanese Government has claimed that this have been removed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Critics  argue that  the advanced liquid  processing system  which was the treatment  process 
<br/>used at the Fukushima Plants fails to capture dangerous isotopes such as tritium, tritium, cobalt and 
<br/>strontium with absolute accuracy.  This is at risk when it is dumped in the Pacific of being coming 
<br/>into our ocean.  Not only that but also into the food chain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are issues regarding trust and that needs to be built up.  There are limits to international 
<br/>law regarding this and concern has been expressed that the discharge might not even get covered 
<br/>under International  Dumping Convention.  Sir, there is also the climate change agenda, the clean 
<br/>energy and nuclear energy has always set those question marks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, regarding the situation with Fiji, I applaud the honourable Members who have expressed 
<br/>their  views.    We  have  to  understand  the  magnitude  of  nuclear  waste  dumping.    It  is  not  normal 
<br/>pollution, it goes into the food chain and Fiji has a very reproductive forest ecosystem  - beaches, 
<br/>mangroves,  et  cetera,  and  more  than  10,000  kilometres  of  coral  reefs  which  support  marine  and 
<br/>coastal diversity and 1,200 fish species, 800 different species of molars and 350 hard coral species.  
<br/>This has played a critical role in subsistence and artisanal fishing to thrive and help our communal 
<br/>communities and also in terms of our cultural practises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, regarding the monetary value, attempts have been made to estimate the monetary value 
<br/>of  the  marine  eco-systems.    However,  this  metric  fails  to  account  for  the  multitude  of  domestic 
<br/>benefits, the support for the Fijian way of life, our fishing communities and maintenance of such 
<br/>subsistence livelihoods. That monetary value has looked at some sectors, for example, shark diving 
<br/>was estimated to contribute US$42.2 million to the Fijian economy.  I am quoting from the report 
<br/>which has been mentioned by the honourable Members, “National Ocean Policy” just to emphasise 
<br/>the point in terms of the impact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  whole  marine  ecosystem,  the  estimated  value  of  Fiji’s  marine  ecosystem 
<br/>services was about $2.4 billion annually and fisheries is estimated to contribute $123 million annually 
<br/>from subsistence farming.  Small inshore commercial fisheries produce a total national value of up 
<br/>to $54 million while commercial offshore fisheries based on albacore tuna produce a total net of $20 
<br/>million per year.  I thought I just share that information for us to appreciate the magnitude of the 
<br/>issue  before  us  and  also  the  very  critical  motion.    I  thank  the  honourable  Members  for  your 
<br/>contribution in our national understanding in unity in terms of our support for this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, can I simply put to you, when debating on issues 
<br/></span><span>such as this, we try and come up with hard core facts rather than quoting these paper clippings et 
<br/>cetera, because this is Parliament and it is just like going to university.  You give your views and 
<br/>your source as well, otherwise it will be just like how we are addressing this now.  It is a very your 
<br/>issue but we really need to rely on hard facts.

<div><span>The Embassy of Japan is somewhere here in Suva and we could easily access that by just 
<br/>tapping into those kind of resources rather than quoting from clippings from this newspaper to that 
<br/>newspaper.  That is what big countries are encountering now because they are being controlled by 
<br/>what  is  being  dished  out  by  the  newspapers  rather  than  the  hard-core  facts  coming  from  the 
<br/>governments.    That  is  all  I  want  to  ask  you  -  please  observe  that  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief and I thank all honourable 
<br/>Members who have contributed and let me assure Government and the mover of the motion that we 
<br/>are in total support of the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  other  options  have  we  got?    I  thank  the  honourable  Koya  for  quoting  the  Treaty  of 
<br/>Raratonga,  that  is  the  guiding  document  for  all  Pacific  Islanders  and  perhaps  that  will  also  leave 
<br/>Government and the honourable Prime Minister in a difficult position as well particularly when it 
<br/>comes to our bilateral relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Article 7 of the </span><span>Treaty of Rarotonga</span><span>, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and mover of the 
<br/>motion, specifically talks about the environmental protection and how we deal with nuclear wastes.  
<br/>I was in Vienna last year on two nuclear related meetings as Minister for Defence.  I have seen with 
<br/>my own two eyes how people suffered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the second generation, they were brought to the meetings to testify about the danger 
<br/>of dealing with this.   They were arm-less and deformed.  Let us be cautious, science has a role to 
<br/>play.  Will we believe the science?  That is another question, but to give assurance to this august 
<br/>Parliament, Article 7 of the </span><span>Treaty of Rarotonga</span><span>, it was open for signing to all Pacific Island countries 
<br/>in 1985 and it came into force meaning that we have ratified in 1986.  It just took that short period 
<br/>for us to ratify because it was so important for our survival.  Our ocean is our life, it is our very 
<br/>existence and it defines us.  This is for the future of every Fijian and every Pacific Islander.  We 
<br/>support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister to make his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to present some closing remarks to 
<br/>the motion before us and before I do, I would just like to thank everyone, the honoured  Members of 
<br/>this august Chamber who have contributed to the debate today.  I was smiling when the honourable 
<br/>Usamate mentioned a question that I first started asking myself when I started hearing about what 
<br/>the  Japanese  were  trying  to  do  in  terms  of  waste  disposal.    The  question  was,  as  the  honourable 
<br/>Usamate put it quite aptly, what will be the answer to our children and grandchildren regarding the 
<br/>attempts by our friends from Japan to dispose waste into our oceans? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been listening quite intently to the debate and a few things are quite clear or obvious 
<br/>as well that we only have one ocean and one chance always to protect our ocean.  When you look at 
<br/>the history of the Pacific, it is almost as if the larger countries have been playing Russian Roulette 
<br/>with us in the Pacific.  Now and again, they developed some testing or conduct some testing in the 
<br/></span><span>ocean that presents a clear and present danger as the honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau had mentioned 
<br/></span><span>in our ocean.

<div><span>        Suspension of Standing Orders  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>923 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Gavoka spoke about the harvesting of great wealth that is in our oceans and 
<br/>the concern that we all  have if that wealth is  threatened or somehow destroyed.  The honourable 
<br/>Members talked eloquently about the size of the Pacific Ocean and its criticality and importance to 
<br/>our lives.  The honourable Usamate has said that it is the essence of our being. I could not help but 
<br/>note that some of the honourable Members too at least had to give their Government some credit in 
<br/>terms of their contribution to climate change and other honourable initiatives on the global stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, just to balance it out, let me just say that the honourable Prime Minister has been 
<br/>instrumental in bringing the region back together and in doing so, allowing us to stand up here today 
<br/>and speak as a region once again with confidence and in many respects, Sir, reclaiming that unique 
<br/>position that Fiji does hold in the Pacific region.  It is clear that our ocean is vulnerable. When I 
<br/>thought about this particular motion, I was hoping that the support would be unanimous or to put it 
<br/>in the words of the honourable Koya, “1000 percent”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Sir, I wish to thank all the contributors to the debate today. I hope that in due 
<br/>course we will continue to push for the preservation of our ocean and protect it as one of the last 
<br/>bastions  of  our  existence  in  the  globe  as  we  know.    With  those  few  words,  I  thank  you  for  this 
<br/>opportunity to provide some closing remarks and I revert the motion to Parliament for a vote, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just for housekeeping, honourable Members, for the purposes of complying  
<br/>with  the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.  
<br/></span></div>
