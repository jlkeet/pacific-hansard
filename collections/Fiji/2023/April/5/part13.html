<div><span>“The persistence of political instability, particular in the wake of </span><span>coups</span><span>, incidence of inter-
<br/>communal violence, erosion of confidence and increase in crime exacerbated the country’s 
<br/>economic problems.  Investors, both local and foreign seek stability and certainty because 
<br/>this reduces the risk of their investment decisions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it talks about the role of Government, role of the private sector and the role 
<br/>of the civil society. It talks about the areas of focus and, of course, marco-economic stability, the 
<br/>development of the resource-based sectors…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There you go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I would urge the honourable Minister,… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He will not come up with anything new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …you had the advantage of learning from us,…

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …from our policies, from our successes and, of course, from our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>failures as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us be transparent about this, but may I suggest to the honourable Minister, this is a good 
<br/>guiding document for this National Economic Summit that you intend to conduct on the 21</span><span>st</span><span> to 22</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/>April. We wish you well, Mr. Speaker. I wish Government well in this process.

<div><span>Tourism Sector Performance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, Members of Parliament and fellow countrymen.  Thank you for the opportunity to 
<br/>share with Members of this Parliament how Fiji’s tourism industry has been performing.  Since taking 
<br/>office, I have spent a fair amount of time with the tourism industry, I have mostly been in the West 
<br/>but I intend to visit everyone across Fiji including the outer maritime islands.  I want to do so to hear 
<br/>their concerns and to pay my respects for the sacrifices over the last few years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  United  Nation  World  Tourism  Organization’s  forward-looking 
<br/>scenarios for 2023 shows that international tourist arrivals could reach 80 percent to 95 percent of 
<br/>pre-pandemic levels this year, depending, of course, on the extent of the economic slowdown, the 
<br/>ongoing  recovery  of  travel  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  the  evolution  of  the  Russian  offensive  in 
<br/>Ukraine among other factors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More than 900 million tourists travelled internationally in 2022, double the number recorded 
<br/>in  2021,  though  still  63  percent  of  pre-pandemic  levels.    Every  global  region  recorded  notable 
<br/>increases  in  international  tourist  numbers.    Asia  and  the  Pacific  reached  only  23  percent  due  to 
<br/>stronger pandemic related restrictions which has eased only in recent months, China being the main 
<br/>case here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Fiji’s performance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite lagging behind as a region, the Fiji tourism 
<br/>industry has been doing well beyond what we expected. This strong performance has put us on the 
<br/>path of recovery.  Next year, we expect visitor arrivals to return to pre-pandemic levels and in 2025, 
<br/>we expect to grow by 3 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  reopening  our  borders  in  December  2021,  Fiji’s  hotel  occupancy  rate  has  soared, 
<br/>consistently tracking above 2019 levels. In 2019, Mr. Speaker, being the benchmark going forward 
<br/>after the pandemic.  Last year, we recovered 71 percent of pre-pandemic visitor numbers.  By value, 
<br/>we reached 73 percent of tourism earnings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Tourism administers Fiji’s International Visitor Survey 
<br/></span><span>(IVS).  The IVS essentially collects data from departing visitors due to  determined key indicators 
<br/></span><span>such as tourism spend and travel trends. This is quite widely used by shareholders such as the Fiji 
<br/>Bureau of Statistics and the tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Data from April to December 2022 showed an estimated $1.67 billion in tourism earnings.  If 
<br/>you take into account the airfare component, we are looking at approximately $2 billion in earnings 
<br/>already.  Total per person per trip was $3,572, an increase of 6 percent from 2019’s ($3,379) which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>885 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>means  every  trip  the  visitors  make,  they  spend  more.    And  per  night  earnings  were  recorded  at 
<br/>$376.40, an increase of 7 percent from 2019 of $353. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Nadi to Coral Coast corridor accounted for just over 60 percent with the North accounting 
<br/>for 4 percent.  Vanua Levu and the surrounds which promises high yield is a region we are looking 
<br/>at specifically with the World Bank to grow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sr,  we  recently  launched  the  “Fiji  where  happiness  comes  naturally”  brand. 
<br/>While we know there is great competition ahead, I am happy to share that we had close to 50 percent 
<br/>repeat visitors showing good brand loyalty.  Overall, visitor satisfaction too increased to 93 percent, 
<br/>meaning people enjoy coming back to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On flights, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are seeing increase capacity into Fiji through our national 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carrier; Fiji Airways who are recording bookings exceeding 2019 … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span> Fiji Airways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  …  growing  at  an  average  7  percent  every  week.    The  forecasted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operating capacity in each quarter next year is above 2019 with a network growth of 23 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Sunday this week, we welcomed back twice weekly flights between Nadi 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Hong Kong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you Fiji Airways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- The first flight was operating at 90 percent, or in the language of 
<br/>airlines, “that there is a fully booked flight” with forward bookings for 12 months recorded at 16,193 
<br/>(both ways). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you Fiji Airways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Besides resuming direct service to Hong Kong, we welcomed back 
<br/>our direct flight from Narita, Japan.  This will also be a twice weekly flight.  Like the Hong Kong 
<br/>flight,  this  is  a  huge  win  for  tourism,  trade,  business  and  investment.    The  Japanese  market,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, contributed close to $40 million in earnings in 2019, so they are an important market 
<br/>for us, and soon, we will also be flying to South Korea.  Bookings from Asia are growing with Hong 
<br/>Kong already ahead of expectation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the call to fly directly into mainland China and that is also in 
<br/>the books; choice between Beijing and Shanghai.  So, while we are seeing exceptional numbers from 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand and United States of America, we can soon expect the gradual return of the 
<br/>Asian market.  While we have natural friends such as Australia and New Zealand, we have a vested 
<br/>interest in diversifying our market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, soon we will be adding two new A350-900 aircrafts, adding 60 more extra 
<br/></span><span>seats for each aircraft and 16 extra tonnes of cargo by mid-2023.  That means, potentially new routes 
<br/></span><span>over the next two or three years including in Asia. We are also looking at Seattle, Dallas or Houston 
<br/>or Chicago.  It is quite impressive.  We are going places we never thought we would, potentially 
<br/>connecting all the way to Chicago on the East Coast. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been supported by partners such as Fiji Airways, Tourism Fiji, Fiji 
<br/>Hotel and Tourism Association, Society of Fiji Travel Associates and the entire industry working 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>behind the scenes to position Fiji as a desired destination.  But there have been challenges, some like 
<br/>labour are more profound than others then there are greater issues such as price competitiveness and 
<br/>impacts of climate change.  All these require stronger than ever partnership between the Government 
<br/>and the private sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have shared in this Parliament, we will use every avenue - the National 
<br/>Economic Summit, the National Sustainable Tourism Framework Consultation, the National Budget 
<br/>to  ensure  we  create the  right environment  for tourism  to  flourish.   The  update  I have shared, the 
<br/>number  of  recovery  means  more  jobs.    It  means  more  employment,  demand  for  food  produce, 
<br/>opportunities to invest, opportunities to build and create. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this year’s ANZ Fiji Excellence in Tourism Award, I shared with the 
<br/>industry that their success is our success.  When the tourism industry thrives, so does the economy 
<br/>and related sectors and when the economy prospers, so do the lives of our people in communities.  
<br/>We build roads that connect people and markets, we invest in education and health care, take water 
<br/>and electricity to the most remote communities - that is the bottom line. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I would like to thank everyone who has in one way or the other contributed to 
<br/>where we are today in tourism.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you again for this opportunity to deliver 
<br/>my Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for their response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I want to take just maybe a minute to reflect on what has 
<br/>been told to us and to thank the honourable Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>having sat in that chair for quite a substantial amount of time, I do understand how it works, but I am 
<br/>so grateful that after eight years, the honourable Minister has now seen the light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I see a glint in his smile and I am happy to say that it took us eight years, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but now you understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, all that he has said completely acceptance and I think, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we need to give credit to where credit is due. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We recovered post COVID-19 because of the strong policies that were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>put in place by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You cannot deny that, Mr. Speaker,  We ensured that the country would 
<br/>be ready to welcome back our tourists with strong decisions that were made during that post COVID-
<br/>19 period and we owe a great deal of gratitude, not just to those who worked within the ministries, 
<br/>we owe a great deal of gratitude to the private sector because of the participation they had throughout 
<br/>the  period  of  COVID-19.    Without  them,  we  also  would  not  have  been  in  a  state  of  readiness  to 
<br/>welcome back our tourists.  At every step of the way, we had consultations with them and we owe

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them a debt of gratitude because Fiji is now back in that particular space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Might I remind the honourable Minister also, we, because of our strong policies became the 
<br/>admiration of quite a few countries around the world and we got asked at every international forum; 
<br/>how did you guys do it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not about always recovery, this is the greatest international crisis; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>give credit where credit is due, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, all these talk about bipartisanship, we want to be nice to you and dialogue, it comes 
<br/>out, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The love to all comes out as soon as they get told, “please just acknowledge 
<br/>what the FijiFirst government had done.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- True colours come out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  We  had  actually  hit  the  worst  global  economic  crisis  in  history,  but 
<br/>FijiFirst stepped up to deal with it.  It is so nice to hear also that the honourable Minister continuously 
<br/>for eight years bashed Fiji Airways… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  …he  bashed  up  for  buying  airbus.    Today  he  can  stand  there  and 
<br/>pontificate  about  two  new  A350s  that  we  are  buying  -  airbus!  What  happened  to  Boeing,  what 
<br/>happened to Qantas, honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- His seen the light.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am so happy the honourable Minister has seen the light … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… and I pray that you continue to see the light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one more, just the last one, yesterday he also gave statements with respect to 
<br/>sporting activities, et cetera that actually happened.  I was sitting here waiting and listening to the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition  when he mentioned something  about  golf.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister actually grimaced; why?  Because he was there standing pontificating about sporting events 
<br/>and how much money it was going to bring in terms of SPARTAN.  Now he realised that.  Again, 
<br/>honourable Minister, thank you for seeing the light.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, I commend him on what he has actually said, may you continue to see 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the light, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have a very good memory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will resume when the bell is sounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.30 a.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.08 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digital Television Initiative (Walesi) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  before  you  today  to  make  a 
<br/>Ministerial  Statement  on  the  Digital  Television  Initiative  commonly  known  as  </span><span>Walesi  –  </span><span>Fiji’s 
<br/>National  Digital  Platform.  The  story  of  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  is  a  classic  example  of  government  overreach, 
<br/>excessive control, wastage, mismanagement and it does not stop there, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There is 
<br/>potential abuse of office and even possibly misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We continue to hear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other side talk 
<br/>about legacy. They all talk about legacy, very proudly.  Ihope today that the learned Members on the 
<br/>other side will embrace the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> legacy with the same vigor and gusto.  I would like to report to 
<br/>Parliament  that  the  total  amount  spent  on  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  so  far  as  at  the  10</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2023  (we  are  still 
<br/>discovering some other payments) is $125,571,388.87. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Allow me, Sir, to return to this a bit later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-Whilst  the  amounts  are  staggering,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>actions of the previous government has left me no other choice but to use the words of the honourable 
<br/>Usamate -flabbergasted, absolutely flabbergasted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To explain what happened to </span><span>Walesi,</span><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, or what </span><span>Walesi</span><span> is, it is probably best 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to listen to a description that was offered by celebrated lawyer, Mr. Richard Naidu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Speak about someone else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He said in his  </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> article on 18</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with some additions from me and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Imagine you own a bus.  You’ve bought your  own buses.  You’ve got bus route 
<br/>licenses.  Your business and your buses are running well.  You have competition with other 
<br/>bus companies as is the case but that is okay because that is business.  All of a sudden, the 
<br/></span><span>government wakes up one day, turns up on our routes with their own shinny buses and no 
<br/></span><span>one is quite sure, what is government doing?  But the government seems to be saying to all 
<br/>the  bus  operators,  our  buses  are  for  all  the  people  of  Fiji.    You  need  to  start  using  the 
<br/>government buses.  You have no choice because otherwise you might lose your license, if 
<br/>you do not agree.  The poor bus operators then asked, what about our buses?  The answer 
<br/>from the government is, ‘that is not our problem.’”
