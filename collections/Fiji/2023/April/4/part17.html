<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number? What point of Order is that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Relevance, he is leaving the topic alone and he is meandering, and it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is half-past six, please stay on the topic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am actually amazed at the hypocrisy that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comes from honourable Jone Usamate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You are always amazed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He should learn Mr. Speaker, Sir, to understand some of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pain that you need to go through when you sit in Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He will grow into a better Opposition Member if he is able to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>take a little bit of pain…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He has seen the light 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think he has seen the light, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  cannot  use  the  word  “hypocrite”  in  this  Parliament,  but  I  am  saying  that  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Usamate…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable J. Usamate interjects)

<div><span>to spend some time in the Opposition.

<div><span>    Review Report – OAG 2021 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I just  wanted to  point out  that the Government  acknowledges as part  of 
<br/>recommendation 1 the need to obtain a quality draft financial statement on a timely basis as this area 
<br/>needs improvement.  At the Ministry of Finance, we already had a good meeting with the Acting 
<br/>Auditor-General,  their  staff.    We  are  looking  at  the  review  of  the  Audit  Act,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  
<br/>Learning  from  the  experience  of  what  we  heard,  what  we  know,  how  the  Auditor-General  was 
<br/>attacked.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to look at the Audit Act and ensure that the Audit Act provides safeguards, gives 
<br/>more  teeth  to  the  Auditor-General’s  office  not  only  in  terms  of  resources  so  that  they  can  work 
<br/>effectively  to  hold  ministries  and  departments  accountable.    We  are  working  with  the  OAG, 
<br/>ministries, departments, agencies and we feel that there is a lot more that can be done around that 
<br/>area.  I know that the honourable Minister for Housing gave a very good account of what is happening 
<br/>within Municipal Councils, an area that we were concerned about, the training plan agreed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was this concern that they were not having this exit plans, these are 
<br/>normal  audit  processes  that  the  OAG  conducts  and  as  a  government,  we  must  stay  away  from 
<br/>dictating to independent offices even if we feel that there are problems.  There are ways in which 
<br/>those  offices  may  not  do  the  work.    So,  the  OAG  must  be  left  as  an  independent  institution,  the 
<br/>Parliament’s job is to make sure that we provide the appropriate resources, provide the appropriate 
<br/>legislative framework so that they can work effectively.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are determined to 
<br/>ensure that the OAG’s office remains an independent office, well-resourced and one that can work 
<br/>with all government departments, entities and bodies and make sure that we have timely, properly 
<br/>audited reports presented to Parliament so the Parliament can scrutinize that and the public can know 
<br/>what is happening to their dollars and cents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accounts Committee to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  all  those  Members  who 
<br/>contributed to the debate and hope that the OAG will work with relevant government ministries and 
<br/>departments who are in delay in the submission of their financial statements for audit, particularly 
<br/>the provincial councils and the municipal councils plus carry out proper exit meetings with all the 
<br/>stakeholders to improve reporting and audit results for the stakeholders. The only additional comment 
<br/>I wish to make is that the OAG is to be independent all the time as it is a constitutional office and to 
<br/>maintain institutional integrity.  With those final comments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the 
<br/>opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we really get into asking our Questions,  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would like to adjourn Parliament now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you could have your dinner in the Big Committee Room and we will 
<br/>resume, going  straight into  the Question,s but  I  would like to  limit  the number of supplementary 
<br/>questions to three only.  The Parliament is adjourned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 6.38 p.m.
