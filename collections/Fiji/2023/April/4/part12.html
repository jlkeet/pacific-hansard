<div><span>Girmit Day Celebrations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my Ministerial Statement on 
<br/>the  Girmit  Day  commemoration  and  celebrations.    On  29</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  2022  during  the  inaugural 
<br/>address to the nation, the honourable Prime Minister made a pledge and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I made a pledge to legislate for a Girmit Day public holiday to honour the settlers 
<br/>from  India  who  began  arriving  here  from  1879.    They  were  starting  a  new  life  in  an 
<br/>unknown  land  and  stayed  to  become  an  integral  part  of  our  country.    I  reconfirm  my 
<br/>promise to inaugurate that new national holiday in 2023.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government has declared and gazetted 15</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023 as the 
<br/>day to mark the occasion for Girmit Day as a national holiday.  In the history of Fiji, this is significant 
<br/>and also a significant as 11</span><span>th</span><span> May of each year marks the </span><span>Syria</span><span> shipwreck and the associated selfless 
<br/>efforts  by  our  indigenous  Fijian  people  in  rescuing  indentured  labourers  from  the  sinking  ship, 
<br/>thereby marking the first major historical event, creating bonds between our indigenous people and 
<br/>the indentured labourers.  This was, Mr. Speaker, on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1884.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The heroism of the indigenous people, the original inhabitants of the land was exemplary.    It 
<br/>deserves recognition because it was an act of valour. They demonstrated tremendous courage and put 
<br/>their own lives in great danger by trying to rescue as many as endangered labourers as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did not know them. They had not seen them at all before, let alone 
<br/>even talk to them.   However, this  was  a valiant  act  of  humanity, and this humanity  has been the 
<br/>cornerstone of peaceful, mutual co-existence of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Indo-Fijian communities, living side 
<br/>by side for the last 144 years since the beginning of Indenture with the arrival of the </span><span>Leonidas</span><span> on 14</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>May,  1879.    Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  mutual  peaceful  co-existence  has  been  shattered  a  few 
<br/>times, but it has not dented this bond.  It was, is and will be unbreakable and it deserves our accolades. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, more than 60,000 Indentured Labourers were brought to Fiji from India to work 
<br/>in the sugarcane plantations between 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1879 and 11</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2016.  While some returned 
<br/>to India, a vast majority chose to stay back and call Fiji their home, working and contributing to the 
<br/>Fiji economy and overall growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the term “girmit” as we all know is coined from the word “agreement” – 
<br/></span><span>the binding document between the  workers and the British. They were  collectively  referred to  as 
<br/></span><span>“</span><span>Girmitiya</span><span>”.  For Fiji, the significance of the Girmit Day is monumental.  It is with the sole objective 
<br/>of making “One Fiji” a reality – a nation genuinely united in harmony – true nationhood of vision, 
<br/>hopes aspirations and a land of vast opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indentured Labourers and their descendants over the last 100 years have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>significantly contributed to the economic, social and political development and advancement of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>797 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is well recognised. They have lived peacefully and harmoniously, side by side with other races.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overwhelmingly,  Sir,  this  peaceful  co-existence  and  cooperation,  the  willingness  of  our 
<br/>landowners to share their resources and land and the freedom for the descendants of our Indentured 
<br/>Labourers  to  put  in  practice  their  language,  culture,  tradition  -  an  integral  part  of  the  Indian 
<br/>civilisation, together with the blood, sweat, toil, tears and lives sacrificed by our forefathers, as well 
<br/>as the immense contributions of other races has made Fiji what it has been for decades – the hub of 
<br/>the South Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, honourable Justice Jai Ram Reddy, whose speech as a grandson of an Indentured 
<br/>Labourer and as the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the National Federation Party to the 
<br/>Great Council of Chiefs on 6</span><span>th</span><span> June, 1997 will go down as a defining moment in Fiji’s history rightly 
<br/>said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Indians of Fiji, brought to these shores as labourers, did not come to conquer 
<br/>or colonise. Our ancestors came to this land in search of a better life, in search of a future 
<br/>they dreamed of for their children and their children’s children.  Though they travelled to 
<br/>these islands long after your ancestors, surely the dreams and hopes of those who landed 
<br/>from  the  </span><span>Leonidas</span><span>  were  not  that  different  from  those  who  came  ashore  after  the  epic 
<br/>earlier voyage from the West.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  after  144  years,  the  time  is  right,  not  only  for  the  celebration  and 
<br/>commemoration of our rich history in this multicultural society, but for a reflection of the freedoms 
<br/>gained  and  lost  on  the  journey.    Our  forefathers  operated  on  the  basis  of  freedom,  human  rights, 
<br/>dignity and a virtuous living – the values that over a period of time guided our fight against the vices 
<br/>of the indentured system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, many seem to have forgotten and some would have us forget, those hard 
<br/>fought for virtues and principles in support of those who have taken our freedoms in the past, but we 
<br/>have the perfect opportunity to put this right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Cabinet meeting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 14</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023 and as announced by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, Cabinet approved the Girmit Day commemoration and celebrations to 
<br/>be  held  on  15</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  2023  including  the  establishment  of  a  National  Committee,  chaired  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development  and  Statistics.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  Girmit  Day  celebrations,  a  two-day 
<br/>International Girmit Conference will be held on 12</span><span>th</span><span> and 13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023. An amount of $500,000 
<br/>has been approved for the Girmit Day celebrations including a two-day conference. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government, Mr. Speaker, has also  approved a 200 percent tax deduction for entities 
<br/>which provides cash donations in an account approved by Government to that will be used to fund 
<br/>activities related to the Girmit</span><span> </span><span>Day (including conference, sports, et cetera).  The same amount, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  has  also  been  allocated  to  celebrate  and  commemorate  Ratu  Sir  Lala  Sukuna  Day.  
<br/>Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade will also reach out to relevant donor 
<br/>agencies to solicit their support for this national initiative through direct financial contributions as 
<br/></span><span>well as support in kind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  stated,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  National  Committee  on  Girmit  Day  has  been  established  to 
<br/>organise  and  oversee  all  official  Government  funded  activities  and  events  to  mark  the  intent  and 
<br/>purpose of Girmit Day on an annual basis.  The other members of the Committee include the:

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>799 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Recognition of the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Rewa for adopting descendants of </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> including a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>visit to Navilaca with traditional ceremonies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Recognition and appreciation of Indo cultural groups for keeping culture alive. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Recognition of different eras of development during and post </span><span>Girmit</span><span> era. 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Acknowledgment  of  Methodist/Anglican  Church  for  promotion  of  Indian  girls’ 
<br/>education during a church service on Sunday at Dilkusha which was the first boarding 
<br/>for Indian girls at that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Girmit Day celebrations will be a time for us to understand the history and 
<br/>context of how Indentured Labourers from India came to Fiji. The event will commemorate the many 
<br/>sacrifices and contributions our ancestors made to the country in terms of shaping the early economic 
<br/>landscape of our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Girmit  history  is  an  integral  part  of  Fiji's  and  Pacific  history  and  a  day  to  mark  this  day 
<br/>acknowledges the significant social, cultural, economic and political contribution the </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> and 
<br/>their descendants have made to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the importance of making this event  a wonderful memory  as  this is  the first 
<br/>national-based celebration on </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> after the 100</span><span>th</span><span> year celebration in 1979, is of historical and 
<br/>will  be  remembered  forever.  To  mark  this  momentous  occasion,  we  must  reiterate  our  need,  as 
<br/>diverse communities of a great nation, to work together for our collective free and secure future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  will  be  a  celebration  as  well  as  a  commemoration  of  that  single 
<br/>momentous event that forever changed the destiny and the landscape of Fijian society. While the 
<br/>atrocities,  trials  and  tribulations  of  the  Indenture  System  in  Fiji  have  been  well  documented,  the 
<br/>descendants  of  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas  </span><span>have  moved  on.  This  is  evident  in  the  way  the  third  and  fourth 
<br/>generation  Indo-Fijians  have integrated themselves into Fiji's  landscape.    As such, they have tied 
<br/>their own personal circumstances to the destiny of this country.  This Coalition Government under 
<br/>the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister recognises this aspect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The celebration, Mr. Speaker, will be a paradigm shift; that is, we are moving away from the 
<br/>rhetoric of the past.  The Coalition Government is inculcating a new culture of dialogue, unity and 
<br/>cooperation with political leaders as well as leaders of other ethnic groups to forge a new approach 
<br/>to politics in this country.   This culture of dialogue will incorporate diverse opinions from a broad 
<br/>spectrum of the ethnic groups that make up this nation. As such, celebrations like this, highlighting 
<br/>a  specific  group  of  people  in  all  their  diversity  must  be  the  cornerstones  of  processes  of  nation 
<br/>building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is why, Mr. Speaker, this Government (led by the honourable Prime Minister Sitiveni 
<br/>Rabuka) believes Girmit Day is important to remember and reflect on the struggles and sacrifices of 
<br/>our forefathers for equality, dignity and justice for all our people. It will be a celebration where the 
<br/>nation comes to grips with the diversity that is its essence.  A diversity that demands mutual respect 
<br/>on the basis of lasting social, economic and political advancement of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately I do not have the same privilege in terms 
<br/></span><span>of time like the honourable Minister of Finance.  I rise to respond to the statement by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Deputy Prime Minister on Girmit Public Holiday and its celebrations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I would like to congratulate all </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> descendants and all Fijians to recognise 
<br/>this  important  day  in  Fijian  history.    Sir,  14</span><span>th</span><span>  May  each  year  marks  the  arrival  day  of  the  first 
<br/></span><span>Girmityas</span><span> to Fiji from British India who arrived off Levuka Harbour on the evening of that day in 
<br/>1879 on the </span><span>Leonidas.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first large scale celebration of Girmit</span><span> </span><span>was on its centennial to mark its 
<br/>100</span><span>th</span><span> year on 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1979.  For those who may remember, the years of the newly independent Fiji 
<br/>between  1970  and  1977  was  marked  by  rising  racial  tensions  and  divisions.    The  bipartisan 
<br/>celebration of the Girmit Centennial in 1979 provided an opportunity for the whole of Fiji to get 
<br/>behind the occasion, not like the approach by this Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also provides the first national occasion for Fiji and all Fijians to learn 
<br/>about this often dark and inhumane part of our history.  That would lay down the foundations of the 
<br/>modern Fijian society and economy as we now know it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  note  the  Public  Holiday,  but  there  is  no  evidence  of  inclusive 
<br/>organisation  of  the  celebration.    In  fact,  no  one  actually  knows  until  these  statements  on  who  is 
<br/>organising the celebration, what level of public consultation and inclusion is involved and why public 
<br/>funds will be spent in the way it is.  This seems more of the Coalition Government’s approach of 
<br/>jobs for the girls and the boys who have come from the three parties and not a case of best people for 
<br/>the best job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Government looks to provide a Girmit public holiday, what is it doing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the attack which is in contrast to the celebration of Girmit</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER- No, you carry on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  put  it  on  record  that  it  was  the  FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government that brought back the national celebrations of Girmit after a long break since 1979.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Control your leader.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this period, celebrations were organised at the local level or through the local Girmit 
<br/>Interest Groups, there was no government support under the SVT government in the 1990s and the 
<br/>government that followed until 2006. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government organised Fiji wide celebrations including one of 
<br/>the largest ever public events on 11</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2016. It is on record, Sir.  This national and inclusive 
<br/>event marked 100 years on the arrival of the last shipload of the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> from the British India to 
<br/>Fiji on board the </span><span>Sutlej V</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government Girmit celebrations continued each year until 2019 
<br/>and was revived after COVID-19 in 2022.  It was inclusive. It was not Suva centred, in fact, we took 
<br/>it to all towns, cities and communities around Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are an absolute disgrace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We all know it is a one-man party so it is obvious you are going to speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Speak on the topic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Control your one-man guy there.

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- The FijiFirst Government invited all religious groups, social groupings 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and ensured that all </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> descendants were celebrated in the public events.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- You will be invited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Regardless of official programme outlined, we will continue to honour 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and remember the contribution of all </span><span>Girmityas</span><span> in building modern Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  The  FijiFirst  Party  will  continue  to  recognise  and  honour  them  in  an 
<br/>inclusive manner, recognising their diverse backgrounds and to ensure , Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we 
<br/>never  forget  their  unity  and  commitment  to  Fiji  in  their  contribution  in  providing  Fiji  with  its 
<br/>economic platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also note, and we must never forget these contributions which were made 
<br/>by the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> despite the abuse, inhumane treatment and lack of resources of the law of the basic 
<br/>essential humanity.  It is a sad thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a bipartisan level, we welcome the public holiday and events to mark Girmit Day but note 
<br/>with  concern that  once  again  the Coalition Government is  not  walking the talk when it comes to 
<br/>inclusive and consultative approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  Parliament  and  wish  all  Fijians  a  Happy  Girmit  Day  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upcoming event and I would also like to say to the Coalition Government, happy 100 days.

<div><span>Outcomes of 5</span><span>th</span><span> United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  fellow  countrymen;  I  rise  to 
<br/>provide an update on the key outcomes of the 5</span><span>th</span><span> United Nations Conference on the Least Developed 
<br/>Countries (UNLDC-V) that was held in Doha, Qatar, from 5</span><span>th</span><span> to 9</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 and which I had 
<br/></span><span>represented the Fiji Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just digress a bit, Mr. Speaker, and I am sure the people of Fiji are asking this question, 
<br/>who is calling the kettle black?  We are hearing a lot of these tirades from FijiFirst and it is a repeat 
<br/>and they are just pointing at themselves on the way they conduct the affairs of government over the 
<br/>last eight to sixteen years.  But we are bringing enlightenment to the country and things are changing 
<br/>and there is a spring in the step of everyone in this country, celebrating the change that they have

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been waiting for, for quite some time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while Fiji is a developing country, our commitment and participation at the 
<br/>Conference solidifies our commitment to our Pacific Island neighbours and the global community in 
<br/>progressing graduation of States out of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) status.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, globally, there are currently 46 LDCs which are home to about 1.1 billion 
<br/>people and these States host about 40 of the world’s poor with many in conflict countries or emerging 
<br/>from one.  These countries account for 13 percent of the world population but contribute about 1.3 
<br/>percent of GDP and less than one percent of global trade and Foreign Direct Investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 46 LDCs, 33 are in Africa, 12 in Asia and the Pacific, and one in 
<br/>the Caribbean region.  For the Pacific, Solomon Islands is due to graduate, together with Kiribati and 
<br/>Tuvalu. The graduation is in the pipeline and will be happening over the coming years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a thought that I planted with the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations 
<br/>and Chairperson of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, Ms. Amina J. Mohammed, 
<br/>is that the small island nations of the Pacific are big Ocean States, whose ocean resources are feeding 
<br/>billions all over the world, especially in the Northern part of the Pacific. They should not be poor, if 
<br/>their resources are fetching prices that are fair, and I have urged Madam Deputy Secretary-General 
<br/>that the UN should take this up and create dialogue at the appropriate level to ensure the resources 
<br/>of the island nations are properly rewarded to enable them to grow their economy and grow wealth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the UNLDC Conference first started in 1971 and is held every 10 years. For this 
<br/>year, lately it was held in two parts - the first was in New York on 17</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 and the second 
<br/>part in Doha from 5</span><span>th</span><span> to 9</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 under the theme, ‘From Potential to Prosperity’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first part of the UNLDC-V resulted in the adoption of the Doha Programme of Action 
<br/>which outlines a 10-year plan to tap into the potential of the LDCs by implementing renewed and 
<br/>strengthened commitments between the LDCs and their development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was quite amazed, Mr. Speaker, on the first day, that majority of the leaders from Europe 
<br/>were there in Doha.  This is the commitment that they have to uplift the lesser developed countries. 
<br/>But, Mr. Speaker, despite some positive results, progress is still falling short of the goals and targets, 
<br/>hence the support that we saw in Doha from the world leaders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, LDCs like Fiji depend on global commitments, especially from developed 
<br/>countries. For the benefit of our people, we are not an LDC - Fiji was never in that category.  We 
<br/>have always been a developed country, and that is something that we should celebrate as our leaders 
<br/>from the beginning had set us on a platform that has helped grow Fiji to what it is today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  partnerships  if  we  want  to  meaningful  progress  towards  the  2030  SDG  Agenda.  
<br/>During the UNLDC-V, countries and key partners announced several commitments to bring LDCs 
<br/>back  on  the  pathway  to  achieving  the  SDGs  and  this  is  welcomed.    These  commitments  include 
<br/>addressing immediate challenges such as climate change and progressing towards sustainable and 
<br/></span><span>irreversible</span><span> </span><span>graduation, meaning we do not want to go back, we need to move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the key commitments made at the UNLDC-V include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A financial package to support the implementation of the Doha Programme of Action; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>A pledge by Germany to finance LDCs; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial commitment from Canada to deliver vitamin supplements in 15 LDCs;

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Tourism Organisation (UNWTO); 
<br/>Pledge of US$50,000 by Kazakhstan to continue supporting the most vulnerable countries; 
<br/>and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Announcement of a US$800 million loan package by Saudi Arabia for the LDCs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are a developing country, there is a lot we can learn.  I would like 
<br/>to share in this august Parliament and with the people of Fiji a few policy recommendations stemming 
<br/>from our participation at the UNLDC-V. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  we  need  the  right  mix  of  policies  for  an  enabling  environment  that  supports 
<br/>sustainable growth and development.  We have four main enablers: technology, access to finance, 
<br/>international trade and capacity and human capital.  We cannot focus solely on finance, what we need 
<br/>is a balanced approach, structural reforms and multi-sectoral cohesion which are key to economic 
<br/>resilience.  We need to look at reforms more holistically and inclusively and it must be long-term, 
<br/>not reforms that take us through a year or five as we have been doing, but reforms that take us into 
<br/>the next decade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  also  needs  to  focus  on  high-yielding  productive  sectors  such  as 
<br/>manufacturing,  circular  tourism,  primary  industries  that  can  enhance  growth,  add  value  and 
<br/>ultimately, create meaningful jobs for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  National  Debt  Restructure  under  Systematic  Reforms  to  Global  Financial 
<br/>Architecture. We were quite saddened when we learnt that some of the LDCs, 20 percent of their 
<br/>government revenue goes towards debt financing to pay off their debts.  These are very vulnerable 
<br/>countries, and it was something that really commended the dialogue in Doha.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Doha Programme of Action, there are calls for a systematic reform of the global 
<br/>financial architecture, addressing both the lack of adequate access to development finance and the 
<br/>challenges posed by precarious debt sustainability by LDCs, whose debt levels have soared due to 
<br/>COVID-19 and other external shocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are no different in Fiji with our debt levels.  If we remain in this situation in the next few 
<br/>years, we risk losing the progress we have made.  Reform of global financial architecture provides 
<br/>an opportunity for Fiji to negotiate and manage debt repayments while at the same time, restructure 
<br/>its economy to raise government revenues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  optimism  from  the  private  sector  around  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s policies for investment.  Last week, we held the first Tourism Investment Summit.  As 
<br/>I have shared in Parliament, we need more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), especially in hotel beds 
<br/>and  infrastructure.    We  need  to  incentivise  additional  financing  and  investments,  strengthen 
<br/></span><span>regulatory and policy environments, and develop pipelines of investable projects.  For Fiji, practical 
<br/></span><span>areas can be better categorisation of investments and further streamlining of processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can better use trade as a true engine for growth.  The United 
<br/>Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has been providing technical support 
<br/>and  assistance  to  LDCs  in  reviewing  their  trade  policies,  structural  economic  transformation, 
<br/>increasing productive capacity and building resilience.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  UNCTAD  has  already  been  supporting  us  in  this  area,  so  we  need  to  take  full 
<br/>advantage of this.  Last week, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-
<br/>operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications shared that trade facilitation is 
<br/>a top priority in Fiji’s development agenda.  Even UNCTAD could assist Fiji in reviewing more of 
<br/>our trade policies.  Bilateral partners such as the United Arab Emirates, Gulf Cooperation Council 
<br/>have been proposing bilateral trade agreements to allow Fiji products to enter their markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at one of our most immediate and long-term priorities, we need to 
<br/>invest more in our people to increase productivity.  The brain-drain syndrome has been a constant 
<br/>challenge for developing States, including Fiji.  We need to be more serious about incentivizing our 
<br/>youth population that make 70 percent of Fiji’s population.   Sir, we need to look beyond ad-hoc 
<br/>trainings or pockets of funding.  We need more programmes with greater focus on inspiring creativity 
<br/>and innovation for our young from very early stages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we often overlook the value and opportunities of the Fiji diaspora overseas.  
<br/>They  already  play  a  huge  role  in  remittance  contribution,  and  we  should  encourage  investments 
<br/>through more tailor-made incentives.  As we speak, Sir, there are a number of big  projects  in  Fiji 
<br/>today - one in Suva, where developers are not even selling to non-Fijians in terms of those living 
<br/>overseas nor are they promoting developments, the lots, to them but to the Fiji diaspora overseas, and 
<br/>they are being taken up.  We will be seeing a lot of these happening, Sir, and it is from our own 
<br/>people living overseas who want to invest back in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I want to reiterate that while Fiji is a developing country, it 
<br/>is important that we continue to show support and solidarity with LDCs, especially our neighbours 
<br/>here in the Pacific.  We know first-hand the disparities in the global economy, so we need to know 
<br/>what we can to increase our engagement with LDCs to correct severe economic imbalance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kiribati’s return to the Forum is a great example of this.  The Deputy Secretary-General of 
<br/>the United Nations, Amina J.  Mohammed, had commented on this, that the world should follow the 
<br/>peaceful manner, the unity on which we relate to each other in the Pacific, instead of the turmoil we 
<br/>see in most regions of the world.  Incidentally, she is coming down here around June, so we will see 
<br/>big things happening in terms of our relationship with the United Nations.  For our part, the remaining 
<br/>years  need  to  usher  in  new  stronger  partnerships,  and  we  need  to  synergise  our  multilateral 
<br/>commitments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  I  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition to make his reply, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a bit of a slight change in our housekeeping this morning.  We are hoping that the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister would be present for our photo shoot, but it seems that he is busy, so we 
<br/>are hoping that he will be here during lunch break so we can then have a photo shoot.   Parliament is 
<br/>now adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.08 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation for his statement on the outcomes of the 
<br/>5th United Nations Conference on the Least Development Countries or LDCs, as it is commonly 
<br/>known.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first question that I had in mind when I saw the Ministerial Statement 
<br/>information this morning is, what on earth are we doing? Why are we attending this conference?  
<br/>Despite the justification, despite the learnings that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has stated 
<br/>and perhaps some of the side meetings or bilaterals that they had, a key question that we have is, why 
<br/>is Fiji attending a meeting that concerns LDCs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not  that  we  are  not  taking  responsibility  on  our  international 
<br/>commitments and, of course, it is not that we are not showing international solidarity on issues as 
<br/>such, we are a responsible global citizen punching above our own weight when it comes to issues, 
<br/>not only of national or regional, but global importance and significance as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Is  it  the  right  choice  made  by  Government  and  particularly 
<br/>involving a Deputy Prime Minister, Sir?  For me, it would have been more acceptable if it was an 
<br/>Alliance of the Small Islands States (AOSIS).    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  would  recall,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  were  in  Bahrain,  the  AOSIS  identified 
<br/>themselves with Fiji.  Seychelles came to see us, the Bahamas came to see us, Mauritius came to see 
<br/>us,  and  the  list  goes  on  and  they  are  looking  forward  to  the  next  conference  in  the  Democratic 
<br/>Republic of Congo because that is where they identify themselves with us because in the geopolitics, 
<br/>we are part of a region, we are part of an alliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS), their link into the global forum is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>AOSIS.  It is our link to the G77 China which is the biggest bloc within the United Nations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It is not that we care less about the LDCs, no, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but it is about prioritising.  We have to have the right priorities as a Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  I  am  concerned  about  the  visits  that  honourable  Ministers  are 
<br/>making, of course, they need to have these visits, but what is the benefit that it brings to our country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- What tangible benefits is this bringing to our country?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry was in New Zealand a 
<br/>few weeks back to mee the diaspora.  Is that his responsibility as the Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs 
<br/>and Sugar Industry?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Let me again tell the honourable 
<br/>Members across the floor that the 100 days is over and according to your  Leader, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, no more excuses from the 100 days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  So,  no  more  excuses,  please,  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Infrastructure and Public Works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial visits are good, but it is the benefit - taxpayer’s money.  It is unfortunate that the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance is not here because he has been blaming us on wastage, wastage, 
<br/>wastage.  But is this not wastage?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to our international commitments and showing solidarity as 
<br/>I have stated earlier, we have been championing issues that is not only relevant to the LDCs or Least 
<br/>Developed States but almost every global citizen.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, COP23, we were the first Small 
<br/>Island Developing State to be the President of COP23. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We all know how climate is related to oceans, we again were the

<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is the tangible benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is what you need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We do not go to conferences just to be an audience, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  I  did  not  hear  from  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  on 
<br/>whether he delivered a statement --+on behalf of Fiji or the region. Is the Pacific Islands Forum there, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the region? Was he just there as an audience?  The contributors are there, 
<br/>he mentioned about the European Union, these are the countries that contribute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Wastage, wastage, wastage, no more excuses.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the honourable Minister of Finance is walking in, I am glad that he walked in at the 
<br/>right time.  Let us stop these Ministerial visits that do not bring any benefit to the taxpayers and to 
<br/>the people of this country. Again, I wish you a happy 100 days but there is nothing to celebrate.

<div><span>Commission on the Status of Women 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  I  rise  this 
<br/>morning to share on the very first participation that I had since taking up the office after the 2022 
<br/>Elections at the 67</span><span>th</span><span> Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women convened 
<br/>at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is a functional commission of 
<br/>the  economic  and  social  council  and  is  the  principle  global  inter-governmental  body  dedicated 
<br/>exclusively to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.  The CSW as it is 
<br/>called for short, is instrumental in promoting women’s rights, documenting the reality of women’s 
<br/></span><span>lives throughout the world and shaping global standards on gender equality and the empowerment of 
<br/></span><span>women  and  also  place  a  leading  role  in  monitoring  and  reviewing  progress  and  problems  in  the 
<br/>implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and in mainstreaming a gender

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>York to discuss this progress and gaps in the implementation of global women’s empowerment and 
<br/>gender equality programmes and also emerging issues that affect women and girls.  The Member 
<br/>States agreed on further actions to accelerate this progress and promote women’s empowerment of 
<br/>their rights in political, economic and social fields.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The outcomes of this meeting, Mr. Speaker, and recommendations of each of the sessions 
<br/>are then forwarded to the Economic and Social Council for follow-up.  From the 6</span><span>th</span><span> to 17</span><span>th</span><span> March, 
<br/>2023 the 67</span><span>th</span><span> Session of the Commission on the Status of Women was convened.  Every year, there 
<br/>are two themes.  The priority theme for this year was on “Innovation and Technological Change and 
<br/>Education in the Digital Age for achieving Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women and 
<br/>Girls”.  The other theme which is called the review theme was on, “Challenges and Opportunities in 
<br/>achieving Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Rural Women and Girls”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Minister responsible, Mr. Speaker, I led a seven-member Government delegation to 
<br/>the CSW.  With their own funding support, the delegation included a Senior representative of a Civil 
<br/>Society Organisation (CSO) Ms. Nalini Singh, who is the Executive Director of the Fiji Women’s 
<br/>Rights Movement (FWRM) funded by her own organisation, we had a female youth representative, 
<br/>Ms. Bulou Gavidi, who is an ICT entrepreneur funded by SPC and also other members who were 
<br/>also funded by their own organisations have been included. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The inclusion of the CSO representative, Mr. Speaker, is for the very first time since a lapse 
<br/>of 11 years.  The last CSO representative to be invited by the Government was under the former late 
<br/>Minister and late Speaker, Jiko Luveni, who took CSO representative from the Catholic Women’s  
<br/>League, Mrs. Susana Evening.  That was the last time that a civil society was invited by Government.  
<br/>But coming in this year, I felt this is very important that we work in partnership with our civil society 
<br/>and to take them along on this trip, and of course, a very critical role that they play in advocating for 
<br/>women’s empowerment and also the work they do on grassroots.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  youth  representative  participated  in  a  number  of  side  events,  as  a 
<br/>panellist and spoke on issues that young women face in line with the theme of the CSW, which is on 
<br/>ICT sector.  The CSO representative was present in the negotiations and had a very key role in the 
<br/>outcomes of the negotiation team and the conference. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Ministry fully utilised this opportunity to participate in high level bilateral meetings and 
<br/>side events.  Not only were we able to secure these bilateral meetings that we requested, but these 
<br/>were outweighed by the number of requests that came from  our bilaterals to  meet.   The bilateral 
<br/>meetings we held with the United States Special Envoy on Human Rights, Ms. Jessica Stern; the 
<br/>European  Union  Ambassador,  the  Canadian  Minister  for  Women  and  Gender  Equality,  the 
<br/>honourable Kirk Humphrey of Barbados, the Executive Director of UN Women, Ms. Sima Bahous, 
<br/>and we also met with, as requested, the permanent representatives to the UN for the countries of the 
<br/>US, New Zealand and Australia. We met with the Heads of the UNDP and UNICEF as well as the 
<br/>UN Special Representative on Violence Against Children, Ms. Najat Maalla, who is visiting Fiji next 
<br/>week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a major highlight of the meetings that were held was the courtesy visit to 
<br/></span><span>our United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Safety and Security, our very own, Mrs. Unaisi 
<br/></span><span>Vuniwaqa.  She is a role model and a strong inspiration for our Fijian women in the disciplined forces 
<br/>and in Fiji as a whole.  Our meetings focussed on how we could secure support and learn from States 
<br/>and  Parties  that  were  successful  in  implementing  activities  that  were  in  line  with  the  strategic 
<br/>priorities in our Ministry.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  support  of  crop  agencies,  namely,  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum 
<br/>Secretariat as well the Pacific Community (SPC), the Cook Islands as the Chair requested that Fiji 
<br/>present the statement on behalf of the Pacific Islands.  As you know, Sir, the Cook Islands is not a 
<br/>member State of the United Nations, but they were present there and they chaired all the Ministers 
<br/>Round Tables of all the Ministers that were present from the Pacific Region.  But they asked Fiji to 
<br/>present the statement and it was certainly an honour to do so on behalf of the region.  The focus, of 
<br/>course,  was  on  climate  emergency  and  the  importance  of  technology  as  an  accessibility  tool  for 
<br/>quality education, and on e-commerce and how we can empower our women in the region, this was 
<br/>in line with the CSW theme.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my national statement on behalf of our country, not only did I highlight the major initiatives 
<br/>we are currently undertaking in line with the theme, but also the possibility of empowering the lives 
<br/>of  Fijian  women  and  girls  with  the  use  of  technology  in  e-commerce.    Our  people  are  actually 
<br/>connected to the internet, about 80 percent are connected with about 70 percent women in Fiji who 
<br/>are connected to the internet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  use  of  e-commerce  for  our  Fijian  women,  especially  those  in  the 
<br/>informal sector, that can also look at the area of agriculture and fisheries and forestry, or wherever 
<br/>women are engaged in e-commerce both in urban and rural areas, this was something we discussed 
<br/>at length.  We also can use technology to improve access to health, access to information, education, 
<br/>but also address the gender-based violence and women in disaster resilience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we were forthright about in our statement when we got there in terms 
<br/>of the negotiations, we actually added this to the Pacific Region Statement, was that, while digital 
<br/>technology and innovation can create new possibilities for climate change mitigation and adaptation, 
<br/>it can also expand the carbon footprint of the ICT sector.  The ICT sector and artificial intelligence 
<br/>have a huge carbon footprint, and this is something if we are advancing the rights of our women and 
<br/>girls in this sector, we also need to be mindful of the carbon footprint of the ICT sector.  This was 
<br/>then  included  in  the  outcomes  because  Fiji  and  then  the  region  endorsed  it,  pushed  for  it  to  be 
<br/>included in the language of the outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to highlight the immense work undertaken by the region and Fiji in 
<br/>the  negotiations  referred  to  at  CSW  as  the  informal  discussions  for  our  input  into  the  agreed 
<br/>conclusions of 67</span><span>th</span><span> Session of the Commission.  Fiji did not only speak in our national capacity, but 
<br/>also as the lead negotiator for the region.  Again, I do acknowledge my predecessors and the previous 
<br/>government in sending our Ministers every year to the CSW because of the need to report on how 
<br/>Fiji is going but also as a leader in the region, as Fiji was the immediate past chair of the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in being true Pacific Islanders, the team of negotiators were able to negotiate 
<br/>on issues related carbon footprint, e-waste and sustainable technology.  The inclusion of the climate 
<br/>change  cluster  in  the  outcomes  document  to  include  a  paragraph  on  the  use  of  technology  and 
<br/>innovation to help promote climate change adaptation and mitigation, particularly, on the efforts to 
<br/>limit global temperature increase to 1.5 Degrees Celsius, ensure conservation and sustainable oceans 
<br/>management and the protection of diversity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to the negotiations to remove the language on maritime areas from the document, 
<br/></span><span>the negotiation team was able to retain this, because they had wanted to remove the reference of the 
<br/>words “maritime areas”.  But the negotiating Asian team was able to retain this and also included the 
<br/>language on “islands” to make specific reference to our region.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very important part of the Conference was the discussion of technology-
<br/>based or technology facilitated violence.  It is known as online violence, and I wanted to share some 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statistics on this.  Two-thirds of Fijians of all races have access to the internet and the number of 
<br/>mobile  phones  is  equivalent  to  139  percent  of  the  population.    It  is  widely  recognised  that  the 
<br/>incidence of online discrimination, harassment, threats and exploitation is surging around the world, 
<br/>and it has serious direct consequences for many of its victims.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian adolescence is at heightened risk of online exploitation.  In Fiji, it is more than six in 
<br/>10 adolescence or 61 percent are found to have low to very low levels of media literacy.  That is the 
<br/>ability to discern and deal with online threats, manipulation or misinformation.  The wide availability 
<br/>of online pornography that can be downloaded, saved, reviewed and retransmitted on mobile phones 
<br/>appears to be a factor exacerbating sexual abuse that is perpetuated not just by adult men, but also by 
<br/>teenage boys.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revenge pornography that occurs when men or boys host sexually explicit images of women 
<br/>or  girls  online  without  their  permission,  especially,  in  situations  where  couples  breakup  after  a 
<br/>romantic relationship has also been seen in Fiji.  It has led to women and girls being stigmatised by 
<br/>their  families  and  communities  with  emotional  consequences  that  can  last  for  years.  Sexting  and 
<br/>cyberbullying are also occurring in Fiji schools, and we really need to educate both girls and boys on 
<br/>the consequences of such actions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A recent research, Mr. Speaker, investigated attacks on Fijian politicians for their political 
<br/>beliefs, views and affiliation. Online comments were directed at male politicians four times more 
<br/>often than female politicians. However, Mr. Speaker, 83 percent of the comments directed at female 
<br/>politicians was sexist or misogynist in nature. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there are several issues pertaining to gender-based violence have found a home with 
<br/>digital and technological facilities, mainstream media and digital technologies also provide critical 
<br/>violence against women prevention settings and at the same time there can be vehicles that perpetuate 
<br/>and  aggravate  violence  against  women.  So,  it  is  a  catch  22  and  it  is  something  that  we,  as  a 
<br/>Government or as Parliament or as legislators, need to look at our legislation and look at our Online 
<br/>Safety Commission and whether it really has teeth when it comes to addressing online violence and 
<br/>especially this huge percentage of comments directed at women and girls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I must acknowledge the Government in its support to ensure that 
<br/>Fiji was represented at CSW. It was something that I literally came upon in the first few weeks that 
<br/>I had to prepare for and I can assure you, honourable Leader of the Opposition, it was not a waste of 
<br/>taxpayer’s money.  It was certainly a continuation of the previous Government’s commitment, and 
<br/>we will continue to do so in terms of our presence at CSW to report on the status of Fijian women.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also acknowledge the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government of Australia through the SPC that supported Fiji’s Chief Negotiator which is 
<br/>our Director for Women and our youth representative to CSW. 
<br/>Chair of Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), Cook Islands and their representative that was in New 
<br/>York  to  support  the  region  and  for  giving  the  honour  for  Fiji  to  present  the  region’s 
<br/>statement. 
<br/></span><span>support of PIFS and SPC Secretariat. They had their secretariat support on the ground to 
<br/></span><span>assist  myself  as  well  as  our  Chief  Negotiator  throughout  the  participation  at  the 
<br/>Commission on the Status of Women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also very grateful to all the women and girls of Fiji for their support and, of course, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, we have a big challenge in front of us.  I shared about the statistics on Violence Against 
<br/></span><span>Women and Girls yesterday, it was part of a question and the trends on domestic violence, online,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>811 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>violence which was addressed at this particular meeting is a big problem that we need to deal with, 
<br/>as legislators, and it is upon us to protect our women and girls and to protect our most vulnerable 
<br/>because of this growing threat because of our presence online. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his 
<br/>designate for their reply, I would like to acknowledge the presence of a former Member of Parliament 
<br/>from Raiwaqa, Mr. Rasova, and a long lost colleague of mine who has been away in the United States 
<br/>of America for donkey’s years now and has just returned, Mr. Jone Sokia, all the way from Newtown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to 
<br/>respond to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation.  That is the type 
<br/>of Ministerial Statement that we need to hear in Parliament. I commend the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think I will decide on that, honourable Bulitavu. Leave that to the Chair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Carry on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The content, the amount of intervention that the delegation did at 
<br/>that CSW 2023, it was really educational and also it showed that the honourable Minister was getting 
<br/>on with the work, not like the rest of the Ministers, especially the three Deputy Prime Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  hear  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  (one)  and  Minister  of  Finance,  always 
<br/>going back to the past. Same as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister (two) and Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications and even the last Ministerial 
<br/>Statement by honourable Deputy Prime Minister (three) and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/>where he did  not  mention anything.  It  was just like a trip to  the dump,  but  if you listened to  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Women,  thank  you  very  much,  Madam.  I  hope  you  will  soon  become  a 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- And I know it is coming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to the theme of the CSW 2023, ‘Innovation and Technological Change and Education 
<br/>in the Digital Age of achieving Gender Equality and Empowerment Women and Girls’, I think under 
<br/>the  FijiFirst  Government,  there  has  been  an  ongoing  programme.  If  you  see  the  Young 
<br/>Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES) Programme, I think that also enables women and girls to participate 
<br/>as entrepreneurs for more innovation in technology. There is an existing policy that the Women’s 
<br/>Ministry can work with the Ministry of Trade on those programmes that are already there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The alarming figures have been revealed by the Minister today in terms of harassment online, 
<br/></span><span>but we thank the FijiFirst Government for bringing that Online Safety Act which the Opposition then 
<br/>did  not  support.  That  is  the  first  legislation  that  is  there  that  gives  some  protection  at  least  for 
<br/>cyberbullying  and  all  other  online  violence  that  could  take  place.    I  agree  with  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Women that there can be more actions taken and more measures implemented to ensure 
<br/>the protection of women and girls.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a rise of violence on social media.  The honourable Minister is a master of </span><span>TikTok</span><span>
<br/>and  she  will  probably  be  the  best  person  to  champion  this  online  on  how  we  can  control  online 
<br/>behaviour,  especially  those  who  targeted,  based  on  race,  not  only  targeting  women  but  other 
<br/>vulnerable groups.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the honourable Minster for Women as someone who is really specialised on </span><span>TikTok</span><span>
<br/>videos to advance this because this will be really helpful.  Given she has many followers online, that 
<br/>will assist. Many of those too are using fake profiles and those are the very people who always do 
<br/>these kinds of coward attacks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to the Beijing Declaration and the Platform of Action, and I think the various policies 
<br/>that will be coming, domesticated by the honourable Minister through her Ministry and the policies 
<br/>that will be coming from the framework that she has already in place plus the outcomes of the 2023 
<br/>CSW  and  how  will  that  trickle  down  to  workable  policies  at  national  level.    I  thank  her  also  in 
<br/>involving  the  NGOs,  plus  those  who  were  part  of  her  delegation,  that  is  a  big  achievement  too. 
<br/>Moving  forward,  given  they  have  data  and  networks  linking  up  with  the  Government,  they  will 
<br/>clearly identify to the honourable Minister where the money should directed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, the honourable Minister, I will remind her to make submissions during the Budget to 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Finance on many programmes that could achieve the goals that is there 
<br/>under the SDGs which this Beijing Declaration aims to achieve by 2023 on the goals that are there 
<br/>under the SDGs goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I again commend the honourable Minister for the work she has done in her recent trip to New 
<br/>York; a very good ambassador for Fiji plus other side activities that happened too in her trip there in 
<br/>the US.  She wore a beautiful dress that was designed by Tagimoucia Designers, I love that dress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Women is in good hands now if the Minister continues in the path she is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>going. I wish her all the best.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>100 Days Achievements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU DR. A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Members, honourable Members of this 
<br/>august Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span> to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 48 days ago in this august Parliament, I delivered my Maiden Speech as 
<br/>Minister responsible for Health and Medical Services and highlighted the significant challenges that 
<br/>the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is facing now in the state of its infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also highlighted the two key elements essential for our vision for excellence in healthcare 
<br/>and  these  are,  firstly,  dramatically  improved  and  maintained  infrastructure  of  the  220  medical 
<br/>facilities  around  Fiji  and,  secondly,  a  well-supported,  appropriately  remunerated  and  competent 
<br/>healthcare professionals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our achievements so far, Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is my 100</span><span>th</span><span> day in Parliament and I wish 
<br/></span><span>to highlight the achievements by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services.  Since my Maiden 
<br/>Speech. the Ministry has worked on re-prioritising funds within the budget and working with the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy to streamline approval processes to reflect these intentions.  Indeed, a team led 
<br/>by  the  Head  of  Finance  and  Assets,  including  a  senior  member  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  are 
<br/>continuing work to ensure these intentions are reflected in the new budget year.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>813 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also embarked on a number of initiatives that have been able to supplement our revamped 
<br/>infrastructure, building and maintenance programme by calling for greater community engagement 
<br/>and strengthening the Board of Visitors programme.  I called on community leaders, youth groups, 
<br/>business  houses,  faith  groups,  rural  and  urban  communities,  villages  and  non-governmental 
<br/>organisations to step forward and lend a helping hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We then followed this up with community visitations where we visited our healthcare workers 
<br/>working  in  their  various  health  facilities  and  discussed  their  challenges  with  them,  as  well  as 
<br/>encouraging  them  on  the  important  tasks  they  are  performing  for  the  people  they  serve  in  their 
<br/>communities.  We also sat down with members of the community, including representatives of local 
<br/>business communities and encourage them to assist in the upgrade of their local healthcare facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on reviving the Board of Visitors (BOV), at the start of my term in office, 
<br/>15 of the 22 or 68 percent of Divisional, Sub-Divisional and Specialist Hospitals which are St. Giles 
<br/>Hospital and Tamavua Twomey Hospital, under the Ministry of Health and Medical Services did not 
<br/>have an active Board of Visitors.  This points to a “disconnect” that exists between the community 
<br/>and their local health facility, and it needed immediate actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has since instigated an application and appointment process for BOV members 
<br/>that is fair and transparent. We are pleased with the response we have received so far and anticipate 
<br/>completing the appointment of BOV members over the next few weeks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For some of our hospitals, this will be the first time that they will have a BOV in place, and 
<br/>this is  a great  step forward in  our efforts towards collaboration and community partnership.  The 
<br/>BOV  is  a  legislated  body  under  the  Public  Hospitals  and  Dispensaries  (Amendment)  Act  2012.  
<br/>Members of the BOV are appointed by the Minister from the local community.  The functions of the 
<br/>BOV as stated in the Act include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The maintenance and repair of the hospital or dispensary under its care and control. 
<br/>The beautification of the hospital or dispensary under its care and control. 
<br/>The  hospital  or  dispensary  under  its  care  or  control  is  well  equipped  and  has  the 
<br/>necessary technology to provide high quality care to patients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Assist the Ministry of Health in encouraging good health and prevent communicable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and non-communicable diseases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  BOV  is  also  the  voice  of  the  community  to  the  management  of  the 
<br/>healthcare facility, and they work with the management of the healthcare facility to ensure that health 
<br/>service is responding effectively to the health needs of the community it serves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the revival of the BOV is in progress, please, allow me to share a few 
<br/>success stories which depict the level of collaboration and partnership between the health facilities 
<br/>and their local communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) in Suva, the state of Fiji’s 
<br/>largest hospital came to light in January when members of the media took a ‘State of the Nation’s 
<br/></span><span>Infrastructure Tour’ around CWMH. After the tour, an Infrastructure Working Group (IWG), Chaired 
<br/></span><span>by  the  Hospital’s  Medial  Superintendent,  Dr.  Luke  Nasedra,  and  with  membership  from  the 
<br/>Hospital’s BOV, Hospital Administration, the Ministry’s Asset and Management Unit and Executive 
<br/>Support Unit, was set up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the IWG have quickly developed processes, trackers and actions in response

<div><span>infrastructural development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  major  fundraising  event  held  at  the  residence  of  the  British  High Commissioner  in  Fiji 
<br/>located in Suva, and hosted by the British High Commissioner himself, His Excellency Dr. Brian 
<br/>James Jones, was a success where about FJ$1 million of pledges and commitments have been made 
<br/>towards the CWMH infrastructure works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Savusavu Hospital, it was good to hear from the Sub-Divisional Medical 
<br/>Officer, Dr. Talei Jioji, upon our visit.  The Savusavu community have rallied around her to assist 
<br/>with the much-needed infrastructural upgrade work for the Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry wishes to acknowledge Mr. Graham Haynes, the community workers of Nawi 
<br/>Island, volunteers, business organisations, non-government organisations and residents of Savusavu 
<br/>here and abroad, who have pledged donations in cash and kind worth $49,000 towards the much-
<br/>needed minor repair works and maintenance works for the Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The donations are currently being put to good use as minor works carried out at the Hospital 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>patching of the roof; 
<br/>replacement of fly screen; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>water blasting, wiping and painting of the exterior and interior walls and ceiling; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>replacement of ceiling fans; and 
<br/>refurbishment of the Hospital Notice Board; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Savusavu  community  have  also  assisted  in  repairing  an  old  power  generator  at  the 
<br/>Hospital that has been restored to full function, and the repair of an old ambulance which once fully 
<br/>functional, will assist to serve the transportation of patients from Tukavesi Health Centre, Natewa 
<br/>Health Centre and Rabi Health Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Cicia Health Centre in the Lau Group, the Divisional Medical Officer 
<br/>Eastern, Dr. Sravaniya Dasi, worked with the Cicia Health Centre Team to identify and engage local 
<br/>community  with  carpentry  skills  to  undertake  minor  infrastructure  at  the  Health  Centre  with  the 
<br/>material bought by the Ministry. The Health Centre was last renovated 41 years ago in 1982 and 
<br/>needed much work in plumbing, repairing of the roof, floor and painting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the support of Tarukua villagers and supervised by a single technical person from the 
<br/>Ministry,  more  than  90  percent  of  the  total  labour  cost  was  saved  through  this  Health  Centre-
<br/>community partnership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the examples of CWMH, Savusavu Hospital and Cicia Health Centre are 
<br/>impressive and heartwarming.  There are more examples, but time is not on my side.  However, I am 
<br/>most certain that with more collaboration and teamwork, many more great things can be achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  very  pleased  to  inform  Parliament  today  that  our  communities 
<br/></span><span>throughout the country have responded in a heartwarming way, showcasing their love and pride for 
<br/></span><span>their local health facilities and the resident heathcare workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within 10 days of delivering my Maiden Speech, more than 1,000 people from Suva as well 
<br/>as other parts of the country, converged at the soon-to-be 100-year-old CWMH for its first Clean-Up 
<br/>Campaign for the year.  People from all walks of life joined hands to clean up the ageing Hospital 
<br/>infrastructure and gave their time and effort for a worthy cause.

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was attending a Ministerial Forum abroad at the time but 
<br/>managed to catch a glimpse of the event on the Ministry’s social media platforms, and I must say I 
<br/>was  emotional  and  at  the  same  time,  overwhelmed  with  pride.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  was 
<br/>physically away, my heart and soul yearned to be part of the Clean-Up Campaign back here at home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also informed that the initiative has since snowballed into other hospitals and divisions 
<br/>around the country where community members have stepped forward and assisted in the clean-up 
<br/>and beautification of their local health facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The late 13 year old American poet, Mattie Stepanek once said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Unity is strength when there is teamwork and collaboration. Wonderful things can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be achieved.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This quote best depicts what transpired at the CWMH Clean-Up Campaign, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as well 
<br/>as the effort exhibited in other healthcare facilities around the country from the main hospitals and 
<br/>right down to the rural nursing stations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to acknowledge and the thank the villagers, community leaders, </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span>, </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>ni Koro,</span><span> local businesses, community groups, civil society organisations, religious organisations and 
<br/>our bilateral and multi-lateral partners, who have supported us and will continue to support us as we 
<br/>move ahead in this endeavour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, both, improved infrastructure and well supported healthcare professionals 
<br/>have  a  significant  impact  on  the  quality  of  care,  the  morale  of  staff  but  also  on  health  seeking 
<br/>behaviour of all Fijians. If people’s confidence in the Fiji’s healthcare system and in their local health 
<br/>facility is high, they are more likely to seek healthcare earlier which can lead to earlier treatment, 
<br/>recovery and care and increased productivity in our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, community engagement and partnership is one way we hope to remove the 
<br/>fear  of  hospitals  and  improve  health  seeking  behaviour  for  our  people.    That  is  why  we  are 
<br/>encouraging and engaging members of the community   to take ownership of maintaining their health 
<br/>facilities.  It is a win-win scenario and promotes the Ministry’s vision for a healthy population in Fiji, 
<br/>supported  by  the  Ministry’s  effort  to  empower  Fijians  to  achieve  optimal  health  and  well-being 
<br/>through the delivery of cost-effective, quality and inclusive health services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on human resource for the Ministry of Health.  One of the 
<br/>Ministry’s greatest challenge it is facing now is maintaining its human resource at an optimal level 
<br/>for the service we provide.  The attrition rate for healthcare workers have been abnormally high over 
<br/>the 12 to 24 months and facilitated by many pull and push factors that include, emigration, the search 
<br/>for greener pastures, education, family welfare, higher salaries and aggressive recruitment techniques 
<br/>by overseas recruitment agencies and local private hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  last  12  months,  the  Ministry  has  lost  some  800  nurses  from  its 
<br/>workforce which includes, nurses who have moved to the Aspen Hospitals in Lautoka and Ba.  The 
<br/></span><span>loss  is  reflective  of  similar  losses  noted  in  other  healthcare  cadre  such  as  doctors,  pharmacists, 
<br/></span><span>laboratory technicians, medical imaging technologists and others. These losses impact our ability to 
<br/>deliver quality services, and also increases the burden of those who remain with the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, however, is a global phenomenon that is currently experienced all over the world.  In 
<br/>fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this week, the United Kingdom (UK) placed Zimbabwe in a group of 
<br/>eight countries in the world that the UK is banned from recruiting health and social workers from, to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>safeguard the country’s health system. This ban followed the World Health Organization’s Health 
<br/>Workforce  Support  and  Safeguards  List  2023,  which  highlights  countries  with  dangerously  low 
<br/>number of healthcare workers.  This List exists because many countries, including Fiji, are facing 
<br/>this human resource predicament of healthcare worker attrition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address this, the Ministry has been working hard in recruiting healthcare 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>workers through the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  nurses,  through  our  Open  Merit  Recruitment  System  (OMRS),  a  total  total  of  206 
<br/>nurses were recruited in November 2022 (2022-2023 financial year). A further 18 nurses 
<br/>have been recruited after November 2022, and a further 162 registered nurses are expected 
<br/>to  be  recruited in  May this year, followed by  another  cohort of  44 registered nurses in 
<br/>November, bringing the total number of registered nurses to be recruited to 206 in 2023 
<br/>(412 registered nurses in the current Budget year).  Furthermore, 237 nurse graduates will 
<br/>be recruited as Inter Nurses in June this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will establish 50 new Nursing Assistants and 50 new Nursing Aide positions 
<br/>and will be advertised shortly for recruitment to support other nursing teams at our hospitals 
<br/>and healthcare facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Doctors, a total of 150 Medical Interns were recruited in January of this year, while 80 
<br/>Medical Officers have been recruited as of today, with the remaining to be recruited as soon 
<br/>as they complete their internship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Oral Health Practitioners, a total of 205 Oral Health Practitioners with another 25 to be 
<br/>recruited before the end of 2022-2023 financial year which will bring the total to 230. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Allied  Health  workers  such  as  Dieticians,  Physiotherapists,  Pharmacists,  Medical 
<br/>Imaging  Technologists,  Laboratory  Assistants  and  Environmental  Health  Officers  and 
<br/>Biomedical  Technicians,  558  of  the  717  positions  have  been  filled  through  an  ongoing 
<br/>recruitment process and 87 more posts are processed to be filled during this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  addition  to  our  recruitment  efforts  in  recognition  that  we  are  losing 
<br/>experienced personnel, the Ministry has also pursued capacity building for its workforce with the 
<br/>support of the central agencies of Government and supplemented by our development partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The in-service training budget of $776,476 for Medical Officers have ensured that our doctors 
<br/></span><span>are  upskilled  and  updated  in  knowledge,  skills  and  competencies,  while  attaining  post-graduate 
<br/>qualification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2023 academic year, the Australian Government Pacific Scholarship for Midwifery 
<br/>sponsored  20  registered  nurses  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  sponsored  an  additional  20  registered 
<br/>nurses through its in-service training budget.  As such, a total of 40 registered nurses are expected to 
<br/>graduate as Midwives at the end of 2023 academic year, and they will be formally recruited in 2024.  
<br/>This is in addition to the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sponsoring 
<br/>249 registered nurses in the years 2019 to 2022 for the Post-Graduate Diploma in Midwifery offered 
<br/>by the Fiji National University (FNU) in Suva and TISI Sangam Institute of Nursing in Labasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also  negotiated with  the World Bank who sponsored 10 registered nurses to 
<br/>pursue their Post-Graduate Certificate in Mental Health offered by the FNU for the 2022 academic 
<br/>year.  An additional 10 nurses are anticipated to be sponsored in 2023.  Similarly, the Fred Hollows 
<br/>Foundation is sponsoring two nurses for the Post-Graduate Diploma in Eye Care at the Pacific Eye

<div><span>Institute, in addition to the 44 registered nurses who have been sponsored by the Foundation from 
<br/>2006 to 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges the challenging financial situation that the nation 
<br/>is in and will continue to work with the Central Government agencies to advocate for the appropriate 
<br/>remuneration  of  its  healthcare  workers  for  the  sterling  work  that  is  carried  out  in  all  our  health 
<br/>facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has worked hard to improve its ability to effectively engage 
<br/>with its health development partners.  The Ministry is establishing development partners coordination 
<br/>to make use of the opportunities provided by the development partners for the delivery of quality 
<br/>health services and the upkeep of health infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has so far held two donor partner coordination meetings attended by a number 
<br/>of important health partners, such as the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, New 
<br/>Zealand  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  JICA,  KOICA,  World  Bank  and  UN  Offices 
<br/>representatives, to name a few.  These meetings have been positive and have provided the platform 
<br/>for the Ministry to share its plans and visions for health and Fiji and solicit the support of the health 
<br/>partners towards these programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, as alluded to earlier, today marks my 100 days as the Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Health and Medical Services.  A lot have been achieved and a lot more needs to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to acknowledge the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, 
<br/>who  despite  the  many  obstacles  before  them,  continue  to  work  hard  and  remain  passionate  and 
<br/>committed to their work towards the vision of a healthy population in Fiji.  I wish you all a blessed 
<br/>Easter.  </span><span>Vina’a vakalevu</span><span> and thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition  or his  designate to  speak in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response to the Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  give  a  response  to  the  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement given by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services.  We were waiting to 
<br/>hear the new policy that would have come out in the first 100 days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are happy to learn from the honourable Minister about the improvement of the outlook of 
<br/>the Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH).  Let us not forget that health services are just like 
<br/>water issues, influx of population, and the influx of people in Suva demand more services by the 
<br/>health sector as well.  So, we thank the honourable Minister for engaging with stakeholders and the 
<br/>business community, the re-appointment of the Board of Visitors (BOV) while looking after several 
<br/>health facilities in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard about the ‘No Jab No Job’ Policy that was repealed 
<br/>by the Coalition Government.  I was hoping to hear how many joined the Ministry of Health after 
<br/>the repeal of that Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know for the fact and also alluded to by the honourable Minister the mass resignation of 
<br/>nurses and other allied healthcare workers living our shores going to greener pastures.  Less than one 
<br/>month ago, we heard from the President of the Fiji Nurses Association, Dr. Alisi Vudiniabola, taking 
<br/>a swipe at the Permanent Secretary for Health.  She said, “Stop behaving as if everything is fine.”

<br/>Relating to COVID-19 Response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard that the Intern Nurses will try to fill the vacuum, however, we must not forget 
<br/>that these Intern Nurses were trained through online platform during COVID-19, and they do lack 
<br/>competency in clinical skills.  That is the challenge the Ministry is facing right now.  Not only that, 
<br/>but they are also new in the profession, and they need a lot of mentorship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the FijiFirst Government after the Job Evaluation Exercise of 2018, nurses were given 
<br/>a huge pay rise from 50 percent to 75 percent, and that saw the influx of nurses as well as doctors 
<br/>and dentists who are in the private sector to come back to the public sector, because of the incentives 
<br/>that were provided by the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  heard  this  morning  that  there  are  graduates  coming  out  from  Post-
<br/>Graduate  training  for  nurses  and  doctors  and  that  was  the  initiative  put  up  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that the status of the health facilities is not in so good conditions.  I used to watch 
<br/>from home the debate in this Parliament and I used to hear the honourable Member who was sitting 
<br/>here in the last term of Parliament always saying, ‘no money, no money.’  I was a bit worried when 
<br/></span><span>the People’s Coalition went into Government, I thought there is just really no money in the kitty, and 
<br/></span><span>I have not heard that in the last 100 days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hospitals need medicine and tenders for consumables are on hold at the moment.  This week, 
<br/>we are hearing about COVID-19 vaccines but at the moment, vaccines for five years to 11 year olds 
<br/>are also out of stock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pharmacies who are participating in the Private-Public Partnership programme, most of them 
<br/>still do not come on board to take the 100 percent of this good initiative helping all Fijians.  It is 
<br/>interesting to see that there are no more contracts for staff who are recruited, and we want to know 
<br/>from the Government the recruitment guideline that is used in the public service and how staff will 
<br/>progress on their salary band. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement and we wish him well in 
<br/>the coming days, months and years.  We thank and urge   the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>and staff to stand firm and be strong as resilient Fijians.
