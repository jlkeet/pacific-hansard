<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>FIJI MEAT INDUSTRY BOARD 2015-2017 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Meat Industry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Board 2015-2017 Annual Report which was tabled on 1</span><span>st</span><span> September, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition and Members of Parliament, I rise to speak on the Review Report of the Fiji Meat 
<br/>Industry Board (FMIB) 2015-2017 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its Review Report of 
<br/>the FMIB 2015-2017 Annual Reports during the 2022 Parliament sitting by the former chairperson, 
<br/>honourable Vijay Nath.  As part of its deliberations, the Committee invited executives from the FMIB 
<br/>to provide a submission for the period under review.  It was noted that the industry had been facing 
<br/>numerous challenges which included but are not limited to dwindling livestock numbers and the high 
<br/>maintenance costs due to the aged abattoir facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee made recommendations for FMIB to develop a multi-year 
<br/>Strategic Plan which systematically addresses these challenges and sets the organisation in the right 
<br/>direction.  Furthermore,  the Committee during its deliberations also  noted the need to  review the 
<br/>Meat Act 1970.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommended for FMIB to consider the option of vertical 
<br/>integration which would entail exploring the viability of having its own supply farm as well as a 
<br/>retail butcher.  It would also enable FMIB to complement its supply of live animals and maintain the 
<br/>minimum throughput necessary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the former Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members who were part of the team that produced this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  on  the  motion.  
<br/>Before I do so, I would like to inform you that there are about eight speakers who submitted their 
<br/>names to their respective Whips.  We will begin the batting by having: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span> Honourable V. Lal; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation; 
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition;  
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services; and  
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/>Environment , Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Review Report of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fiji Meat Industry Board 2015-2017 Annual Report.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FMIB 2015-2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee’s scrutiny of the Report in terms of Sustainable Development Goals specifically in areas 
<br/>of gender equality, empowerment of women and girls and promotion of sustainable agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIB’s effort to encourage people to venture into livestock farming in the area of poultry 
<br/>and  beef  farming  is  a  step  towards  achieving  SDG2,  ending  hunger,  achieving  food  security  and 
<br/>boosting the local economy.  The efforts made by the FMIB in ensuring the safety and quality of 
<br/>meat consumed by Fijian families through the provision of internationally benchmark facilities is 
<br/>commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the recommendations made by the Standing Committee in the Review of the Fiji 
<br/>Meat Industry Board Annual Report 2015-2017.  It is imperative that the FMIB develops a Strategic 
<br/>Plan to address the challenges it faces and ensure its sustainability in the long term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  accurately  highlights  the  challenges  faced  by  the  FMIB  including  dwindling 
<br/>livestock numbers and high maintenance cost due to aged abattoir facilities.  The recommendations 
<br/>made by the Committee such as developing a multi-year strategic plan and exploring the option of 
<br/>vertical integration are constructive and will benefit the FMIB in the long run. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recommendation  to  consider  vertical  integration  which  includes 
<br/>exploring the viability of having its own supply farm and retailed butcher is a smart move that will 
<br/>not only increase supply consistency but also reduce the number of bush skills and allow farmers to 
<br/>receive  a  fair  value  for  their  animals.  Additionally,  exploring  the  possibility  of  a  mobile 
<br/>slaughterhouse  will  increase  the  number  of  animals  coming  through  FMIB  which  has  a  positive 
<br/>impact on both the industry and the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the FMIB to take the Committee’s recommendations seriously and 
<br/>work towards implementing them. This will ensure the sustainability and growth of the Meat Industry 
<br/>in Fiji providing safe and thick meat for consumption by Fijian families while contributing to the 
<br/>country’s overall economic development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully endorse the Committees recommendations and commend the Standing Committee on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic Affairs for their efforts in producing this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion before Parliament is to debate the report 
<br/>and recommendations of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs on the Fiji  Meat  Industry 
<br/>Board Annual Report 2015-2017.  The Report by the previous Members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>was tabled in Parliament in September 2022.  I thank the honourable Members of the previous and 
<br/>the  current  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  for  the  preparation  of  this  Report  and  its 
<br/>production for us to debate on this evening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Meat Industry Board was established by the Alliance Government 
<br/>in 1976 under the Meat Act 1969.  The Board was declared a Commercial Statutory Authority and 
<br/>as a re-organisation enterprise.  When the whole world was going through an era of corporatisation 
<br/>and privatisation and right-sizing of government, et cetera, and the SVT Government that I led at the 
<br/>time enacted the Public Enterprise Act of 1996.  Under the new Public Enterprises Act of 2019, the 
<br/></span><span>Board is now a public enterprise and the key functions of the Fiji Meat Industry Board include the 
<br/></span><span>following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Construct and operate public slaughter facilities; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Protect, preserve and expand meat industry; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Borrow capital monies when required; and  
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Purchase trade or deal in livestock or meat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Consolidated Review Report – FMIB 2015-2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>839 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I might add at this time, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition would understand, this 
<br/>is an area that whole world is looking at, livestock and their contribution to emissions that might 
<br/>mitigate or militate against us in our fight to be compliant with what the world is trying to do.  This 
<br/>Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an important agricultural asset for the nation as it serves the purpose of 
<br/>providing  slaughter  services  for  not  only  the  general  public,  but  also  in  assisting  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture with the slaughter, marketing and administration of compensation to farmers for cattle 
<br/>with tuberculosis reactors.  We know that over some periods in the past, we have had some livestock 
<br/>destroyed when TB was around and rampant at the time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of fulfilling its commercial obligations, the Public Enterprise Act and its own statute, 
<br/>the  Board  encountered  several  challenges  in  achieving  profitability  over  the  years  under  review, 
<br/>which further worsened during the pandemic.  During the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FMIB was 
<br/>deemed an essential service and continued to provide its services.  The Board operation was severely 
<br/>impacted due to the decline in the supply of pigs, goats, sheep and cattle during the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, the Board adopted a strategy to work with stakeholders to source livestock for 
<br/>slaughter purposes. There had been some other attempts in the past to import beef cattle from New 
<br/>Zealand.  I was personally involved in an attempt, but my recommendation did not go beyond the 
<br/>Minister for Home Affairs Office who was then working in the Prime Minister’s Office.  We tried to 
<br/>do  that,  and  other  people  have  also  tried  to  do  that  and  improve  the  breed  of  livestock  we  have 
<br/>available for our meat industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Board has continued to  be affected by the aftermath  of the pandemic and the current 
<br/>national  and  international  economic  situation.    While  the  cost  of  providing  their  services  has 
<br/>significantly increased, slaughter fees have remained the same since 2006, when it was last reviewed.  
<br/>Many farmers in the livestock sector are slowly recovering their livestock population and returning 
<br/>to the numbers prior to the pandemic, with the assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture.  Despite 
<br/>these challenges, I am pleased to note that the Board achieved a net profit in the 2022 financial period, 
<br/>after four years of  consecutive losses and I thank those involved with  the industry at  the time.  I 
<br/>would also like to thank the Fiji Meat Industry Board management and staff for their diligence in 
<br/>looking after their services for the people and into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Meat Industry Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, commenced with developing a 5-year Strategic 
<br/>Plan from 2024 to 2028 in January of 2021.  A workshop was organised in April that year, inviting 
<br/>stakeholders from Fiji Crop &amp; Livestock Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, Vuda 
<br/>Piggeries Limited, Tebara Halal Meats Limited, Leylands Fiji and farmers involved in the livestock 
<br/>industry for their feedback in developing the Strategic Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted that the FMIB encountered three major challenges, such as a decline in livestock 
<br/>numbers, aging abattoir buildings and equipment and the outdated legislative framework of the Meat 
<br/>Industry Act of 1969.  The Strategic Plan will aim to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliver the relevant obligations as mandated to the Meat Act; 
<br/>define service requirements to inform other key strategies such as financial management, 
<br/>asset management, people management and governance;  
<br/></span><span>ensure that there is an understanding across the Government on the long-term aspirations 
<br/></span><span>and desired outcomes of FMIB businesses;  
<br/>ensure connection between FMIB goals and objectives to its day to day operations; and  
<br/>provide a basis for decision making to continuously improve FMIB’s operations, and as 
<br/>such, confirm long term capital and operational expenditure plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Strategic Plan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is in the final stage of completion and is expected to be 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FMIB 2015-2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completed by the middle of this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span><span>The Committee also noted from the Report the need to review the Meat Industry Act 1969.   
<br/>The Committee concurs with this and recommends this to be done with urgency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response, and I believe everyone involved is working towards this.  The Committee’s 
<br/>recommendation is noted, the review of the Meat Industry Act 1969 comes under the ambit of the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture (MoA).  In February 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 
<br/>completed the assessment of all legislations related to MoA, including the Meat Act, and based on 
<br/>this assessment, MoA has been exploring options to review all outdated legislations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span><span>In light of supply consistency, the Committee recommends for FMIB to consider the option 
<br/>of vertical integration.  This would entail exploring the viability of having its own supply 
<br/>farm as well as a retail butcher.  In addition, this would enable FMIB to complement its supply 
<br/>of live animals and maintain the minimum throughput necessary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee’s recommendation, I believe, is being accepted and noted.  The opportunity 
<br/>to consider vertical integration is limited by the Meat Industry Act of 1969.  However, as per the 
<br/>Meat Act, one of the FMIB’s core functions is to construct and operate public slaughtering facilities.  
<br/>As such, FMIB is currently focused on refurbishing its Nakasi and Vuda Abattoirs to acquire Hazard 
<br/>Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) certification which will improve its performance in 
<br/>providing slaughtering services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  FMIB  has  been  allocated  approximately  $1.2  million  of  Government  grant  from  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  the  past  three  years  to  upgrade  its  Nakasi  and  Vuda  Abattoirs.  The 
<br/>investment in the facilities ensures that it remains functional and compliant to safety standards and it 
<br/>will also enhance the profitability of Fiji Meat Industry Board as the production of high quality and 
<br/>hygienic  meat  products  will  generate  more  revenue  for  it.    In  addition  to  that,  FMIB  is  working 
<br/>closely with the Ministry of Agriculture in assisting farmers to increase the number of livestock to 
<br/>ensure a consistent supply is maintained at the abattoir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span><span>The  Committee  recommends  for  FMIB  to  explore  possible  options  in  terms  of  mobile 
<br/>slaughterhouse.  The Committee believes this  may increase the number of animals  coming 
<br/>through FMIB and reduce the number of bush kills.  It may also have a positive impact on 
<br/>the farmers as they are maybe able to get a fair value for their animals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee’s recommendation is noted and FMIB will work closely with stakeholders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and development partners in exploring these options: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provision of mobile slaughterhouses may increase the number of livestock coming 
<br/>through the FMIB and reduce the number of bush kills leading to a positive impact for 
<br/>the farmers as it will also allow them to get a fair value for their meat that is slaughtered 
<br/></span><span>in hygienic conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIB is also currently exploring potential locations to relocate its abattoir services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am very much aware that we have some honourable Members who do not 
<br/>take meat and I hope they will pardon me for what I am going through here.  At this point, I would 
<br/>like to just go back a few years when I raised a point here about some bush farmers in Vanua Levu 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>who had lost herds of cattle.  I had to call my friend, honourable Bala to release them from a bush 
<br/>killing abattoir we had in Cakaudrove at that time.  He obliged and released the animals, but we had 
<br/>to pay for the collection – you promised me that you will refund me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that short contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you and I commend the motion before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do acknowledge the statement made by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister particularly in the positive steps that the Ministry for Public Enterprise is 
<br/>taking to assist FMIB.  I am thankful for the allocation from the Ministry of Agriculture because this 
<br/>is  one  entity  that  never  receives  any  assistance  from  government  since  its  existence  and  that  has 
<br/>always been an issue that the Board brings in almost every meeting that they have because they never 
<br/>receive any assistance.  Because of the aging infrastructure has a piece of critical requirement when 
<br/>it comes to food processing, and we have to upgrade the facility.  I am thankful that the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture is working on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to talk about the opportunities that are there.  Sir, FMIB relies 
<br/>on the efforts of the farmers and unfortunately, livestock level in Fiji has been declining over the 
<br/>years.  When FMIB was established, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the turnaround was around 20,000 animals 
<br/>slaughtered per year.  They used to have a tannery and take the leather across to Australia or New 
<br/>Zealand for processing, but all these were closed.  Maybe the honourable Minister for Agriculture 
<br/>knows the exact time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It depended on the farmers.  If we go back to history, we had Verata Beef Scheme, where is 
<br/>the Verate Beef Scheme now?  Non-existent.  We had the Uluisavou Beef Scheme in Ra, it is  no 
<br/>longer in existence.  We have Yalavou Beef Scheme in the interior of Nadroga/Navosa, it is no longer 
<br/>in existence. We are thankful to the honourable Assistant Minister for Agriculture, a few years back 
<br/>he  revived  Tilivalevu.    What  I  wish  to  emphasise  here,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  huge  opportunities 
<br/>particularly for landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to pick up these projects, it is unfortunate.  I know Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly 
<br/>Yalavou  and  Uluisavou  as  well,  even  when  Verata  Beef  Scheme  started,  the  honourable  Sakiasi 
<br/>Ditoka and I know the Verata Beef Scheme very well.  A few of the problems was, I think because 
<br/>they were financed by the Fiji Development Bank, but I think in terms of the capacity development, 
<br/>the entrepreneurial skills for the farmers so that they can repay debt and one of the big challenges too 
<br/>is our communal way of living.  I know this because my namesake, in fact, utilized our  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>
<br/>land, he was a beef farmer.  I will use Verata, for example.  When the farmers go to the village for a 
<br/>death or whatever, they will spend about three weeks over there and they will come back to the farm.  
<br/>When they come back to the farm, the animals have gone astray.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is that communal way of living and I am glad that are few years back when we went to 
<br/>Malaysia, we saw how Malaysia succeeded in such projects. They were taking away the farmers from 
<br/>their communities but whatever is needed in the community, they also established it in the estate, the 
<br/></span><span>community halls, churches, temples, mosques, schools et cetera.  These are some of the factors that 
<br/></span><span>contributed  to  the  farmers  living  the  farm  because  their  children  needed  to  go  to  school.    The 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture knows the steps that we have taken a few years back and I was 
<br/>looking forward to hearing his statement first because he was the one that we sent to Rockhampton 
<br/>to go and get the new breeds.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FMIB 2015-2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right  now,  we  have  the  new  beef  breeds  in  Nadroga,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  –  Senepol, 
<br/>Droughtmaster  and  Wagyu.    Two  are  already  here  and  we  have  gone  into  the  new  technology  - 
<br/>embryo transfer rather than the artificial insemination.  We have even brought in the new dairy breed 
<br/>- Brown Swiss.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do acknowledge the work undertaken by my successor, we are not blowing our own trumpet 
<br/>here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we saw the potentials, we have done the initial work.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister knows it well and this is one of the things that I emphasised with him, “please pick up and 
<br/>carry on with the work that we done in the livestock sector.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With sheep, we have brought the Dorper Sheep to be in cross bred with the Fiji Fantastic, 
<br/>likewise the Boer Goat.  I will not go into the details; we have started some of the work but let me 
<br/>go back to the potentials.  I hope that we, honourable Members of this august Parliament will go back 
<br/>and try and convince our people that we need to be involved in livestock farming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although I am well aware Sir, that in climate change, we are looking at trying to reduce but 
<br/>animal waste as long as we convert that into methane gas, it is still acceptable.  This is one of the 
<br/>challenges that we have, but then SDG2 is about Zero Hunger and in the Paris Agreement, it talks 
<br/>about the common and differentiated responsibilities based on capacities.  We have a responsibility 
<br/>to feed our own people, therefore we will gradually go towards zero grazing so that we can minimise 
<br/>and particularly with the pigs, they have now come up with digesters and hopefully the beef sector 
<br/>will go into this as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank Government for the commitment to review the Act because the private sector can 
<br/>invest but they are restricted by this Act.  The current Act says that you cannot establish another 
<br/>facility, but you can do slaughterhouses because I know few of the operators, particularly from the 
<br/>private sectors, those that own butchery, they want to invest in these areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To those in the rural areas, one of the big markets in Fiji Meat Industry Board is the </span><span>magiti</span><span>
<br/>sector,  particularly  with  pork,  slaughtered  in,  they  are  from  the  outer  islands.    But  to  the  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Transport, one of the issues coming up now is the cartage fees.  This is major 
<br/>issue that will be raised regularly in the provincial council meetings; Lau Provincial Council meeting, 
<br/>Kadavu Provincial Council and Lomaiviti.  So, probably this is something that can be looked into, 
<br/>but it is a big market segment with FMIB – the </span><span>magiti</span><span> market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to conclude by again saying that there is huge potential because FMIB is dependent on 
<br/>what the farmers raise in the paddocks or in their projects.  If the livestock sector performs better, 
<br/>FMIB  will  definitely  be  able  to  break  even  in  terms  of  cost  and  even  make  huge  profits  but 
<br/>particularly based on the farmers’ efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would again urge the honourable Minister, I know that he is passionate about this because 
<br/>probably  that  has  to  be  his  legacy  too,  because  he  went  to  Rockhampton  to  go  and  look  at  the 
<br/>opportunities and he is very close to the technician that is doing all the embryo transfer and we look 
<br/>forward to the day where we will have sufficient and even abundance supplies so that FMIB can 
<br/>perform better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to show my support for the motion before 
<br/>Parliament  that  is  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Board  2015  –  2017 
<br/>Annual Reports.  I think the honourable Prime Minister has touched on most of what I had intended 
<br/>to speak on, but I will try to speak on others that he may have left out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FMIB is a commercial statutory authority of Government with a core

<div><span>function to protect, preserve and expand the meat industry in Fiji.  The Board’s mandate is to control 
<br/>and  regulate  slaughtering  of  livestock  in  Fiji  and  it  has  continuously  worked  with  the  industry 
<br/>stakeholders to develop standards that meet Fiji’s Food Safety Act 2009 as well as benchmarking it 
<br/>to international standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of FMIB’s financial position, I think this has been alluded to by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister,  after  successive  losses  which  shows  in  this  Report,  it  has  finally  made  a  profit.    The 
<br/>important thing to note that the bulk of revenue generated by FMIB is from the slaughter fees and 
<br/>not from the sale of carcass.  A small portion of revenue is generated from the sale of processed meat 
<br/>meal and fish meal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me provide some insights on the partnership between the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture  and  FMIB  and  its  challenges.    All  meat  inspection  services  at  both  the  abattoirs  are 
<br/>provided by the Ministry of Agriculture Meat Inspectors.  From 2015, the Ministry and FMIB have 
<br/>worked together in disposing and compensating for tuberculosis and brucellosis infected animals.  
<br/>The  Ministry  further  collaborated  with  FMIB  to  ensure  that  productive  female  cattle  were  not 
<br/>slaughtered.  They have continued to work together on meat surveillance to ensure that all animals 
<br/>slaughtered for sale are safe for human consumption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, I want to inform Parliament that we have extended these services out from the 
<br/>abattoirs to special gatherings and events such as funerals, religious festivities, </span><span>qurbani</span><span> and the recent 
<br/>chiefly installation on Bau Island, our meat inspectors were active right throughout the function. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through its Assistance Programme in the Livestock Sector, the Ministry ensured linking up 
<br/>of small holder farmers to formal markets, for example, the Goat Partnership Programme and the 
<br/>Beef Development Programme.  In terms of the challenges, the Meat Industry Act 1969 is way too 
<br/>old and needs to be reviewed.  The slaughter fees are outdated and was last reviewed in 2005.  There 
<br/>has been low throughput and only two days of slaughter per week with barely enough to cover the 
<br/>operational cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the location of the Nasinu Abattoir, it is situated in a highly populated residential 
<br/>area and central business district.  If you look around the surroundings of where the abattoir is located, 
<br/>Sir, the landscape has changed so much over the years.  It is now becoming a commercial centre. I 
<br/>have told the Chief Executive Officer of FMIB that he needs to start looking for somewhere to move 
<br/>because sooner or later we will be told to move. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of illegal slaughtering, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in fees and charges may have 
<br/>a negative effect of increasing illegal slaughtering but the Ministry officials are prepared to work 
<br/>around the clock on supervising.  The cost of operations at the abattoir has been increasing over the 
<br/>years.  Due to the degradation of the abattoir and equipment, there also has been a high staff turnover. 
<br/>Most of the workers from the abattoir, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have left for the Pacific Labour Scheme to 
<br/>work in the Australian meat works industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms  of  cattle supply, the main source of beef supply to the abattoir is from  the dairy 
<br/>sector.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  your  information,  those  cattle  that  suffer  from  tuberculosis  and 
<br/></span><span>brucellosis, at one year they can still be slaughtered and safe for consumption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of cattle that come from Vanu Levu, a good number of cattle comes from Vanua 
<br/>Levu and I know there are a lot of Vanua Levu associated parliamentarians here.  However, the cost 
<br/>of bringing the cattle over to Viti Levu to be slaughtered in the abattoir is a disincentive to Vanua 
<br/>Levu farmers and it is all the more reason to review the Fiji Meat Act 1969 to allow for the setting 
<br/>up of an abattoir in Vanua Levu.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FMIB 2015-2017 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  opportunities  in  capital  production,  the  opportunity  is  in 
<br/>intensive cattle rearing.  This is where you rear cattle in a controlled environment and use silage and 
<br/>other forms of feed to feed cattle without the cattle running around or in open pasture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry had embarked on an Embryo Transfer Programme back in 2017 as alluded to 
<br/>by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. I was the unfortunate one sent to Rockhampton to do 
<br/>the selection. We came back with four breeds of cattle, in fact, one of them is the most expensive 
<br/>beef in the world which is wagyu. To-date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have nine wagyu calves that are in 
<br/>Koronivia and are now around three months old.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other breeds, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are Droughtmaster, Senepol and one beef and dairy breed 
<br/>which  is  the  Brown  Swiss.  We  made  the  selection  of  this  breed  because  we  visited  a  farm  in 
<br/>Rockhampton where the farmer changed his whole herd of about a thousand cattle to Brown Swiss.  
<br/>We were convinced there and then that this breed should be good enough for Fiji because the weather 
<br/>in Rockhampton is just like Fiji.  For wagyu, we were fortunate because there were only two </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>members of the team and the rest of the team were all Hindus, so we managed to eat all the beef 
<br/>BBQ.  We told them that if they eat BBQ, we would tell their parents in Fiji.  Sorry, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>that is just a joke. The wagyu steak virtually melts in your mouth.  It has got that marbling rate which 
<br/>is the highest for any cattle in the world and we have that here now in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I wish to highlight the following. In order to address the supply 
<br/>of throughput issues, the Ministry of Agriculture has been working with the farmers at farm gate as 
<br/>well as those throughout the value chain.  Over the years we have seen a rise in illegal slaughter and 
<br/>sale of meat and the Ministry has been working with the Ministry of Health, Biosecurity of Fiji and 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force in raising awareness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the current financial year the Ministry and FMIB will work together with the Office 
<br/>of the Solicitor-General to start the review process of the Meat Act 1969 and a draft review shall be 
<br/>taken for public consultations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry of Agriculture has provided FMIB a capital grant of over $380,000 
<br/>in  the  2020-2021  Budget,  $400,000  in  the  2021-2022  Budget  and  the  2022/2023  Budgets 
<br/>respectively.  The funds have been used to  upgrade the Nasinu  and Vuda Abattoirs to  ensure the 
<br/>facilities are certified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  will  continue  to  assist  in  providing  strategic  direction  and 
<br/>support to FMIB in leveraging the standard of meat that are internationally benchmarked for safety, 
<br/>hygiene and quality.  Therefore, I am in support of the review Report before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution will be very short and I will speak 
<br/>on the subject through the lenses of tourism.  We have a very vibrant tourism industry and, in a year 
<br/>or two, we will be hosting or welcoming about 1.2 million visitors to the country.  The tragedy here 
<br/>is that we will be importing all the beef to feed our tourists.  We talk about the high leakage factor in 
<br/>tourism  and  that  is  something  that  challenges  us  to  ensure  that  the  tourism  dollar  remains  in  the 
<br/>country and that the leakage is reduced.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an example of the leakage we have 
<br/></span><span>in tourism through the importation of beef.  I am heartened about what I hear today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was part of the Economic Affairs Committee who put this report together and it was sad that 
<br/>we saw the reduction in livestock in this country over a period of 10 years or so.  We must do what 
<br/>we can to rebuild the stock in this country of the quality that meets the expectations of our tourists. I 
<br/>liked what the honourable Minister for Agriculture said, the steak that melts in your mouth is possible 
<br/>for Fiji.  That is what we want.  We have tried some models and we should apply ourselves in this  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some years ago I spoke about Vanuatu.  They were able to export beef to Japan.  If you know 
<br/>the Japanese, they are very discerning consumers for them to buy beef.  You heard about Kobe beef, 
<br/>one of the best in the world.  So to export beef to Japan is quite something and the Vanuatu people 
<br/>did it.  I do not know what model they used, but that is our very close neighbour.  If they can do it,  
<br/>we should also be able to do it and meet the needs of our tourism industry.  That is all that I want to 
<br/>contribute to today, speaking of the lenses of tourism.  It is very urgent, we must apply ourselves to 
<br/>ensure that we can produce beef of the quantity and the quality that meets the needs of the tourism 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion. I would 
<br/>like to thank our Chairman, honourable Vijay Nath, who was instrumental in this Report.  But as I 
<br/>contribute today, I am just contemplating in the last few days of Parliament, not only this one, but in 
<br/>the last session, I do not know whether others are also thinking of what I am thinking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Just hearing what the Opposition is saying, it sems like they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are still in Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Talk on the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Think about the cattles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Yes, I am getting to that end.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very concerned about them because it is like they are in a psychological stalemate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other concern is, we can also think as Ministers about what we will do in our ministries.  
<br/>So, there is no need for you to regurgitate - keep on revegetating what we have done and what we 
<br/>need to do.  If you focus maybe on your role as Opposition, that will be great and we will focus on 
<br/>our role as Ministers.  After a month, we can see what is there and we know what to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Koya.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Standing  Order  60.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  on  this  side  of  Parliament 
<br/>thought there was only one meanderer, now we have found another one.  Please, relevance, if we are 
<br/>praising a report, what is the problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Just listen!.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I think you also need to keep quiet for a change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please ask them to stay relevant. There is a reason why the Standing Orders 
<br/>are there, and that relevance provision  is  there.  Please, stick to it, be relevant  and talk about  the 
<br/>report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is related to the report because … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… as I stated, we are going back and forth.  So let me emphasise the Opposition’s role, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know it very well, I was in the Opposition for four years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know what the role is.  I was there with honourable Mosese Bulitavu.  He was one of my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>key colleagues and we used to conspire together on the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- His seen the light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  The  reason  I  am  saying  this  is  because  they  have  always 
<br/>expressed the view that Fiji must be like Singapore.  But where is it today, what happened?  One of 
<br/>the big Singapore dreams was the direct  route from Suva to Nadi across the mountains, and they 
<br/>quoted the wrong figure of $2 billion when it should be $12 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the report itself, it is another delayed annual report.  If you look at it, it is 2017, and we 
<br/>asked the CEO what was the reason and what he explained was there was a change in leadership and 
<br/>due to lack of proper handover records.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- If you just hold on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  expressing  what  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  honourable  Minister  had 
<br/>mentioned.  The Meat Act, of course, that is overdue for review.  If you look at the functions, it is 
<br/>quite  wide  ranging.    For  example,  take  steps  deemed  desirable  for  protection,  preservation  and 
<br/>expansion of the meat industry.  It can operate as it is going to retail, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Committee’s recommendations, our colleagues have mentioned the Strategic 
<br/>Plan. I believe that that is ready.  However, I would like to stress that the profit was realised mainly 
<br/>through the sale of the land on which they are sitting on to the Fiji Police Force.  We have expressed 
<br/>and also the Opposition side on the numbers.  Cattle slaughter numbers and the weight and that has 
<br/>been decreasing from 2000 to 2017 as expressed there - from 10,779 to 8,381.  We understand other 
<br/></span><span>sectors have grown as a percentage of GDP, but agriculture has not really grown.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, talking about livestock, I recall in the FijiFirst campaign during their term, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their leader was supposed to present 100 horses to Navosa.  Unfortunately, this did not happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  We are talking cattle here.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>847 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  It  is  a  concern  regarding  the  people  of  Navosa,  so  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister  for Agriculture is working on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You should be talking on cattle, now you have gone to the horses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is part of livestock, that is livestock, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because it was also dealt with by the former Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Mahendra Reddy.  
<br/>He  presented  during  the  campaign  a  horse  which  was  confiscated  by  the  roadside  to  a  village  in 
<br/>Nadroga and that was in the papers.  I think at that function honourable Bala was also there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He was presenting as usual knives, forks, weed killers, et cetera to the youths.  I commend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you, honourable Bala, I mean it is a simple vote buying exercise my friend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable V. Naupoto interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is another important information in the 
<br/>Report which has not been mentioned that the Fiji Meat Industry Board owns land in Wainibuka, 
<br/>Naitasiri and in Naciriyawa, Vuda, Ba.  The explanation on that was that they use for the cattle to be 
<br/>herded before they are slaughtered (brought to Suva or Vuda for slaughtering).  We had requested 
<br/>that they reassess the use of this land as it is currently underutilized and maybe it could be used for 
<br/>more commercially viable alternatives.  With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Chairman 
<br/>and the members of the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament for their contribution and input into the report.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the inherent problem in the industry is the declining livestock numbers and that has been brought up 
<br/>in a number of contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  recognise  the  huge  potential  of  livestock  in  this  country 
<br/>particularly in terms of addressing food security.  We have to look at innovative ways of how we can 
<br/>develop and increase the livestock numbers, and of course the livestock enhanced the industry in the 
<br/>long  term.    There  are  some  innovative  ways  that  has  been  brought  up  by  some  of  the  Members 
<br/>particularly relating to setting up of an abattoir in Vanua Levu, the new breeds and amending the 
<br/>current Act that is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the former Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs for their contribution and also the current Members of the Economic Affairs for 
<br/>their input into the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
