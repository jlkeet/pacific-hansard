<div><span>Review Report - Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased  to  submit  to  Parliament  the  Review  Report  of  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer 
<br/>Commission (FCCC) 2018-2019 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is aware of the significant role played by FCCC in ensuring that consumers 
<br/>in Fiji are protected from unfair and unethical market practices.  It works with the vision to create a 
<br/></span><span>dynamic and competitive market in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was pleased to note the array of information that was available in the 2018-
<br/>2019  Annual  Report  which  helped  during  deliberations.    Sir,  FCCC  had  submitted  a  written 
<br/>submission which provided the Committee with a better understanding of the operations during the 
<br/>period under review.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While reading through the analysis that was provided by FCCC, the Committee noted that a 
<br/>number of rental complaints increased by 58 percent and recommended that further consultations are 
<br/>held  with  all stakeholders.   It  further noted that the three worst  industries in  terms  of  complaints 
<br/>received included automotive, construction and white goods with automotive comprising 57 percent 
<br/>and made recommendations on the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further  to  this,  the  Committee  noted  that  petroleum  and  LPG  prices  comprised  a  major 
<br/>component of not only cost of business and households but also a key factor in national economic 
<br/>performance.   It further  noted that the review based on submissions and analysis had aligned the 
<br/>regulatory  pricing  for  petroleum  products  from  quarterly  to  monthly  mechanism  with  the  aim  to 
<br/>ensure that the volatility of petroleum prices at world market gets reflected in a shorter span of time.  
<br/>The Committee commended FCCC for the successful implementation of this change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2018-2019 period was when the FCCC had launched its five-year Strategic Plan which 
<br/>was from 2018-2023.  Given the important roles played by FCCC, the Committee looks forward to 
<br/>future reporting against its yearly Business Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the former Committee Members who were part of the team that produced 
<br/>the  Report.  I  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge  the  current  Members  of  the  Committee  - 
<br/>honourable Sashi Kiran, honourable Tomasi N. Tuinabuna, honourable Semi T. Koroilavesau and 
<br/>honourable Premila D. Kumar for their contributions towards the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the 
<br/>Review  of  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  2018-2019  Annual  Report  to 
<br/>Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I am pleased to present the 
<br/>Report  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  on  the  annual  review  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations Annual Report 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2016 - 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament to review the Annual Report and report back on its findings.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  will  emphasise  and  clarify  the  work  done  by  the  previous 
<br/>Committee  in  reviewing  and  highlighting  the  contents  of  the  annual  reports  and  make 
<br/>recommendations on the anomalies noted in the Report. It will also highlight the discussions held by 
<br/>the Committee with the Ministry in relation to the issues noted from their Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the period under review, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity 
<br/>and  Industrial  Relations  continued  to  support  workplaces  to  become  compliant,  productive  and 
<br/>inclusive,  in  response  to  important  legislative  changes,  complex  issues  and  growing  community 
<br/>expectations. The Ministry’s internal  processes were changed and upgraded for re-certification to 
<br/>ISO 9001:2015 international standards in growing an efficient and effective work culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry significantly expanded its service offerings through the launch of its Customer 
<br/>Service  Centre,  ensuring  that  more  workers  and  businesses  understood  their  entitlements  and 
<br/>obligations.  There  was  also  easier  access  of  services  for  the  general  public  as  well  as  the 
<br/>implementation of Fiji’s first-ever National Employment Policy aimed at reducing unemployment.  
<br/>It also continued to work with its tripartite partners and strived to find the best ways to achieve decent 
<br/>work and employment growth in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to acknowledge the Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in 
<br/>the last term of Parliament under the able leadership of the honourable Pillay and all their hard work 
<br/>and input which has greatly assisted our Committee in completing this Report.  I would also like to 
<br/>thank the honourable Members of the current Standing Committee on Social Affairs and wish them 
<br/>well in their Committee deliberations in this new term of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also extend my gratitude to the former Permanent Secretary of the Ministry 
<br/>of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, Mr. Osea Cawaru, and his staff for all their 
<br/>assistance in this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all Members of Parliament to take note of the Report.

<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Consolidated Review Report of PAFCO 2018 and 2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of PAFCO 2018 and 2019 Annual 
<br/>Reports.  Sir, PAFCO is one of the largest fish processing companies in the Pacific Region. It is the

<div><span>        Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>795 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>largest employer in Levuka and immensely contributes to the economic activity on the island. The 
<br/>years 2018 and 2019 were filled with its own unique opportunities and challenges for the company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018, PAFCO achieved a milestone when the honourable Prime Minister of Fiji visited the 
<br/>factory to officially open the new cold storage facility. During the year, PAFCO continued its efforts 
<br/>to  upgrade  its  infrastructure,  plants  and  equipment.    However,  the  company  faced  significant 
<br/>challenges during 2018 and 2019 due to inconsistent supply of albacore tuna. This led to the factory 
<br/>aligning its processing operations throughout to adjust to the incoming fish stock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While deliberating on the Report, the Committee noted that one of the  causes of the $3.2 
<br/>million  loss  in  2019  was  due  to  the  low  supply  of  tuna.  Apart  from  the  20,000  metric  tonnes  of 
<br/>albacore  supplied  by  Bumblebee,  the  Committee  recommended  for  PAFCO  to  explore  engaging 
<br/>other suppliers under strict contractual terms to ensure consistency in supply of tuna and to ultimately 
<br/>optimise the plant's productive capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee also noted the need for the company to have a comprehensively documented 
<br/>Risk Management Policy for high-risk areas that are not covered.  Given the two years of consecutive 
<br/>losses  from  2018  to  2019,  the  Committee  recommended  an  overall  organisational  review  be 
<br/>conducted to assess both short term and long-term strategic issues and determine future directions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that during the year 2019, the company recruited five graduate cadets 
<br/>in the Quality Control and Production Departments and an accountant. It also celebrated the success 
<br/>of  PAFCO’s  Apprenticeship  Programme.    Five  apprentices  successfully  completed  their  4-year 
<br/>programmes  and  one  was  a  Runner-Up  in  the  Apprentice  of  the  Year  Award  given  by  the  Fiji 
<br/>National University. The Committee commends such initiatives and encourages PAFCO to continue 
<br/>its effort in upgrading the skills of their workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  would  like  to  thank  the  former  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced  this  Report.  I  also  take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge  the  current  members  of  the 
<br/>Committee  -  honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  honourable  Tomasi  N.  Tunabuna,  honourable  Semi  T. 
<br/>Koroilavesau and honourable Premila D. Kumar for their contribution towards the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs,  I  commend  the  Consolidated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the PAFCO 2018 and 2019 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
