<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - WATER AUTHORITY OF FIJI 2017 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of the Water Authority of Fiji 2017 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was tabled on 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  TUIWAILEVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and Members of Parliament, on 
<br/>behalf  of  the  former  and  current  honourable  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Natural 
<br/>Resources, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion in regard to the Committee’s Report on</span><span> </span><span>the 
<br/>2017 Annual Review of the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) which was tabled in Parliament by the 
<br/>former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Sanjay Kirpal, on Wednesday, 31</span><span>st</span><span> August 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WAF is a Commercial Statutory Authority (CSA) that was formed by the Government 
<br/>of Fiji under the WAF Promulgation 2007 to provide environmentally sound, sustainable, efficient, 
<br/>and effective water and wastewater services. The WAF has continued to deliver its core responsibility 
<br/>of providing clean, safe, reliable water to all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  commends  the  WAF  for  the  significant  achievement  highlighted  in  2017 
<br/>despite the challenges faced, that is, the aftermath of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  In its review, the WAF continued 
<br/>to drive towards service excellence in delivering clean water and sanitation for all Fijians embedded 
<br/>in  its  Strategic  Plan  2017  -  2019.    In  addition,  WAF  continued  to  build  on  the  knowledge  of  its 
<br/>employees from time to time with the present experience, in line with the Fijian Government’s goals 
<br/>to pave the way for the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the highlights of WAF in 2017 was the achievement of SDG6 which states “access to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clean and safe water in adequate quantities to urban, rural and maritime populations.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends the Authority for its achievements and initiatives in the 2017 fiscal 
<br/>year.    Furthermore,  under  the  2017  budget,  one  of  the  highlights  of  the  WAF,  the  government 
<br/>continued funding on three free initiatives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Free Water Allowance for households with incomes under $30,000, Rainwater Harvesting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Free Water tanks for intermittent supply areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Free Water Allowance Under this scheme, customers are provided with 91,250 litres of 
<br/>water free annually. Customers that exceed this amount will have to pay for their extra 
<br/>usage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Free Water Tanks distribution is mostly distributed to rural and intermittent supply areas. 
<br/>Key requirements for the household applying is to build a water tank base and have roof 
<br/>guttering in place to meet the criteria for approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  bipartisan  Committee  Report  examines,  compares  and  analyses  the 
<br/>performance  of  the  Water  Authority  administration,  legislation,  organisational  structure,  financial 
<br/>management, functions and programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee,  following  its  scrutiny  of  the  Annual  Reports,  made  the  following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>727 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee recommends that WAF provides timely submission of annual reports to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee recommends that WAF adheres to the 2020 - 2025 Strategic Plan. 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Government to consider decreasing duty and taxation on imports of machines used in 
<br/>quick fix and waste management, that is, pulverizes, mulchers, compactors, crushers, 
<br/>shredders and extruders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Ensure stakeholders involve enforcement officers to monitor trade waste intrusion into 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>waterways particularly in industrial areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The WAF to provide a gender breakdown in its future annual report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Committee was satisfied with the performance of the WAF in 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor, I wish to inform you  that I have a list provided by the Whips of the Opposition 
<br/>and the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament.  There are seven speakers and the order 
<br/>is as folloed: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable J. Usamate; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable R.R. Sharma; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A. Bia: 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises, and Communications; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to talk on this motion. 
<br/>I would like to congratulate the Standing Committee on Natural Resources those that were initially 
<br/>part of the development  of the Report and the Committee that  has  now taken over in  putting  the 
<br/>Report together on Water Authority of Fiji (WAF).  As we get to this year, Sir, this year will be the 
<br/>13</span><span>th</span><span> year, if I am not mistaken over the Water Authority of Fiji having been in place, as a solution 
<br/>that was put in place to try to strengthen the distribution of clean and safe water and to deal with 
<br/>sanitation issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Report has highlighted, it has had two development Strategic Development Plans, the 
<br/>one from 2017 and we have heard of the one that has now been in place from 2022 to 2025. Now the 
<br/>recent discussions that have taken place on the 2050 Plan. So, it looks like that the Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji as has been mentioned in Parliament, the kind of issues that they need to address are big issues 
<br/>that they need to prepare over a significant portion of time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at some of the major highlights of the plan, WAF launching its new plan and as I 
<br/>have mentioned, they also have a new 2022 to 2025 Strategic Development Plan. I was very glad to 
<br/>see the money that WAF was able to get from the ADB for the work that it has done on Greenhouse 
<br/>Gas Reduction. This is an issue that has been discussed at great length in the past, there has been talk 
<br/>about getting electricity out of that methane out of Kinoya.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be interesting to learn from the honourable Minister later on today whether there 
<br/></span><span>have been any more plans on taking that forward to the next step.  I think it will be to our benefit if 
<br/></span><span>those greenhouse gas emissions that are going out into the atmosphere in Kinoya and other places 
<br/>can be turned and used in a manner that is useful for everyone in this country, and at the same time 
<br/>reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noticed with pleasure the awards that was given to WAF for the 2017 Global Water 
<br/>Awards for its Water Champion Programme that I think has had a powerful impact on this country, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in telling people about the importance of using water well, conservation of water and teaching our 
<br/>students in schools.  I think that might be partially responsible for some of the trends that we have 
<br/>seen that the average water usage of individuals has declined slightly over the years as people have 
<br/>become a bit more used to dealing with water well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF has been highlighted in the Report as the first water utility in the Asia Pacific region 
<br/>to pilot the Aqua Rating; a utility benchmarking tool.  I think this has been a very good development 
<br/>because  if  you  are  going  to  look  at  things  like  production  of  water,  you  cannot  just  look  at  the 
<br/>technical  issues.    You  have  to  look  at  the  whole  kind  of  things  that  are  covered  in  these  sort  of 
<br/>analysis;  change  management,  strategic  planning,  innovation,  knowledge  management  and 
<br/>continuous improvement because as they keep on dealing with problems, they want to learn from 
<br/>them,  change  the  way  that  they  do  things  so  that  they  can  keep  improving  for  the  benefit  of  our 
<br/>people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  just  like  to  speak  very  briefly  to  the  submissions  to  the  recommendation.    It  is 
<br/>recommended timely submission of annual reports.  I noticed from their website that the 2018-2019 
<br/>Annual  Reports  were supposed to  have been  available around this time,  hopefully we can get an 
<br/>update from the honourable Minister on when those might be coming up to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the second recommendation, this is one recommendation that I would like to spend a bit of 
<br/>time on.  It suggests that the WAF adhere to the 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, but during this past week, 
<br/>we have heard about the 2050 strategy.  I also mentioned earlier this morning that in either September 
<br/>or  October  last  year,  there  was  also  an  analysis  done  by  Pacific  Regional  Infrastructure  Facility 
<br/>(PRIF) looking at all the member utilities of the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That particular report was presented at the Pacific Water and Wastewater Forum (WWA) held 
<br/>in Denarau towards the end of last year, and it looked at how well our utility is doing vis-à-vis other 
<br/>utilities around the world.  As a result of that, the outcome of that particular report was an action plan 
<br/>on SDG6 which is on Water.  I am also interested to hear what the progress has been, how the WAF 
<br/>is thinking about incorporating the findings of that assessment into their existing strategic plan or 
<br/>annual operational plans that they might have right now, moving forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  interesting  things  that  came  out  at  the  Pacific  WWA  Report,  as  I  mentioned 
<br/>earlier,  one  of  the  challenges  that  this  greater  Suva  area  faces  is  that  every  year,  the  number  of 
<br/>consumers increases by 2.5 percent.  That has been true from the period 2012 to 2019 or to 2020.  
<br/>That  means  your  infrastructure  is  the  same,  but  the  number  of  people  is  increasing.    That  is  a 
<br/>reflection probably of two things in this urban area – the continuing rural to urban migration drift 
<br/>which happened years ago, but it is still occurring now.  It might also be a reflection of the changing 
<br/>of our city boundaries which means that more people are coming to the urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we know, a lot of people in our urban areas are in informal settlements.  Normally, WAF 
<br/>gives water to places where you have ownership of that land, but there are special provisions that 
<br/>they make for these informal settlements.  That is going to be a challenge for us.  We know now at 
<br/>the moment that not all of our households are able to receive 24/7 water supply and there are areas 
<br/>that receive considerably less than that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2013, WAF had actually identified 68 areas with intermittent supply.  That means they get 
<br/>water sometimes, other times they do not get it.  At the moment for me in Nakasi, for the past three 
<br/>weeks or so,  we have had intermittent  water supply, so WAF had identified these areas and then 
<br/>started trying to address these intermittent water supply areas so that they could be improved.  That 
<br/>was reduced to 50 in 2014 and around 23 areas in 2015.  In 2016, the number has gone down and we 
<br/>look forward to hearing from the honourable Minister how they intend to be able to continue to drive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>729 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down the number of areas that have those intermittent water supplies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things that the report noted was that it has become noticeable in the continuity 
<br/>of supply, which has increased from an average of 20 to 22 hours per day.  There are 24 hours per 
<br/>day but on average people are getting water in these areas up to 22 hours per day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are still challenges in terms of water quality.  It has improved over the 
<br/>years from 2012 going up to the recent parts and I think up to 2020, compliance had gone up to 93 
<br/>percent.  There are still some issues that we need to improve on.  We understand that WAF is very 
<br/>closely  monitoring  the  performance  on  this  indicator  on  the  various  regions,  and  we  hope  that 
<br/>eventually we will get to the 100 percent benchmark that we need for all the people that we have in 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the challenges also has been faced in WAF is faced by a lot of other utilities are the 
<br/>number of complaints that are received and the percentage at which complaints are resolved.  The 
<br/>number of complaints as a percentage of total number of connections has continued to increase over 
<br/>the years.  Part of this might be due to the fact that now WAF has a 24/7 call centre.  When you have 
<br/>a 24/7 call centre, there is a likelihood that you get more complaints, so you might be getting a more 
<br/>accurate read of the number of complaints that we have.  We know that WAF’s policy is to respond 
<br/>to each complaint within 72 hours, so we hope and look forward to that continuing to improve into 
<br/>the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One major issue that has always been a challenge for WAF is non-revenue water.  That is 
<br/>water that WAF produces but which they do not collect revenue on.  It has been a challenge over the 
<br/>years, I remember when I first had the opportunity to take up the role of Minister for Infrastructure, 
<br/>it had come down to around 27 percent.  Now, I think it is hovering at around 50 percent, there are a 
<br/>lot of complex issues that affects non-revenue water. When you have a lot of firefighting to do, you 
<br/>move people away from dealing with the non-revenue water and you focus them on the problems of 
<br/>today, so being able to manage the problems of today with the more larger size problems that you 
<br/>have for non-revenue water, that becomes an issue that needs to be balanced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But it is something that needs to be done; non-revenue water must go down.  If you are able 
<br/>to  reduce  non-revenue  water,  then  there  will  be  automatically  enough  water  in  the  system  for 
<br/>everyone to be able to drink.  I think probably at the moment, non-revenue water is sitting at around 
<br/>49 percent and that is something that we hope will go down in the future, and it needs to go down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF provides a reasonable level of service but is not yet able to provide the service level 
<br/>of targets stated in its customer charter.  This is something that WAF has been working on over the 
<br/>years, it has been improving  on, but  it is  still something  that needs to  be addressed into the near 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the big challenges that will be with us into the future is the number 
<br/>of people that we have in our urban areas.  It is good that Viria is coming online, eventually it will 
<br/>resolve a lot of these issues, but nevertheless it will be something that we still have to keep a watch 
<br/>on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 is for Government to consider decreasing duty and taxation on imports 
<br/>of  machines  used  in  quick  fix  and  waste  management,  that  is,  pulverizes,  mulchers,  compactors, 
<br/>crushers, shredders and extruders.  I think that is something that the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>will be looking at in terms of his fiscal review strategy that unfortunately, not too many people have 
<br/>been attending the meetings, but hopefully they will be able to address those into the future.

<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For number four, it talks about another serious problem in WAF, and this is the monitoring 
<br/>trade waste intrusion into the waterways.  A lot of stuff that is coming into the sewerage system are 
<br/>not supposed to be there, so that has been a major challenge.  I know that WAF are doing the smoke 
<br/>test and I had actually participated in some of these to try to get rid of all the illegal things that are 
<br/>coming into the sewerage systems of WAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think they now have some teeth where they can go after people, but we encourage everyone 
<br/>in Fiji to make sure that the stuff that you put into your wastewater or sewer are the stuff that are 
<br/>supposed to be there and not anything else, not stormwater, not waste from factories, not waste from 
<br/>commercial entities.  It needs to be the right stuff because if you get the wrong stuff in the sewerage 
<br/>areas, then we get poor processing of water, your electricity bills go up because your machines have 
<br/>to work harder, and it is a cost on WAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the biggest problems with WAF at the moment unlike EFL which is completely self-
<br/>financing, WAF relies on the Government of Fiji.  It is possible to build WAF to a level way where 
<br/>it can be self- financing. This is one of the things that we have been able to do for EFL, which can 
<br/>go out on its own and borrow money; WAF is still not in that position.  Those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are 
<br/>some of the things that I wanted to share some comments on in relation to this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the  review 
<br/>Report  of  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  2017  Annual  Report.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Members of this Committee for compiling this Report.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, water is a necessity for life 
<br/>on earth but there is not enough water for everyone while our planet has 70 percent of water available, 
<br/>90 percent is salty, 2 percent is frozen, and 1 percent is available for drinking water.  Today, more 
<br/>than over 800 million people do not have access to clean drinking water. As populations increase, 
<br/>the need for clean drinking water increases as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rural urban drift is a complex and multifaceted phenomena that is shaped by a wide range 
<br/>of economic, social and environmental factors.  In the Central Division, we have seen the prolific 
<br/>increase  in  population  by  2.5  percent  and  this  has  caused  a  huge  demand  for  basic  necessities, 
<br/>resources, goods and services, in particular the need for continuous water supply to every household.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government realised the growing challenges linked to degraded water, related 
<br/>ecosystems, water stress, water scarcity and damaged pipelines caused by external factors which has 
<br/>been  further  exacerbated  by  climate  change.  But  as  water  stress  exacerbated,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  had  to  ensure  that  water  was  provided  by  the  cartage  services,  water  tanks  were 
<br/>distributed, and prior notice was given for water disruptions.  I would like to sincerely thank the staff 
<br/>of Water Authority of Fiji for the commendable efforts and years of dedication in their service to the 
<br/>people of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initiation of the  Viria  Water Project  is a key  achievement under the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government’s  leadership.  The  project  is  forecasted  to  benefit  about  300,000  to  360,000 
<br/>Fijians.  The project is mid-way through completion and the plans are to increase water services to 
<br/>villages along the Rewa pipeline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  key  targets  are  to  achieve  equitable  access  to  safe  and  affordable  drinking  water  to 
<br/></span><span>achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene, paying special attention to the needs 
<br/>of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.  Now, we and the people of the Suva and 
<br/>Nausori corridor have high hopes with the Coalition Government for the completion of this project 
<br/>and this will benefit almost one-third of our population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, something I would urge the people of this nation is to practice  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>731 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>self-sustainability in terms of water collection and storage.  Rainwater harvesting has been practiced 
<br/>for thousands of years and it is an effective and sustainable way to manage the water supply and 
<br/>demand and it can have many positive impacts on both the environment and people’s lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while the honourable Minister for Public Works has expressed his ambitious 
<br/>plans, I would like to share with him the voices and concerns of our Fijian citizens in regard to water 
<br/>shortages and uninformed water disruption notices from yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Josephine from Lautoka said, “In the Kashmir area, Lautoka we have not 
<br/>had water since Saturday morning till now” and that was Sunday.  Shania from 8 miles said, “Usually 
<br/>water cuts off at 9.00 p.m. but today it was at 5.00 p.m.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shaneel from Nausori said, “The water trucks come to people who they know, if we request 
<br/>for water, they say that not much water is left.  My neighbour has a water tank, they repeatedly called 
<br/>them to fill their tank but it has not come for more than two weeks.”   This is something that the 
<br/>honourable Minister can look into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what’s really funny that this  Coalition Government  calls themselves the 
<br/>“People’s Government.”  Where  were the people when they held  their  Fiscal  Review Committee 
<br/>Consultations?  There were five, 10 – we have a population of over 800,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Tell them, tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the Coalition Government is attending to fix 
<br/>these delays, there are many delays because a lot of promises were made, or whether there is delay 
<br/>in paying the TELS loans and telling the tertiary students we did it, or whether there is the delay of 
<br/>fixing the roads and its maintenance or whether the delay of responding to water shortages to  at least 
<br/>tell the team to give prior notice to the people of this country so they can prepare. The Coalition 
<br/>Government, the people of this country are waiting upon you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the review of the 
<br/>Water Authority of Fiji 2017 Annual Report.  The Committee noted that the Authority continues to 
<br/>show commitment in growth in providing all Fijians access to better and efficiency in delivery as per 
<br/>SDG6 – Clean Water and Sanitation. Overall, the performance of the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) 
<br/>during the period under review was very satisfactory despite the existing aged underground pipes 
<br/>and infrastructure and the fluctuating system pressure throughout the network. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the previous Members of the Committee proceeded with its deliberation on 
<br/>the Water Authority of Fiji 2017 Annual Report and collected written evidence from the Authority.  
<br/>The evidence collected were written responses from the WAF and in response to the written questions 
<br/>put forth by the Committee Members.  Pertinent questions on issues relating to the operations of the 
<br/>Authority in 2017 were raised by the Committee Members which were then collated as Committee 
<br/>Findings to be presented to Parliament for enactment.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee is very grateful to WAF for undertaking an approach to build 
<br/></span><span>up on the future of employee knowledge over time together with the Fijian Government’s goal to 
<br/></span><span>pave  the  way  for  the  future.    The  drive  towards  service  excellence  in  delivering  clean  water  and 
<br/>sanitation for all Fijians is the central guiding theme of the Strategic Plan 2017-2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me dwell on some of the key findings of the report which are as follows:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2017,  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  launched  its  Strategic  Plan  2017-2019.  However,  the 
<br/>Committee noted that Water Authority of Fiji has its new Strategic Plan for 2020-2025. 
<br/>There is a need for mechanisation to enhance service delivery. Water Authority of Fiji to 
<br/>consider purchasing their own machinery, for quick fix and waste management.  
<br/>The Water Authority of Fiji focus on liquid trade waste that has been raised on awareness 
<br/>and provide advice to ensure that businesses are aware of these business obligations. 
<br/>The Committee noted that there was no gender breakdown provided in the 2017 Annual 
<br/>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very encouraging to note that WAF is using all its available resources 
<br/>to  ensure that all the issues highlighted in  the  findings  are adequately attended and appropriately 
<br/>addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the Committee’s recommendations is for the Government to consider 
<br/>decreasing duty and taxation on imports of machines used in quick fix and waste management, that 
<br/>is, pulverises, mulchers, compactors, crushers, shredders and extruders. This will not only help WAF 
<br/>to fix the ageing infrastructure, but to minimise the frequent water cuts we have been experiencing 
<br/>for some time now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the 
<br/>staff  of  WAF  in  all  the  Divisions  for  the  enormous  work  been  done  under  pressure  to  meet  the 
<br/>demands of our citizens on a daily basis.  I fully support the motion before the Chambers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution on the Report that is before 
<br/>Parliament.  At this juncture, I would like to extend my congratulations also and I think it is fitting 
<br/>that Parliament offer their congratulations to the Fijiana Team and Fijian Drua for their last week.  
<br/>What a display of brilliance and flare.  It brought smiles to all the people of Fiji and Fijians around 
<br/>the globe.  Also, to the Fijiana and Fijian 7s Team, last night, I believe some were disappointed, but 
<br/>we hope that they will be able to regroup this weekend and come out strong again for the people of 
<br/>Fiji.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to also take this time to thank the previous Committee and the current Committee 
<br/>Members for a thorough and more detailed Report that is offered in Parliament today.  According to 
<br/>the Report, the period under review was satisfactory, despite the existing aged underground pipes 
<br/>and infrastructure with the fluctuating system pressure throughout the network, and that was also 
<br/>evident in the way the former Chairman, honourable Kirpal, offered a statement in their Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the major highlights and achievements that have shown in the Report, a 
<br/>notable  one  was  the  fact  that  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (WAF)  is  the  first  water  utility  in  the  Asia 
<br/>Pacific Region to pilot the aqua rating.  This was really beneficial because this tool helps WAF to 
<br/>assess how it is performing across all its operational areas with the results benchmarked against other 
<br/>utilities that are in the aqua rating system.  So, somehow, it offers a good picture of where the service 
<br/>that has been provided by WAF in the years that is under the review in the Report is   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water  cut  is  a  major  problem  in  our  communities  and  in  our  everyday  life.    I  thank  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister, who has made his  earlier Ministerial Statement this morning, as well as the 
<br/></span><span>reply from this side of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just my observation so far, if we continue with this basic necessity need that 
<br/>is out there, it is an  everyday occurrence, if we continue to come and pinpoint what we have done 
<br/>and  the  loopholes  that  have  occurred  for  the  past  16  years,  I  wanted  to  say  that  we  will  not  be 
<br/>determined or the way we see our leadership, according to what had happened in the past.  What we

<div><span>         Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>733 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can do is, what we will be remembered after our service in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Minister responsible on the other side and just a suggestion, building 
<br/>community capacity of how we can support ourselves and at the same time, wait for Government to 
<br/>find permanent solutions of how we can solve water issues.  It is an occurrence everyday and we 
<br/>cannot  afford to  continue to  implement  projects  and ideas  that will take  years to  complete,  when 
<br/>people do suffer on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an idea and an observation that has come to mind and one of the innovative 
<br/>ways of addressing water issues within our communities, without much cost, is a scenario just like 
<br/>the NDMO.  They have evacuation centres organised throughout the country, and an idea that has 
<br/>come to my mind, and I think the Committee will take this on board too, why not the WAF take the 
<br/>list of those evacuation centres, set up may be, three water tanks in each evacuation centre, so just 
<br/>like a disaster, when the NDMO activates the evacuation centres, when there is unplanned water cuts, 
<br/>WAF can also activate these three water tanks may be in all the evacuation centres that are in the list 
<br/>with NDMO so that the public can access when there is unplanned or planned water cut by the WAF.  
<br/>I think that is also a suggestion that the Committee can take on board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend and render my full support to the Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to offer some contributions to 
<br/>the  Report  on  the  review  of  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  2017  Annual  Report,    as  tabled  by  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Natural Resources.  Perhaps, I will compartmentalise my small contribution 
<br/>in a couple of parts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One is, I thought I just share some broader thoughts because of my profession and just after 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being here for a week, just thinking through some of the work that we are doing in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I have been looking at the Reports that we have been considering, 
<br/>they are quite old Reports.  This one is from 2017.  I wonder whether as a group, who is responsible 
<br/>for the leadership of our country to ask ourselves, should we be discussing outdated reports in this 
<br/>august Chamber, as Members of Parliament, as representatives of our people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It’s the requirement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I know that, but allow me  to finish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I just thought I would share that as a question to all of us, because it is important that 
<br/>whatever we discuss in this Parliament, is relevant, and I have been mentioning relevance a little bit 
<br/>today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an accountant, when I am talking about something in 2017 in 2023, it is 
<br/>absolutely irrelevant, I am afraid.  I just thought I would share that with all of us, just to have a serious 
<br/>thought about what some of the functions we are carrying out in Parliament.  Perhaps, as a suggestion 
<br/></span><span>to all of us, we can allow the Standing Committees to try and do a catch up on all the reports, so that 
<br/></span><span>if we accept where we need to go with these reports, maybe we do a catchup from 2017 up to 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We discuss that and so we start talking about things on relevant basis. I have been told it is in 
<br/>accordance with the law, but we are here to lead and provide guidance in this country.   So, I just 
<br/>thought I would share that as an opening remark regarding this Report. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was quite intrigued when the Report talked about WAF, they have used 
<br/>the  acronym  “A”  and  it  stands  for  accountability.    Just  to  re-enforce  my  point,  if  we  are  to  be 
<br/>accountable,  we  need  to  encourage  entities  such  as  WAF  that  we  are  providing  good  taxpayers’ 
<br/>money to, to be accountable and make sure that their reports are on a timely basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I totally agree with the comments of the Committee, we should not accept untimely reports.  
<br/>Why?  Because it talks about wider issues, Sir.  As an accountant, when people cannot submit good 
<br/>information on time, that suggests that there is a problem.  Simple, very simple.  So, going forward, 
<br/>I hope we can all discuss as a group in this august Parliament on how we can make these reports 
<br/>relevant so that when we discuss in Parliament, we are discussing things that affect real time future 
<br/>rather than historical reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I,  kind  of,  smiled  when  honourable  Sharma  started  throwing  some  small  stones  at  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Public Works regarding some complaints arising from Lautoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I think all agree in this Parliament that water is a challenging issue.  It has been an issue 
<br/>and from this side of Parliament, it could have been managed a bit better.   Sir, 16 years, and the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Public Works and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
<br/>Finance have told us that there have been leakages happening in this country for all this time.  I heard 
<br/>this in 2018, I think, and we have never been told publicly that that is an issue, that water is leaking 
<br/>from our systems up to 50 percent.  Am I right?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It has always been there in the Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- But you have not disclosed it to the public of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- It is in the Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  You  have  not  disclosed  it  to  the  public  of  Fiji.  Why?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because you know it is unpopular and you need to be, like us on our side, full disclosure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think sometimes honourable Sharma who was speaking on it too, to be 
<br/>fair in defence of my colleague, I know that when we call him about issues, they get dealt with in 
<br/>less than eight hours or 12 hours, and it is part of larger problems, which we all have to accept and 
<br/>own as Members of this Parliament.  But, like I said, 16 years, surely, we could have been in a better 
<br/>place in 16 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Just before I sit down, Sir, I thought I just share a little story about efficiency that I have 
<br/>shared with the honourable Minister for Public Works.  For WAF, ‘F’ stands for financially efficient 
<br/>and effective service delivery.  So, my family has a small business venture in Dravo and right now 
<br/>because of the water cuts, we have to call for water to be supplied to the village.  To do that exercise, 
<br/>our manager in the village has to get up in the morning when there is shortage of water in the tanks, 
<br/>go to Laucala Beach at R.B. Patel Centrepoint where WAF is based, pay $266 for the water, take that 
<br/>receipt and go back to Nausori, hand it to the Depot in Nausori and then go and wait in the village 
<br/>for the water to be delivered.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it took 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate said flabbergasted, I would return and say, that is quite flabbergasting.  
<br/>We have been advising people, but no one is listening, so we just decided to continue.  I guess, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, what I am saying is, there is a wider issue here and there are still things to sort out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad  talked  about  the  sewerage  issues  in  our  country  and  38 
<br/>wastewater systems need to be fixed.  We never heard about this.  I know it is easy to cast stones, but 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>735 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think what we have to collectively agree in this Parliament is that there are major issues that need 
<br/>to be sorted out.  I can see from the great work that our honourable Minister is doing, that he is doing 
<br/>his utmost to firefight first, whilst he tries to resolve the issues on a medium to long term basis and, 
<br/>of course, with funding from our honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst I support this, I just thought I would offer some, if you like, words 
<br/>of wisdom from myself in terms of the timeliness of the reports, and I truly hope that perhaps, the 
<br/>Business Committee can discuss it because ultimately, if we are in this Parliament, we need to remain 
<br/>relevant to the people of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to honourable Bala, I wish to remind honourable 
<br/>Members that there have been constant delays in the submission of Annual Reports to Parliament.  
<br/>Most of these Reports were never completely concluded during the past Government’s term.  So they 
<br/>have resurrected, we have passed it in this Parliament and as such, we are now discussing Reports 
<br/>that have been delayed but yet, it still needs to be brought to the attention of Parliament because of 
<br/>taxpayers’ funds that had been utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your observation is  commendable, honourable Deputy  Prime Minister, but  may be that is 
<br/>something for the Business Committee to sort out.  How do they take all the delayed Annual Reports 
<br/>that are before them and lump it all into one and then present it.  It will be the same thing.  That is 
<br/>my view, but the observation is commendable and is noted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I wish to correct the incorrect statement 
<br/>by the honourable Minister of Finance on Thursday that I did not release the payment for the Lagilagi 
<br/>Housing Project, and I was not in Parliament on that day.  It is unfortunate for the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance to mislead this Parliament because I do not release payments.  During those times in our 
<br/>Ministerial portfolio, we do not release payment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  It is the Permanent Secretary that releases the payment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for him to come here and mislead Parliament, is not a correct one.  I just want 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to put it on record.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make my brief contribution on the deliberation in this Parliament 
<br/>on the review of the Water Authority of Fiji’s 2017 Annual Report.  Water is an essential of life and 
<br/>its provision in safe and reliable means to people as one of the key priority areas of all governments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Standing  Committee  review  of  the  Annual  Report  highlights  this  as  a  key  priority 
<br/>initiative that gives back to the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF).  Mr. Speaker, Sir, even as we speak, 
<br/>water issues affect people.  During the </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span>, which we all wished everyone a happy </span><span>Ram 
<br/>Navami</span><span>, but for the people who celebrated was a bad </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span> for them because there was no 
<br/>water, and so many people called us and said, “Please, help us with the water.”  I directed few people 
<br/>to certain agencies, but they were told to go and buy their own water tanks.  So, I hope the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Public Works, who is responsible for water, will look into this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past months, as with everything else, the Coalition Government has 
<br/>spent a lot of time putting the blame on water issues to the FijiFirst Government.  It seems that there 
<br/>was no history to water infrastructure until the FijiFirst came into power.  I remember during my 
<br/>tenure, I had first-hand experience and learnt from the experts on the long history of infrastructure 
<br/>shortcomings when it came to water in Fiji.

<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issues of aged and out of date infrastructure in the water sector goes 
<br/>back to the lack of investment that began in the pre-Independence era.  The issues did not suddenly 
<br/>fall from the sky when the FijiFirst Government came into power in 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Review Report points out in the main, it was satisfied with the work and 
<br/>delivery outputs of WAF.  Now, I am told that honourable Minister wants to remove the Board.   But 
<br/>by removing the Board, will it solve the problem?  Good luck to you, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a general agreement, as they should be in this Parliament, 
<br/>that we have issues with infrastructure, and we need to have a plan to fix it.  Moving forward, this is 
<br/>an area that will need bipartisan input so that we can get up to speed in upgrading the infrastructure.  
<br/>The FijiFirst Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, invested heavily in this area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to read out what the honourable Minister of Finance said few 
<br/>weeks ago about this Viria Project and I am happy with your statement. In fact, there is some truth 
<br/>in it.  I know this project is designed so he is accepting, the design is well and good - design to the 
<br/>vital  infrastructure  and  services  which  is,  again,  vital  for  supporting  growth  and  sustainable 
<br/>development in the Greater Suva-Nausori area. I hope that when it is completed in May 2023, it will 
<br/>resolve and aid the support development within the Suva-Nausori corridors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project could have finished earlier on but as we all know that this project 
<br/>was  heavily  impacted  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  otherwise  this  project  could  have  been 
<br/>commissioned.  Apart  from  the  ongoing  reticulation  upgrades,  the  FijiFirst  Government  had  an 
<br/>extensive  programme  of  spreading  mains  water  to  rural  areas,  as  well  as  having  targeted  water 
<br/>delivery programmes for remote, rural and maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  WAF,  as  per  the  Review  Report,  has  been  heavily  involved  in  this 
<br/>evident dimension of the 17 rural programmes under WAF which was earlier on mentioned by my 
<br/>colleague. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Review  Report  also  noted  a  number  of  green  energy  and  climate 
<br/>initiatives by WAF.  We should not forget that WAF, under the FijiFirst Government’s direction, 
<br/>achieved many milestones in these areas as noted in the Review Report.  Few of them, includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Carbon Credit for Greenhouse Gas Reduction where WAF claimed $350,000 from ADB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by reducing emissions at 22,000 tonnes. 
<br/>It received an award, as mentioned earlier on by my colleague, at the 2017 Global Water 
<br/>Awards for its Water Champion Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government, through its effort, enabled the WAF to receive a 
<br/>US$31  million  grant  from  the  Green  Climate  Fund  -  a  component  towards  the  US$405  million 
<br/>investment  from  the  Fijian  Government,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  European 
<br/>Investment Bank (EIB) to develop the Suva-Nausori Water Supplies System.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable  Minister of Finance also mentioned in  that 
<br/></span><span>brief that $1.12 million was given to WAF for the past five years.  But all this time, he has been 
<br/></span><span>talking  and saying  that the country is  in  $10 million  debt  for the last 10 years.  So, $1 billion or 
<br/>whatever is now with WAF. We will also give some justification for the balance of $9 million in the 
<br/>coming months, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the system which is still in the process will result in greatly improved water 
<br/>services for close to 400,000 people in most populated corridors, as per the Review Report.  It is

<div><span>737 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>important  that  we  note  that  these  achievements  were  made  possible  by  the  policy,  directions  and 
<br/>oversight provided to the WAF under the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  note  that  instead  of  sitting  on  our  backsides  and 
<br/>complaining about the problems from the past Government, we from the FijiFirst Government, never 
<br/>blamed about the past Government at that time.  You know, Mr. Speaker, you were sitting there, you 
<br/>know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Bhatao</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  went  out  and  initiated  long  term  solutions  using  best  available 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>practice, as is evident in the Report.  I am just saying whatever is in the Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to thank you for this opportunity and I want to 
<br/>wish the honourable Minister all the best in the water issue that we have. If you need some assistance, 
<br/>please, let us now. We have been in the system, as I have said, we need to have a bipartisan…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Ro F.Q. Tuisawau interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. KUMAR.- Not really, but just to help you.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to the honourable Leader of Opposition. There has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been a slight reshuffle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERURATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, l will do my best to stick within the two minutes 
<br/>that I have requested for a short contribution.  I will not repeat what has been discussed but perhaps, 
<br/>I will just make four recommendations which the Government can perhaps consider seriously, given 
<br/>the issues that is common to water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My first recommendation, I will urge this, through the honourable Ministers and honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister is the Water Harvesting Policy. We are providing water tanks for our people but some 
<br/>seem to think that this is only for our people in the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To save a lot of money for Government and perhaps, it is a question of affordability as well, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be good if we, who live within the urban areas, if we can have a water tank 
<br/>each for every household because it will save a lot of money for Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that the Rainwater Harvesting Policy and its funding will continue but at the same 
<br/>time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I make also a recommendation and the honourable Minister for Rural 
<br/>and Maritime Development, and Disaster Management would already be aware with the Programme 
<br/>that we started with the UNDP called Risk Informed Development.  Let us not only provide water 
<br/></span><span>tanks for the sake of providing water tanks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, a key lesson learnt from the past, we  go and give people 
<br/>water tanks, but it is not protected.   After every cyclone, the honourable Minister and I know this 
<br/>very well, we have to replace these tanks because they were simply damaged from flying debris and 
<br/>everything.  So, with the Risk Informed Development, we are now providing protection to the tanks 
<br/>and that is very important for us.  It will save a lot of money in the long terms.

<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  second  recommendation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  Ecological  Purification  Systems  (EPS).  
<br/>Honourable Prime Minister, you are aware, Sir, that most of the water projects that were constructed 
<br/>from the 1950s, 1960s or whatever, are still in the same state today. They are not purified and treated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people are drinking straight from the source and Government has already initiated this 
<br/>EPS, Sir.  It is a simple purification system that, of course, gets rid of bacteria.  It only uses sand and 
<br/>stones.  If you drive past Nanuca Village, Sir, on your way to your village, you have an excellent 
<br/>example of an EPS in Nanuca Village. And that has been replicated almost in most parts of Fiji but 
<br/>large majority of Fijians are still drinking straight from the source from those days until today. It is 
<br/>going to take time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I hope that Government can pick this up and continue with 
<br/>it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third recommendation is what we call the Package Plants.  That is, again, is important to 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development, and Disaster Management in terms of 
<br/>responding during disasters and, of course, to everyone because water is a basic need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is a Package Plant?  You have a Containerised Processing System that you can just lift 
<br/>to the bank of any stream or whatever and you suck the water, regardless of the state of the water.  
<br/>Turbidity or whatever does not matter.  You extract the water, it is treated within that container and 
<br/>then on the hand, delivery trucks can come, they fill the water tanks, that is treated water going out.  
<br/>During our time we only managed two, we bought it, and I have always tried as Minister responsible 
<br/>for Disaster if we can have one or two in  every major towns and cities and then have a strategic 
<br/>reserve.  But these package plants are very, very important for us in the long-term, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I just also highlight about the need for these ecological purification systems and also 
<br/>these package plants.  Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, for your information, two Budgets from 2021-
<br/>2022  and  2022-2023,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  also  now  have  an  allocation  called  the 
<br/>“High Risk and Water Sanitation allocation”.  Initially, it was with the Ministry of Infrastructure for 
<br/>WAF  to  use  that,  but  because  of  the  utilisation,  it  was  slow  because  they  have  other  major 
<br/>commitments, it has been transferred to the Ministry of Rural Development - High Risk Water and 
<br/>Sanitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is based on the data that we receive from the Ministry of Health on Leptospirosis, 
<br/>Typhoid, Dengue and Diarrhoea (LTDD).  It is a common problem in Fiji, a lot of places still have 
<br/>leptospirosis, typhoid and dengue and likewise post-disasters when water service is affected, these 
<br/>becomes  very  important.    I  hope  that  the  programme  on  High  Risk  Water  and  Sanitation  can  be 
<br/>continued so that we can address some of those issues.  Those are my recommendations and thank 
<br/>you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee for the Report 
<br/>on the Water  Authority  of Fiji  Annual  Report for 2017 and  I  also  note the contribution  from  the 
<br/>honourable Members.  If I can just speak on what the very important point that the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  Kamikamica  made  with  respect  to  timeliness  of  presenting  annual  reports  and 
<br/>financial reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  point  of  view  of  efficiency  and  managing  budgets,  allocating 
<br/></span><span>budgets and appropriate budgets, it is very important for this Parliament to receive annual reports, 
<br/>financial reports on a timely basis so the Office of the Auditor-General can look at that.  That report 
<br/>can be looked at by the Standing Committee, it comes to Parliament and it gives Government and 
<br/>Parliament a better sense of performance of those entities and how we can allocate budgets which 
<br/>can lead to more efficiency and timeliness of addressing those and I think it is a very important point.

<div><span>         Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>739 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we saw over the last eight years that I have been in Parliament and 
<br/>under the Military Government before that, today for example, we are looking at a report which is 
<br/>five years old and constantly over the last eight years, we kept reminding the previous Government 
<br/>on the importance of those reports.  I think, as a government, we want to ensure (I am sure all the 
<br/>honourable Ministers on this side are concerned about that) and we will make sure that we get some 
<br/>of these reports on a timely basis.  We can have some delays here and there but not things like five 
<br/>years delay.  We will be working on ensuring that we get timely annual reports, financial reports so 
<br/>that the Office of the Auditor-General can look at them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to inform Parliament, I know honourable Bala talked about the budget.  
<br/>The Water Authority of Fiji over the last six years has been provided approximately $1.5 billion and 
<br/>of  that,  $511.3  million  was  just  for  operating  expenditure  and  $922.6  million  was  for  capital 
<br/>infrastructure and a significant portion of that is for the Viria Water Project and we acknowledge that 
<br/>project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Members are right that once that comes on board around May, it is going 
<br/>solve major water problems that we had over the last so many years.  I know honourable Usamate 
<br/>talked about the non-revenue water - that is correct.  I think it has been a problem for a long time.  
<br/>That also means that we are losing not only just the timeliness and appropriateness of the supply, but 
<br/>also, we are losing in monetary terms approximately $25 million per year because of that leakage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The task for the Government is a big one and it presents significant challenges for us.  I know 
<br/>that the honourable Minister responsible, we have been having a lot of discussions with the Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji, with the people who are in charge and we understand the difficulties that people 
<br/>have gone through; not  only recently but in the past as well because some of these issues were not 
<br/>addressed for a very long time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  understand  the  importance  of  infrastructure,  if  there  is  a  drag  on  the  maintenance  of 
<br/>infrastructure, it is  a drag on the economy,  it is a drag on all the sectors of the economy  and the 
<br/>efficiency in those sectors.  So neglected infrastructure is a serious problem, we are not just talking 
<br/>about  water.    If  you  look  at  our  health  facilities  around  the  country,  government  properties, 
<br/>government quarters and we have been in Government for only three months.  I can understand why 
<br/>there is so much sensitivity on the other side when we talk about what the problem is because they 
<br/>cannot take the fact that we are highlighting the problems that we have to deal with.  We cannot solve 
<br/>all these problems in three months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know there are people even outside of this Parliament who think that we can solve all the 
<br/>problems that we have landed on in three months.  I would urge the honourable Members on the 
<br/>other side to please have some tenacity to bear the bad news that we are giving to them; to the people 
<br/>of this country under what happened when they were in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For eight years, I sat on the other side and every time there was a big problem, we heard about 
<br/>the  past  governments,  we  heard  all  kinds  of  examples  thrown  at  us  about  what  the  previous 
<br/>governments did not do and sometimes they were talking about what the governments did in 1970s 
<br/>and 1980s.  We accepted that, we said that not every government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No, you didn’t.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … gets everything right in their tenure; we acknowledge that.  
<br/>But they also need to acknowledge themselves that they did not do everything right.  For many years, 
<br/>I have heard this bragging from honourable Members from the other side when they were this side 
<br/>about what the Government did.  I would urge them to show some restraint and understand that we

<div><span>        Review Report - WAF 2017 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have just been in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about maintenance, one of the things that we have already 
<br/>been discussing and the honourable Members have been invited to the National Economic Summit 
<br/>and I hope that all of them will turn up, we can have some good discussions in some of the thematic 
<br/>areas, specific sectors and I will give a Ministerial Statement on the Summit on Wednesday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 
<br/>2023 to provide more details. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Finance and I want to let the people of this country know and especially those 
<br/>people in the Suva-Nausori areas who have suffered water cuts, I know as I have been receiving all 
<br/>kinds of calls, but people understand on the contrary that this is a problem that we cannot just solve 
<br/>in three months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I can assure the people, we are already discussing about maintenance plan, and we want to 
<br/>ensure that these objectives, with respect to maintenance of our infrastructure because you can build 
<br/>infrastructure, and if you do not maintain it on a regular basis, you will see the effect of that in a very 
<br/>short period of time.  What we want to do, Mr. Speaker, is to ensure that in the next few years, in the 
<br/>next  few  budgets,  we  have  a  very  determined,  specific  agenda  to  ensure  that  we  provide  a 
<br/>maintenance budget or plan so that all the Ministers in respective ministries take the responsibility 
<br/>and ensure that that is done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, Mr. Speaker, that has been made by some of honourable Members on the 
<br/>other  side  is  important.    Sustainability  and  conservation,  these  are  issues  that  are  important,  and 
<br/>people need to understand.  I think honourable Sharma made a good point apart from the little jabs 
<br/>that he was throwing but he made a very good point with respect to sustainability of water use and 
<br/>conservation and I think it is a good point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also need to look at whether the tariff rate, what is causing that – whether there has been 
<br/>an improvement or not and I am sure the Water Authority of Fiji would be looking at the key drivers 
<br/>for  high  usage,  whether  there  are  enough  incentives  for  water  conservation  and  management  by 
<br/>households and individuals.  These are important issues in terms of the overall sustainability of water 
<br/>use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, what I want to say is, sort of going back to where I started.  We note 
<br/>that  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  is  working  closely  with  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  on 
<br/>finalising  the  backlog  of  Audit  Reports  for  2020-2021  and  2021-2022  reports.    These  respective 
<br/>updates are tabulated or planned as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The draft financial for 2020-2021 is now with the Office of the Auditor-General awaiting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Auditor-General to provide the timelines for field audit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  2021-2022 financial  year, the draft  financial has been submitted,  I  am told  on  24</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>March, 2023 the draft will be submitted to the Office of the Auditor-General before the end 
<br/>of April or before that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, Mr. Speaker, that we will be able to catchup on the timeliness and more updated 
<br/></span><span>financial annual reports so that when we are debating some of those issues, it is current and makes 
<br/></span><span>sense to talk about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Natural Resources for his reply, I must commend the way the debate has gone on especially on 
<br/>the Government side.  You have raised a point of lateness, now the honourable Deputy Prime and 
<br/>Minister of Finance is saying they can nip it at the bud by quickly ensuring that all annual reports are
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>741 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are submitted on time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  affects  the  role  of  the  Speaker  as  well,  various  Chairmen  of  Standing  Committees 
<br/>wanting more time.  It is already a delayed report but they still want more time and we have to put 
<br/>up with that and that very much chews into the budget of the Legislature. So with the reply provided 
<br/>by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, we are grateful that something 
<br/>would  be  looked  into  as  observed  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Commerce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members 
<br/>for their contribution to the Report.  The Standing Committee on Natural Resources will take all your 
<br/>contributions into consideration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I thank the previous Committee for its effort in tabling this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.

<div><span>Motion agreed to.
