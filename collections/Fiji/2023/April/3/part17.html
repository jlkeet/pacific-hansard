<h3>REVIEW REPORT ON THE MINISTRY OF LANDS ANDMINERAL RESOURCES 2014 AND 2015 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORTS</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE MINISTRY OF LANDS AND  
<br/>MINERAL RESOURCES 2014 AND 2015 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity 
<br/>to talk on this Report.  First of all, I would like to congratulate and thank the Committee for its work, 
<br/>the Committee that did it and the Committee that presented the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully, I will try and limit myself to may be seven minutes.  I will just very briefly dwell 
<br/>on the recommendations. I agree entirely with the recommendations from the Committee, and I think 
<br/>this has been expressed also in Parliament about the fact that we are looking at Reports that go back 
<br/>to 2014 and 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  notice  that  for  this  particular  Ministry,  the  2018-2019  Report  is  now  on  their  website.  
<br/>However, just looking at some of the issues to do with Annual Reports that lead to their delay, very 
<br/>briefly from the experience that I have had, a number of things lead to this.  I think in the different 
<br/>Ministries that people have headed, that is something that we try to address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first is knowledge management – knowledge that sits tacitly in someone’s head, and when 
<br/>that  person leaves,  that information  is gone.  So, it is just knowledge  management  -  converting tacit 
<br/>knowledge to make it explicit, made available for whoever comes into an organisation.  That is always a 
<br/>problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the other one has been, in a lot of Ministries, the report is ready but they are waiting for 
<br/>the audited financial statements, so those two things.  Sometimes, there will be reports ready for two-
<br/>three years, while you wait for the audits to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For audits, well, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister can tell you the reasons why audits are 
<br/>delayed, all sorts of different reasons.  Sometimes, the workload in the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>(OAG) or sometimes the whole host of other things.  The reports can only come together when both of 
<br/>these things are ready. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think for some of the things that we need to do, all Ministers when we go to a Ministry, we 
<br/></span><span>always put this as a KPI - get the annual reports out.  So, listening earlier today, that the WAF Reports 
<br/>for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 are ready, I really appreciate that because it is something that we have 
<br/>been pushing very hard, but that is one of the reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look forward to getting from the honourable Minister on the status or update on the other 
<br/>Annual Reports and also the audited financial statements from 2019, 2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>745 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look forward to getting from the honourable Minister on the status or update on the other 
<br/>Annual Reports and also the audited financial statements from 2019, 2020, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022.  
<br/>That is probably a big ask for the time being.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one is the Mining Act which is the second recommendation.  This is something 
<br/>that has been making the rounds for a long time in the Ministry, in the sector, and I am glad to see 
<br/>that  it is  getting  almost  to  the  end  now.    We  thank  IGF  that  has  given  us  free  expertise  working 
<br/>together with the Mineral Resources Department (MRD) and also the local consultant, a former staff 
<br/>of MRD who has been involved in this work, Venasio Nasara.  So, I am very glad to see that the 
<br/>work on the Mining Act is almost complete and we look forward to it being completed so that the 
<br/>big changes  can take place.  I think there have been 11 or 12 drafts of this legislation, so we are 
<br/>finally glad to see that we are moving to a stage when it will be completed, and I am sure the whole 
<br/>sector is looking to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to see the recommendation on the National Land Use Plan.  I understand the ITLTB 
<br/>has  also  developed  one  on  its  own.    I  am  not  too  sure  how  these  two  will  be  integrated  but  it  is 
<br/>important for us to manage whatever land that we have and use it in the best possible manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth recommendation - survey of land boundaries.  Reading this recommendation, I think 
<br/>it seems to relate much more to the mahogany forests.  This is a big challenge.  Mahogany forests are 
<br/>huge, sometimes within a mahogany forest, the boundaries of what belongs to the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> is not very 
<br/>clear.  So, for a long time now, the Ministry of Lands has been sending people in very difficult terrain.  
<br/>There are still some other mahogany forests that need to be looked at, but we look forward to this being 
<br/>undertaken so that the landowners can get a fair return on the mahogany that is on their land, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  last  one  -  officers  recommended  for  further  studies  and  supported  for  scholarship 
<br/>application.  Earlier on, this past week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked about this Ministry, and it 
<br/>has been one in which may be 70 to 75 percent of the Senior Management are all female, from the 
<br/>Director downwards.  I think that is a good reflection of the emphasis on capacity building, they have 
<br/>been able to get scholarships and push people through the system so that they are very well-educated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  this  is  one  particular  Ministry  you  can  see  this  and  my  recommendation  to  the 
<br/>Government is to make sure that we keep that.  We find a way so that our good talent can go and get 
<br/>their  masters  and  post-graduate  degrees,  the  PS  in  this  Ministry  is  a  Post-Graduate  also,  she  is  a 
<br/>Doctor - Dr. Raijeli Taga.  There are other PhDs about to come out, so this is very good.  We need 
<br/>to make sure that in Government Ministries we maintain it so that they can continue to provide good 
<br/>results for the people at large.  So, I will keep it there, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to share some experience.  First of all, 
<br/>we get to know the people that we are working together really well when.  I used to be a Member of 
<br/>the Public Accounts Committee before, and honourable Maharaj was our Chairperson.  We used to 
<br/>have  our  meetings  at  the  OAG  Conference  Room.    That  was  how  we  begun  to  build  a  good 
<br/>relationship with the Auditor-General and his staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  so  many  finger-pointing  going  on,  not  signing  of  the  report  when  they  leave  the 
<br/></span><span>complex, et cetera, but that is all just finger-pointing.  But the best solution is like what honourable 
<br/>Maharaj did, he took the meeting to them.  He took our PAC meetings and hold them in the OAG 
<br/>Conference Room.   That was a tremendous leap forward in  us knowing, understanding  and them 
<br/>understanding us as well.  So, honourable Usamate has raised a very valid point there.  There are 
<br/>other factors and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications knows it very well.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the report is finished by the Ministry, the Auditor-General is still waiting for it to be 
<br/>passed from him and that takes another while before the final report comes into Parliament and when 
<br/>it comes to Parliament, you have this 60-day limitation there.  Perhaps, we need to relook at that.  
<br/>Can we shorten the 60-day period in our review of our Standing Orders?  I am just throwing this in 
<br/>and it is up to you, honourable Members, because that has been highlighted by the Government that 
<br/>something is terribly wrong here - the delays of the Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity and I also thank the previous 
<br/>Committee and the current Committee for coming up with the Report.  I am not going to talk on the 
<br/>recommendations of the Report as it has already been read out by the Mover of the motion and also 
<br/>the findings of the Committee.  I will be very short, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  viewed  that  the  Ministry’s  overall  performance  in  2014  and  2015  was 
<br/>satisfactory,  even  with  the  limited  resources  in  place.    It  was  noted  that  during  those  operational 
<br/>years, the Ministry met with challenges which enabled the Ministry to promote and improve their 
<br/>service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the dedication by all staff of the Ministry in both years - 2014 and 2015, 
<br/>that had enabled the Ministry to implement its programmes has budgeted for and more importantly, 
<br/>in achieving its targets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  highlighted  issues  of  over-exploitation,  unregulated  illegal  extraction, 
<br/>underestimation  of  the  industry’s  output  and  environmental  degradation,  resulting  from  poorly 
<br/>regulated development mineral industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report recommends various measures to address these issues, including the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transformation of manual record-keeping to an electronic centralised database system; 
<br/>a review of current fees levied by Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources; 
<br/>the use of digital technologies for monitoring purposes; 
<br/>conducting regular trainings and workshops on financial literacy;  
<br/>resource management for resource owners; and  
<br/>carrying out awareness programmes on the impact of river gravel and sand extractions to 
<br/>the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  mineral  industry  plays  a  major  role  in  Fiji’s  domestic  development,  particularly  in 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure,  construction,  agriculture  and  disaster  reconstruction,  as  well  as  supporting  a  large 
<br/></span><span>number of Fijian small and medium-sized domestic enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  the  Report  highlights  the  importance  of  effective  regulation  and  sustainable 
<br/>management of the extractive industry sector to secure governance and sustainable development in 
<br/>Fiji.  With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief,  considering  that  honourable 
<br/>Usamate has actually covered most of the issues. But very pertinent recommendations have come out 
<br/>of this Report, and I see it is not very contentious.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But just to add on to that, Sir, one of the things that was glaringly obvious with respect to the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands is that some of the other Departments around Government never actually realised 
<br/>the kind of resources that are available within the Ministry of Lands, especially at the Mineral 
<br/></span><span>Resources Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>747 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  remember an  episode  where the Fiji  Roads Authority (FRA) was actually hunting down 
<br/>some people who were needed in respect to get some geotechnical work done and they would have 
<br/>ended up spending millions to actually hire someone to do it with respect to the bridge. I offered a 
<br/>simple solution to them and say, “Why are you not using one Government Department paying another 
<br/>Government Department to use MRD to get the actual information?”  So, it is just stuff like that - it 
<br/>requires  a  lot  of  coordination,  and  it  actually  helps  and  I  think  that  everyone  needs  to  come  to  a 
<br/>realisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  other  problem,  Sir,  there  is  a  wealth  of  expertise  and  young  expertise  and 
<br/>knowledge that actually exits within the MRD and the Ministry of Lands that we do not make use of.  
<br/>One of the biggest obstacles to getting a lot done at the Ministry of Lands also was the process of 
<br/>digitisation that actually needed to be completed.  I think that is a very helpful thing for all of us at 
<br/>the end of the day.  I am not sure if there has been PBR to actually do that at the moment, but it would 
<br/>be  something  that  should  be  a  part  of  the  whole  process  to  ensure  that  we  have  a  very  efficient 
<br/>Ministry of Lands which I think it has, but it still requires a lot of work.  Those are my submissions, 
<br/>Sir, and I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, first, I take the opportunity to thank the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Natural Resources that had dealt with this Report and also the Standing Committee 
<br/>that  have  now  able  to  table  this  Report  here  this  afternoon.  The  work  that  they  have  done  in  the 
<br/>financial year of 2014-2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, there had been a number of Ministers who have occupied the position, two of them 
<br/>are here, two are not but also the hard work of the previous Permanent Secretaries - Mr. Boseiwaqa 
<br/>and Mr. Malakai Finau; the hardworking and dedicated Senior Management Team of the Ministry, 
<br/>as well as all personnel who had worked hard to put in together the Annual Report that we are now 
<br/>discussing in this Parliament today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it has come to my attention that in the period of review - 2014-2015, even though 
<br/>there had been limited resources provided by the Ministry for the various work that it is required to 
<br/>do statutorily, they had performed very satisfactorily. So, that is something that the Report had picked 
<br/>up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also want to reiterate that the year of the review presented its own sets of challenges, but the 
<br/>Ministry  was  still  able  to  provide  the  service  delivery  that  the  public  expected  of  them,  which  is 
<br/>something that we, of course, in 2023 still want to maintain and to improve on in the next few months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were a number of highlights, Mr. Speaker, that were highlighted in the period of review, 
<br/>part of which is the review of the Organisation Structure which, of course, had been ongoing since 
<br/>2014-2015 and remains ongoing today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, out of the Report, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources have made five 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>general observations and I want to just run through them quickly, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 1</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Timely submission of the Ministry’s Annual Report to Parliament should be done within five 
<br/></span><span>months after the closing of accounts for the preceding year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2014-2015 and I suppose even uptil now, that remains a challenge.  When the books 
<br/>are closed how fast we get to reconcile books and how fast really the Office of the Auditor -General 
<br/>comes to the Office to do their part so that in a timely fashion, Parliament could be able to discuss 
<br/>them and dispose of them in a timely manner.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past three years, Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has been working towards tabling all of its 
<br/>Annual Reports that have been pending - 2020-2021, 2021-2022 Reports and those are earmarked to 
<br/>be presented in this Chamber in this financial year; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span><span>Facilitation of the early enactment of the Mineral Exploitation and Exploration Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review of the Mineral Exploration and Exploitation Bill and the Minerals Policy of Fiji 
<br/>commenced, Mr. Speaker, after a Cabinet decision was made on it in December 2020.  Following 
<br/>that,  an  agreement  was  put  in  place  between  the  Inter-Governmental  Forum  (IGF)  on  Mining, 
<br/>Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development of Canada and the Government of Fiji by the Ministry 
<br/>of Lands and Mineral Resources in 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  IGF,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  a  leading  global  Inter-Governmental  Forum  on  Mining  and 
<br/>Sustainable Development with its objective being to improve, sustain and contribute to the mining, 
<br/>minerals and metal sector to sustain development and, of course, help in poverty reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  assessment  exercise  not  only  involves  research  and  review  of  relevant 
<br/>documents  and  records  on  National  Mining  Laws,  Policies,  Regulations  and  Administrative 
<br/>Framework,  but  also  is  extensive  on  person  to  person  consultation  with  key  stakeholders  from 
<br/>Government, the private sector and also the civil society, as well as those who are involved in the 
<br/>mining sector. And as highlighted by honourable Usamate, now there is a former staff of the Ministry 
<br/>who is appointed by the IGF to be the local consultant to conduct work on Phase 1.  The Mining 
<br/>Legislation of 1965 really needs some review and that is work in progress at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase 1, Mr. Speaker, has already been completed.  The report for Phase 1 has been compiled 
<br/>and  has  been  submitted  to  Cabinet  for  their  consideration  and  approval.    We  are  now  presently 
<br/>awaiting the commencement of Phase 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span><span>On the National Land Use Plan which is currently demand base, the Committee recommends 
<br/>a  more  proactive  approach,  that  is,  provincial,  </span><span>tikina,  </span><span>village,  </span><span>yavusa,  mataqali  </span><span>and  also 
<br/>emphasis on farm base. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current Land Use Master Plan project has been revamped with a focus 
<br/>on the greater Western Division.  The other two Divisions - Northern and the Central/Eastern will be 
<br/>completed by 2024-2025 financial year in the North and 2023-2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon completion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final product will be a State Land Use Master Plan 
<br/>that will guide the Management in making leasing decision and to coordinate a more robust approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the State Land Use Master Plan will complement the similar work that has 
<br/>been carried out by iTLTB in their own Master Plan.  It will cover development plans for </span><span>mataqali,</span><span>
<br/>village and at </span><span>tikina</span><span> levels with the completion of the two master plans by the two agencies - State 
<br/></span><span>land, as well as iTLTB, combine end product.  Hopefully, it will give us a National Land Use Master 
<br/></span><span>Plan to be used by relevant authorities in planning ahead for future developments and proposals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4</span><span>
<br/> The survey of land boundaries needs to be accelerated as payment for stumpage is payable 
<br/>on trees harvested on each landowning unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>749 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the previous two speakers have spoken about how tough it is for landowners to 
<br/>have their mahogany plantations surveyed.  They have to deal with tough terrains and tough weather 
<br/>conditions and just recently, Mr. Speaker, for Parliament’s information, in the Ministry of Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources </span><span>Facebook </span><span>page, there is a video that we have deliberately uploaded so that people 
<br/>will get to understand and know how the surveyors do their work, where they leave their homes and 
<br/>for months they do not return.  Some would camp out in the forest for many days and for weeks, just 
<br/>so they can do the work that is required of them so that landowners who rely on the stumpage of the 
<br/>trees would be able to get what is rightfully theirs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry, through the Survey Division and, again, in pursuit of a Cabinet 
<br/>Decision that was made in 2008, with an endorsement extension in 2021 and in agreement with the 
<br/>Fiji Hardwood Corporation, they continue to prioritise the survey of these mahogany lots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For instance, in Galoa, a total of 12 lots with a total area of 7,382.3 hectares has already been 
<br/>surveyed and that has been completed.  The Naboutini Mahogany comprises of nine lots with a total 
<br/>area of 4,921 hectares which have been surveyed and completed.  The Nukurua Forest Mahogany, 
<br/>of course, is one of the large ones which consists of 28 lots with a total area of 5,160 hectares, 2,949 
<br/>hectares (about half of that) is still yet to be surveyed.  That brings a balance of 2,660 hectares to be 
<br/>done in  the  future.   For  Sawakasa, the mahogany encompasses  16 lots  with  a total  area of 4,128 
<br/>hectares,  1,881  hectares  has  been  surveyed  and  a  balance  of  2,746  remains  to  be  surveyed.    The 
<br/>surveyors are on the ground doing what needs to be done so that we can cover the balance and get 
<br/>Fiji Mahogany to do what needs to be done to the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 5 
<br/></span><span>Officers recommended for further studies and support for scholarship application.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The present Director of Mineral Resources is studying in Japan and, of course, the honourable 
<br/>gentleman Usamate had spoken about, knowledge retention.  That continues to be the challenge that 
<br/>we have at the Ministry because the Ministry, Mr. Speaker, being a former Minister for Lands in 
<br/>earlier years is a very technical Ministry.  There are surveyors, geospatial specialists - all of these 
<br/>requires very specific and fine training.  So, when we lose them, their knowledge goes away from 
<br/>the Ministry, and it is hard to replace them.  Even up until today, we continue to lose very technical 
<br/>officers from the Mineral Resources Department as well as the Ministry of Lands.  It is something 
<br/>that perhaps, we could all contribute to in how civil servants are able to retain people so that they can 
<br/>continue to provide the service to the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the last recommendation of course is on Gender Equality Analysis.  For some 
<br/>reason,  there  was  no  information  on  gender  provided  in  the  Annual  Report,  except  for  a  Gender 
<br/>Policy achieved by the Ministry during the period under review.  However, we all know, and we have 
<br/>spoken about the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources when it was tabled here last week and 
<br/>how the Ministry now have women in its top management level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  acknowledge  the  two  gentlemen  who  are  seated  here  and  their 
<br/>predecessors for encouraging women in their role in the Ministry.  But this Government, we have 
<br/>been able to give them permanency of jobs and that is something that they are very happy about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I commend the Report to Parliament and I, again, thank the 
<br/>Standing Committee that had dealt with this, and the Standing Committee that have now tabled its 
<br/>Report to Parliament today.

<div><span>        Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution to the motion that 
<br/>is before Parliament and, that is, to note the recommendations of the Committee on the 2014-2015 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just touch on Recommendation 3 and, that is, the development of the National Land 
<br/>Use Plan that the honourable Minister has alluded to and the final product that will come out of that 
<br/>is  the Vanua GIS.  I know that you will understand that, Sir, when you were former Manager of 
<br/>iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Vanua GIS is very important as all landowners have to have a 
<br/>fair understanding of our geospatial sets or what are the features there on our land, especially the 
<br/>Land Use Plan and also working with iTLTB on how landowners can assign various resources that 
<br/>are available on their land, whether it is river resources, rock for quarries,  land that will be suitable 
<br/>for  subdivision,  whether  any  other  economic  interests  on  their  land,  there  needs  to  be  proper 
<br/>valuation.  So, this Vanua GIS also connects them to investors who might be interested in their land.  
<br/>They are able to see those features that will be available in the system.  That will come out of the 
<br/>Land Use Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also urge the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources to work closely with iTLTB because 
<br/>they have a more comprehensive National Land Use Framework where all the iTaukei consultation 
<br/>or </span><span>veivakararamataki </span><span>which is called </span><span>Koro ni Yau - </span><span>a program which takes them to the landowners 
<br/>to do awareness and gives them a fair idea of their maps and what is available on their land and what 
<br/>kind of development they can pursue on that land.  Not only that, but other things also that could be 
<br/>used as village reserve and other subsistence farming.  Those are some of the things that landowners 
<br/>need to be educated and understand proper participation in all these awareness programmes that will 
<br/>be facilitated by the Ministry and also other stakeholders out there including the Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>and Fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I would like to highlight is the borehole project. I think in the last motion 
<br/>we were talking about the Water Authority of Fiji Annual  Report, but the Ministry of Lands also 
<br/>specialises on water resources. How we can we develop all those communities during a drought?  I 
<br/>think there are ongoing programmes identifying and also other research done to borehole projects in 
<br/>various areas which Government in the past has directed funds to help our communities who do face 
<br/>water problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I would like to highlight is on the mining industry and more consultation 
<br/>with the landowners especially mining companies on their operations, whether it is on exploration, 
<br/>whether it is moving towards exploitation, their rights and also the EIA plus, other things that the 
<br/>landowners need to be aware of in moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the biggest achievements of the FijiFirst government, if you see the mining industry 
<br/>in Section 30 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji which talks about a fair share of royalty, 
<br/>it was part of the 1997 Constitution under the SVT Government but it was not implemented until the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government came in under the 2013 Constitution which has allowed a fair share of royalty 
<br/>for landowners whether it is a State land, a freehold land or </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  80  percent  of  that  royalty  goes  to  landowners.  There  are  certain  projects  that  were 
<br/>pioneered like the one in Nawailevu plus another one in Vatukoula, those have received and benefited 
<br/>from  mineral  royalties  and  those  royalties  have  really  helped  the  communities  in  moving  into 
<br/>investment,  and  part  of  that  fund  too  is  for  their  future  generation  that  is  invested  by  the  future 
<br/>generation fund under the Land Bank of the Ministry of Lands.

<div><span>       Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>751 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think last week we were talking about the Land Bank; we have heard from the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Lands that they will go through a consultation on whether they will revert back to iTLTB.  
<br/>However, something about Land Bank, Sir, under the Land Use Division of the Ministry of Lands, I 
<br/>think nothing is paid, landowners just deposit their land there and all the costs to develop that land is 
<br/>forked by the Ministry.  This is something that has really helped landowners in the past in developing 
<br/>their land for investment and also to allow those who want to come and lease their land to see that 
<br/>they have a system in place, that also assist the landowners in terms of land rentals. The Ministry of 
<br/>Lands  does  not  charge  any  poundage  like  iTLTB  plus  all  other  things  that  go  directly  to  the 
<br/>landowners  to  develop.    There  are  examples  of  achievements  for  landowners  in  Savusavu  in  the 
<br/>Northern Division and all other areas that are part of this Land Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are few things, Sir, that I would like to share as part of achievements but there are other 
<br/>challenges that the Ministry has taken on board.  Just before I conclude, Sir, we have been talking 
<br/>about the delay of our Annual Reports.  One of the responses by the Ministry in this particular Annual 
<br/>Report 2014 and 2015 as the reason why the Ministry of Lands Annual Reports was delayed was 
<br/>because there was reorganisation and restructure within the Ministry. But if we are going to push 
<br/>Annual Reports to be timely, I think the onus is on the Government. If the Government will bring in 
<br/>more changes, we should expect more delays because once you bring in new changes, new policies, 
<br/>then there is a new system in place coming in again.  For the system that is now familiar with the 
<br/>civil servant, they are familiar with policies.  Once the new Government comes in with new changes, 
<br/>we should expect the delay of these Annual Reports and other things that we will see as we move 
<br/>forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, for Annual Reports, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Commerce was 
<br/>talking about the delay in outdated reports.  All those reports are with Parliament, Parliament decides 
<br/>when it comes for debate.  The reports are there with the Committee, more recent years but if this is 
<br/>2023  and  we  are  debating  a  report  from  2014  and  2015,  we  will  expect  the  People’s  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s Annual Report to come in 2026 if we are not timely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you see the backlog that is there, that is a challenge and I hope that the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Finance will look into that and the timeliness of annual reports coming into Parliament. That is 
<br/>practical when you see those reports that are coming into Parliament and when we expect the People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government, the various ministries that they run now to come into Parliament. I think they 
<br/>probably will not be happy to be in government and debating for Annual Reports that were done by 
<br/>FijiFirst government because there are plenty of achievements in those Annual Reports.  Again, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, thank you for your indulgence and I commend the Report that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  wish  to  support  the  comments  of  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources and I would like to make a few additional comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the work that the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, even though there 
<br/>are huge challenges faced by the Ministry in terms of resources but what we are hearing today is 
<br/>basically something new, innovative and I also would like to acknowledge the contribution of the 
<br/>former Ministers on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Solicitor-General has been actively involved in not only providing timely 
<br/></span><span>legal advice to the Ministry but also assist with the Ministry in legal vetting of the Cabinet papers, 
<br/>policies, frameworks and regulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the matter’s filed against the Ministry in court, a total number of active 
<br/>cases filed in 2014 were 33 matters. There is another issue I wish to highlight.  This is in regard to 
<br/>amendments to the State Lands Act.  In 2021, section 13 of the Act was amended by the State Land 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report – MLMR 2014&amp;2015 Consolidated Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Budget  Amendment)  Bill  2021  or  known  as  Bill  No.  16  of  2021  to  remove  the  requirement  of 
<br/>obtaining written consent from the Director of Lands for any mortgage, charge, pledge, caveats on 
<br/>protected leases or any such lease to be dealt with by any court of law or under the process of any 
<br/>court of law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consent is still required for dealings such as transfers, sales, sub-leases, rezoning, et cetera.  
<br/>The  previous  government  had  legislated  this  amendment  by  giving  reasons  that  the  amendment 
<br/>would ensure faster service delivery to  leases, and third parties  will no longer need to  obtain the 
<br/>consent of the Director of Lands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure you are quite familiar with the process as a owner of the land, it 
<br/>is only right that the Director of Lands would like to know what has happened to that lease before its 
<br/>mortgaged.  Unfortunately,  and  hopefully  in  the  future  we  will  get  some  detailed  report  if  the 
<br/>amendments have actually achieved the result, the intended purpose.  Sir, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will try and be very brief.    I know the 
<br/>honourable Members who have spoken before me have covered most of the issues and in particular 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Lands, I think they will put the recommendations in details so I am not 
<br/>going to talk about those.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Commerce,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  I  have  been  talking  about  streamlining  business 
<br/>processes,  streamlining  investment  proposals,  approvals  and  I  think  the  relationship  between  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Lands,  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board  and  Town  and  Country  Planning  is  very,  very 
<br/>important from a development point of view and from an approval point of view. I kind of note with 
<br/>satisfaction that there was a committee (with the former Ministry of Economy) now the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance, iTaukei Land Trust Board, Ministry of Lands and Department of Town and Country  
<br/>Planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the report I have got, they were able to sort out 900 scheme plan applications.  Now 
<br/>that is very satisfying because a lot these scheme plans, we have heard stories in the past, get stuck.  
<br/>I would say that the honourable Minister for Lands will continue with that Committee and make sure 
<br/>that these approvals are efficient and done in a timely manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other innovations that I saw, I want to acknowledge the Vanua View Online free access.  
<br/>I think that is a good innovation and also the fair share of Mineral Royalties Bill, which was passed 
<br/>in  May  2018,  where  the  landowners  are  entitled  to  80  percent  of  royalty  payments  and  the 
<br/>Government takes about 20 percent for administration cost.  And beneficiaries are the landowning 
<br/>units,  as  well  as  owners  of  freehold  land  if  minerals  are  extracted  from  the  freehold  land.    The 
<br/>Ministry received over the last six years on average about $25 million a year, a total of about $155 
<br/>million in budget.  I note that they also have a significant arrears as of today of $23.8 million is owed 
<br/>as rental arears to the State.  So, I am sure the honourable Minister for Lands is looking at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  finish  off,  I  am  always  amused  by  honourable  Bulitavu’s 
<br/>contribution.  I actually enjoy his contribution because some of the things that he is now saying, were 
<br/></span><span>quite the opposite of what he was saying when he was with us.  And maybe, he is already thinking 
<br/></span><span>of coming this side.

<br/>thank  the  honourable  Members  for  their  contributions.    We  will  take  your  contribution  into 
<br/>consideration.  I appreciate the work done by the previous Committee in reviewing this said report
