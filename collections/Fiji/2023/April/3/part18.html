<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE FIJI REVENUE AND CUSTOMS  
<br/>SERVICE 2017-2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review Report of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 to 2018 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Members of this august Parliament, I rise to speak on the review Report 
<br/>of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 2017 to 2018 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its review Report of the Fiji Revenue 
<br/>and Customs Service 2017 to 2018 Annual Report during the 2022 Parliament sitting by the former 
<br/>Chairperson, honourable Vijay Nath.  During the period under review, Fiji Revenue and Customs 
<br/>Service  (FRCS) collected $2.83 billion in  net  tax revenue, recording a growth  of $252.8 million, 
<br/>which was about 9.8 percent over the fiscal year of 2016 to 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRCS has introduced a Standard Interpretation Guideline 6 during the 2017-
<br/>2018  period,  which  is  an  extremely  useful  instrument  that  enables  taxpayers  to  understand  the 
<br/>technical interpretations made by FRCS.  These guidelines cover all the complex issues, which the 
<br/>taxpayers would be able to access and understand, especially regarding specific tax policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had commended FRCS for transitioning towards the use of 
<br/>digital  technology  through  the  use  of  HR  Information  System,  including  online  Performance 
<br/>Management System within the organisation.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge 
<br/>the former Committee Members, honourable Vijay Nath, Mrs. Veena Bhatnagar, Mr. Sachida Nand, 
<br/>Mr, Inosi Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau who were part of the team that produced this 
<br/></span><span>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor, I would like to inform honourable Members that 
<br/>we have about five speakers sent by the Whip of the Opposition and the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Government in Parliament.  Batting order is as follows:

<div><span>       Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Nath; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and Transport; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Economic  Affairs  Committee  for 
<br/>analysing the Annual Report and coming up with their findings and recommendations.  There is no 
<br/>denying that FRCS has a very critical role to play in funding the national budget.  The FRCS is tasked 
<br/>to collect maximum revenue every year based on the targets set by the Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  this  revenue,  the  Government  provides  essential  services  such  as  education,  health, 
<br/>better infrastructure, pension for elderlies, social welfare payments and many other services to our 
<br/>people.  If the FRCS fails to collect revenue, then the Government budget is affected, which in turn 
<br/>affects socio-economic development, including the aspiration of all Fijians for a better life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is,  therefore,  very  important  that  meritocracy  is  the  basis  for  the 
<br/>appointment of Board members and staff of the FRCS.  If Board members or staff members are not 
<br/>recruited based on merit, the Government will suffer with revenue collection, and without revenue, 
<br/>promises made by the Government cannot be delivered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing we do not want to hear from our honourable Deputy Prime Minister is there is 
<br/>no money or where is the money.  To answer those two questions, he needs to improve the functioning 
<br/>of FRCS through the Board members.  Where is the money, there is no money has become his famous 
<br/>rhetoric and excuse as well.  So, I would like  to  urge the honourable Minister of Finance that he 
<br/>should whinging and just get the job done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 100 days and the Coalition Government failed 
<br/>to deliver its promises.  No one asked them to come up with 100 days of deliverables.  They made 
<br/>the commitment and they announced that they will deliver in the first 100 days.  We have heard in 
<br/>the previous debate, they are saying, “it is only three months, it is only three months.”  Well, you 
<br/>came up with your list of things that you will deliver in three months, not one year or two years, you 
<br/>said exactly 100 days so the people of this country, all Fijians are looking forward to the promises 
<br/>that you made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Exactly! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the board members of FRCS 
<br/>who served during the period under review.  They achieved 9.8 percent growth in revenue collection.  
<br/>We have heard the total collection was $2.83 billion.  That is an increase of about $252.8 million.  
<br/>Such result is only possible when you appoint the right people for the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is greatly appreciated that the board members of 
<br/>FRCS then, Mr. Ajith Kodagoda, Ms. Makereta Konrote and late Mr. Faiz Khan, worked tirelessly 
<br/>without even taking a dollar as a board fee.  The only board member who received the board fee was 
<br/>the late Jone Vatukela. None of the board members came out publicly to say they were working for 
<br/>free.  That showed their humbleness and commitment to serving the nation with no personal gain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>755 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  have  been  continuous  investment  made  by  FRCS  and  under  the 
<br/>leadership of this board, FRCS embarked on a transformational journey.  The tax collection system 
<br/>was modernised, even they started working on the legislation to modernise the legislation as well.  
<br/>Customer-centric approaches were adopted and that is why there was a name change from Authority 
<br/>to Service. They also adopted digital technologies and these digital technologies were introduced for 
<br/>example,  Electronic  Fiscal  Devices  (EFD)  to  monitor  VAT,  STT  and  ECAL  collections  in  that 
<br/>particular year but we all know that STT and ECAL were scrapped later on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all have heard from the honourable Minister of Finance, and I think only 
<br/>last week he mentioned that he intends to remove VAT Monitoring System (VMS).  That, in my view 
<br/>is not a good idea but of course the government of the day can make that decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So if he intends to suspend the third phase, I support him for that.  It 
<br/>does make sense because the third phase was for the small businesses and such cautionary approach 
<br/>is far better, so it is a good move, honourable Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  CEO  of  FIRCS  at  that  time  also  talked  about  VMS  and  he  actually 
<br/>appreciated the tax collection they were making from phase one and phase two which were mainly 
<br/>for the bigger companies like supermarkets, pharmacies et cetera.  I can share a story with you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  when  I  was  working  for  Consumer  Council  of  Fiji,  we  used  to  receive  calls  from 
<br/>workers who were working for supermarkets.  They will exactly say which cash register was not 
<br/>connected  to  FRCS  and  which  ones  were  connected.    So  that  meant  that  the  company  or  the 
<br/>supermarket  could  collect  black  money  and  that  was  the  case  previously  when  VMS  was  not 
<br/>introduced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also heard and read that in 2007, the World Bank conducted a study and they found 
<br/>that one-third of our economy was in black and losing such an amount of money is a concern for any 
<br/>government because if that money is collected, the government can deliver more services.  So, it is 
<br/>again very important that we continue to improve FRCS and ensure that we collect maximum revenue 
<br/>out of that organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate again FRCS for their forward-looking initiatives in that year 
<br/>which included research and development work on the introduction of new tax information system 
<br/>and the taxpayer online services.  Such transformation is needed in the digital world that we live in.  
<br/>We cannot be stuck in the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the global world changes, the organisation must 
<br/>move on and adapt to that change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FRCS  underwent  innovation  and  technology  driven  transformation  and  when  an 
<br/>organisation  undergoes  major transformation, it is  expected that  the organisation’s structure must 
<br/>reorient to respond to such changes.  You cannot have a transformation on one hand and continue to 
<br/>keep the same set of workers, either you provide that training, or you have to let go some people.  
<br/>That is how corporates work if they want profits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen, and it has become a common practice that politicians start 
<br/></span><span>interfering with a statutory body.  Who knows better how the organisation should be run and when it 
<br/>comes  to  letting  go  of  staff  then  we  see  politicians  jumping  in  and  start  giving  advice  to  those 
<br/>organisations or actually forcing them to take those workers back.  I think there is a separate process, 
<br/>and the process is the system that we have created, if there are worker grievances, it is through that 
<br/>process that people should go through.

<div><span>        Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I would like to acknowledge the board, the CEO, Mr Visvanath 
<br/>Das and his team for achieving such a good result during the period under review.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I support the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  unlike the other side of Parliament, I will 
<br/>try  and  keep  my  comments  brief  so  that  we  can proceed  with  business  as  there  is  a  lot  to  cover.  
<br/>Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly congratulations to the Committee for coming up with a Report, the 
<br/>Economic Affairs Standing Committee and for picking on some issues that I thought I would pick 
<br/>on.  The honourable Premila Kumar provided some segue for me in terms of asking the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance on how are we going to find the money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me assure you, Sir, I was not here when the honourable Minister of Finance made his 
<br/>very excellent Ministerial Statement on the State of Government Wastage I guess in the country or 
<br/>Economic Management.  But just to assure the Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji that 
<br/>even though when you read the honourable Deputy Prime Minister’s statement, there is a daunting 
<br/>task ahead of this country in terms of that amount of capital expenditure that we need to spend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have got a slightly different take, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  From what I have seen in the last three 
<br/>months, there is tremendous opportunity for our country and that therein lies the secret to how we 
<br/>are going to succeed or fall in the next four years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have just returned from a Trade Mission in New Zealand and if New Zealand is an indication 
<br/>of  what  we  are  going  to  see  across  the  rest  of  our  trading  partners,  there  are  some  very  good 
<br/>opportunities in front of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in short answer to honourable Premila Kumar’s concerns, rest assured, and certainly as 
<br/>the Minister for Trade is responsible for investment and plays a key role in the stimulation of the 
<br/>economy and the driving of economic growth in the country with the assistance of the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance, we are quite optimistic in terms of where we should head. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You can quote me on this in a couple of years but like I said, I was not joking, Sir, when I 
<br/>said in my Maiden Speech here that we really should be looking at doubling, at least, 50 percent 
<br/>growth in the economy in the next 10 years. So, that means an average growth of about five percent 
<br/>each  year  for  the  next  five  years  because  that  is  the  way  we  will  resolve  the  tremendous  capital 
<br/>expenditure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, the previous Government decided to lend and borrow a lot, not understanding that with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dislocations like COVID-19, things can get, as they say in some worlds, pear-shaped.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, certainly I can speak on behalf of my Ministry and our colleagues on this 
<br/>side of Parliament, including the honourable Minister for Tourism, we do see a lot of upside in the 
<br/>economy, Sir. We hope to activate what needs to be activated and will ensure that if we are going 
<br/>forward, that we keep the economy on an even keel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been asked by the honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services, 
<br/></span><span>and Transport to contribute on the IT side of things which I thought I will share some thoughts in this 
<br/></span><span>Parliament because it is part of my training, I guess.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the challenges that we always face in IT is we try and replicate systems that are big 
<br/>country systems.  So, we adopt sometimes technology that is big country technology as opposed to 
<br/>looking at things like off-the shelf software, sometimes looking at closer partners that may have the 
<br/>software that we can use and when we try and develop our own, that is when we faced a lot of risks. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>757 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been a user of the current tax systems, it is not complete which is sad, which means 
<br/>that we have spent a lot of good taxpayer money but have not achieved the outcomes that we are 
<br/>supposed to achieve from a proper online tax system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  another  example  of  wastage.  My  colleagues  in  the  profession  told  me  that  the  initial 
<br/>consultation on the system was virtually zero - that the system was adopted and then consultation 
<br/>happened once the selection of the system had started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the things that we will not repeat on this side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  We will ensure that before we deploy systems, that good disciplines and practices are in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under communications, I look after IT, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I can assure this House that we 
<br/>will ensure we do not have a repeat of this kind of debacles going forward because this is what the 
<br/>people of Fiji demand of us, that we are responsible with the money we invest, particularly in IT 
<br/>systems, and it is important that we spend their money responsibly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, with those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to contribute and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to contribute to 
<br/>the motion moved by the honourable Member.  At the outset, I congratulate the current honourable 
<br/>Members on their appointment to the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I,  as  former  Chairperson,  thank  all  honourable  Members  for  their 
<br/>contribution  in  compiling  the  Report  which  was  a  bipartisan  Report:  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Public Works and Meteorological Services, and Transport, former Members – Mr. Inosi Kuridrani, 
<br/>Mrs. Veena Bhatnagar and Mr. Sachida Nand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir, on Wednesday, 1</span><span>st</span><span> June 2022, the Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS) 
<br/>Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark Dixon, and his Team appeared before the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Economic Affairs to discuss the Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service 2017-2018 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FRCS  is  a  statutory  authority  established  under  the  Fiji  Revenue  and 
<br/>Customs Service Act 1999. It is a major revenue collector for Government, so it is very important 
<br/>that they improve on the outstanding tax so that it brings more revenue for Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A number of initiatives were planned by FRCS, but it was slowed down or put on hold due 
<br/>to COVID-19.  However, it is understandable that now, FRCS will fight back and continue with its 
<br/>initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted in that year that FRCS collected $283 billion in net 
<br/>tax revenue, recording a growth $552.8 million which was about 9.8 percent overall over the fiscal 
<br/>year.  Someone asked me how we got that 9.8 percent growth?  I will try to explain, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Income tax for 2017-2018 rose to $749,905,090. That was a 7.5 percent increase.  VAT in the 
<br/></span><span>same year recorded a 12.3 percent increase.  Trade Tax, a 10 percent increase, other taxes and levies 
<br/>increased to 9.3 percent.  One can find this in the Verbatim Report, which is in the Parliament website, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  across  all  those  tax  types,  the  collection  in  2017  was  compared  to  the  previous  year 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase by 9.8 percent. The Committee commended FRCS for the effort.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Report, there were six findings and recommendations and 
<br/>I  have  spoken  on  the  first  just  now.    There  were  other  finding  and  recommendations  which  the 
<br/>Committee really appreciated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the introduction, the Committee noted that in the same year, FRCS commenced with the 
<br/>modernisation of both, Custom and Tax legislation and the programme will continue which definitely 
<br/>you will find that in the new or other Reports where you will find the best part of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  introduction  of  Authorisation  Economic  Operator  (AEO),  the  programme  was  also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduced in the same year.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the same year, FRCS introduced a new Tax Information System (TIS) 
<br/>Programme,  and  I  am  optimistic  that  we  will  definitely  be  seeing  that  achievement  in  the  other 
<br/>Reports which will be coming to the Committee, and I fully support the Committee’s Report. In fact, 
<br/>I am supporting my own Report and I request the Members to, please, support this Report as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Fiji Revenue and 
<br/>Customs  Service  Report  which  I  was  a  Member  of  that  Committee  with  my  Chairman,  that 
<br/>scrutinised the Report.  In our committee, we would normally have consensus, but we also agreed 
<br/>that when we come into Parliament, we can also raise issues, which might not be along the lines 
<br/>which we are recommending.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Yes, that is normal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Anyway,  on  the  new  tax  information  system  in  the 
<br/>recommendation, that was a concern and I had thought about bringing it up to the Committee to have 
<br/>a special audit on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of our Committee, because there are three of them and two of us, we are to reach 
<br/>consensus so we agreed just to bring it with those recommendations.  This is a major issue - FRCS’s 
<br/>IT system, and we had looked at some of the reports with regards to the amount of funds which was 
<br/>spent on it.  For example, by the end of July, it was $1.1 million but it jumped to $7.056 million in 
<br/>2019, so it is huge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you look at the figures by 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 in terms of consultancies, it was $3.3 million.  
<br/>There were issues not only for the initial contract, but also the implementation and based on what we 
<br/>have discussed with the CEO, when we upgrade an IT system in an organisation, we do business 
<br/>process mapping, so we go step by step and map that out, then get the IT software to match them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this case, it does not seem to have been initially done, so as the project progressed, it was 
<br/>amended as it went along, which was why the costs escalated in terms of the consultancies.  That is 
<br/>why today, a lot of us experience issues with the IT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just read out one of the feedbacks, Sir, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is high risk to invest in Fiji at this moment given the problems in FRCS.  Our new 
<br/></span><span>digital tax portal system is a shamble, it cannot operate itself, it cannot reconcile payments 
<br/>with assessments.  It cannot distinguish between taxpayers who have a tax file extension 
<br/>numbers and those who do not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taxpayers are now receiving demands for tax returns which have already been filed 
<br/>and even worse, the taxpayers are being penalised for late lodgement of returns that have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>759 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already been lodged, and late payment in taxes which have already been paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some taxpayers are receiving assessments showing overdue tax owing while their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>statement of tax account with the FRCS has a credit balance.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This happened to me.  I had a tax clearance but just lately, they advised that I have some tax 
<br/>due but that was cleared about six months back, so it seems that the various databases within are not 
<br/>communicating.  I think that is why the honourable Deputy Prime Minister is putting the system on 
<br/>hold, and that is an issue which we would need to overcome. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, the original initial assessment, the contracting and the progressive type of business 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>planning processing and payment as it progress is a big issue and it might need a special audit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the way you looked at me, I thought you were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>directing me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Members  for  their  contribution,  and  I  agree  with  the  sentiments 
<br/>expressed by everyone which says that FRCS is a very important arm of Government which collects 
<br/>taxes and duties on behalf of the Government.  It also provides quality advice on tax and customs 
<br/>matters to all stakeholders, including the Ministry of Finance, facilitates trade, travel and protects our 
<br/>borders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the former Chairman highlighted, it is a statutory body governed under the Fiji Revenue 
<br/>and Customs Service Act 1999 and we now have a new Board led by Mr. Malakai Naiyaga; a man 
<br/>of integrity, experienced and I have every confident that he will lead, not only the Board but together 
<br/>with  the CEO and staff, a very, very  competent  organisation for us and  an important  one for the 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me say that FRCS went through some turbulent times in the recent past </span><span>ad 
<br/>hoc</span><span> changes were done.  Within FRCS, with massive staff redundancies which led to critical staff 
<br/>shortages,  skill  loss  and  manpower.    In  fact,  Sir,  I  remember  raising  this  in  this  Parliament  -  the 
<br/>morale of the staff had actually plummeted, and we brought this quite actively in Parliament when 
<br/>we were in Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was listening very carefully to what honourable Premila Kumar said, Mr. Speaker, and I 
<br/>absolutely agree with her that we need people of integrity and experience to be on the Board and 
<br/>Chair the Board.  Honourable Kumar maybe just forgot, and I have just highlighted that in the recent 
<br/>past, there was a lot of </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> changes, staff redundancies, loss of skills and that was done under a 
<br/>Chairman appointed by the previous Government and that person (I would not be like the previous 
<br/>government  naming  people  here)  was  sacked  by  a  significant  important  regional  organisation  for 
<br/>being unethical.  He was appointed the Chair of the FRCS Board, and that was when a lot of these 
<br/>things happened.  I agree with her, but they should also reflect on what happened under them.  That 
<br/>is a very important point, and they know what happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  Board,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  obviously  looking  into  the  new  organisational  structure.  
<br/></span><span>They are looking at staffing needs and I can assure them that the additional funding will be provided 
<br/></span><span>to fund a fit-for-purpose FRCS that can effectively collect taxes and provide service to the taxpayers 
<br/>and support trade and business generally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this process, Mr. Speaker, I know the Board and the CEO are working very closely.  
<br/>To provide for additional recruitment, genuine opportunities are being provided to former staff to 
<br/>return to FRCS and I am also told that the FRCS is shortly about to sign the new collective agreement

<div><span>        Review Report – FRCS 2017-2018 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with  the  union  after  a  very,  very  good  consultation  with  them.    So,  these  are  attempts  as  a  new 
<br/>Government who recognises that we need a harmonious industrial relations environment, staff need 
<br/>to be compensated, provided a working environment that is conducive to their productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FRCS right now has a new leadership team, and the new CEO has been investing 
<br/>in that process and trying to create a culture within FRCS to become an employer of choice.  I am 
<br/>told that for the first time, a female director of Taxation was appointed.  This is very important as we 
<br/>are continuing to invest in people and ensuring that the environment within those organisations are 
<br/>good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new Board has also proved the new Strategic Plan for FRCS that seeks 
<br/>to improve strategic engagement with taxpayers and making it easier for them to comply and harder 
<br/>not to, because that is also very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key focus, Mr. Speaker, moving forward would be to, firstly, become an employer of 
<br/>choice where every staff is valued with clear recognition of a positive workforce and culture linked 
<br/>to strong leadership and technical skills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  FRCS  will  maintain  its  new  focus  on  being  a  customer-centric 
<br/>organisation because we have talked about this before that people should not fear FRCS.  In fact,  a 
<br/>good tax collecting agency promotes businesses, works with them, resolves issues in an environment 
<br/>of trust and partnership so that we can build their confidence which, Mr. Speaker, in some sense was 
<br/>lacking in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services, and Transport talked 
<br/>about  the  IT  Project,  the  new  tax  information  system.    Mr.    Speaker,  we  recognised  that  some 
<br/>requirements  have  changed  since  the  original  scoping  and  FRCS,  therefore,  is  working  and  has 
<br/>created  a  new  collaborative  team  with  staff  from  FRCS,  representatives  from  the  Fiji  Institute  of 
<br/>Accountants, industry and business partners to agree to the enhancements required and how we can 
<br/>move forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to go into the details of the 2017-2018 Annual Report, but I just 
<br/>wanted to quickly highlight that a total of $2.83 billion tax revenue was collected by FRCS in the 
<br/>financial year, recording a growth of 9.8 percent for $2.8 million over the previous financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The revenue, Mr. Speaker, accounted for 87.3 percent of total Government revenue.  The total 
<br/>revenue - VAT is leading the revenue collection with a contribution of 27.9 percent, followed by 
<br/>income tax at 26.5 percent. Trade taxes stood at 23.6 percent and other taxes and levies contributing 
<br/>about 22 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is significant to note, and this is a very important point that we need to make, 
<br/>the Report actually highlights that the total tax revenue collection for the financial year 2017-2018 
<br/>was below the forecast by 8.6 percent for $266.8 million and 3.5 percent below the revised forecast.  
<br/>So, one of the reasons for the under collection of revenue by FRCS for the review period would have 
<br/>been due to tax reforms just before the 2018 General Election in mind, I am sure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, tax exemptions and incentives are usually provided to encourage investment 
<br/>in particular sectors, products or projects, or to encourage certain types of spending. However, Sir, 
<br/>we  all  know  and  honourable  Members  would  know  that  tax  exemptions  and  incentives  can  have 
<br/>unintended consequences, it can have adverse impacts, it may not lead to those kind of results as 
<br/>envisaged by those tax incentives and exemptions, if not carefully assessed and given, can erode the 
<br/>tax base and can result in significant revenue losses which often, means that those in the lower income

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>761 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>income bracket would be burdened with more taxes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is imperative for the Government to do tax reforms, streamline and re-evaluate 
<br/>some tax exemptions and incentives and encourage self-regulation to improve tax compliance with 
<br/>the  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Strategy  that  we  have  already  presented  to  Parliament.    I  know,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, some of them asked, where is your plan? They forgot that we have already presented to 
<br/>Parliament our Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy 2024-2026 which talks about spending more efficient, 
<br/>streamlining taxes and working on revenue enhancing measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have already said in other forums that the following will be the guiding policy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>principles in the medium term: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>We intend to widen the tax base by gradually removing exemptions and other distortions. 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Make the tax regime and tax administration even simpler to encourage tax compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve tax compliance and collection of tax areas, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, one of the principles of a good tax system is administrative simplicity.  If you 
<br/>do not adhere to that principle of taxation, then you could see a lot of leakages, a lot of distortions 
<br/>and a lot of waste and inefficiencies in the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  noted,  Mr.  Speaker,  before  I  conclude,  honourable  Premila  Kumar  talked  about  the 
<br/>former CEO, Mr. Visvanath Das, and thanked him for the performance that he was able to achieve 
<br/>but, obviously, she forgot to tell us, why he was removed.  Did he leave on his own? What was it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As I have pointed out, it is actually quite reach to hear from 
<br/>honourable Members from the other side about meritocracy, about appointments on Boards and  I 
<br/>know the honourable Leader of the Opposition talked about it, that we should appoint good people.  
<br/>We are appointing good people, Mr, Speaker, but their record I am not saying 100 percent but littered 
<br/>with appointments of cronies, people who supported the FijiFirst Party, people who funded them, so 
<br/>that is how they were doing it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to assure all our people, investors, our taxpayers that FRCS is going to 
<br/>become an efficient, customer friendly and an organisation that is going to be a very, very important 
<br/>arm  of  Government.    I  know,  when  I  asked,  where  is  the  money,  honourable  Premila  Kumar 
<br/>obviously,  did  not  understand  what  I  was  saying  when  I  was  talking  about  wastage,  when  I  was 
<br/>talking about deteriorating infrastructure, when I was talking about extravagance in spending and 
<br/>wastage, that is the question, where is the money? Why cannot people see the results of that - in the 
<br/>hospital, on the roads, in the water infrastructure? That is the point I was making, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me say, Mr. Speaker, that since the formation of the Coalition  Government,  there has 
<br/>been a sense of exuberance, there has been a sense of confidence, there has been a sense of optimism, 
<br/>there has been a sense of freedom in this country... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are confident, Mr. Speaker,  as a Government  - we  are 
<br/></span><span>talking to investors, we are talking to those who are waiting for a change in Government, they are 
<br/>coming on board and you will see.  the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Co-operatives  and Small  and Medium Enterprises, and Communications, is  absolutely on the dot 
<br/>when  he  says  that  we  know  that  we  have  created  that  confidence,  we  know  that  we  will  achieve 
<br/>significant economic growth in the years to come.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  And,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  most  important  thing  that  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will do is to manage the finances properly…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … cut on the wastages and make sure that we do not go on a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spending spree like what they did for eight years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember, Mr. Speaker, saying one time in the Budget that they were spending like drunks 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in a nightclub. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I also said that, at least, in the nightclubs, people were spending their own monies. The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>previous Government, Mr. Speaker, they were spending the taxpayers’ money... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is meandering.  Please, no more verbal diarrhoea, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stick to the point! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not like that, and I am sure 
<br/>that after a while, they will get used to this.  We are not going to keep on bragging about what they 
<br/>did, but it is important for the people of this country, while we are putting out our plans, while we 
<br/>are saying what we are doing, and they do not talk about what we have done already.  We did not 
<br/>wait for an election, we re-deployed funds, we helped more than 200,000 students in this country so 
<br/>that they could get to their schools without any problems with the appropriate gear.  They do not talk 
<br/>about  that,  because  they  know,  that  the  people  out  there  are  very  happy.    They  are  thanking  the 
<br/>Government for taking their initiatives so early in their time.  That is what the problem is.  I hope 
<br/>that after a while, they will get used to this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we have heard quite a mouthful from both 
<br/>sides of Parliament. I would like to thank the honourable Members of this august Parliament for their 
<br/>input and contribution.  Of course, we really appreciate what has been shared already and I do not 
<br/>want to repeat quite a lot of issues that has been shared.  We will take note of all the issues and the 
<br/>discussions.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the former honourable Members of this 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  for  their  contribution  and  the  current  Members  of  the 
<br/>Committee for their input.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
