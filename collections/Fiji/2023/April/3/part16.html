<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under Standing Order 6: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>        Suspension of Standing Orders  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>743 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as noted 
<br/>from the Order Paper, we still have three reports to debate, as well as our question time.  We, as the 
<br/>Government  side  actually  have  reduced  our  number  of  speakers  on  our  motions  hoping  that  the 
<br/>Opposition would do likewise, but they are very keen to speak, and we are very happy to hear them.  
<br/>So, we would love to accommodate that and have Parliament sit beyond 4.30 p.m. so that we can 
<br/>listen to the Opposition as they present to us.  So, we ask Parliament to support this motion to extend 
<br/>beyond 4.30 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I now call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if there is any. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing further to add. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- At this juncture, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when we resume, we will continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 3.58 p.m.
