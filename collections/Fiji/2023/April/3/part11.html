<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I am pleased to present the 
<br/></span><span>Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Fiji Airports 2020 
<br/></span><span>Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) which 
<br/>mandates  the  Committee  to  look  into  issues  related  to  health,  education,  social  services,  labour,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>normal process for report scrutiny, the current Committee was mandated by Parliament to review the 
<br/>Annual Report and report back on its findings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee took note of and deliberated on the previous Committee's 
<br/>work  on  the  mentioned  Report,  which  reiterated  the  work  done  by  the  previous  Committee  in 
<br/>reviewing  and  highlighting  the  contents  of  the  Fiji  Airports  Annual  Report  and  made 
<br/>recommendations on the anomalies noted in the Report.  It also highlighted the discussions held by 
<br/>the Committee with Fiji Airports in relation to the issues noted from its Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airports recorded a net operating profit before tax of $1.5 million for 
<br/>the year 2020.  Fiji Airports declared a total of $175 million in dividends over the last six years from 
<br/>2014 to 2019.  Despite this unprecedented dividend pay-out, the total shareholder’s equity stood at 
<br/>$448.6 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  operation  of  Fiji  Airports  was  severely  affected  by  the  prolonged  COVID-19  global 
<br/>pandemic crisis which negatively affected its revenue. However, it remained steadfast to resolve and 
<br/>emerge  stronger  as  an  organization,  having  gained  insights,  developed  strategies  and  prudently 
<br/>restructured its business model for the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament for all their hard work and their efforts which had greatly 
<br/>assisted our Committee in the completion of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to wish the Members of the current Standing Committee 
<br/>on Social Affairs the very best in this new term  of Parliament.  I also extend my gratitude to the 
<br/>former Chief Executive Officer of Fiji Airports, Mr Rowan Chalmers, and his staff for their assistance 
<br/>in this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report to Parliament and request all Members of Parliament to take note of the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121(5),  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hereby move:

<div><span>Review Report – Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the pleasure of tabling, 
<br/>on behalf of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, a Report on the review of 
<br/>the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2017-2018.  As a brief background, Sir, I wish 
<br/>to advise the members of this  august Parliament that the Annual Report was referred to Standing 
<br/>Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  of  the  previous  Parliament  which  undertook  the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Presentation of Reports of Committees  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>687 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>review of this Parliamentary Paper.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the previous Committee could not 
<br/>complete the work on this Annual Report due to the dissolution of the previous Parliament.  The 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  of  this  Parliament  then  inherited  the 
<br/>responsibility of the review when it was referred the Annual Report on 13</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think it would be necessary at this stage to briefly mention that Parliament’s 
<br/>administration  comes  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Secretary-General  to  Parliament  through  the 
<br/>direction of the Speaker of Parliament, and this administration includes the efficient, effective and 
<br/>economic  management  of  Parliament.  Supporting  the  functions  of  the  Secretary-General  to 
<br/>Parliament is the Secretariat known as the Department of Legislature, which is made up of two main 
<br/>Divisions namely - the Legislative Processes Services, now known as Legislative Services Division, 
<br/>and the Administration, Finance and IT Services, now known as the Corporate Services Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  back  to  the  review  work  itself,  the  Committee  resolved  that  it  would  be 
<br/>appropriate to continue from where our predecessors had left off and reviewed all the information 
<br/>that had been gathered by the previous Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted, Sir, that there were few pertinent issues identified which were communicated to 
<br/></span><span>the  Department  of  Legislature  for  clarification.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  issues  that  were 
<br/>identified were as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament has made tremendous strides in contributing to the achievement of certain 
<br/>SDGs such SDG5 and SDG10.  
<br/>That Parliament has been provided great support by the Department and donor partners 
<br/>such as the UNDP.  
<br/>That the work conditions for Members of Parliament and staff have been given priority 
<br/>which  has  allowed  for  Parliament  to  function  well.    Furthermore,  that  the  welfare  of 
<br/>Members of Parliament and staff had been given ample emphasis so as to maintain a safe 
<br/>work environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the conclusion of the review, the Committee noted that Parliament has done a commendable 
<br/>job  during  the  reported  period,  and  also  resolved  that  it  would  be  necessary  to  put  forth  new 
<br/>recommendations for consideration of the Department of Legislature and Parliament which includes:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The continuation of Parliament’s effort in promoting gender equality and empowerment.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Maintaining  the  efforts  regarding  SDG10  by  recommending  that  Parliament  consider 
<br/></span><span>improving  accessibility  to  the  complex  by  fast-tracking  the  installation  of  aids,  such  as 
<br/>direction signs and other means of accessibility which cater for persons who have mobility 
<br/>issues and that Parliament consider introducing other initiatives such as the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>
<br/>being published in different vernaculars we have in Fiji and in </span><span>Braille</span><span> which would promote 
<br/>inclusivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Recommending  that  a  clear  demarcation  of  the  Parliament  Precincts  is  considered  by 
<br/>Parliament  in  order  to  facilitate  easier  accessibility  to  Parliament  Precincts  which  also 
<br/>contributes to the achievement of SDG10.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Recommending the expeditious digitisation of all Parliamentary </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Parliamentary  space  and  infrastructure  whereby  space  should  be  provided  for  separate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Offices for the various Parties represented in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Awareness  and  public  engagement  programmes  for  Parliament  –  Meet  the  Speaker  and 
<br/>Parliament  Bus  -  be  revamped  to  include  all  Members  of  Parliament,  opening  up  more 
<br/>opportunities for engagement with the public.
