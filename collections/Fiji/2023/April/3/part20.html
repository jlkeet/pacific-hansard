<div><span>Recruitment of New Teachers in 2023 
<br/>(Question No. 42/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on what basis were new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>teachers recruited in the school calendar year of 2023 and how many? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question I would like 
<br/>to respond to what honourable Bala had stated this morning on some teachers being issued with five 
<br/>year contracts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Ministry of Education wishes to reassure Parliament and the teachers who were issued 
<br/>those contracts that the Ministry is rectifying that oversight by ensuring that the contracts be rectified 
<br/>to  be  in  line  with  the  Cabinet  Decision.    On  that,  on  behalf  of  the  Ministry,  I  apologise  for  that 
<br/>oversight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  question  that  has  been  asked,  I      seek  clarification  on  what  the 
<br/>intention of the question was because the question that was asked is somehow confusing. The basis 
<br/>of teachers recruited into schools in 2023.  Can the honourable Member clarify, is he requesting the 
<br/>criteria of appointment or the process of appointment because that is also linked to the second part 
<br/>of the question in terms of the number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need clarification on both. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to state that in vernacular </span><span>o koya e vaka e taro 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kila tiko mai, se taro vakilakila tiko</span><span>.  He already knows the answer to the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the former Head of Human Resources in the Ministry of Education, I 
<br/>have, no doubt, that already knows the answer to his question.  Maybe, he has been given information 
<br/>from some of his friends within the Ministry, some of whom used to campaign for him and the former 
<br/>Minister for Education in the recent General Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But not to worry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are almost finishing the investigation and we will be 
<br/>forced to consider taking actions as that taken by both the former Minister and that of the former 
<br/>head of HR during their time … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Then do it!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- … when they were terminating teachers who were allegedly to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be politically-involved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Do it, I challenge you.

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Or making political commentaries on social media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  obligated,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  respond  to  the  question  in  any  event  for  the  2023.    The 
<br/>Ministry of Education has reviewed the recruitment process and is still reviewing, that was previously 
<br/>adopted by the Opposition party while it was in government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The system adopted by the previous government, which is commonly known as the Open, 
<br/>Merit, Recruitment, Selection (OMRS).  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you may be aware, as a former Member 
<br/>of PAC and also the Members on that side of Parliament, one is not here now, they always raised 
<br/>concerns about the integrity and the fairness of this OMRS system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From that time, we had voiced concerns about the basis of this system as there were many 
<br/>instances, teachers who were reaching out, seeking assistance because they were not called for the 
<br/>job test, for example, for heads of school appointments, processes even when they have the relevant 
<br/>necessary qualifications and the years of experience or when their employment contracts were up for 
<br/>review because they were very short contracts, some six months, some one year, others three years 
<br/>and more.  Some teachers to this day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are still seeking justice for disparity in pay 
<br/>that they were given despite graduating at  the same time, they  were  appointed at  different  salary 
<br/>bands.  These issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are worrying and they point to a flawed system and I see that 
<br/>the honourable former Minister is shaking her head in agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Oh, seriously.  What else did I do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- They point to a system which promotes injustice, bias, nepotism, 
<br/>cronyism and creates a very toxic work environment that can only affect teacher performances and 
<br/>students learning.  Another example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the job test required as the main criteria for 
<br/>appointment which leaves aside important elements like the length of time a teacher serves in the 
<br/>field, experience in school and student management as heads of school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  start  appointing  people  based  on  exams  we  have  reached  an 
<br/>illogical place in our management of human resources and there can be no justification as to why it 
<br/>was even practised in the first place.  The teacher unions have raised objections on these injustices 
<br/>and had pleaded for a better system but of course the arrogance of the former Minister, thinking their 
<br/>leadership would last forever, assumed a position of it is my way or the highway.  One very simple 
<br/>lesson for the former Minister and her colleague, honourable Hem Chand is to remember that they 
<br/>are dealing with human beings who also have a tipping point.  Even more important is to remember 
<br/>that when we are appointed to these positions of power, we are servants of the people, elected by 
<br/>them and they are the same people who will judge us come the next election. So, treat them with 
<br/>dignity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  undertaking  a  review  of  the  OMRS  system  in 
<br/>consultation with the Public Service Commission and its relevance, and the review will accommodate 
<br/>the changes, the policy of government like the removal of contracts and the extension of retirement 
<br/>age to 60 along with the now removed “No Jab, No Job Policy.”  We also continuously highlighted 
<br/>the shortage of teachers in the primary and secondary levels and we are working hard to resolving 
<br/></span><span>these shortages.  As we have always publicly acknowledged, announced, the continuous shortage 
<br/></span><span>that is something that the Ministry of Education has always been challenged with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  basis  of  recruitment  for  new  teachers  in  2023,  one  is  through  resignation. 
<br/>There were 377 in total to-date.  Number two is deaths.  There were unfortunately 28 deaths in total 
<br/>that occurred thus creating vacancies.  Number three, there were also new establishments due to new 
<br/>schools.  There were also new streams added to existing schools.  For instance, there were eight-

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>777 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>teacher  primary  school  and  four-teacher  secondary  school  recruited  for  Industrial  Arts,  Maths, 
<br/>Physics, Computer and </span><span>Vosa Vaka Viti </span><span>lessons.  There were also recruitments to temporarily fill in 
<br/>for  official  leaves,  for  those  undergoing  in-service  study  leave  or  leave  without  pay  or  maternity 
<br/>leave, et cetera There were also teachers who had opted to retire despite the retirement age being 
<br/>extended  to  60,  fortunately  76  teachers  have  been  re-engaged  with  two  for  ECE,  50  for  primary 
<br/>education and 24 for secondary education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had no intention to ask him any question but he 
<br/>actually compelled me to ask a question now.  He is very well aware that the Fiji Teachers Union has 
<br/>written to the honourable Prime Minister regarding the appointments he is doing in his Ministry and 
<br/>in the same breath he is saying that the unions are very happy. This statement came out very clearly 
<br/>in the newspapers and it was reported.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My concern is, why did Fiji Teachers Union write to the honourable Prime Minister and not 
<br/>to the Minister?  The reason is, they do not faith in this Minister despite the General-Secretary sitting 
<br/>there, who used to advocate for fairness but he is not doing anything about it.  My question is, can 
<br/>the Minister explain ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am not the General-Secretary. Please 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>withdraw that statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Former, former.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You didn’t say former.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking about integrity, fairness of the system, honourable Minister, can the Minister explain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how non-civil servants were recruited by the Ministry in the acting position?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  question is related to teacher appointments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Non-teacher appointments, she can raise it in another sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, school started on 30</span><span>th</span><span> January, it is very surprising to 
<br/>see that after two months  of teaching  and learning, some schools have teacher shortages.   It was 
<br/>reported in the media last week that some schools in the rural areas and outer islands have teacher 
<br/>shortages and due to this, students are teaching themselves.  This reflects badly on the Ministry and 
<br/>the honourable Minister.  Can the honourable Minister confirm how many schools have shortage of 
<br/>teachers and by when this issue will be addressed?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  happy  to  provide  the  honourable 
<br/>Member  with  the  statistics  that  he  has  asked  if  given  the  opportunity  to  present  it  as  a  Written 
<br/>Question.  On the issue of shortage of teachers, he was the former head of HR, the mess he has created 
<br/>led to this.  He should understand that.

<div><span>Update of the Geodetic Datum 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 43/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the upgrade of the Geodetic Datum? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="97">Page 97</a></div>
<div><span>778 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. The Cabinet in 2015 passed the resolution that started the modernisation of Fiji’s geodetic 
<br/>datum.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the geodetic datum is a coordinate system and set up reference points as it 
<br/>relates to planet earth.  It is not really an everyday language for most of us but I suppose the best 
<br/>example that we can use is that the datum allows applications like the Global Positioning System or 
<br/>GPS to operate.  As such the upgrade of the datum will determine the accuracy of that application 
<br/>and ensure for example, our air and sea navigation system is positioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the modernisation of Fiji’s geodetic datum will position Fiji to comply with 
<br/>international  standards  and  its  requirements  whereby  changing,  that  is  the  ongoing  work  at  the 
<br/>moment is changing the datum from model 1972WGS72 to WGS84.  That is the present work that 
<br/>is being undertaken by the Ministry at this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adopting the international standard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will ensure Fiji’s compatibility across 
<br/>various geographic information systems that are used nationally, regionally and also at a global level.  
<br/>The current datum when compared to international levels has poor accuracy and with a significant 
<br/>difference or variance between five to twenty metres depending on the positions and locations. An 
<br/>example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this means that if we use the GPS in Fiji to locate a car, the information 
<br/>which the GPS will give will approximately be five to twenty metres off the actual position on the 
<br/>ground or if airplanes enter Fiji’s airspace, pilots will have to switch on their switch from autopilot 
<br/>to manual in order to steer the plane safely onto the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  four  phases  into  this  project.    Phase  1  which  includes 
<br/>procurement  and  construction,  that  has  been  completed  between  2016  and  2018.  Construction  of 
<br/>eight hearts and pillars that presently at the moment shelter our Global Navigation Satellite System 
<br/>(GNSS)  and  they  continue  to  operate  from  reference  points  that  are  located  in  Taveuni,  Labasa, 
<br/>Nabouwalu,  Koro  Island,  Kadavu,  Lakeba,  Ono-i-Lau  and  Rotuma.    Those  projects  had  been 
<br/>completed.  Then procurements of five GNSS equipment, additionally three GNSS equipment was 
<br/>donated by the Republic of China which was commissioned on 9</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase two involves the completion of the survey field campaign and synchronisation of field 
<br/>data conducted between 2019 to 2020.  This has also been concluded which involves a total of 62 
<br/>reference points were observed continuously for seven days and a total of 87 secondary reference 
<br/>points which were observed on a six-hourly basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase three, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has also  been completed and it involves data release report 
<br/>produced from survey field data, online transmission of all geodetic survey data and information to 
<br/>Geoscience  Australia  through  Pacific  Geospatial  Surveying  Council,  and also  taking  advice  from 
<br/>Geoscience Australia to assist in the provision not only of geodetic datum but the physical height 
<br/>datum  and  geoid  model  transformation  parameters  standards,  technical  and  documentation  and 
<br/>educational materials at our Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase four, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is the final phase is pending and that requires a final and 
<br/>detailed  process  to  complete  the  project.  This  phase  involves  activities  like  the  formulation  and 
<br/>completion of a Fiji Geospatial Reference System Roadmap undertaking the national adjustments to 
<br/></span><span>create the new Fiji Geodetic Datum and development of transformation parameters from historical 
<br/></span><span>datum to new datum.  Discussion and agreement on height datum and geoid model development to 
<br/>create a new Fiji height datum. This will enable the datum to also capture the average height of the 
<br/>entire ocean surface, that is also measuring distance above our sea level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some challenges Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I would propose that as a way forward in 
<br/>answering  the  question.    There  are  technical  issues  that  are  experienced  throughout  these  CORS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="98">Page 98</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>779 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>systems in Fiji. Systemic faults on the internet connectivity for the CORS stations.  The Ministry has 
<br/>support from ITC to evaluate service providers for internet services in which </span><span>Walesi</span><span> and </span><span>Digicel</span><span> had 
<br/>been awarded service right for the outer islands CORS stations.  Technical capacity. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, is the lack of know-how in the field of geodetic.  So, at the moment Mr. Speaker, Sir, assistance 
<br/>has been pursued with Geoscience Australia to provide training and those involved in the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the infrastructure safety and maintenance is also a challenge where 
<br/>periodic maintenance of the compound in which our CORS stations are built needs to be maintained 
<br/>and in doing so, we have four offices altogether and one IT person that do periodic check on all of 
<br/>our CORS stations to make sure that they are compliant and also giving us the feed of information 
<br/>that we need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the inclusion of the vertical datum will enable the Ministry to measure rates 
<br/>of subsidence or land sinking which is the result of development of coastal erosion and ground water 
<br/>withdrawals.  For instance, if the Government does not have accurate elevation information about 
<br/>these routes, hurricanes and waterways, evacuees during emergencies may be trapped in fast rising 
<br/>water situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of this project, the Ministry has only been focusing on 
<br/>developing horizonal datum, the inclusion of high datum as advised by Geoscience Australia which 
<br/>will also  then allow  Fiji  to  be  well placed to  take advantage of the widespread benefit of having 
<br/>satellite based positions systems in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, honourable Minister thank you for the explanation.  With 
<br/>respect to the transformation that is actually happening, you mentioned the World Geodetic System 
<br/>has been used.  I do understand also that you have the Fiji Map Grid which is 1986.  From what I 
<br/>understand, there is a transformative exercise into the international terrestrial reference frame which 
<br/>is going to be the final frame that we are going to use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In simple term, Sir, what we are asking is, what is actually going to be the benefit that we will 
<br/>accrue to every Fijian and specifically to the Maritime Sector considering that we have rising sea 
<br/>levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, I mentioned when I answered the question that 
<br/>what would happen when we improve the system in its position.    The position of information that 
<br/>was going to be available to every citizen of this country.  When we improve the system, we would 
<br/>get rid of the five to 20 metres variation or variance that presently exist in our GPS at the moment.  
<br/>Once we update it and it comes to par with international standards, we can be sure about locations 
<br/>and positions, that would be able to help us predict things that we need to do in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  follow-on  question  Sir.    I  know  that  our 
<br/>navigation charts are already on World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84).  The land maps are on 72 
<br/>and migrating from that datum to the international datum which is WGS84 will mean that our maps 
<br/>may change, the land maps that we have because we are going to use a new datum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, will that affect the nautical charts that we have, given there is a little overlap 
<br/></span><span>between our land, maps and our nautical charts because in nautical charts, the tidal reading is taken 
<br/>right up to our foreshore or have they consulted with our Hydrographic Unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- From my briefing on how it will affect, how we see things at 
<br/>the moment, there is a possibility that with the upgrade of the system it obviously is going to affect 
<br/>how maps are going to be read.  But that, of course,  is something that the Ministry is going to have 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to work with stakeholders to make sure that our map systems in the upgrade of the system that we 
<br/>have is going to resolve all of the unintended consequences of bringing in a new system over and 
<br/>above and outlay of an old system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Sir, a supplementary question.  Can the honourable Minister explain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the difference between a geodetic datum and map projections? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, I could not get that question whether it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was supplementary to the main question that was asked by honourable Tubuna? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could we note that as a new question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- No, it is not a new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We are talking controls here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the Ministry staff and the honourable 
<br/>Minister.  They are very glad to see that we are finally able to get the information, the data across to 
<br/>Geoscience Australia - something that the team have been working for a long time.  I am glad that 
<br/>we are getting to that stage and very soon we will have the new datum that will make things a bit 
<br/>more accurate.  Once the new datum is in, there will of course be policies, legislations, regulations 
<br/>that have to be adjusted as such. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not think you are probably in a position here to decide what those will be.  In the future 
<br/>to make sure that the accessibility of this information is more accessible to users, there might be a 
<br/>need to intensify the network of the core stations.  I am just wondering if there are already plans in 
<br/>place to intensify the network to make sure that the information is more accessible to those that were 
<br/>wanting to use those CORS station data?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, that was something that the Ministry staff had 
<br/>briefed me about when I assumed the office at the Ministry for Lands and Mineral Resources.  There 
<br/>is a challenge at the CORS  Stations and I can assure the honourable Member that, that would be 
<br/>something that we would consider to make sure that it is improved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budgetary Allocation – Overseas Sports Tour 
<br/>(Question No. 44/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports inform Parliament what types of 
<br/>travel are included in the Ministry’s Budget Allocation for the Minister and Ministry staff to 
<br/>undertake overseas sport tours?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  former  Assistant  Minister  for  Youth  and 
<br/>Sports for his question.  The travel budget for the Ministry has fund allocated for all official travel 
<br/></span><span>locally and overseas (for staff and the Minister) are aligned to youth and sports purposes.  However, 
<br/></span><span>Cabinet approves  all overseas travel for Ministers and funds are reimbursed from the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance for Minister’s overseas travel.  The Permanent Secretary for Youth and Sports approves all 
<br/>overseas travel and funding for Ministry staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a sports supplementary question.  Does the 
<br/>budget for sports tours of staff of the Ministry allow them to go or is it programmed as such if they

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>781 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have to go to two events overseas, they go to one in North America, have to fly back to Fiji and then 
<br/>fly back to North America.  Is that the normal way in which such trips are planned or is that out of 
<br/>the ordinary and would that be an excess wastage of Government resources? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the supplementary question.  I 
<br/>was directed by the honourable Prime Minister to accompany the IRB Sevens tournament on 25</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>and 26</span><span>th</span><span> February for LA and 3</span><span>rd</span><span> to 5</span><span>th</span><span> March to Vancouver 7s respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji 7s team is one of the most successful rugby 7s teams in the World 
<br/>and history shows our Fiji has performed at the world class level, winning numerous rugby 7s titles.  
<br/>By  far,  the  great  accomplishment  has  been  winning  the  Gold  Metal  at  both  the  2016  Summer 
<br/>Olympics Games in Brazil and 2020 Olympics Games in Japan.  Fiji has been continuously praised 
<br/>for natural talents on the international stage and it seems the Fijian flare has become a must have 
<br/>accessory for every nation.

<div><span>Fiji is also famously known as friendly and the national rugby team as true Ambassadors of 
<br/>the </span><span>bula</span><span> spirit.  Fiji Men’s Rugby 7s Team won another Olympic Gold Medal at 2020 Tokyo Summer 
<br/>Olympics while the Women’s Fijian Team stunned the World with a Bronze Medal.  In simple terms, 
<br/>Sir, from the directive of the honourable Prime Minister, I had to be in attendance with the Fiji Rugby 
<br/>Team in both the Los Angeles and Vancouver legs of the Rugby 7s.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  was  the  role  of  the  honourable  Minister  at 
<br/>HSBC World Rugby 7s Series Tournament in Los Angeles and Vancouver which he attended at the 
<br/>cost of taxpayers money and how did Fiji benefit through his attendance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  Apart 
<br/>from  taking  time  to  empower  the  players  and  watch  their  performance,  I  met  with  Mr.  Richard 
<br/>Sharma a Nike representative in Vancouver, visited the famous Sydney Cricket Ground with a tour 
<br/>of their sports museum and the new Allianz Stadium. The Ministry is considering the setup of a sports 
<br/>museum under the Fiji Sports Council to commemorate the contribution of sports and sports players 
<br/>in our development as a nation, for which a Cabinet paper will be submitted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I met some Fijians in Vancouver who were interested in investing back to Fiji, met with a 
<br/>representative from Pacific Trade Invest of Australia and how we could address some youth issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister confirm that from  Los 
<br/>Angeles you had to come back to Nadi and then go back to Vancouver because someone in your 
<br/>office failed to organise your ticket from Los Angeles, is it true? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Sir, I thank you for the question. It is true that I had to come back to 
<br/>Sydney  for  my  visa  to  go  to  Vancouver  because  it  was  at  a  short  notice.    Am  I  answering  your 
<br/>question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You do not have to worry about that honourable Minister.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SPARTAN Event? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Tunabuna for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond, I wanted to share with honourable Members of Parliament 
<br/>and those watching us today that over the weekend we welcomed back our direct flight from Hong 
<br/>Kong and today  we  are  welcoming  back Narita,  Japan. This  is a key milestone, not  only for Fiji 
<br/>Airways and the tourism industry but also for business, investments, trade and the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the sitting of January 2023, Cabinet endorsed 
<br/>the hosting of SPARTAN Trifecta event in Fiji for a three-year partnership - 2023, 2024 and 2025. 
<br/>The first Spartan event will be held from 9</span><span>th</span><span> to 12</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, SPARTAN is a series of obstacle races of varying distances, attracting  a wide 
<br/>global audience from the fitness minded to the seasoned elite athletes. Each SPARTAN event is held 
<br/>at unique locations that combines terrain and unique natural features like creeks and mountains as 
<br/>well as manmade obstacles, a lot like a challenge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many ways to market a destination, whether it is a music festival, 
<br/>sporting, religious gathering, cavalry events or major conference.  We have done in the past and we 
<br/>have seen its benefits.  So, by bringing SPARTAN into Fiji, which is new to Fiji, we are showcasing 
<br/>our ability to host global events and reach global audience. Participants come in numbers, often with 
<br/>their families and spend money in our economy.  They then go back to the countries and share their 
<br/>experience, attracting more visitors and often becoming repeat visitors themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been working very closely with Tourism Fiji and the SPARTAN 
<br/>Team in the lead up to the November event.  On 6</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, the Ministry signed an MOU 
<br/>with SPARTAN Australia setting the framework of a partnership with the organisers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since signing the MOU, we are now negotiating the legal agreement which 
<br/>shall outline the responsibilities and expectations in the event delivery.  As endorsed by Cabinet, we 
<br/>have now established a Public Private Sector Steering Committee made up of our Ministry, Ministry 
<br/>of Finance, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, iTaukei Land Trust Board, 
<br/>Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service,  Tourism  Fiji,  Fiji  Airways  and  the  Fiji  Hotel  and  Tourism 
<br/>Association.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the first Steering Committee meeting and tomorrow together with 
<br/>the Ministry of iTaukei  Affairs to  undertake a site visit  to  ensure all protocols  are followed with 
<br/>respect  to  landowners.    Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  tourism  has  produced  a  SPARTAN 
<br/>promotional video which has been released on their pages.  We have also developed a page on the 
<br/>Fiji  Tourism  website,  for  all  things  SPARTAN  essentially  putting  out  the  message  on  why  do 
<br/>SPARTAN in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an industry webinar online meeting was held last week with Tourism Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  Airways  and  the  organisers  where  we  spoke  about  the  event  to  move  the  industry  partners 
<br/>involved.  Four properties have already released spartan packages, they are Vomo, Tropica Island 
<br/>Resort, Plantation Island Resort and Marriot. So, there is a lot of excitements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  this  year  we  are  looking  up  to  3,000  participants  from  Fiji’s  key  source  
<br/>markets staying throughout Nadi and the Coral Coast regions.  Directly in terms of economic benefit, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>783 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the event organisers using its moral forecast total revenue, over approximately $12 million per annum 
<br/>without a multiplier.  This includes an estimated $1.2 million in spend by the event organisers and 
<br/>$10.8 million in participant spend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now if you take a very basic calculation, based on an estimate of 3,000 participants, staying 
<br/>at least four nights, we are looking at approximate return on investment of $9.3 million. This looks 
<br/>at the departure tracks, accommodation, food and beverages, transport and airfare and this is without 
<br/>applying any multiplier.  On media value as I mentioned, the event has been forecasted forecasted on 
<br/>quarter one, media value of $2.750 million. Fiji will be the exclusive trifactor location for Australia, 
<br/>New Zealand and the Pacific, so a great marketing exposure for the Fiji  brand. Like other major 
<br/>events, the event will be showcased through strategic television advertising, broadcast, social media, 
<br/>campaigns, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Indirectly, local suppliers and communities will be engaged in construction, catering, apparel, 
<br/>electronics, transport and entertainment.  The event will look at various locations such as Sabeto so 
<br/>that we spread the benefits and exposure.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue work with the 
<br/>SPARTAN organisers through the Steering Committee to ensure that the event delivers a maximum 
<br/>exposure and benefits for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is kind of two-folds and I am not sure if 
<br/>you are going to allow it.  Firstly, how much is the input from the Fijian Government with respect to 
<br/>this particular event?   Secondly, I did not quite catch what the marketing dollars gain in this is going 
<br/>to be?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our contribution to this is $750,000 a year for three 
<br/>years.  You look at the return on investment on that, you are talking about $12 million in actual spend, 
<br/>not taking into account the multiplier.  The multiplier is the way it multiplies in the economy.  So, 
<br/>dollar to dollar, $750,000 for $12 million return in direct receipts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other question was the marketing spend.  The marketing spend is, can I share this with 
<br/>the honourable Member  later on.  The medium  value, Mr. Speaker, is  $2.750 million on the first 
<br/>quarter alone on marketing spend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  quick  supplementary  question  to  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  What sort of numbers are we looking at?  Although I am aware 
<br/>of what will be online in terms of viewers, but how many people are we expecting roughly on our 
<br/>shores?  The only reason why I am asking this, Sir, is because of room capacity, and given the influx 
<br/>of whatever into the country, because this is one of our constraints as well when it comes to hosting 
<br/>major events? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted it is going to be in November.  
<br/>November  is  one  of  the  low  months  for  Fiji.    The  whole  of  Nadi  and  Coral  Coast  will  be 
<br/>accommodating these 3,000 people.  There will be people who will stay in Five Star Resorts and 
<br/>there are those who stay in backpackers.  Nadi, Denarau, Nadi Airport environment and the Coral 
<br/>Coast have a range of accommodation to accommodate these 3,000 people during this period.  So, in 
<br/></span><span>terms of accommodation, we can cater to these kind of numbers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just relate to a situation where we had the Golden Oldies in Nadi.  
<br/>The whole of Nadi for one week was just full of the delegates that when they left Nadi, we felt like 
<br/>there was a big vacuum in Nadi.  Such was the impact during that particular week when we had the 
<br/>Golden Oldies.  I see something similar during this period.  It is going to be huge for Nadi.  The

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cafes, taxis,  it is just about everyone could feel the impact of these 3,000 people staying in Nadi and 
<br/>the Coral Coast during his period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to see the measures being taken for sports 
<br/>tourism and other forms of tourism to bring in much needed revenue.  One of the things that I am 
<br/>interested in is the amount of exposure that Fiji gets as a result.  If you recall, not too many years 
<br/>ago, we used to have the Fiji International Golf.  We had people like Vijay Singh and Ernie Els come. 
<br/>There used to be a lot of derogatory and negative comments about it, but I think the media exposure 
<br/>that Fiji got was phenomenal, especially when you have large names like that coming to the country.  
<br/>I am just thinking, compared to that kind of media exposure and the long-term benefits of that kind 
<br/>of exposure, what kind of media exposure worldwide globally will result as a result of this SPARTAN 
<br/>compared perhaps to events like the Fiji International Golf? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SPARTAN people are very committed.  As I 
<br/>said, some are elite athletes.  Fiji is the centre for this during the next three years, and they have 
<br/>followers in the United States of America and North America.  So, we see it as quite huge in terms 
<br/>of the exposure within the SPARTAN community, which itself is quite huge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trends of Domestic Violence 
<br/>(Question No. 46/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the trends of domestic violence up to the present day? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>There is a lot of data involved in this question and actually the source is the Fiji Country Gender 
<br/>Assessment, which I had spoken about last week, which has been launched.  Also, the data itself is 
<br/>available to Members, if they wish to get that data.  Suffice to say, I think the trends of domestic 
<br/>violence in our country to this day is something that is a national shame.  We have higher than the 
<br/>average of the world average, which is one out of three women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two out of three women in Fiji faces some form of violence.  In fact, it should be something 
<br/>that we as a Parliament should pursue and support to declare it a national crisis.  It has really reached 
<br/>that stage and it has been a number of years that governments have tried to tackle this issue, including 
<br/>the previous government, and of course this is something that has fallen upon the Government now.  
<br/>It is really worrying in terms of our trend being above the global average.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just some very quick statistics on this, is that apart from the two out of three 
<br/>women who face some sort of intimate partner violence, the forms of violence that are prevalent and 
<br/>severe are hitting, kicking, driving, choking, burning or being threatened with a weapon.  From these 
<br/>statistics, these are 15 percent of the women state that they attacked while pregnant.  While pregnant, 
<br/>they are being punched or kicked in the abdomen.  The proportion of women who have been beaten 
<br/>during pregnancy is significantly higher among younger women.  So, it is increasing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nearly six in 10 women over their lifetimes are subjected to emotional violence.  I talked 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about physical violence, now we are talking about emotional violence.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The men who exert control over their spouses, it talks about controlling behaviour.  The most 
<br/>common form  of sexual intimate partner violence is  marital  rape, and that  is  in  the statistics too.  
<br/>Marital rape is the most common form. Also, Mr. Speaker, women who face economic abuse, report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="104">Page 104</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>785 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that about 28 percent of women face economic abuse from a husband or </span><span>de facto</span><span> partner either they 
<br/>forcibly take their savings or earnings, or they refuse to provide money for food and expenses, and 
<br/>so this is the form of economic abuse that women face.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we know the data that the Fiji Police Force puts out every year and the crime 
<br/>against women and children.  The biggest portion, Mr. Speaker, 73 percent are between the age of 
<br/>18 to 35.  So again, they are in the youth population, the young women who are facing this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, very quickly just on the Domestic Violence Helpline in terms of the number of 
<br/>calls that we receive.  Of course, there was a spike in it during COVID-19 2020 and then in 2021, it 
<br/>doubled in just the first half of the year from 2020.  Again, Mr. Speaker, in 2021 which is again the 
<br/>recent  statistics  provided,  women  are  reporting,  there  is  an  increase  in  reporting,  but  they  are 
<br/>reporting increased aggressiveness and intensified physical violence, and this includes burnt with hot 
<br/>soup, punched, kicked or dragged by the throat, whipped by their husband on horseback, threatened 
<br/>with knives or other objects such as bricks, stones, gardening spades, garlic pounder and firewood.  
<br/>So, Mr. Speaker, the data does not lie. It is actual data that is available from the Bureau of Statistics 
<br/>and also collected through the Domestic Violence Helpline and also our workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The business cost for violence, we lose 10 workdays in a year because of violence faced by 
<br/>women  and  again,  those  who  are  worried  about  women  facing  violence,  they  say  that  they  are 
<br/>distracted or unwell or feel tired from work or they are late or absent from work because they are 
<br/>worried about the person going through it and supporting colleagues also face some sort of violence 
<br/>as a result of it.  They get the shrapnel or collateral damage being involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are things that the Ministry is doing at the moment which includes, we are 
<br/>very excited about launching the National Action Plan to prevent violence against all women and 
<br/>girls.  This makes Fiji the first Pacific Island country and only one of two countries globally to have 
<br/>a National Action Plan to prevent violence against women before it starts, Mr. Speaker, and this is 
<br/>yet to come to Cabinet and to be approved but it is again based on data and evidence, about the root 
<br/>cause of violence.  What is the root cause of violence? It is patriarchy, Mr. Speaker.  The entitlement 
<br/>that power has over women and women are not entitled to the same rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry would really like to see this is as something that we can declare as 
<br/>a national crisis because of what our women and girls face, and we hope that Parliament will support 
<br/>this, should we bring it here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  your  response.    How  does  your 
<br/>Ministry  engage  with  marginalised  communities  who  may  face  additional  barriers  to  accessing 
<br/>services and support?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you for the question, honourable Member.  The Ministry is 
<br/>now undertaking working with service providers in the community.  We are actually yet to bring 
<br/>Domestic Violence Shelter Guidelines to be approved so that our service providers who are in the 
<br/>community can provide shelters for our women who are facing violence, as well as our children who 
<br/>are a part of the families that face violence.  The shelter guidelines are needed, Mr. Speaker, because 
<br/></span><span>we have homes that have opened up but yet to come under the Ministry officially, so that we are able 
<br/></span><span>to monitor and ensure that the services provided or the guidelines of those shelters are proper and 
<br/>meet certain standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are also looking at the issue of children who are involved in or caught up in 
<br/>violence.  We hope that we are able to also encourage more employers to look at providing childcare 
<br/>in  workplaces.    It  is  something  that  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  is  working  with  the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministry and that will also need Cabinet approval but it will be funded by the employer so that the 
<br/>children are at workplaces then if mum or dad are working then they are not worried so much about 
<br/>what  is  happening  to  their children, they become more productive and we hope too  that that will 
<br/>reduce the amount of child abuse that we also face which is four out of five children.   </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, honourable Minister.  My question is, are there 
<br/>any  plans  to  increase  the  funding  for  domestic  violence  in  terms  of  the  prevention  and  response 
<br/>programme in the coming years?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member.  We are very excited to announce 
<br/>that our bilateral partners have come on board to fund the roll-out of this National Action Plan to 
<br/>prevent gender-based violence.  Our visit to New York, I was able to meet with our partners there 
<br/>who have committed between $3 million to $5 million in the next few years to roll-out this Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Plan  also  includes  a  very  effective  communications  campaign  because  we  need  to 
<br/>inculcate this information to the public through an effective communications campaign.  We also got 
<br/>to revisit our school curriculum so that we can educate our children about the need to prevent violence 
<br/>in our homes and in our families.  So that is the kind of funding we are looking at to supplement what 
<br/>the Government is committing in the financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my  question to the honourable Minister is related to 
<br/>the conflicting information that gets exposed to the public.  For example, recently we heard from Fiji 
<br/>Women’s  Crisis  Centre,  they  claimed  that  because  of  the  new  Government,  domestic  violence 
<br/>reduced whereas the Fiji Police Force came forward with their data saying that there is an increase 
<br/>in domestic violence. So, my question to you is – how do you deal with this conflicting information 
<br/>when it comes to advocacy and you are trying to change the behaviour?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Member. I understand the information that 
<br/>came from the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre was that there was a reduction in calls received from the 
<br/>Domestic Violence Helpline, not necessarily a drop in domestic violence.  They saw a drop in the 
<br/>calls that were received from the Domestic Violence Helpline which the Government gives a grant 
<br/>for, so that is part of their reporting to the Ministry.  They just reported it factually, as far as that 
<br/>opinion that was given, that is not the opinion of the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We still need to look at the statistics as is and importantly working with our stakeholders like 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force as well as the other service providers and to work together because the numbers, 
<br/>according to the Fiji Country Gender Assessment and the information received, we are still sitting at 
<br/>two out of three women who are facing violence.  We really need to do something about that and I 
<br/>hope that is something that we as a Parliament, we as legislators and as a whole country can come 
<br/>together to address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one  supplementary question for the honourable 
<br/>Minister.  Can the honourable Minister for Women provide more clarity because she spoke about her 
<br/>recent trip to the United States of America on the UN Commission on the Status of Women Session.  
<br/>Can she please provide more clarity on the outcome and output from this event?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you honourable Member for that question.  I think this is a 
<br/>new question but the Commission on the Status of Women, I am planning to address, I think there is 
<br/>a question later in the week than I will be able to address that question and give full information on 
<br/>the outcomes of event.

<div><span>Status of the National Security Strategy 
<br/>(Question No. 47/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the status of the National Security Strategy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. For the benefit of those that perhaps, I am sure we would all understand the national security 
<br/>strategy but for the benefit of those that do not quite understand the subject, it is the overarching 
<br/>strategy that sets the agenda and policy intentions of government with respect to national security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  moment  Fiji  does  not  have  one  purely  because  there  have  been 
<br/>processes in the past where national security strategy was going to be established.  That had gone 
<br/>through certain processes but did not eventually complete the process of Cabinet to endorse it and 
<br/>then from which the national security strategy would be derived and everyone works from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  earlier  on  at  the  beginning  of  this  Parliament,  I  had  made  known  Government’s 
<br/>intentions that we would like to conduct a Security and Defence Review and the outcome of that will 
<br/>also develop the national security strategy.  This has been discussed both with the traditional and 
<br/>non-traditional security areas that affect Fiji generally as a nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  national  security  strategy  in  the  recent  past  has  been  led  by  defense  and  uniform 
<br/>personnel. This one that we are going to do is going to be civilian led and will involve a committee 
<br/>that  will  lead  the  process.  At  the  moment,  I  have  a  terms  of  reference  that  is  on  my  desk  that  is 
<br/>actually  taking  shape  and  is  undergoing  consultation  in  terms  of  what  will  become  the  terms  of 
<br/>reference that will guide this process at the end. So, everyone in Fiji including our friends from the 
<br/>other side of Parliament will have the opportunity to air their views with regards to the defense and 
<br/>security aspects of our nation.  Obviously, these things are interesting subjects today, I think in our 
<br/>region,  in  the  whole  of  the  Southern  Hemisphere  is  looking  up  to  perhaps  worried  about  what  is 
<br/>happening on the Taiwan’s Gate and how things have developed and how things have shaped security 
<br/>in our region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen how the big players have come down lately, we know how the non-traditional 
<br/>sectors have affected the way that the whole of our national life has been affected in the past. The 
<br/>national security covers not just defense or security in general, it is the area that we know but covers 
<br/>essentially every other aspect of all of our national life.  So, we will have the opportunity to do that 
<br/>and like I said, when that process is ready and hopefully we can develop something that will take 
<br/>place this year and then by next year we should be able to put through the parliamentary papers to 
<br/>discuss it in the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you honourable Minister for your response, but probably I 
<br/>will just ask one quick supplementary question.  You have talked about traditional and non-traditional 
<br/>threats.  Non-traditional threats particularly two that are of concern to us not only to us but perhaps 
<br/></span><span>this is consistent in the region is on climate change and cybercrime.  I want some explanation from 
<br/></span><span>you honourable Minister on perhaps how this will be approached particularly given the significance 
<br/>and the relevance of these two non-traditional threats, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for the question - very relevant.  Obviously, on the issue of climate change, we are looking at the 
<br/>security of the world as a whole and we are looking at Fiji as a nation. With respect to climate change 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in general throughout the world. So, this is also going to form part of that review in terms of how Fiji 
<br/>will best attack it, I know in other areas of the economy in terms of the climate mitigation fund and 
<br/>what has been done through the COP process is going to provide us with the kind of information 
<br/>which best suits us, so the Committee will also look at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of cybercrime, I think I addressed a little bit of this last time. This is one big area of 
<br/>vulnerability today as the honourable Leader of the Opposition would know. We are so vulnerable 
<br/>in that area that we have threats everyday.  I think we had a short experience of ITC getting hacked 
<br/>the last time and the affected areas like iTLTB in their data.  One of the major concerns is that there 
<br/>are many cybercrime attacks in Fiji that are not reported particularly in the business sector because 
<br/>they  worry  about  that.    If  they  make  this  public,  then  the  integrity  of  their  business  becomes 
<br/>questioned as well.  So, we realise this gap that we have, we do not have the national capacity right 
<br/>now to deal with it.  It is something that every other nation is dealing with ongoing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a team that is coming down from Canberra from the border force, as I said the other 
<br/>said to try and help us out on how we can at least fix that part. But there are other areas that we have 
<br/>to invest in, and the Committee is really going to look at that because as part of the national defence 
<br/>and security review, this is one other area that they will look at - cybercrime and also drug is a big 
<br/>one.  How do we deal with this non-traditional area that really is affecting our national security and 
<br/>our children and we are talking about domestic violence, what is the cause of that?  So, those are 
<br/>other range of areas that the Committee can look at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick supplementary question to the Minister, 
<br/>talking about national security strategy and the defence review.  Is it happening concurrently or are 
<br/>you going to go for the strategy first before you do the defence review? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is the strategy that needs to be defined first, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and part or born out of that is looking at defence as a whole and how we translate. As I said earlier, 
<br/>civil primacy is important which is the whole area that the government is looking at - the primacy of 
<br/>civil power in looking at defence traditionally as we look at it.  So, this is one area where Government 
<br/>is  looking at  to  review the defence  functions that  we have  right now.  There is  no hiding behind 
<br/>anything, that is, we have already discussed that at many levels and how best to do that, there is a 
<br/>constitutional role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not want to go in too much detail because that is really the work of the Committee to 
<br/>look at it, but the defence has become part of it and not only defence, even though wider look at, the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force at the moment we are working on a process called “Policies of Restoring Blue”.  
<br/>So, restoring blue is looking at how to relook at the culture and the professionalism of the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force to take it back to the way that traditionally the police would see it.  So that is one part of it 
<br/>because immigration falls under this portfolio as well, so we are going to look at border security as 
<br/>part of that too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a very transparent process where the people of Fiji can then openly talk about this – that 
<br/>is the whole idea. It is not going  to be contained, it has to be civilian-led and it will be civil-led.  
<br/>Obviously, RFMF would play a big part, Police, border, and of course politically and the private 
<br/></span><span>sector.  Something we must do well, obviously like I said, there is nothing that defines defence right 
<br/></span><span>now.  There is also the roles that they have independently which they do, that is about all.  They 
<br/>assume their roles right now but there is not a guiding strategic document by Government that points 
<br/>out the policy path, maybe you would like to go into the future.  So, that really Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 
<br/>the intent of all this exercise that we want to do.  People will have their chance to talk and share their 
<br/>views including honourable Members on the other side.

<div><span>       Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>789 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister, Fiji has always lived by the tenet 
<br/>“friends to all and enemies to none.”  In the development of this strategy, bearing in mind the actual 
<br/>geopolitics of the region and in terms of influence being exerted on Fiji by different development 
<br/>partners et cetera that we have had, how much of a role will that geopolitics of that particular region 
<br/>actually play within the development of this particular strategy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  It  is  going  to  be  huge,  honourable  Member.    I  think  regional 
<br/>politics is really shaping the way we are even in the non-traditional sectors.  We have got to look at 
<br/>countries where we share traditional alliances with.  It is also the morale of a good nation chooses its 
<br/>principle well.  Politics are fine, be it a small nation, we try to attach ourselves to as many places 
<br/>where we can get help, but at the end of the day, we always want to stand tall as well for the kind of 
<br/>principles that we stand for.  So, hopefully the people of Fiji can tell the Committee when they look 
<br/>at  this  review the kind of places where they look at  Fiji  and where it is  to go in  light  of  what  is 
<br/>happening in the South.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without going too much into the details of the geopolitics which we understand, I think at the 
<br/>beginning  of  the  year  after  the  elections,  Australians  rushed  here,  the  Chinese  rushed  here,  the 
<br/>Americans came afterward, we still got the French, everyone wants to  come in.  Geopolitics will 
<br/>define it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got AUKUS right at our doorstep, threat of nuclear energy and nuclear power shapes 
<br/>everything that we have but the people must have a say.  At the end of the day, we are a democratic 
<br/>nation, we want a democratic framework, traditional alliances are also very important to us as well 
<br/>as our trading partners.  But it is always good to stand for something, it is the morally right thing to 
<br/>do.
