<h3>MEDIA INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (REPEAL) BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>MEDIA INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (REPEAL) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 1/2023),  be considered by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023, but that 
<br/>one hour be given to debate the Bill with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/></span><span>moving this motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Media Industry Development Act 2010, which 
<br/>I will refer to as the Act amongst other things, regulates the ownership, registration and content of 
<br/>the media organisations in Fiji.  Under the Act, the Media Content Regulation Framework includes
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>712 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the creation of the Media Industry Development Authority, the Media Tribunal and other elements 
<br/>and  it  is  these  provisions  that  have  been  considered  controversial.    These  elements  are  widely 
<br/>considered  undemocratic  and  in  breach  of  the  constitutional  right  to  freedom  of  expression  as 
<br/>outlined under Section 17 of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to that end, the Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023 seeks to 
<br/>repeal the Act.  This does not mean that the media organisations and reporters can now report on 
<br/>anything and everything without authentic sources and facts, but it does provide a start to ensuring 
<br/>that  what  reaches  the  ordinary  people  of  Fiji  is  not  limited  by  overbearing  regulation  by  the 
<br/>government.  Each person can now be guaranteed of that once the Act is repealed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, at  this juncture, I will only  speak as  to  why Parliament must 
<br/>consider the Bill without delay. It is hoped that the Members of this august Parliament will also limit 
<br/>their contributions, if any, to the motion and any substantive contribution to the merits of the Bill 
<br/>itself be made during the debate on Thursday, 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is really a real need to urgently repeal the Act.  It does not and has not 
<br/>served  any  practical  purpose  other  than  to  unnecessarily  limit  media  organisations  and  their 
<br/>operations and the freedom of expression that is the hallmark of a democratically run country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act was promulgated as a Decree in 2010 at a time when there was no 
<br/>Parliament and no Opposition party to question the need for such an Act.  Since the commencement 
<br/>of the Act almost 13 years ago, the Act has been repeatedly criticized and has been viewed as an 
<br/>oppressive media law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a public consultation held on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> March, 2023 at Level 9, Suvavou House, on the review 
<br/>of  the  Act,  the  overwhelming  response  from  those  present,  specifically  the  media  industry 
<br/>representatives  call  for  the  repeal  of  the  Act,  given  the  important  role  that  the  media  plays  in  a 
<br/>democratic  society  and  the  adverse  effects  of  the  Act,  it  is  therefore  incumbent  that  the  Act  be 
<br/>repealed at the earliest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover of the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to share a few points with regards to the 
<br/>motion  that  is  before  Parliament,  and  that  is  a  Bill  to  repeal  the  Media  Industry  Development 
<br/>Authority Act 2010 and for related matters.  I will not talk about the substance of the Bill, that is 
<br/>subject to another debate on Thursday. I will talk about the procedure on Standing Order 51 and the 
<br/>use of Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that this Coalition Government is called the People’s Coalition Government and 
<br/>I think we really need to go back to the people.  One of the key roles of legislatures of law makers 
<br/>and that is to consult the people on what kind of law that is to govern them.  That is the whole purpose 
<br/>of  establishing  a  Standing  Committee  and  there  is  this  specific  Committee  called  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights that deals with Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  week,  we  heard  about  the  Coalition  Government  calling  themselves  as  a  responsible 
<br/>government that does consultation, and this is the first example of them not doing consultation when 
<br/>it comes to Bills.  In the last Election, and even in the last few years, they always criticised the use 
<br/>of Standing Order 51; you will know very well, Sir.  But again, they have gone back to eat their 
<br/>vomit, coming in again by way of Standing Order 51.  I think the mover of the Bill needs to reconsider 
<br/>this.  Although  he  has  done  executive  consultation  through  the  Solicitor-General’s  Office  and  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>713 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>office with various media stakeholders, but it is very important to involve the people who are also 
<br/>stakeholders and who have a vested interest in this particular Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular procedure needs to be followed and if we are really a responsible government, 
<br/>and if we are true to our words that we do consultation then let us start with the Media Bill.  If you 
<br/>cannot start with this, then you have failed in your promise as a responsible government and that is 
<br/>what I am calling for as a mover of the Bill to withdraw this.  At least, we can go to the Committee 
<br/>for the Committee to come back in the next sitting with a one month or six weeks to eight weeks 
<br/>consultation for people to be involved so people can be heard.  Parliament has enough systems in 
<br/>place that allows Committees to travel outside the country and it is televised, and people give their 
<br/>views on all these.  There may be people who have alternative views on this particular Act, but we 
<br/>need to allow the process as law makers and without doing that, we fail in our duty as law makers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes we opposed the use of Standing Order 
<br/>51 in the last Parliament, that is correct, because they were using Standing Order 51, you would recall 
<br/>and they were abusing it. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very simple.  This Bill is about repealing the 
<br/>draconian Media Industry Development Decree, which was put forward, which was imposed on the 
<br/>people of Fiji by the military government and in this Constitution under Section 173 that law and 
<br/>amongst many others was preserved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is making it right because it is an urgent Bill. As the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  talked  about  it,  and  we  talked  about  it.    For  eight  years  we  had  debate  and 
<br/>discussion on the Decree which was turned into an Act unilaterally in the previous Parliament. So, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an urgent Bill and as the honourable Attorney-General said, it is going to be 
<br/>debated on Thursday - they have today, tomorrow and Wednesday, to go through it, rethink-their 
<br/>own mentality about curbing media freedom and I hope that when they come on Thursday, they will 
<br/>all support the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I find this quite rich in the sense that we had eight years 
<br/>of this Government when they were in Opposition complaining about the use of Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Bills under Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Again, I think someone really like the sound of his own voice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, eight years of them complaining about the use of Standing Order 51.  Just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for once, maybe they should practice what they preach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We have got a lot of preachers on that side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot of 
<br/>them.  But now, what they are doing is throwing it back in our face and saying, “Ah, you did it the 
<br/>way that I do it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Where is the change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>
<div><span>714 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Where is the change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is the justification? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Media freedom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  by  his  own 
<br/>admission again said that I am only going to do or take part in things that I am only supposed to 
<br/>because my Prime Minister directed me to do so.  Maybe he should keep quite Sir, leave it to the 
<br/>Attorney-General, leave it to the able Attorney-General next to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on the Bill  itself, I see in the explanatory note, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Attorney-General right at the bottom it states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“3.1  The new legislation comes under the responsibility of the Attorney-General.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  no  new  legislation,  this  is  a  repeal.    What  new  legislation  are  you  talking  about?    Bad 
<br/>drafting, I am not sure, maybe you need to check that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as rightfully pointed out by honourable Bulitavu, they have gone on about 
<br/>this in terms of Standing Order 51 and I just wanted to point out that there was quite a lot that was 
<br/>said with respect to freedom of expression, media freedom, et cetera, all those kinds of stuff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FijiFirst followed the Constitution. We were bound and are still bound by the 
<br/>law.  Everyone had Freedom of Expression. Do not say they did not.  But now, Sir, certain media 
<br/>outlets are upright against the FijiFirst.  Fine, that is your freedom of expression, but even before 
<br/>they used to report on both sides, maybe they actually feel threatened, who knows! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Some media outlets, Mr. Speaker, actually feel threatened and they refuse 
<br/>to come and interview us. They are not actually doing it. So, maybe you should really look at what 
<br/>you actually saying, they suffer from insecurity now.  Mr. Speaker, FijiFirst were called dictators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because they suffered under you people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know you cannot take it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA.- Oh, I can take it, but believe me I can give it also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But when I give it, you actually keep quiet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, no one was actually threatened. Everyone had their freedoms guaranteed. Now, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, social media commentators … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>715 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…make comments against the FijiFirst Government that was in place, they are free to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable L.D. Tabuya interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- There are blatant racist remarks made and supporters are actually doing 
<br/>this openly now. Fijians are told to go back to India or leave, comments such as those yet nothing is 
<br/>being done about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Shame, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Nothing is being done about it. Mr. Speaker, I will just go back to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>actual Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, practice what you preach.  Do not come here and procrastinate and pontificate about, 
<br/>“oh, you did this, did that.”  All week you hear them, “you did this, you did that,”  Get on with the 
<br/>job like honourable Usamate says. Maybe if he does not want to listen to us… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-… maybe he ought to listen to our former Prime Minister who is outside 
<br/>this Parliament whose telling him to get on with the job, Mr. Speaker. Maybe he should listen to him, 
<br/>maybe he ought to. But the point here is, now you are doing something today, it is the first Bill to 
<br/>come to Parliament. Eight years of complaining and what they are doing, they are not practicing what 
<br/>they are preaching. They go and do exactly what we did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not see the urgency here.  The solution that has been offered by honourable Bulitavu…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are doing exactly what is in that Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Member, I suggest you refrain from pointing at me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You pointed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- One man party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, might I address, </span><span>jhoot nai bolo!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- One man party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Speak up the rest of you!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just quickly, Sir, I agree with the sentiments expressed by honourable Bulitavu, 
<br/>take it to the next session of Parliament.  Maybe it needs to come to one Committee, that is fine.  We 
<br/>do not have a problem with you using Standing Order 51 because this is a specific one. They had 
<br/>their  consultations,  I  understand,  but  not  with  everyone.    Maybe  they  should  practice  what  they 
<br/>preach, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, flabbergasted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Absolutely flabbergasted. Eight years I have heard this rhetoric and in their very first ever 
<br/>Bill, not the second, third, fourth or the tenth, but the first - flabbergasted.  You speak and you do not 
<br/>do; absolutely flabbergasted, Sir.  I have been sitting on that side of Parliament and again they keep 
<br/>saying  and  in  this  honourable  Attorney-General’s  first  Bill  he  goes  against  what  they  have  been 
<br/>talking about. Absolutely flabbergasted, the very first Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  were  in  government,  when  we  used  Standing  Order  51  it  was 
<br/>either for a Consequential Amendment or a minor change - a wrong spelling here, a change of a word 
<br/>or something that had become outdated, we corrected it.  But here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a huge change, 
<br/>a  whole  Bill  being  repealed.    Their  very  first  ever  Bill  and  they  go  against  what  they  have  been 
<br/>preaching for years and years - flabbergasted and that is the colour of this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Now they are hearing a lot from what they used to refer to as the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>silent 25. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- One man Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  But  one  thing  is  consistent  with  this  Government  is  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inconsistency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.-  Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Because out in the public space, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  they used words 
<br/>that entice, that are very convincing but in reality this is what is happening. I am quite disappointed, 
<br/>as alluded to by the honourable Members, their very first Bill, we were looking forward because we 
<br/>have heard it from His Excellency the President about the legislation changes. But the very first Bill 
<br/>is under Standing Order 51.  I know why they are avoiding the consultations. I will repeat this, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I know why they are avoiding consultations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION  MEMBERS.- Tell them, tell them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Because the consultations that are currently undertaken in Fiji, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiscal Review Committee … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- …very poor attendance or no attendance at all in most places.

<div><span>         Media Industry Development (Repeal) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>717 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  talking  about  MIDA,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  brings  up  the  Fiscal  Review  Committee.  They  are  totally 
<br/>different things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- What is the Point of Order? It is the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Relevance irrelevant again, Mr. Speaker. We might have to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bring out the dictionary to explain what relevance means to the other side of Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I just ask that we stick to the discussion which is MIDA. If they listen 
<br/>to the results of the election, that was your answer.  They do not want us to stand around and consult 
<br/>on the Bill. That was your answer. The answer of the people of Fiji to MIDA is, get rid of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Go to the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, relevance, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am used to his heat of the moment response. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am used to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member talked about what had been discussed but I heard the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General, I was very attentive to his words this morning. He mentioned that the consultation 
<br/>at Level 9, he only mentioned two groups of people - the media and academia. Where’s the rest of 
<br/>Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- And talking about the inconsistency, let me say that initially, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  consultations  that  they  undertook,  there  was  a  draft  already  prepared  but  the 
<br/>stakeholders that came in wanted this to be totally repealed.  They have a draft  already, we know 
<br/>that.  I have been asked and I said, “we will comment when it comes to Parliament.”   This is the 
<br/>inconsistencies there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking  about  media  freedom,  Sir;  Fijian  Broadcasting  Corporation  (FBC)  are  few  weeks 
<br/>back came up with a title of one of their responses, “Commander fires a warning shot.”  They were 
<br/>directed to take away that title.  That is the media freedom that we are talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. I think the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition is making an allegation.  Does he have evidence of that?  Does he have evidence that 
<br/>the Government directed?  He does not have the evidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  He  just  blurting  something  which  is  false,  misleading  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>irrelevant.  If he has the evidence, he should produce it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We have raised our concerns and we will see how things develop 
<br/>from here, but we have taken our stance and we are here representing the people, and I am against 
<br/>this motion personally.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to keep it short.  This Bill under Standing 
<br/>Order51, we were just informed that we need to go back and read and most of the when this kind of 
<br/>Bill is introduced, we get a good background information as part of the Bill itself.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>this might be the first time we are repealing a Bill and the background information is just one and 
<br/>half line sentence.  We, as the Opposition need to know the justification in background as to why the 
<br/>Bill is being repealed.  This is what happens when we rush through things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people’s voice, people’s government is on record.  The honourable Ro Filipe 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tuisawau, honourable Gavoka small amendments as just correcting the spelling error in a Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is not true. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is in the Verbatim Report.  They requested it to be taken to the 
<br/>general public.  It should be taken to the general public for consultations, small amendments as just 
<br/>correcting the spelling.  Here, we are going to repeal a Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  Again, the honourable Member 
<br/>is lying because I was in Parliament for eight years.  We never opposed the use of Standing Order to 
<br/>correct on any consequential bills or correct typographical error, so he is absolutely lying about that, 
<br/>that we were opposing it.  We never opposed the use of Standing Order 51 on consequential bills and 
<br/>bills where there were corrections, spelling mistakes or comma, or full stop, so do not lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It’s in the </span><span>Hansard.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I agree, NFP never opposed.  What I am talking about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is former SODELPA members …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who makes up the government… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-…who are part of this Government to take the Bill to the general 
<br/>public as consultation.  I was the Chairman of Standing Committee of Justice, Law and Human Rights 
<br/>whereby they even requested me to intervene to take those Bills to the general public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  here  repealing  a  Bill  without  any 
<br/>background information given to the Opposition as to why that is happening.  As alluded to by the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Government  already  had  an  amendment  Bill,  so  they 
<br/>understood the importance of a Media Act at that point in time.  That is  why they were bringing 
<br/>amendments to that particular Act </span><span>per se</span><span> as a Bill to this Parliament, but just because they were put 
<br/>under pressure by the media and certain academics, they have opted to repeal a Bill in one single 
<br/>sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  this  Bill  needs  to  go  to  the  general  public  for  consultation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>otherwise this Bill should be thrown out of this Chambers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Attorney-General to speak on his Reply.  This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is just the introduction; we will have another bite of the cherry on Thursday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Warming up, warming up! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last 13 years, if they listened enough, they

<div><span>iTAUKEI LAND TRUST (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 2/2023), be considered by Parliament 
<br/>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023, but that 
<br/>one hour be given to debate the Bill with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023 or 
<br/>widely known as Bill No. 17 of 2021, seeks to amend the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940 to remove 
<br/>the  amendment  made  by  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  (Budget  Amendment)  Act  2021.    So  the  Act  is 
<br/>known as Act No. 22 of 2021, which was tabled in Parliament as Bill No. 17 of 2021 and passed as 
<br/>an Act of Parliament (Act No. 22 of 2021) and it came into force on 1</span><span>st</span><span>  August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, essentially, the iTaukei Land Trust (Budget Amendment) Act 2021amended 
<br/>the Act to remove the requirement of any consent from the iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB) for 
<br/>any mortgage, charge, pledge, caveat, or for any such lease to be dealt with by any court of law or 
<br/>under the processes of any court of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTaukei Land Trust (Budget Amendment) Bill 2021was tabled in Parliament 
<br/>in 2021 under Standing Order 51 by the previous Government without having conducted extensive 
<br/></span><span>consultations with Land Owning Units (LOU) through the Provincial Council or the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Proper  consultations  with  LOU  were  not  conducted  in  a  proper 
<br/>manner  in  2021  and  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  (Budget  Amendment)  Act  2021was  rushed  through 
<br/>during the Parliamentary process.  Those that were most affected by the Act were the LOU, were not
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>720 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allowed for the facilitation of the processing of mortgages, charges, caveats and pledges without the 
<br/>consent of the Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, under section 11(1) of the iTaukei Affairs Act 1944 in relation to the provision of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>procedure with respect to Bills affecting iTaukei, it states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When any Bill is to be introduced into Parliament which appears to the Minister 
<br/>to affect in any important matter the rights and interests of the iTaukei, and especially 
<br/>any Bill imposing taxes to be paid by them or relating to their chiefs, local authorities 
<br/>or land, it shall first be referred to the Board for consideration.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is this Coalition Government’s interest to reverse the laws that have been 
<br/>tabled  in  Parliament  under  Standing  Order  51  without  proper  consultations  been  conducted  with 
<br/>members  of  the  public  or  relevant  stakeholders.    Therefore,  having  consulted  the  LOUs  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Vanua</span><span> through the Provincial Councils and other relevant stakeholders, this Bill is now being tabled 
<br/>under  Standing  Order  51  to  reverse  the  amendments  made  by  the  iTaukei  Land  Trust  (Budget 
<br/>Amendment) Act 2021.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to  take the  floor.  
<br/>Again, Sir, this side of Parliament opposes the use of Standing Order 51, just like the previous Bill 
<br/>that has been debated on procedures.  On the substance, we will debate that at the time that is specified 
<br/>by the Mover of the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  the  importance  of  involving  the  people.    Standing  Order  51, 
<br/>according to the honourable Attorney-General, when Bill No. 2 of 2023 was Bill No. 17 of 2021… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Listen, honourable Minister! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… it came in as a Consequential Bill of that Budget.  That is the main thing, it did not come 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in on separate occasion like this. It came in as Consequential Bill to the 2021-2022 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, if the honourable Attorney-General had also gone back to the history of Bill No. 
<br/>17 of 2021, I think the CEO then of iTLTB also ensured the public in a press conference by iTLTB 
<br/>that the Board had done wider consultations throughout Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That was confirmed by the CEO of iTLTB in the media and you 
<br/>can go back and find that media statement that will help you.  You will have your own inclinations 
<br/>on this particular Bill but, again, there was evidence of consultations.  Even iTLTB teams that were 
<br/>moving around to various </span><span>Bose Ni Yasana</span><span> and </span><span>Bose Ni Tikina</span><span> and villages, were also talking about 
<br/>the benefits and advantages of Bill No. 17 of 2021 at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has gone worse now, Sir, given that the Mover of the motion is now proposing only a one-
<br/></span><span>hour debate on the Bill which has even given more injustice, Sir.  We do not have the privilege of 
<br/>taking this Bill to the Committee, I think, where people need to be consulted on some of the things 
<br/>that  they  have  benefited  from  when  that  Bill  came  into  place  after  it  was  passed,  how  some 
<br/>bureaucracies and other red tapes were resolved through that, especially this particular Bill only deals 
<br/>with the administration on the Board giving consent.  But we all know that the Board sits probably 
<br/>two or three times in a year and that is why that amendment was brought in by iTLTB after extensive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>721 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultations then.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, again, I urge the honourable Attorney-General if he could withdraw the motion and come 
<br/>through the long passage as provided by the Standing Orders.  The provisions of the Standing Orders 
<br/>in passing the Bill are not in the Standing Orders as a decoration.  We need to consult those that need 
<br/>to be consulted, not only the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners but also the other stakeholders, like the banks and 
<br/>all those that are involved in various transactions - law firms, others that have vested interest in land 
<br/>transaction or transfer between the one who is selling and the other who is buying. So, there is a lot 
<br/>of consultation that needs to be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From experience, Sir, as the Member of the Standing Committee of Justice, Law and Human 
<br/>Rights, sometimes the executive consultation is not done properly and that is why we need to have 
<br/>Parliament or legislative consultation through the Standing Orders Committees to follow-up on those 
<br/>venues and those submissions that were given to the Solicitor-General’s Office and most of the time 
<br/>they do not confirm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  again,  Sir,  I  wish  that  the  honourable  Attorney-General  as  the  Mover  of  the  motion, 
<br/>reconsider this Bill and make it a must, that this must go to the people as a responsible government, 
<br/>as they are saying, for people to be consulted in all the laws that will govern them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are contributing to the debate on the pathway 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for this Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite unreal that the other side of Parliament are saying, “We are the 
<br/>only ones who can use Standing Order 51, not you.”  That is basically what they are saying. Only 
<br/>FijiFirst can use Standing Order 51 and no one else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we sat there for eight years, and we made this point then.  The tragedy with 
<br/>them, Mr. Speaker, was that, more than 85 percent of the Bills - the laws, came through this pathway 
<br/>– Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- And in this one, in particular, Mr. Speaker, you will remember it 
<br/>came as part of Consequential Bills which could be about 20 Bills to be debated as part of the Budget.  
<br/>Fortunately, for us, we were able to pinpoint this and there was an outcry across the country and that 
<br/>made the (former) Speaker provide a special time for the debate on this Bill.  Otherwise, it could 
<br/>have just come through as a Consequential Bill, amongst 17 or 20, and a law that was passed in 1940 
<br/>relating to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land would have been passed in that manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I collected 30,000 signatures as a petition, so what other consultations do you want?  The 
<br/>consultation was done then.  I think honourable Tabuya also collected some signatures, as well as 
<br/>honourable Saukuru.  So, if you want consultations, that has been done, all we need to do now, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, is repeal this.  This was an abuse, this was disrespectful of the laws relating to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land 
<br/>and it needs to be repealed quickly and the best way to do that is Thursday when we debate this Bill, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They say that the first Bill and we are using Standing Order 51, there is a range of arsenal that 
<br/>we have in Parliament.  It is there, Mr. Speaker, we will use them all.  We will do this under Standing 
<br/>Order 51, we can do Standing Order 51 with time limits, and we can do proper readings – first, second 
<br/>and third reading.  We are just starting out today and we will use all these in Parliament, Mr. Speaker,  
<br/>but this one needs to …

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Needs to go.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … go immediately.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the word ‘hypocrisy’ means,  ‘I say this  and  I do 
<br/>that’.  That is the point, honourable Member.  That is the point - you preached it, you yelled it, you 
<br/>shouted about it for eight years.  I am not calling you hypocrites, I am just saying that, that is the 
<br/>definition of hypocrisy and that is precisely the point.  You talked about it.  You sweated and you 
<br/>were so emotional.  Your first two bills, the exact thing you preached about.   We did not preach that, 
<br/>you preached it.  That is hypocrisy.  You are not hypocrites but that is hypocrisy.   Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  and 
<br/>especially on Standing Order 51.  I would like to correct some of the perceptions they are bringing 
<br/>out today in terms of the word ‘hypocrisy’.  It is not hypocrisy because if you look at the use of 
<br/>Standing Order 51 when they were in Government, those were really a lot of substantial bills which 
<br/>they brought through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, nearly 85 percent, and it was an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>abuse of the process in terms of Standing Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue was raised by honourable Maharaj, I do not recall what he said because we 
<br/>were opposing Standing Order 51 because of abuse of process and that there were Bills which were 
<br/>not supposed to be coming through Standing Order 51, which they were putting through.  That was 
<br/>the main issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to this particular Bill in front of us, it was a controversial Bill, as mentioned, 
<br/>there was a lot of opposition, petitions were signed, and I was picked up from home during the curfew 
<br/>to be taken to CID because of this.  I asked them, “Why are you picking me up?”  They said, “No, 
<br/>we are investigating you for talking on Bill No. 17, for meeting the landowners because you went 
<br/>around the Western Division explaining to them about the Bill and they opposed it.”  For that reason, 
<br/>I asked the CID – why are you picking me up?  They said, “Oh, it is orders from the top.”  So, I was 
<br/>taken to CID, spent the night there and for the next five nights, I was taken in and out, in and out, so 
<br/>up  to  today,  I  have  not  been  charged.    So,  what  was  that  for?That  is  the  result  of  your  abuse  of 
<br/>Standing Order 51.  That is the problem. That is why we are bringing this up today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point is that we are using Standing Order 51 not for normal Bills, but it is to repeal 
<br/>the Bills that have been contentious and have been opposed by the people, such as the Media Bill and 
<br/>Standing Order 51.  There is no need to take it to them because they already opposed it.  They have 
<br/>already expressed their views and the key stakeholders have expressed their views as well.  We have 
<br/>already consulted them over the last 12 months regarding this.  Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reminded of that saying, listening to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the utterances from the other side, it is like the pot calling the kettle black.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reassure the gallery and also the people of Fiji, that we are 
<br/></span><span>not making these changes lightly.  This is serious business in the house.  This is another problem 
<br/>with the other side of the House, they never listen.  They never listen, Sir!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did not listen to what the people of Fiji told them at the last Election.  
<br/>When we were going around during the campaign, what the people of Fiji told us in Fijian is this, 
<br/></span><span>Bill 17, me lako i tuba. Na Media Decree, me lako i tuba</span><span>.  What does that mean, Mr. Speaker, Sir?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Minimum wages!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Do we need to meander around and talk about and drag this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for another eight weeks?  Absolutely not!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What about the minimum wages? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  So,  Sir,  what  this  side  of  the  Chamber  is  saying  is  and 
<br/>honourable Tuisawau just mentioned, we will use Standing Order 51 sparingly and responsibly, and 
<br/>we will only use it where we believe the Bills have been unjust, draconian and in this case, there has 
<br/>been zero consultations.  Absolutely zero!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Gavoka  and  honourable  Qereqeretabua  just  reminded  me,  that  consultations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>happened after the Bill was passed.  What a nonsense!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to assure this Parliament and I would also like to assure my 
<br/>colleagues on the other side and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, we will use Standing Order 
<br/>51 responsibly and you can quote me.  For these two Bills, these are wrong Bills.  They should not 
<br/>exist in a proper democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I just thought I would assure all of us, we can talk again for a couple of minutes but from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this side of Parliament, these two Bills are gone.  </span><span>Vinaka saka valevu. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his 
<br/>contribution and for listening to the people.  But what we have also heard from the people saying to 
<br/>the other side, “Increase the minimum wage.” Increase the sugarcane price.  Bring the Rakiraki sugar 
<br/>Mill back.”  So, just a reminder to the other side that those were also said by the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on Standing Order 51, I believe this is an Act now and is already in place.  What 
<br/>we are actually suggesting from this side of Parliament is that we do not oppose Standing Order 51.  
<br/>We have been using it, and we will support it when the need arises to use Standing Order 51, there 
<br/>is no doubt about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But what we are saying, Mr. Speaker, is that there was an Act that was in place.  Before it is 
<br/>repealed, there needs to be two kinds of consultation.  Firstly, the consultation by the Government 
<br/>and  when  it  actually  comes  to  the  Chambers,  Standing  Order  51  allows  30  days.    It  goes  to  the 
<br/>Standing Order Committee, the Committee can go and do a consultation, come back with the report 
<br/>and if the people want it to be repealed or amended, we can do it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a legislative procedure in place that allows, under Standing Order 51, for the Bills to 
<br/>be referred for further consultation to the general public. That is all we are saying, Sir.  There is a 
<br/>process in place and Standing Order 51 does allow it and that is what we are requesting.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Just  very  briefly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side need to understand that this is a repeal of two Bills.  We are not making 
<br/></span><span>a new law.  What we are saying is that, both the laws that we are trying to repeal were made in the 
<br/></span><span>circumstances where there was no consultation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one was made under the Military Government to suppress the media.  This 
<br/>Bill was brought into Parliament and after it was tabled, like honourable Tuisawau, I opposed the 
<br/>Bill on the basis that proper consultation was not done according to the Act and we were hauled up 
<br/>from home during COVID-19 in the night, taken to the police station, and I asked the same question

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        iTaukei Land Trust (Amendment) Bill 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> April, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and said, “This is my legitimate right as a Member of Parliament to talk about the Bill that is before 
<br/>Parliament, why are you taking me for?”  And they said, and I quote, “Sir, we cannot tell you, but 
<br/>this is orders from the top”.  I was taken four or five times, I think. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all we are doing, using Standing Order 51, is to say, “The process through which 
<br/>those laws came in was wrong, it should have never been done”, and we are simply saying, “This is 
<br/>going to be repealed”. So, it is not making a new law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Kamikamica said that we are not going to abuse the use of Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have said this, and I think honourable Members need to understand and support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, since we have just started this Parliament, we have been 
<br/>hearing from the Opposition saying to us, “Get on with the job.  What are you doing in  your 100 
<br/>days? Where are your promises?”  These were promises by this Coalition Government.  So, we are 
<br/>doing our job, we are getting on with it.  Yes, the 100 days you are saying is about to be up… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Standing Order 51 is the only way to do it, now let us do our job.  We 
<br/>are getting on with it and we are keeping our word and we want to tell the people of Fiji, yes, both 
<br/>Bills will be repealed they need to go and we are keeping our promises.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Attorney-General to speak in Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a reference made by honourable Bulitavu 
<br/>whether the Association of Banks were consulted or not, they were.  There is a letter that I am going 
<br/>to read to you dated 22</span><span>nd</span><span> March, 2023, addressed to the Solicitor-General, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Please note, the Association of Banks of Fiji does not have any objection to the draft Bills 
<br/>subject to the following – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>All charges taken over the iTLTB leases during the transitional period is deemed to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have acquired the consent and will be legally enforced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>All applications received during the transitional period which may or may not have 
<br/>been registered yet, and after the date of commencement of the revised Bill will not 
<br/>require consent in line with the existing Bill and until the revised Bill is enacted.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we have consulted the key stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  hearing  from  the  other  side,  when  this  Bill  was  debated  or  rushed 
<br/>through Parliament you also, Sir, a paramount chief, sat here and you opposed the Bill because you 
<br/></span><span>very well know the administration of land by virtue of your traditional title.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has been going on is that the FijiFirst Party needs to get their consciousness right. The 
<br/>whole of Fiji supports this and the Coalition Government, as said by my colleagues, we endorse this 
<br/>Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Well, take it to the Committee.
