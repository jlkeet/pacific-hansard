<div><span>MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES 
<br/>(HONOURABLE DR. RATU ATONIO RABICI LALABALAVU) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to the Question by Hon. P. Ravunawa is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have alluded in my Maiden Speech, the Ministry  of Health  and  Medical  Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs well supported, appropriately remunerated and strong healthcare  professionals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nurses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While more than 800 nurses resigned last year, a total of 206 nurses were recruited in 
<br/>November 2022 (this financial year 2022-2023).  In addition, there is open advertisement  for 
<br/>Registered Nurses positions whereby a registered nurse can apply for a post at any time.  Under 
<br/>this process, we have managed to recruit 18 Registered Nurses. Another 162 Registered Nurses 
<br/>are expected to be recruited in May this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Doctors 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total of 150 medical interns were recruited in January of this year and today, 80 Medical 
<br/>Officers (MOs) have been recruited,  with the remaining to be recruited as soon as they complete 
<br/>their internship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Oral Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a total of 205 oral health practitioners with another 25 to be recruited before the 
<br/>end of the 2022-2023 financial year which will bring the total to 230.  There are many vacancies 
<br/>in  Dental  Hygienist  positions  which  is  due  to  the  unavailability  of  graduates  and  the  Fiji 
<br/>National University is currently reviewing their programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allied Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allied Health professionals are involved in the delivery of health or related services 
<br/>pertaining to the  identification, evaluation and prevention of diseases and disorders; dietary 
<br/>and nutrition services; rehabilitation and health systems management, among others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have a total  of 717 established  allied  health workers,  and we have recruited 558 
<br/>more with 87 more posts yet to be filled during this financial  year.  Allied health professionals, 
<br/></span><span>to  name  a  few,  include  Biomedical  Engineers,  Dieticians,  Physiotherapists,  Pharmacists, 
<br/></span><span>Medical Imaging Technologists, Laboratory Assistants and Environmental Health Officers.
