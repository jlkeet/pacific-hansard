<h3>MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT(HONOURABLE MACIU KATAMOTU NALUMISA)</h3>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
<br/>(HONOURABLE MACIU KATAMOTU NALUMISA) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Response to the Question by Hon. I. Tuiwailevu is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Lautoka Swimming Pool is a major capital development project, which remains incomplete 
<br/></span><span>due to  dispute between the  Lautoka City Council (LCC) and the Lead Consultant/Contractor.  
<br/></span><span>The  Pool,  if  constructed  in  a  timely  manner  would  have  generated  revenue  that  would  have 
<br/>supported the Council’s financial position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Lead Consultant and one of the contractors challenged the Council’s decision to terminate 
<br/>the  Contract  and  instituted  legal  proceedings  against  the  Council.  The  LCC  terminated  the 
<br/>contract of the Lead Consultant in 2020, due to poor project management and poor metal work 
<br/>done by the contractor responsible.  Furthermore, the project progress was slow. The Contractors 
<br/>were not able to meet the set timelines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  this  contractual  disagreement,  a  meeting  was  called  to  discuss  the  issues  and  find  a 
<br/>workable  solution.  The  resolution  was  to  carry  out  a  Peer  Review  Exercise.    A  Terms  of 
<br/>Settlement  was  drafted  between  the  LCC  and  the  Lead  Consultant,  due  to  a  civil  litigation 
<br/>instituted  by  the  Lead  Consultant’s  solicitors  for  the  initial  termination  of  the  consultant’s 
<br/>Contract. This was to ensure that the matter is put on hold, whilst the peer review process is carried 
<br/>out by the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) from the then Ministry of Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Terms of Reference was drafted by the CIU to engage a consultant for the Peer Review.  The 
<br/>Terms of Reference was discussed in detail with CIU, LCC, Lead Consultant’s solicitors and the 
<br/></span><span>Office of the Solicitor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initial Terms of Settlement and the Terms of Reference was vetted and finalised by the Office 
<br/>of the Solicitor-General. The CIU undertook the advertisement and recruitment of a consultant to 
<br/>carry  out  the  Peer Review.    A  Peer  Review  was  to  assess  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Lead 
<br/>Consultant and the Contractors. This was to ensure that the work was carried out in accordance 
<br/>with the scope of works in the Contract between the Lautoka City Council and the Lead Consultant 
<br/>and other relating Contractors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the Expression of Interest and the assessment undertaken of the applicants, an independent 
<br/></span><span>Consultant had been engaged by the Ministry of Local Government to carry out the said Peer 
<br/>Review.  The parties to the Contract had withdrawn the case against LCC, from Court, as the Peer 
<br/>Review exercise had commenced.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  worth  noting  that  the  Peer  review exercise has been completed and the parties are yet to 
<br/>determine the way forward based on the findings and recommendations in the Peer Review Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Peer Review exercise was undertaken in 2022, with a final report submitted in June 2022. 
<br/>This  Peer  Review  Report  is  currently  being  considered  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government to determine the feasible way forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were no works and/or construction undertaken on the Project during the Peer Review 
<br/>process.  Therefore, there is no pending legal matter in relation to the Lautoka Swimming 
<br/>Pool and the construction is yet to be completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Lautoka Swimming Pool Project  started with  a  lot of enthusiasm by the Lautoka City 
<br/>Council in 2015. The Council carried out the tender and appointment of the Lead Consultant 
<br/>and Contractors within the provisions of the Manual of Accounts that was used by Councils 
<br/>to  guide  their  operations  previously.  This  is  now  replaced  by  the  Finance  Manual  for 
<br/>Municipal Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the challenges faced by the Council was the lack of technical expertise in-house. This 
<br/>shortage of experts is a perennial problem faced by most Councils. Hence, this led the Council 
<br/>to  rely  heavily  on  the  Project  Architect,  who  also  assumed  the  role  of  the  Project  Lead 
<br/>Consultant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council, as a statutory body (by virtue of section 8 of the Local Government Act 1972) 
<br/>made  independent  decision  on  the  procurement  process.  The  decision  by  the  Council  to 
<br/>award the contract to the contractors was within the ambit of the provisions of the Manual 
<br/>of Accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In August 2015, the Council made a submission to the Ministry of Local Government with 
<br/>respect to the Project background information and engagement of an Architect Consultant 
<br/>to provide the concept design and detailed drawings.  Architect Consultant to provide the 
<br/>concept design and detailed drawings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Council  submitted  their  proposal  to  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  for  budget 
<br/>consideration,  for  the  construction  of  a  Swimming  Pool  for  all  users  comprising  of  two 
<br/>pools, which will include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>competition pool of FINA compliant (size) 50m x 8 lanes; and 
<br/>community pool of 25m x 6 lanes and associated facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  September  2015,  a  “Call  for  Tender”  was  advertised  for  Architectural  Consultancy 
<br/>Services in the local dailies twice by LCC. The LCC formed a Committee to evaluate the 
<br/>tenders received. The Evaluation Committee comprised of a representative from a private 
<br/>technical firm with engineering background. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommended an architectural firm which was awarded the contract on 27</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>July, 2016. The appointment of the Consultant was made in accordance with the Manual of 
<br/>Accounts and consultation with the Ministry of Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The variation on the cost of the project arose when the initial concept was amended.  The 
<br/></span><span>initial Project was for two swimming pools - a FINA compliant competition pool (50m x 8 
<br/>lanes) and a community pool of 25m x 6 lanes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project included the construction of associated facilities for the pool, which includes 
<br/>one  medical  room,  two  sets  of  public  convenience  for  male  and  female  with  access  for 
<br/>physically  challenged  individuals,  two  sets  of  change  rooms,  a  pool  attendant’s  room, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>iii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>storage room and 1 ticket booth.  The estimated cost for the initial Project design was $2 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budget for the new Concept Proposal, after several site visits and site meetings, increased 
<br/>to  $3  million  and then  to  $7.8  million.   This  was  due  to  the  change  in  scope  of  works  as 
<br/>outlined below: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10 lane Competition Pool; 
<br/>4 lane Community Pool; 
<br/>4 lane Warm Up Pool; and 
<br/>Sports Village with 1,000 seater stadium. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The above was approved by 17</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Lautoka City Council and the Lead Consultant executed the Consultancy Agreement 
<br/>for the Swimming Pool Development on 18</span><span>th</span><span> December 2017, when the Project Cost had 
<br/>escalated to $12.6 million due to further changes in scope.  The changes were as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10 lane Competition Pool; 
<br/>8 Lane Warm Up Pool; 
<br/>1 Children’s Pool; and 
<br/>All to be at Olympic International Standard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that an Olympic Standard Swimming Pool Facility is a competitive 
<br/>and for high performance swimming classification, which amongst the above-mentioned, 
<br/>required  specialised  pool  equipment,  timing  system,  water  quality  control  equipment, 
<br/>balance  tank  to  maintain  water  quantity  and  level,  floodlights  of  1,500  lux  and  other 
<br/>facilities, such as changing rooms, shower rooms, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the site for the pool was changed after a site visit was conducted by the Ministry 
<br/>of Local Government.  The new site required more civil works and it was on a higher level. 
<br/>The change in the project scope led to the increase of the project cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  Contract  was  executed  by  the  LCC  in  December  2017,  the  total  project  cost 
<br/>increased to $12.6 million. The estimates from the beginning were based on the calculations 
<br/>by the Project Consultant, of market prices of construction material and labour at that time.  
<br/>The Project Team included a Quantity Surveyor who worked with the Project Architect in 
<br/>terms of project supervision for the progress payments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tender for the construction work was also publicly advertised and the company with 
<br/>experience and expertise in the construction of swimming pool did not want to be involved 
<br/>with the construction of the associated facilities.  Hence, the Council had two contractors 
<br/>engaged for the project, one specifically to construct the three pools (as Contract A) and the 
<br/>other  contractor  engaged  for  the  associated  facilities,  which  were  the  change  rooms, 
<br/>restrooms, medical room and kiosks (as Contract B).  Those two contracts were separately 
<br/>awarded to the contractors, whilst the Project Architect was tasked to evaluate the bidders' 
<br/>submission and forward to the Council the evaluation paper with his recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The awarding of the contracts was carried out as per the procurement guidelines that was 
<br/>used by all Municipal Councils. It is important to note that the composition of the Evaluation 
<br/>Committee  that  carries  out  evaluation  had  an  important  role  in  awarding  the  respective 
<br/>tenders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>iv. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary, the process for the Lautoka Swimming Pool Project started in 2015, with LCC 
<br/>expressing  interest  to  construct  a  pool  for  the  residents  and  ratepayers of Lautoka.  The 
<br/>Expression of Interest was called for the Project Consultants. The cost estimates provided by 
<br/>the  Consultant  for  the  project  was  on  the  initial  scope.  The  scope  was  changed  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government in 2016, when approval was being sought by LCC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016, only civil works and leveling of ground had started. The changes by the Ministry 
<br/>increased the project cost estimates from $2 million to $7.8 million and when the tender for 
<br/>the construction was called and quotations received, the actual project cost reached $12.6 
<br/>million. The concept of the Lautoka Swimming Pool was approved in January 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  contract  was  executed  in  December  2017,  with  construction  of  the 
<br/>swimming pool started in 2018. In 2020, LCC had terminated the contract of the Project 
<br/>Consultant and Contractors due to the delay in works and not meeting project timelines for 
<br/>completion.  Since  2020,  there  has  been  no  construction  undertaken  at  the  site,  as  all  the 
<br/>parties  involved  agreed  to  have  a  Peer  Review  exercise  undertaken.  In  2022,  the  Peer 
<br/>Review  was  done,  and  the  Report  is  currently  with  the  Fiji  Government,  which  is  being 
<br/>discussed with LCC to formulate a feasible way forward for the completion of the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2018, there was an improvement in the major Capital Project tender process, as it was 
<br/>handled by the Fiji Procurement Office within the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics. The Government Tender Board consists of appropriate 
<br/>technical personnel required to evaluate submissions and make pragmatic recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that the Ministry of Local Government  has developed 
<br/>a new Finance Policy for the Councils, which sets out specific provisions on the procurement 
<br/>process.  The  Ministry  of  Local  Government  consults  relevant  stakeholders  to  ensure 
<br/>appropriate implementation of Development Projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The above response is submitted. Thank you.
