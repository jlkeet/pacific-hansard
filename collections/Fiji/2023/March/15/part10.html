<body><h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Welcome I welcome all honourable Members to today’s final sitting for the week. I understand it has been a hectic one. We had some very healthy exchanges, I hope you will utilise all the time available to you when given these two opportunities to speak; one is the Opening of Parliament by His Excellency the President and the second one is on the Budget, which is coming up in the horizon. I also welcome those joining us in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament. Students - Nasinu Gospel Primary School I have been given to understand that there is a school - Years 7 and 8 students from Nasinu Gospel Primary School. The students are being led by the Head of School, Ms. Sereima Waqalevu. I noticed two faces sitting amongst the students, one is Mr. Nata and then there is another one right at the back, maybe they are part-time teachers in this school. You are most welcome to your Parliament. Every time I pass students, like yourself, I wonder what we have been doing in Parliament to ensure that there will be job opportunities available for you in the not too distant future. That is the role of your Parliament, students - to make laws, change the laws and even repeal the laws, that is our core function. We wish you well in this year’s school work.
