<body><h3>REINSTATEMENT OF BILL – ORDER PAPER</h3><h4>REINSTATEMENT OF BILL – ORDER PAPER</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 97, I hereby move: That the Heritage Bill be restored to the Order Paper.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 97 primarily focuses on the procedure with respect to the reinstatement of Bills to the Order Paper. As honourable Members are aware, the Parliament had prorogued on Monday, 4 th December, 2023. During the Prorogation period, all Bills had passed which meant that all processes paused or come to a halt. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 97(1) further provides that those Bills which had lapsed may proceed in the new session of Parliament at the stage they had reached in the previous session by resolution of Parliament in restoring the Bills to the Order Paper. Therefore, this is purely a procedural motion which is necessary so as to allow Parliament to undertake or continue with its mandate to legislate, to make and pass laws; a core Parliamentary function which is entrenched under</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>15 th March, 2024 Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 305 Section 46 of the Constitution. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the time of Prorogation, there was only one Bill that had lapsed and this was the Heritage Bill (Bill No. 25 of 2023). With the reinstatement of the Heritage Bill, Parliament and the respective Standing Committee would be able to proceed immediately where they left off. This would further mean that Parliament and the Standing Committees should be able to continue to undertake their legislative, representative and oversight functions. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate that this is merely a procedural motion, which is necessary to allow the lapsed Bill to be reinstated and restored to the Order Paper. I do commend this motion to Parliament and, I hereby seek the full support from all honourable Members to approve the motion before this august Parliament as it is imperative for Parliament and its Standing Committees to fulfil their legislative, representative and oversight functions. MR SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion. There being none, and now I call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament to speak in reply. HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments to add. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to.</p></body>
