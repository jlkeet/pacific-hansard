<div><span>Government’s Plan for the Land Bank 
<br/>(Question No. 01/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources inform Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government’s plan for the Land Bank and whether it will be maintained or removed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am delighted to kick start the questions and 
<br/>answers session in this year’s Parliament term and I am glad to take the question from the honourable 
<br/>gentleman,  who  was  the  previous  Minister  for  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  in  the  previous 
<br/>Government .    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I might say from the start, Mr. Speaker, that as a responsible Government, a Government that 
<br/>has promised to consult, that is exactly what we will do.  We will consult with the people on the Land 
<br/>Bank and whether it will be maintained or not and I suppose that would apply to any other law that 
<br/>we may wish to develop, amend all laws that we might even choose to repeal.  But allow me, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, to highlight a few features of the Land Bank as of the 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2022.  Sir, 82 leases 
<br/>had been issued under the Land Bank that came into effect under Land Use Act 2010.  This was at 
<br/>the inception on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> July, 2010.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Use Unit presently, Mr. Speaker, is administering 66 leases, some have expired out 
<br/></span><span>of the 82 and a couple have now been re-entered.  Under the Land Use Act 2010, a total of 10,080.42 
<br/>hectares, equivalent to 245,988.26 acres of land which is owned by 105 landowning units have now 
<br/>already been designated by the Prime Minister’s Office from 2011 to 2022.  They also administer 14 
<br/>buy back lands which total an area of 667.598 hectares, equivalent to 1,649.67 acres. These had also 
<br/>been designated.  There are seven parcels of State land which comprise an area of 385.6807 hectares, 
<br/>equivalent of 953.037 acres.  These had also been designated by the previous Government and under 
<br/>the hand of the previous Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I say, Mr. Speaker, consultation will have to be made, they will have to be made with 
<br/>iTLTB being the Administrator of native land or </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, consultation will also have to be made 
<br/>with the landowners who have had their land in the bank, consultation, of course, will have to be 
<br/>made with the lessees those who now have a lease for a period of time for which time still remains.  
<br/>A lease, Mr. Speaker, you would understand and also to the honourable Parliament, we all understand 
<br/>it is  a legal document.   A document that has convenance and obligations  both  by the Director of 
<br/>Lands and those who lease those lands under the Land Bank. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>437 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some lessees have expanded a large amount of funds in these leases, others are looking for 
<br/>investment, it would be a legal and a financial tragedy to bring all of these to an end without proper 
<br/>consultation.  Government of course, Mr. Speaker, must consider the cost that incurs in these Land 
<br/>Bank system because as you would understand, Sir, all services cost under the Land Bank is absorbed 
<br/>by Government.  Surveys, valuation, for example, are borne by Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2011, Mr. Speaker, until 2022, the 2023 budgetary year $18.1 million have been spent 
<br/>by the Land Management Use Division of the Ministry and that has managed to bring in $11.4 million 
<br/>to the Landowning Units and they come by way of premium, ground rental, humanitarian needs or 
<br/>funds and by way of royalties.  I may add to that, that all proceeds from these leases, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>are given to the landowners and none are kept by Government.  In all of these, Government has spent, 
<br/>as  I  mentioned  $18.1  million,  the  revenue  that  it  gets  has  only  amounted  to  $573,430.63.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, this then begs the question whether it is the role of the Ministry of Lands to administer the 
<br/>land other than State lands which lands really opt to be administered by the iTLTB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Laws are passed by Parliament at least that is how laws are supposed to be passed.  The Land 
<br/>Use Act 2010 was first introduced as a Decree, and we all know how those Decrees came to existence 
<br/>without parliamentary debate and of course without public discourse.  Mr. Speaker, you would see 
<br/></span><span>why we all find ourselves in this legal doldrum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past government, they passed laws without consultation. We, the Coalition Government 
<br/>will not do that.  We will consult then we will act, then we will enact laws. We are in touch with the 
<br/>various landowning units who have their land in the Land Bank, the lessees and if there are any legal 
<br/>issues that needs to be ironed out, we will do that and we will endeavour to do our best.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So as a responsible Government, Mr. Speaker, we will consult to determine whether the Land 
<br/>Bank should be maintained or removed and if it is going to be removed, we are going to provide the 
<br/>transition of those leases under special protective lease scheme to the iTLTB under a Bill necessary 
<br/>in Parliament, of course through consultation and with debate to amend the iTaukei Land Trust Act 
<br/>1940.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to see that there has been a slight change 
<br/>of tune from some of the comments that have been made about the Land Bank in the past, where 
<br/>there has been call for repealing it immediately. I think there is a change here when they talk about 
<br/>consulting on the future of the Land Bank. So, I think that is quite a significant change having looked 
<br/>at what Members of Government and former Members of the Opposition were saying about the Land 
<br/></span><span>Bank, in particular.  As we know for the Land Bank, for a long time, people on this side of Parliament 
<br/></span><span>were said to … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT  MEMBERS.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- … not be doing things for iTaukei landowners but this one way that 
<br/>the Government had done in the past to try to make sure that landowners not only have assets but 
<br/>converted into cash.  As we well know that in the Land Bank when you give your land to the Land 
<br/>Bank, 60 percent of people must agree, it is not taken away.  When the land is given, it is surveyed 
<br/>for free. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we have seen 
<br/>from the Land Bank and now there is an opportunity for pieces of land to be leased for the purpose 
<br/>of making a movie for only three to six months or so. This was something that did not happen in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>438 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>past.  So how have landowning units benefitted from the Land Bank as a result of movies that were 
<br/>shot in Fiji on areas that were given out through short-term leases through the Land Bank that were 
<br/>not there in the past?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That was a lengthy supplementary, honourable Usamate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  is  that  a  supplementary  question  or  a  new 
<br/>question altogether?  It appears to be a new question altogether, Mr. Speaker, but I think it is only 
<br/>fair that the honourable Member give me time for me to answer that when I get back to my office. I 
<br/>should be able to do that within the sitting that is scheduled this week and next week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We usually consider that, the honourable Minister needs time on that line 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of question that you have raised honourable Usamate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A supplementary question, Sir.  Thank you, honourable Minister for that 
<br/>explanation which respect to the Land Bank.  Just a quick question, the Kokomo Resort, which is 
<br/>now one of the great 7-star resorts currently housed in Fiji, and this has actually come as a direct 
<br/>result  of  the  Land  Bank  and  it  is  providing  7-star  accommodation  to  some  of  our  tourists,  as  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister for Tourism will tell you, and it provides a considerate amount of employment 
<br/></span><span>also to our locals.  Can the honourable Minister please inform Parliament on the scale of the benefits 
<br/>that are actually accruing to the landowners as a result of the Land Bank making the land available 
<br/>for tourism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I  think  that  is  a  new  question 
<br/>altogether.  The honourable Member would be able to give me time, I should come back to you in 
<br/>this session of Parliament to provide the answer for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a supplementary question.  It is good to 
<br/>see that some honourable Members on the other side become very responsible just by crossing the 
<br/>floor, because there were lots of irresponsible statements made before concerning the  Land Bank.  
<br/>My simple question to the honourable Minister is this, given the consultations that you have already 
<br/>alluded to, how long is it going to take and when will we expect a report to this august Parliament, 
<br/>given the importance of the issue before us? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I can answer.  The operational mandate 
<br/>of the Land Bank is presently being undertaken by my Ministry.  We are looking at the efficacy of 
<br/></span><span>the system as opposed to the system that is being run by the iTLTB.  The legislative mandate, of 
<br/></span><span>course, they would understand that it has to come back to Parliament.  If we were to repeal or propose 
<br/>to repeal the Act, that has to come back to Parliament and the legislative mandate will depend on 
<br/>how  the  honourable  Attorney-General  would  want  to  see  that  being  tabled  in  his  timetable  of 
<br/>legislative mandate in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To answer the question, the operational mandate is currently being  reviewed and I should 
<br/>come  back  to  Parliament  with  a  review  on  it  within  the  next  three  months.  But  of  course,  the 
<br/>Government will then inform Parliament on what it intends to do with the Land Use Act 2010 when 
<br/>it makes a decision on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That would be the last supplementary question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   Given,  Land Bank 
<br/>was established due to the bureaucracy with iTLTB and also the difficulties in landowners developing 
<br/>their  land  because  they  were  cash  poor,  although  we  are  resource  rich  as  </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>    From  your 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>439 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>observation so far, after three months in office, you have stated in your answer that the Government 
<br/>has injected $18 million to the Land Bank and the landowners have benefited $11 million through 
<br/>various premiums and rentals.  What is your observation, whether Land Bank really benefits </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>landowners and provides a better option for them than iTLTB? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question by the honourable Member, I 
<br/>think it started with a very bad presumption, and the presumption is that iTLTB as a leasing facility 
<br/>was not  doing  well for the landowners.  We do  not  know whether that  was the case.  There was 
<br/>nothing that came into this Parliament that proved that.  All they did was, in 2010 they introduced 
<br/>the Decree and suggested, “Well, let us give the landowners an alternative land use system.”  Did 
<br/>they consult the landowners?  Was there proof that they did consult the landowners?  Now, what they 
<br/>have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that through the enacted …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- $11 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  There  is  more  than  $11  million  that  is  administered  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTLTB; more than that, more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.-  Of course,  it is  good.   This  is a State department,  they are 
<br/>measuring  $11  million  against  $18  million  that  was  spent  from  treasury.    It  could  have  been 
<br/>administered  privately  by  iTLTB,  and  that  would  have  been  the  economics  of  it.    There  was  in 
<br/>existence  an  iTLTB  system  of  leasing  land  from  the  landowners.    All  they  needed  to  do  was  to 
<br/>improve that system.  There was no need to set up an alternative system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Fiji’s Negotiations With IPEF 
<br/>(Question No. 02/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  Fiji’s  ongoing 
<br/>negotiations on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I thank honourable Vanawalu for 
<br/></span><span>this question on what perhaps, is one of the most important and significant negotiations Fiji has been 
<br/></span><span>engaged in and has the potential to unlock a myriad of trade, economic and development cooperation 
<br/>opportunities and benefits for our country.  But before I do that, in the spirit of friendship I guess, 
<br/>and the desire to work together as expressed by our honourable Prime Minister, I will give credit 
<br/>where credit is due.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we had the swearing in, honourable Koya in one of the breaks said to me, “Have a look 
<br/>at the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), make sure you do not take your eyes off IPEF”, 
<br/>and I actually listened to honourable Koya.  Having said that, can I just balance it off with a caution 
<br/>to my friends on the other side.  They have been saying all along, legacy, legacy and legacy and 
<br/>talking about the good things about what they think is their legacy.  I will give them a warning now.  
<br/>You  take  the  good  with  the  bad.    In  this  session,  you  will  hear  about  the  bad.    Let  me  allow  to 
<br/>continue, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, IPEF for prosperity was first publicly announced at the East Asia Summit 
<br/>in October 2021, launched later in Tokyo in May 2022 with a total of 13 participating countries that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>440 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>represent 40 percent of the world’s GDP and 60 percent of the world’s population.  The IPEF is a 
<br/>United  States-led  initiative  amongst  founding  members  which  include  Australia,  Brunei,  India, 
<br/>Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and 
<br/>Vietnam to create a new regional grouping for areas of trade, supply chains, clean and fair economy.  
<br/>Shortly, after the launch in May of 2022, Fiji, the first and only Pacific Island nation was invited to 
<br/>join IPEF to bring the membership to 14.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  this,  a  series  of  intense  virtual  and  physical  meetings  took  place  to  establish 
<br/>ministerial mandates or publicly known as Ministerial Statements.  The Ministerial Statements were 
<br/>released on 9</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2022.  Fiji joined the United States and the other 12 partners across the 
<br/>Indo-Pacific Region in Los Angeles to launch IPEF Ministerial Statements on Pillar 1 which is Trade, 
<br/>Pillar 2 which is Supply Chains, Pillar 3 which is Clean Economy and Pillar 4 on Fair Economy.  
<br/>Those are the four broad pillars of the  IPEF.  Ministerial Statements contain broad ambitions of  the 
<br/>IPEF initiative and forms the basis for negotiations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  worth  noting  that  IPEF  is  not  a  market  access  agreement,  therefore  contains  no 
<br/>obligations to reduce tariffs.  However, it is a broad economic framework agreement that focuses on 
<br/>closer alignment amongst members of trade and trade-related policies and standards.  For example, 
<br/></span><span>in Pillar 1 alone, Sir, the Trade Pillar, there are 10 specific areas of negotiations:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Agriculture; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Environment; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Digital trade; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Labour; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Transparency and good regulatory practices; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Services domestic regulation and inclusivity; 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Trade facilitation; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Competition policy; 
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Technical assistance; and  
<br/>(10)</span><span> </span><span>Economic co-operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the coverage of IPEF is highly technical and covers a broad 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>range of subject matters that can have significant impact on our economies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response and through a Cabinet mandate, the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small 
<br/>and  Medium  Enterprises  has  formed  a  technical  working  group,  including  experts  from  technical 
<br/></span><span>spheres such as the Office of the Prime Minister, the Department of Environment and the Climate 
<br/></span><span>Division, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries, Office of the Solicitor-
<br/>General, Ministry of Communications, Fiji Revenue and Customs Services (FRCS), Fiji Independent 
<br/>Commission Against Corruption (FICAC), Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF), the Reserve Bank 
<br/>of Fiji (RBF) and, obviously, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first IPEF Negotiating Round was held in Brisbane in December 2022, followed by a 
<br/>special Negotiating Round on Pillar 2 to Pillar 4 in February 2023 in New Delhi.  Just recently last 
<br/>week, the second full IPEF Negotiating Round was concluded in March 2023 in Bali. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that in every round, there are, at least, eight streams 
<br/>of  negotiations  taking  place  in  parallel,  and  it  is  a  seven-to-eight-day  marathon  of  negotiations, 
<br/>including weekends.  All the Pillars and sub-topics under the Pillars have a negotiating text.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this requires immense effort, resources and coordination and a negotiating 
<br/>team that comprises experts, officials and technical advisors, despite our negotiating team being small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>441 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in number compared to other parties.  For example, in the last Negotiating Round in Bali, we had a 
<br/>team of 11 Officials, the largest delegation thus far. However, the average size of the other larger 
<br/>countries range from about 70, some exceeding 100.  Why invest in all this effort?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, IPEF is a unique progressive framework that has sustainability, resilience 
<br/>and  inclusive  prosperity  at  its  core.    It  represents  immense  opportunity  for  growth,  development, 
<br/>integration and prosperity for all nations in the Indo-Pacific Region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s participation in IPEF Negotiations will provide numerous tangible benefits, including 
<br/>increased  foreign  investment,  enhanced  trade  relations  and  economic  cooperation  with  other 
<br/>members of IPEF.  Similarly, it will advance our aims under the IPEF four Pillars.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s participation in these negotiations is not a passive one, as we have had strong influence 
<br/>in shaping Ministerial Statements, as honourable Koya would know the negotiating guidelines, which 
<br/>recognises  the  different  levels  of  economic  development  and  capacity  constraints  across  IPEF 
<br/>member countries and makes technical assistance and capacity building integral as part of IPEF.  Sir, 
<br/>this is important as Ministerial Statements will guide the IPEF Negotiations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With IPEF being a high-level ambition Agreement, we strongly believe that the commitment 
<br/></span><span>of  flexibility,  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  should  continue  to  be  engrained  in  our 
<br/>negotiations.  That is why Fiji is actively contributing to the formation of the legal text during the 
<br/>negotiations.    In  this  regard,  we  look  forward  to  the  United  States  and  other  parties’  continuing 
<br/>support in considering Fiji’s position because we are the only ones that are the voice for Small Island 
<br/>Developing States (SIDS) in the IPEF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the parties are not waiting for the negotiations to conclude in order to realise 
<br/>the benefits and this is one of the excellent benefits from IPEF.  We acknowledge the early harvest 
<br/>benefits such as the upskilling and capacity building initiatives by IPEF members such as United 
<br/>States, Korea and Japan, which will upskill and empower Fijian women and girls in terms of using 
<br/>digital tools, as well as enhancing knowledge base of Fiji’s Science, Technology, Engineering and 
<br/>Mathematics (STEM) field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the recent Bali Rounds, Fiji with ASEAN countries presented a paper on tangible benefits, 
<br/>underscoring the type of benefits that could be realised under IPEF.  The paper envisaged tangible 
<br/>benefits  such  as  upgrade  of  physical  infrastructure  related  to  trade,  such  as  ports,  digital 
<br/>infrastructure, systems and processes and human capital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the negotiations are moving at a rapid pace. After Bali, the third Round will 
<br/>be held in Singapore in May, following which the Ministers will meet as well.  It is proposed that the 
<br/>Ministers may be able to approve in principle the conclusion of negotiations at least on one of the 
<br/>IPEF Pillars.  It is envisaged that there will be five more rounds after May, leading up to the expected 
<br/>conclusion of the IPEF Negotiations in November this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we can see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the parties of IPEF, including Fiji, are determined and vested 
<br/>with  negotiating  and  concluding  IPEF  as  an  important  vehicle  to  drive  economic  growth  and 
<br/>prosperity in the Indo-Pacific Region.  This will require a herculean effort on our part, not just by the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives, but the whole of the Government of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge all honourable Members to support Fiji’s efforts and negotiations of IPEF, as this will 
<br/>be a monumental step forward for Fiji in terms of forging trade and economic alliance with some of 
<br/>the most powerful nations and economies in the world.  Sir, IPEF will firmly stamp Fiji’s position 
<br/>firmly in the greater Indo-Pacific Region.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>442 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- That was quite a long reply. I was about to say that honourable Premila 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Opposition  was  very  good  in  criticising  the  past  Government  for  lengthy  replies  to 
<br/>questions that were raised but now, it seems that we are on that track as well.  Perhaps, if I could ask 
<br/>that we try and concise our replies as much as possible, so it becomes a question and answer one 
<br/>rather than lengthy statements.  But I thank you for those statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- A supplementary question, Sir, and first of all, let me say, ‘thank you’ 
<br/>for the acknowledgement to the honourable Minister.  I, for one, will take his side and say, “I think 
<br/>he actually deserved the lengthy explanation”.  It is something new, something very valuable to Fiji 
<br/>-  IPEF  is  a  very,  very  important  framework  that  needs  to  be  dealt  with  carefully.  So,  I  think  the 
<br/>explanation being long was not really a Ministerial Statement, it just that it requires that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  question  really,  just  in  short,  honourable  Minister,  thank  you  for  the  very  thorough 
<br/>explanation on that.  In the last Ministerial Meeting, there was a very comprehensive Early Harvest 
<br/>Programme that was done with respect to our females and women entrepreneurs.  I just wanted to get 
<br/>an update on whether that has commenced or started because of the upskilling programme that was 
<br/></span><span>put out by the private sector that was attached to the Ministerial Meeting?  I just want to know whether 
<br/></span><span>we have actually are recipients of it already or there are something in training with respect to those 
<br/>women entrepreneurs?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for the question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the teams have 
<br/>visited Fiji and they will be visiting again soon to try and start the provision of the benefits.  So, that 
<br/>is, sort of, well underway right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Just  a  quick  supplementary  question,  in  the  statement,  a  lot  of 
<br/>information about the negotiations which we very well understand but you also talked on potentials 
<br/>and opportunities.  Can you clarify more on that because there are a lot of ears listening now with 
<br/>high  expectations,  whether  it  be  in  the  information  technology  sector  or  whether  it  be  in 
<br/>manufacturing?  The reason is because I know in some of the previous arrangements that we had, 
<br/>while we have a lot of potentials in resource-based sectors, unfortunately, the agreements were in the 
<br/>other areas as well.  So, that is my area of interest out of the statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I guess some of the early harvest benefits 
<br/>have been in the digital space and it has to do with actually start training our children for the future.  
<br/></span><span>I  alluded  to  the  STEM  training  and  this  is  where  two  major  companies  in  the  world  are  actually 
<br/></span><span>coming to Fiji to introduce IT-based training.  So,  over the next five to 10 years, we will have a cadre 
<br/>of  children  who  will  be very  technologically  savvy,  and  that  will sit  us well  in  the  technological 
<br/>space.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to your question on export and potential, there are initial discussions happening 
<br/>with a lot of the parties that are in this agreement.  I think it is fair to say that we will perhaps be 
<br/>realising some of the discussions that are initially starting to happen in the next six months – let us 
<br/>say, but I am very optimistic, Sir, with this agreement because, first, it puts Fiji at the centre of a 
<br/>major economic bloc, if you like and, secondly, it will allow us to play a role in terms of trying to 
<br/>drive more trade and more investment into Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a question to the honourable Minister; given 
<br/>Fiji  is  one of the 14 founding  members of  IPEF, what  is  the level  of our engagement in  the four 
<br/>pillars?  Are we engaging negotiations in all those four pillars or only on the taxation and the anti-
<br/>corruption that you have mentioned? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>443 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the engagement is across the four pillars.  
<br/>As you note from the Technical Committee, it includes all the disciplines that are involved in the four 
<br/>pillars.  So, you have my assurance that we will be actively engaged across the four pillars to ensure 
<br/>that Fiji’s voice and the rest of the Small Island Developing States’ voice is actually heard at these 
<br/>international levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S.KOYA.- Just quickly, honourable Minister, I am not sure if you are going to answer 
<br/>this or not but does this particular agreement have any influence or is it influenced by the geopolitics 
<br/>of our region?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  being  led  by  the  United  States 
<br/>probably answers your question.  It is a very significant agreement because it puts Fiji in the middle 
<br/>of the Indo-Pacific region and we should be thankful that, that is the case because it will just open up 
<br/>a lot of opportunities for the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other things that we will announce subsequently, that will make you understand 
<br/>why we have embraced IPEF very quickly because it does allow us to become more of a regional 
<br/>hub in all facets of the business, so technology, aviation and trade.  So, it is a tremendous opportunity 
<br/></span><span>for  our  country  and  the  Americans  want  it  done  this  year.    That  is  why  the  pace  at  which  the 
<br/></span><span>negotiations is taking place is quite aggressive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Current Inflation Rate 
<br/>(Question No. 03/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the current inflation rate 
<br/>and its effect? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question regarding the inflation rate and its effect, and I think he probably means effect on consumers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, Mr. Speaker, as a government, we acknowledge the impact of inflation on Fijian 
<br/>consumers, businesses and other entities, especially on the consumers.  High rates of inflation can 
<br/>have adverse effects, lower purchasing power in terms of making it more difficult for consumers to 
<br/></span><span>afford basic goods and services.  The good news, Mr. Speaker, however, is that in February this year, 
<br/></span><span>inflation rate actually fell to 1.5 percent compared to 2.5 percent in January, and that is the lowest 
<br/>inflation since November 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, inflation started increasing in March 2022 and continued to accelerate due to 
<br/>rising food and energy prices.  Obviously, there are international movements now.  We see somewhat 
<br/>declining international energy and food prices.  For example, oil prices have dropped by about 30 
<br/>percent since June 2022.  Currently, it is close to about US$80 per barrel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in terms of food and alcoholic beverages, tobacco, narcotics, transport, housing, 
<br/>water, electricity and gas, and other fuel categories, they contribute about 70 percent of the Consumer 
<br/>Price Index (CPI).  Therefore, any price movement in those categories can significantly influence 
<br/>inflation rate.   Price of food and non-alcoholic items rose by 3.2 percent but, Mr. Speaker, it was the 
<br/>lowest rise in the last 22 months.  Again, that is  good news in terms of what is happening to the 
<br/>inflation rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>444 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  as  a  government,  we  understand  the  impact  of  inflation  and 
<br/>components  of  that  inflation,  as  I  have  said,  70  percent  of  the  CPI  comes  from  food  and  other 
<br/>alcoholic beverages, household items, et cetera.  So we, as a government, need to understand.  I think 
<br/>we are working with the Ministry of Trade and Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Price control mechanism is something that people do not always like but it is an effective 
<br/>mechanism in circumstances, Mr. Speaker, where prices fluctuate quite significantly to ensure that 
<br/>there is a stable pass through within the pricing mechanism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is my short answer to the question on inflation and its effect on consumers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister is related to inflation. I do note that inflation has come down but when we measure inflation, 
<br/>it is all about the basket of goods and, obviously, food and fuel are the two major components.  My 
<br/>question is related to food and fuel inflation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also seen that because the inflation was very high, the FijiFirst Government  had 
<br/>exempted VAT on 21 basic consumer goods, removed fuel duty of 20 cents per litre and large scale 
<br/></span><span>reduction in Customs duties for thousands of products - all that was done.  Now, we see that the fuel 
<br/></span><span>inflation  is  still  high.  The  price  of  motor  spirit  and  premix  increased  by  12  cents  and  gas  prices 
<br/>increased by $5.61.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has just acknowledged the impact of inflation on consumers and 
<br/>businesses so my very simple question to the honourable Minister is, will he remove 20 cents fuel 
<br/>tax to show compassion to consumers and businesses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  in  fact,  it  is  a  very  good  question.    The 
<br/>honourable Member has probably forgotten that during COVID-19 when the oil prices went down 
<br/>significantly, at that time a lot of people had lost jobs, a lot of people were suffering, there was loss 
<br/>of income and what those in Government (she was part of that Government) at that time did was they 
<br/>raised the 20 cents tax from 44 cents to 66 cents.  After we, in the Opposition, made a big song and 
<br/>dance about it and we called on the Government to reduce the 20 cents, then they reduced it from 66 
<br/>percent to 44 percent. Now, she is asking whether we are going to reduce it further  by 20 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have just said, Mr. Speaker, if she had listened carefully, that there is an international trend 
<br/>now, declining fuel prices and food prices. Any decision on those, of course, will be taken in, but it 
<br/></span><span>is actually quite hilarious that they were part of the Government which actually increased the tax by 
<br/></span><span>20 cents at a time when people were suffering, when people needed help and when businesses needed 
<br/>help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You never answered my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- I like that part of </span><span>bhatao</span><span>, </span><span>bhatao</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The mover of the question is wanting to raise his supplementary question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank  the honourable Minister for giving 
<br/>that brief.  I think he should have known that better before promising people $5 lamb chops during 
<br/>the campaign period.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>445 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  supplementary  question  is;  the  purchasing  power  of  all  citizens  had  significantly 
<br/>decreased  and  businesses  are  in  turmoil.    Food  prices  are  high,  and  we  understand  the  problems 
<br/>around the world that have caused this.  But what Fiji wants to know is, what is your Government 
<br/>doing and what measures are being put in place to counteract this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Member,  before  asking  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question, he talked about $5 minimum wages. We promised that in 2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me just say this, the honourable Member forgot that in 
<br/>2018, he was making videos and going on the social media and supporting the National Federation 
<br/>Party and our promise to bring $5 wages. So, something happened, and I know what happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  You sit down. I have a Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 60 - Speech must be relevant. Standing Order 
<br/>60(1) states, and I quote: “When speaking, members must confine their observations to the subject…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  You mentioned the $5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I am talking about inflation.  What you are talking about is not inflation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- No running commentary, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, my advice to the honourable Member is, before 
<br/>he opens his mouth, he should think of what he is going to say. He talked about $5 and that was my 
<br/>response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- $5 for what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me explain, Mr. Speaker, on what the Government has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done under the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  first  30  days  just  before  the  school  opened,  we  released  that  a  lot  of  families  and 
<br/>students throughout the country were struggling, incomes slowly restored, but there were a lot of 
<br/>families  out  there.  And  the  Government,  under  the  leadership  of  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>decided that we would pay $200 per child, called Back to School Support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we supported more than 214,000 students in this country. You go and talk to all 
<br/>the parents, families and friends. You ask the honourable Minister for Education on the number of 
<br/>parents  and  families  who  have  come  out  and  said  how  important,  critical  and  timely  that

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announcement was by the honourable Prime Minister and the support by the Government to all their 
<br/>families. They do not talk about that, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- We’re supporting everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, we allocated an additional 
<br/>$7.5 million to continue the 10 percent reduction in bus fares for additional six months from February 
<br/>to July. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Where is the money from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, unlike them who kept borrowing, we are looking 
<br/>at the budget. We found the money in the budget that they did.  So, Sir, this is a Government which 
<br/>understands much better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Tell them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- He is an economist. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-The honourable Minister for Lands, Mr. Speaker, just taught 
<br/>them some simple economics. They do not understand that because they were cheerleaders for a non-
<br/>economist who was trying to run this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  So,  let  me  assure  the  people  of  this  country  that  the 
<br/>Government is fully committed to ensuring that we develop programmes and policies that are timely 
<br/>ones, not during election, to support our families and those who are in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will have to move on.  I intend to adjourn the 
<br/>House now so that honourable Members will be able to serve themselves dinner that is being provided 
<br/>in the Big Committee Room. We have been holding on to this very lengthy meeting and as such, 
<br/></span><span>dinner has been provided.  We will resume once the bell is sounded.  I adjourn Parliament.

<div><span>Humanitarian and Disaster Relief Assistance 
<br/>(Question No. 04/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management update Parliament on the humanitarian and disaster relief assistance provided to 
<br/>New Zealand and Vanuatu after the recent severe tropical cyclones? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  asked  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Alitia  Bainivalu  to  provide  an  update  on  the  recent  humanitarian  and  disaster  relief 
<br/>assistance provided to New Zealand and Vanuatu after the recent severe tropical cyclone events. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the New Zealand Response, Sir, allow me to provide an update. First for the New Zealand 
<br/>deployment, during severe </span><span>TC Gabrielle </span><span>which hit the North Island of New Zealand with damages 
<br/>estimated to be at least $13 billion. It caused significant impacts to the northern and eastern parts of 
<br/></span><span>North Island including Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Tairawhiti, Hawkes Bay and 
<br/></span><span>Tararua.  New Zealand declared a National State of Emergency on the 14</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023.   It was 
<br/>only the third time in New Zealand’s history they have a national emergency with a number of 11 
<br/>fatalities recorded, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  2017  till  to-date,  New  Zealand’s  support  towards  Fiji  disaster 
<br/>management has been to the tune of over $7 million.  The Government’s decision to reciprocate this 
<br/>assistance was received with much gratitude by the Government and the people of New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 20</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) 
<br/>and the Republic of the Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) briefed the honourable Prime Minister on what 
<br/>Fiji could offer.  A subsequent Cabinet Paper was also submitted with the following proposal with 
<br/>NDMO  with  five  personnel  comprising  of  emergency  management  specialist,  RFMF  with  26 
<br/>personnel comprising of infantry and engineering platoon led by a Navy Lieutenant Commander and 
<br/>assisted by an RFMF Captain.  The RFMF team liaised closely with the New Zealand Defence Force 
<br/>team.  From the National Fire Authority (NFA), we had three personnel.  They offered three officers 
<br/>who were specialists in search and rescue operations to assist in the response effort at the Hawkes 
<br/>Bay  Emergency  Services.    A  total  of  34  personnel  from  the  Government  of  Fiji’s  Humanitarian 
<br/></span><span>Assistance team to New Zealand and departed on 24</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  the  distribution  of  tasks,  the  five  NDMO  officials  were 
<br/>embedded with the New Zealand National Emergency Management Agency, based at their national 
<br/>coordination centre in Wellington.  The officials were deployed for 14 days.  The three NFA officials 
<br/>were embedded with the New Zealand Emergency Services team in Napier, Hawkes Bay and officials 
<br/>were deployed for 14 days.  The 26 RFMF officials were embedded with the New Zealand Defence 
<br/>Force based at Hawkes Bay which was the worst affected region in New Zealand.  The officials were 
<br/>deployed for 28 days and they have just returned last Saturday and we owe them a vote of gratitude 
<br/>for  all  the  good  work  they  have  done.    The  budget  and  logistics,  Sir,  the  total  budget  for  the 
<br/>deployment  of  the  Government  of  Fiji  team  to  New  Zealand  was  $184,900.    The  New  Zealand 
<br/>Government provided the strategic air lift, food and accommodation to the Fiji Emergency Response 
<br/>Team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  Vanuatu  deployment  Sir,  as  part  of  our  Pacific  family  initiative,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government  also  responded  to  Vanuatu  after  the  island  was  hit  by  two  consecutive  Category  4

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister  whilst  he  was  in  Panama  at  that  time,  communicated  his 
<br/>advice to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the permanent representative of Fiji to reach out to 
<br/>key  stakeholders  to  coordinate  Fiji’s  support  to  Vanuatu.    Consequently,  the  Ministry  of  Foreign 
<br/>Affairs  convened  a  multi-stakeholder  committee  meeting  on  Monday,  6</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2023  to  discuss

<br/>Bhikabhai  &amp;  Company  Proprietary  Limited,  Ba  Industries  Proprietary  Limited,  Fiji  Rice  (Pte)

<br/>together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  total  budget  for  the  deployment  was  $583,841  and  I  would  like  to 
<br/>acknowledge the New Zealand Government and again providing airlift for the second contingency 
<br/>team with the host country providing accommodation for the Emergency Response Team.  The team 
<br/>is currently deployed for 28 days and updates up to now, Sir, since the team is still in Vanuatu, I wish 
<br/>to inform the Members of this august Parliament on some of the work they have conducted and are 
<br/>currently doing in Vanuatu.  They are providing surge support to the Vanuatu National Emergency 
<br/>Coordination Centre, they are delivering ration packs and water to severely affected areas and the 
<br/>RFMF has conducted a quick fix on the Vila SDA School that was instrumental in the re-opening of 
<br/>that school on Monday, 27</span><span>th </span><span>March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The team  also  joined up with  the Fiji  Field Ready Team  to  assist  the WASH cluster with 
<br/>installation of sanitation systems.  Our FEMAT team has also been assigned to Mele Village and will 
<br/>be working with the respective clusters in responding to the recovery needs of Mele Village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a spike in leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue fever and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>diarrhoea cases in the country and has recorded its first death this past week from leptospirosis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these assistance and regional deployments are aligned well to 
<br/>our regional cooperation strategy outlined in the Boe Declaration of Regional Security where member 
<br/>states are encouraged to assist each other during humanitarian crisis.  Both humanitarian response 
<br/></span><span>deployment fulfils Fiji’s obligations under the Boe Declaration and the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy 
<br/></span><span>also affirms Fiji’s position as a leader in the region in inter-regional assistance for disasters and also

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>449 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>emergencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The honourable Minister 
<br/>mentioned in one of the recent media statements some legacy issues that the Ministry will need to fix 
<br/>regarding  information  and  advisory  on  the  general  public.    Can  you  please  clarify  and  be  more 
<br/>specific on this legacy issue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I am not quite clear on what the question is. Can you please clarify 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what the question is again, honourable Member?. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat the supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- It is a supplementary question.  Recently in the media you mentioned that 
<br/>you  were  exercising  a  legacy.    You  had  quoted  that  you  were  going  to  fix  and  provide  some 
<br/>information and advice to the general public. Can you clarify and be specific on what advice you are 
<br/>talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I fail to see the question there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I do not believe 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that there is anything to answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Vijay Nath, the honourable Minister has replied that his not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clear even though you have repeated the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What is the subject matter? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  in  one  of  his  recent  media 
<br/>statements  mentioned of some legacy issue that the Ministry will need to fix regarding information 
<br/>and advisory on the general public. That is what I am asking, can you clarify and be more specific 
<br/>on this legacy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Can you re-submit that later on honourable Vijay Nath as a new question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Noted, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Supplementary question. Honourable Minister, in the 2050 Strategy for 
<br/>the Blue Pacific Continent, a common vision for our Pacific Leaders is also for a very resilient Pacific 
<br/></span><span>region,  a  region  of  peace,  harmony,  security  and  social  inclusion  and  prosperity.  One  of  the  key 
<br/></span><span>thematic areas, honourable Minister is actually climate change and disasters under which resilience 
<br/>is listed as an actual strategic pathway under this particular thematical area. What role, honourable 
<br/>Minister  can  Fiji  play  under  this  particular  thematical  area  in  terms  of  regional  cooperation  and 
<br/>collaboration to strengthen the resilience of all our communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I will try to answer that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are signatory to the 
<br/>Sendai Framework. I have just been to one of the conferences in that area and the disaster resilience 
<br/>work that we are doing will be our mid-term review that is going to be reported in New York later in 
<br/>May.  I believe that is going to be part of the discussions that we are going to have in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick supplementary question. Thank you, 
<br/>honourable Minister, you have highlighted how we are responding to New Zealand and to the region 
<br/>in terms of severe tropical cyclones and how we are providing humanitarian assistance. But back to 
<br/>Fiji, given there are recent floods and other things, how are we responding?  We are not mobilising 
<br/>as quick as we are organising ourselves overseas than what we are facing here in Fiji. What measures 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>450 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been put in place to improve things as we move forward in response to our local weather events? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a brief on the flooding incidents that happened 
<br/>lately in the Northern and Western Divisions.  On 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023, the National Emergency Centre 
<br/>in the Northern Division, EOC’s were activated to monitor the heavy rain warning issued.  Sir, 80 
<br/>Evacuation Centres were opened, 350 evacuees were helped.  The evacuation should be commended 
<br/>for being proactive, moving early to the Evacuation Centres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank our partners, the Red Cross, the Labasa faith-based organisations 
<br/>and  partners  for  their  assistances  rendered  to  our  evacuees.  I  would  like  to  remind  this  august 
<br/>Parliament that the rules on 48-hour food rations to occupants of these evacuation centres were put 
<br/>in place by the previous Government and is currently under review.  We are reviewing the existing 
<br/>policies in places to ensure easy access and fast delivery of services to the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, heavy rain warnings were again monitored by the National and Divisional 
<br/>EOC’s  on  17</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2023  and  in  light  of  the  adverse  weather  conditions  experienced,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education advised schools to close and Permanent Secretaries to allow non-essential civil 
<br/>service to take early leave.  This was part of our preparedness effort to ensure safety for all.  During 
<br/></span><span>this  event,  there  were  two  Evacuation  Centres  opened  with  five  households,  21  evacuees  in  the 
<br/></span><span>Western Division.  All Evacuation Centres were closed by 19</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, less than 48 hours of 
<br/>its opening.  I can give you a more detailed breakdown if you want more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  7</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2023  due  to  the  effects  of  </span><span>TC  Kevin</span><span>,  the  Western  Division  EOC’s  were 
<br/>activated to monitor the adverse weather conditions. No evacuation centre was opened, however, 32 
<br/>families were impacted  by floodwater upon the  Commissioner of Western Team  field  visit  while 
<br/>waiting for the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct an initial damage assessment, the Commissioner 
<br/>Western mobilised its community partnership watch and worked with our friend from the Foundation 
<br/>for Rural Integrated Enterprises &amp; Development (FRIEND) to provide food ration to these affected 
<br/>families.  Again, the breakdown is available, and we can give them to you if you need them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his answers.   I 
<br/>think all of us as part of the Pacific fraternity appreciate the assistance that was given to our friends 
<br/>in New Zealand and also to our Melanesian cousins in Vanuatu. I am glad to see that the Ministry is 
<br/>still taking this further, I think the legacy issue that the former Assistant Minister Nath was talking 
<br/>about, the legacy issues was related to the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Coming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…  relationship  between  Fiji  Meteorological  and  NDMO  in  giving  the  advance  warnings 
<br/>because they are in different ministries.  But I think what has happened now, that is more not a real 
<br/>legacy issue, but it is a matter of coordination between the two different ministries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue that I wanted to bring up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that over the past few years, we have 
<br/>developed this new facility called the Fiji Emergency Medical Assistance Team (FEMAT) which has 
<br/>been useful.  We were probably the ninth nation in the world to develop this, the first of the small 
<br/>island countries, we were accredited by the World Health Organisation  (WHO) and that was one 
<br/>example  of  the  things  that  were  done  to  prepare  ourselves  for  disasters.  We  also  developed  the 
<br/>warehouses, so my question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FEMAT was it also involved in this exercise that was 
<br/>carried out in Vanuatu and New Zealand and what are your plans for further building up this capacity 
<br/>of providing assistance through FEMAT? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>451 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, FEMAT was  part of the team in Vanuatu, it 
<br/>was not sent to New Zealand though. It is part of the future planning for the Ministry, we are going 
<br/>to be developing strategies on developing our National Emergency Response Teams (NERT).  That 
<br/>is going to be part of what will be submitted to Cabinet shortly. I think Solomon Islands is the only 
<br/>island nation in the Pacific that has developed its NERT capacity at the moment.  Fiji is working very 
<br/>closely with its agencies to try and develop the RFMF, Fiji Police, NFA and other teams like FEMAT 
<br/>to  try  and  develop  SOPs  and  procedures  on  how  we  will  progress  that  so  that  we  can  be  readily 
<br/>available to call upon them when we need them, both for local intervention as well as the regional.

<div><span>Cane Price Per Tonne of Sugarcane 
<br/>(Question No. 05/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament on what cane price will cane farmers get per tonne of sugarcane in the next season? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question by honourable Bala.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My response will be very short and simple.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have just been appointed as a Minister for Sugar Industry, it is nearly three months now.  I 
<br/>want to share what has been discovered in the sugar industry with this Parliament.  To begin with, I 
<br/>wish to thank all the sugar stakeholders including the cane farmers who were sharing their issues 
<br/>honestly  and  openly  with  me.    So  far,  I  have  held  a  number  of  meetings  with  all  sugar  industry 
<br/>institutions and visited all its facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  also  visited  the  cane  growers  and  made  numerous  field  visits, 
<br/>whereby, I gained first-hand knowledge and opportunity to see how growers were suffering due to 
<br/>lack of infrastructure and waterlogged farms.  The infilled drains were almost invisible with infested 
<br/>weeds, overgrown plants and grass.  With these waterlogged farms, the cane plants were stranded 
<br/>and will not grow as it is supposed to be thus impact on cane production and yield.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The farms are dominated only by ratoon crops with more than 10 years of age with barely 5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent of planted cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I will come to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ratoon crops are not yielding outputs as expected and the productivity is below 50 tonnes 
<br/>per hectare for a very long time.  Monocropping is the key result for depleted soil health cleaning 
<br/>almost all under cane into the acidic soil.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rail networks have almost disappeared in some areas while 
<br/>the rail carts are in bad shape causing frequent derailments.  Many of the productive and hardworking 
<br/>growers are paid same as those providing lower cane quality. There have been incentives for them to 
<br/>work harder and it will improve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes. No proper attention was given to the growers on how to support 
<br/>them in reducing the production cost.  This would have significantly reduced the cost and increased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>452 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the overall income of key farmers interested in the sugar cane.  For decades, FSC has been producing 
<br/>only  one  product  and  that  is  sugar.    There  has  been  no  diversification  as  those  of  other  sugar 
<br/>producing countries.  The actual cream of the cake is being enjoyed by the overseas buyers who take 
<br/>our sugar, refine it and sell it at a premium price, making huge profits through our hard work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to add value here in Fiji.  Issues identified by many, I will not speak more but provide 
<br/>my response to the question by honourable Bala.  Currently, my Ministry is working on a new plan 
<br/>with budget requirements for 2023-2024 financial year.  Therefore, the Ministry will continue with 
<br/>the budget allocated to it in 2022-2023 financial year.  So my answer is, the growers will be paid $85 
<br/>a tonne for this year, and this is what I have told the growers and stakeholders in all my meetings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third cane payment for the 2022 season, which is $24.62 per tonne, the highest compared 
<br/>to previous payments will be made.  I will not reveal any further details about what will happen in 
<br/>2023-2024 financial year budget as the process has not been completed and it is impulsive to make 
<br/>any speculation what will be paid next season.  Let the People’s Coalition Government do its work 
<br/>with  proper  planning,  well-reasoned  ideas  and  thorough  inclusive  consultation  that  will  concern 
<br/>stakeholders for the sugar industry and complete our budget for 2023-2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Supplementary question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if that is the case, then when 
<br/></span><span>the Government will implement the increased guaranteed minimum cane price as promised during 
<br/>the election campaign? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Who promised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Just get up and say what for the budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Wait for the budget, honourable Bala.  No one promised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Wait for the budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was part (a).  Now,(b), is it true that the sales of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>truck, which I have highlighted in the last session, have been put on hold and if, yes, then why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Too many questions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- That is totally a new question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Too many questions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You are only asking about the sugar price, that is it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- One at a time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have raised two questions, honourable Bala.  One is about trucks and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the other one is about the sugar price. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do not want to create this Chamber into the function 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that was  held in New Zealand.

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>That is exactly what he is trying to do here.  I am asking you and you have to answer as a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister.  You cannot run away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have answered…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Can you sit down?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will now take honourable Seruiratu’s question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Baitho, baitho</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said in the last Parliament, it is a matter of 
<br/>interest and that relates to what he has just said.  Is it true that the sales of truck have been put on 
<br/>hold and if yes, then why?  It is a simple question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- If you do not know the answer, say so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  totally  a  new  question  and  if  he  wants  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answer, he  submits a new question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will go back to  the original  question.  You 
<br/>would recall when we had the Business Committee Meeting, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/>who unfortunately is not here, wanted us to clarify whether it was the current season’s price or the 
<br/>next season’s price, and that is why this question is appearing and has been raised. So the simple 
<br/>question again, he is not committing which is disappointing.  What will be the price per tonne of 
<br/>sugar or cane in the next season?  That is the original question that you are avoiding, honourable 
<br/>Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, $85 is guaranteed now.  For the next budget, once the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>next budget comes out, you will get a new figure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  I do not want to ask anything, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Do not go.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Rubbish! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Areh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament if the 
<br/>subsidies on fertiliser, chemicals and the assistance towards land preparation, sugar cane planting 
<br/>and the subsidised rates on machinery will continue as it was during FijiFirst? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, again the honourable Member should understand that

<div><span>2022-2023 Informal Settlement Upgrade Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 06/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on  the  informal  settlements  that  will  be  upgraded  under  the  Informal  Settlement  Upgrade 
<br/>Programme in the 2022-2023 financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question that has been 
<br/>posed by the honourable Member.  The rural to urban migration is one of the primary reasons for the 
<br/>increase  of  informal  settlements  in  our  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.    Informal  settlements  have 
<br/>become a major feature in Fiji’s urban life for the past 40 years to 50 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Informal  Settlement  Upgrade  Programme  is  an  in-situ  capital 
<br/>programme that intends to improve the housing standards of people living in informal settlements 
<br/></span><span>across our nation.  These programmes gives priority to the provision of basic services such as water, 
<br/></span><span>waste water, drainage, road, electricity and a functional tenure through issuance of 99-year lease titles 
<br/>to eligible settlers.  The Ministry continues to carry out upgrades to informal settlements through 
<br/>progressive  planning  and  preparation  works  that  will  minimise  disturbance  of  the  day-to-day 
<br/>activities of settlers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  last  financial  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  completed  three  informal 
<br/>settlements.  Unfortunately, honourable Bala is not here - Waidamudamu in Nausori, Ledrusasa in 
<br/>Nadi and Cuvu in Sigatoka with a total investment of more than $11 million. Even though the three 
<br/>projects  were  completed,  it  took  a  bit  of  time  for  the  Ministry  to  complete  these  projects.  
<br/>Waidamudamu took close to five years, Ledrusasa nearly seven years and Cuvu eight years.  With 
<br/>the completion of upgrades, we are working to finalise royalty works of the issuance of 99 years lease 
<br/>titles that will benefit 451 households in the three settlements.  This has been long awaited by the 
<br/>settlers and we will make it our priority to issue the lease titles they rightfully deserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, preparation works for the upgrades of our informal settlements goes through 
<br/>various phases.  The preparation phases include topographic surveys, scheme plans, environmental 
<br/>impact  assessments,  geotech  surveys  and  engineering  plans.    At  the  completion  of  these  phases, 
<br/></span><span>construction works then commences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2022-2023 financial year, two informal settlements have commenced 
<br/>construction works.  These are Sakoca in Nasinu which accommodates 174 households and Tabela 
<br/>in  Nadi  accommodates  68  households.    The  total  project  cost  for  the  upgrades  in  these  informal 
<br/>settlements amounts to $9.9 million out of which $5.9 million is for Sakoca and $4 million for Tabela.  
<br/>The third informal settlement that is lined up to commence construction work in April is Field 4 in 
<br/>Lautoka which has 77 households at a total project cost of $5.3 million. So, at the end of the upgrade, 
<br/>a total of 319 households will have access to fully serviced subdivided lots with access to basic utility 
<br/>services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 10 settlements that are in preparation phase this financial year, 
<br/>four settlements have reached tendered documentation phase and will be earmarked to commence 
<br/>construction works.  These areas include Tore, Lovu Seaside, Nabare and Delaisaweni Settlements 
<br/>in  Lautoka.  The  total  project  cost  of  the  upgrades  of  these  settlements  amounts  to  a  tune  of  $38 
<br/>million that will be made progressively.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>455 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the remaining six Settlements - Valewaquyaya in Ba, Vunika in Labasa, 
<br/>Caubati  and  Wakanisila  in  Nasinu,  Sasawira  in  Nausori  and  Nadonumai  in  Lami  have  had  their 
<br/>scheme plans completed and will be progressing to have their engineering plans completed by this 
<br/>financial year.  The total project cost for the upgrades in these settlements is nearly $42 million which 
<br/>is  an investment  that will  also  be made progressively.   The Ministry had acquired two additional 
<br/>development leases in the financial year for Valenimasima in Nadi and Sakoca too in Nasinu.  The 
<br/>Ministry currently has a total of 48 development leases, out of these, four settlements are on State 
<br/>land and 44 are on </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon acquiring these development leases, the Ministry pays for the lease 
<br/>premium  and yearly ground rentals.  This  financial year we have paid  close to  $123,000 in  lease 
<br/>premiums for the two new development leases and more than $110,000 for ground rental and renewal 
<br/>of lease.  This process has benefitted both landowners and settlers in these informal settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to  work with  and not  against informality and 
<br/>ensure that the livelihoods and economic opportunities for those living in informal settlements are 
<br/>forwarded through the informal settlement upgrade programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The upgrading and formalization of informal settlements supports Fiji’s Progress Towards 
<br/></span><span>Achieving  one  of  the  SDGs  that  was  alluded  earlier  by  honourable  Seruiratu,  in  this  case  it  is 
<br/>SDG11or making cities and urban settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable with a target 
<br/>of ensuring access for all to adequate safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade 
<br/>informal settlements by 2030.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  thank  the  Member  for  his  response  to  the 
<br/>question.  It is quite interesting sitting this side and listening to the response because that is precisely 
<br/>what we did.  There is nothing new and I understand because the question was for the 2022-2023 
<br/>financial year.  So, everything he has said is what we have done… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Of course, I am coming to the question.  That is exactly what we have 
<br/>done and the reason why I am emphasizing this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because when I used to tell them 
<br/>what we were doing, they refused to believe, and I hope they will believe now what the Member has 
<br/>said.    My  question  is,  what  are  the  challenges  the  Ministry  is  facing  when  it  comes  to  in-situ 
<br/>development? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  my  response,  I mentioned that one of the 
<br/>three  projects  that  will  be  completed  this  year  is  Waidamudamu.    It  started  way  back  in  2017,  I 
<br/>remember I attended that groundbreaking ceremony.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the upgrading of informal settlements, as alluded to by the former Minister, it is about 
<br/>upgrading of in-situ capital developments.  What that actually means is that, it is something that is 
<br/>different from a normal sub-division.  Like when there is a parcel of land, there is no development 
<br/>on  site,  there  is  no  settlement  on  the  site.    So,  in  this  case,  the  Ministry  is  trying  to  formalise 
<br/>settlements that have already been resided or occupied by settlers.  It takes time for the consultants - 
<br/>the draughtsman, to actually come up with a scheme plan, they have to try and come up with a plan 
<br/>so that it accommodates everyone in that settlement.   So, the scheme plan will take time, I understand 
<br/>some of the reasons why some of these projects were delayed because when the settlers went in, there 
<br/>was no scheme plan ready.  So, these are some of the things that the Ministry faces, it actually gets 
<br/>the  scheme  plan  done,  gets  the  engineering  plans  done  and  the  survey  plan  approved  before  we 
<br/>actually give out the land leases to all the settlers.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>456 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister has been like a breath of fresh 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>air.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  These  are  exactly  the  things  that  we  have  been  explaining  in 
<br/>Parliament these past few years, so as I always invited you, come into the light, finally you are coming 
<br/>into the light.  I just have one question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can you just give us an update on Qauia?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see me holding one of the plans that 
<br/>the Ministry has drawn up including all the settlements that we are intending to do this year.  Qauia 
<br/>is one of the settlements that we are targeting to also see this year.  Qauia is a big area.  If you have 
<br/>been to Qauia, one portion of Qauia is a flood prone area, so these are some of the things that we 
<br/>need to consider before we actually go in and formalise the Qauia settlement.   On your question, 
<br/>honourable Member, the Ministry is in the process of considering Qauia in one of our future project 
<br/>developments for informal settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, as everyone is aware when a development lease is 
<br/></span><span>acquired, the sitting tenants do not pay any kind of rental.  Recently there are news that there are 
<br/></span><span>certain landowners, not all, who are actually asking the sitting tenants to pay rental.  Is the Ministry 
<br/>aware of this?  If it is happening, what is the Ministry actually doing to stop this?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Thank  you  for  the  question,  honourable  Member.    I  think  the 
<br/>question is not related to the question that I have been asked to respond to this evening.  But as far 
<br/>as I am concerned, I have not received any complaints or queries from current residents regarding 
<br/>payments that are done to the landlords.  If there are issues, please feel free to forward those queries 
<br/>to my office.  </span><span>

<div><span>Our Ocean Conference - Panama 
<br/>(Question No. 07/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  inform 
<br/>Parliament on the positive outcomes of Our Ocean Conference in Panama? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that positive outcomes from international conferences take time to materialise. 
<br/>Honourable Members of this Parliament know that international conferences such as the “Our Ocean 
<br/>Conference” that the honourable Ravunawa is asking about which was held in Panama City between 
<br/>the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> and 3</span><span>rd</span><span> March, 2023 was a part of a series of talks and meetings and conferences that I thought 
<br/>began  in  1992  but  in  fact  it  began  in  1972  in  Europe.    We  had  sent  our  Minister  for  Urban 
<br/>Development, Housing and Climate Change at the time and these conferences come up with all sorts 
<br/>of things that we later develop into our development policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  recent  one  in  Panama  was  the  Our  Ocean  Conference.    The  short  answer  to  the 
<br/>question, is that we are expecting US$1.695 billion in Green Climate Funds which will go towards 
<br/>the  Fiji  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Management  Project,  some  will  go  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Agrophotovoltaic  Project  in  Bureta,  Ovalau,  a  Global  Subnational  Climate  Fund  (Technical 
<br/>Assistance Facility), Global Subnational Climate Fund (Equity), Global Fund for Coral Reefs

<div><span>457 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment window enhancing direct access to climate finance in Fiji Phase One and enhancing direct 
<br/>access to climate finance in Fiji Phase Two.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  presenting  a  very  detailed  Ministerial  Statement  after  the 
<br/>presentation of my report to Cabinet tomorrow.  Basically, the outcomes of that conference are those 
<br/>that I have read out and we do not take all the credit because a lot of these discussions had happened 
<br/>before we were elected in, but we found also that there are catch-up legislations which we have to 
<br/>put in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the climate change champion will know, we need to put in place those legislations that 
<br/>make us compliant with the international expectation for those that are going to be receiving these 
<br/>funds and contributing to the reduction of global warming as the national champion had said - 1.5 
<br/>Degrees target.  That tries to get the world back to pre-industrial standards or temperatures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I will take supplementary questions, but I will also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>present a Ministerial Statement later on in the Sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is the eighth Oral Question for today and it is under honourable Sakiusa 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tubuna who is not available.  Normally, the question lapses when the author is not available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  noticed  that  the  former  Speaker  entertained  this,  but  I  want  to  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Members,  are  we  going  to  be  entertaining  this  because  honourable  Isikeli  Tuiwailevu  is  readily 
<br/>available to ask that question, but I would like the honourable Members to decide on that. If it moves 
<br/>on, the question lapses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- We move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- So, we will move on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(</span><span>Oral Question No. 08/2023 lapses</span><span>) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I have a clarification being sought, I think this might benefit everyone in 
<br/>Parliament with respect to the written questions. So, just a quick clarification. The question that is 
<br/>being asked in terms of Written Question, the dates on it, Mr. Speaker, with respect to Question 9(b) 
<br/>is actually the period January 2005 to 16</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021. This does not correlate with the financial 
<br/>years.  I think they may want to amend it to put it within the financial years so that we can all get a 
<br/></span><span>proper answer for the financial year reporting time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I think, honourable Koya is a Member of the Business Committee. 
<br/>This was not raised in the Business Committee and the questions have passed so I think it should not 
<br/>be allowed to be asked unless the honourable Member right now wishes to amend on the floor as 
<br/>requested and covers the whole financial year, then that can be done here.  But as far as the Business 
<br/>Committee is concerned, it had passed and it is here on the Order Paper, and that we should proceed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not even sure. We are all interested in the answer, but I am not sure 
<br/>how they are actually going to report it because there is a reference to annual reports. It is just a date 
<br/>change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If they want to move to change it here that is fine, Sir, as long as they  fit it in within the 
<br/>financial period because there are no reports specific to any other period. It is specific to an annual 
<br/>report and these particular dates that have been mentioned January 2005 to 16</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021, 
<br/>how does that work, Sir, it does not.  We do not have any objection to an amendment been made on
