<h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery, 
<br/>and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet.  Thank you for taking interest in 
<br/>your Parliament.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Extension of Time - Cybercrime Treaty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I received a request from the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
<br/>and Defence seeking an extension of time with respect to the tabling of the Committee’s Report on 
<br/>the Cybercrime Treaty.  I have subsequently approved the request, so as to allow the Committee to 
<br/>thoroughly scrutinise the Treaty before tabling its Report in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resignation of Leader of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  on  the  matter  of  the  resignation  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  I 
<br/>confirm receiving the resignation from the Leader of the Opposition on 8</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023.  I referred 
<br/></span><span>the matter to the Privileges Committee and sought clarification from the Committee on whether there 
<br/></span><span>were any further aspects or impact on the privileges matter to consider before proceeding to deal with 
<br/>the resignation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  can  also  confirm  that  I  have  now  received  the  response  from  the  Privileges  Committee 
<br/>stating that under its remit, there were no further comments to make nor actions that the Committee 
<br/>would undertake on the matter.  In that respect, honourable Members, my Office has now proceeded 
<br/>with the processing of the resignation pursuant to the Electoral Act 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
