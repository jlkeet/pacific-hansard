<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE 
<br/> 2016-2018 CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
<br/>Consolidated Annual Reports from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2016 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017 and 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2017 
<br/>to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 which was tabled on 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  TUIWAILEVU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; before I speak on the Review Report, firstly, I would like to congratulate 
<br/>the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, the newly elected Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Inia Seruiratu.  Sir, I wish you well in your appointment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  former  and  current  honourable  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Natural Resources, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion regarding the Committee Review 
<br/>Report on the 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 Annual Review of the Ministry of Agriculture which 
<br/>was tabled in Parliament by the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Sanjay Kirpal, on 
<br/>Wednesday, 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the bipartisan Committee Report examines, compares and analyses 
<br/>the  performance  of  the  Ministry  administration,  legislation,  organisational  structure,  financial 
<br/>management, functions and programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee,  in  its  review  process,  has  identified  concerns  relating  to  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>management,  extension  and  service  delivery  to  all  stakeholders.  The  review  exercise  was  made 
<br/>possible through consultations and verification meeting with the Permanent Secretary and the Senior 
<br/>Staff of the Ministry of Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee,  following  its  scrutiny  of  the  two  Annual  Reports,  made  the  following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span>That the Ministry of Agriculture work harder to reduce the trade deficit that stood at $451 
<br/>million, 232 percent at the end of the 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/></span><span>That the Ministry must endeavour to do various analysis that will help manage the budget 
<br/>more brilliantly and more accurately and monitor success and failure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>618 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommends  prompt  action  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  internal  control  of  payroll 
<br/>expenses and management of inventories of trading activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Committee was satisfied with the operation of the Ministry of Agriculture for the 
<br/>period of 2016–2017 and 2017– 018.  With those sentiments, I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we have a list of four speakers as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we open the floor for debate on this motion.  The order of speakers is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable R.R. Sharma; 
<br/>Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports; 
<br/>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and 
<br/>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the Review Report of 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture Consolidated Annual Reports 2016–2017 and 2017–2018.  I would like 
<br/>to thank the honourable Members of this Committee for compiling this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As some of the findings of the Committee with a slow recovery economy like ours, a trade 
<br/>deficit would generally affect job creation and economic growth.  This trade deficit simply means 
<br/>that we are spending more on imports and we make more on exports and under the rules of economic 
<br/>accounting, we have to make up for the shortfalls through foreign borrowings and investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  recommendations  I  would  like  to  highlight,  and  as  already  been  said,  that  the 
<br/>Committee recommended that the Ministry must work in reducing the trade deficit that stood at a 
<br/>staggering $451 million which is 232 percent at the end of 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I believe that a healthy, sustainable and an inclusive food system is 
<br/>critical to achieve Fiji’s development goals.  Agricultural development is one of the most powerful 
<br/>tools to end extreme poverty, to boost shared prosperity and feed a projected 9.7 billion people by 
<br/>2050. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture is the world’s largest industry as it employs over a billion people and generates 
<br/>over $1.3 trillion worth of food annually.  When agricultural operations are sustainably managed, 
<br/>they can preserve, restore critical habitats, improve soil health, improve water quality, human health 
<br/>and biodiversity as a whole.  When you look at the globalisation of the food system, accompanied by 
<br/>a concentration of food distributors, processors and a growing consumer awareness, it increases the 
<br/>need for effective, coordinated and a proactive national food system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this brings my attention to climate change.  Fiji’s agriculture is one 
<br/>of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change impacts with implications to food security, water 
<br/>security and livelihoods and even the economic stability.  With these vulnerabilities, as populations 
<br/>expand, agricultural production must be more efficient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To have a profound understanding of how climate change affects our agriculture, it affects 
<br/></span><span>the perimeters the plants grow in which is basically the temperature, humidity, the pH which is the 
<br/>power  of  hydrogen  and  their  concentration  levels.    With  climate  change,  we  have  extreme 
<br/>temperatures, and the plants go in a state of shock, stress and that is why quantity and quality is low 
<br/>in the Pacific region and in Fiji in particular.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>619 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the Agriculture Census 2020, the status number of farmers in Fiji is 83,395 and 
<br/>only 14.4 percent are women.  But when we talk about Fiji’s agriculture, we talk about plants, but it 
<br/>is actually about the soil because in soil farming, we do not feed the plant, we feed the soil.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If Fiji needs to transition to organic farming, we really need to work on Fiji’s waste recycling 
<br/>and management system.  If a policy or in the future can be introduced that households separate their 
<br/>waste,  like  plastics,  cardboard  which  is  rich  carbon,  and  then  the  kitchen  waste  which  is  organic 
<br/>matter, pure and entirely rich that can be used as compose and if this was collected and made into a 
<br/>compose and used as a fertiliser, then this would greatly reduce the importation of synthetic fertilisers 
<br/>in  Fiji.   Because it is  not  about  building  a rich  economy,  we should focus on building  a wealthy 
<br/>economy,  a  wealthy  nation  and  this  is  measured  through  the  help  of  our  Fijian  people.    And  as 
<br/>honourable  Professor  Prasad  has  stated  that  his  focus  is  on  the  healthcare  system,  this  would 
<br/>automatically reduce the burden on our healthcare system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend the vision of our honourable Minister for Agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I commend his ambitions and efforts to push Fijian-grown products to international markets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But that reminds me that I would like to thank the FijiFirst Government for not selling our 
<br/>airline during the pandemic because our airline made an instrumental and critical role in exporting 
<br/>locally  grown  produce  to  overseas  destinations.    This  is  the  efforts  of  the  FijiFirst  strategic  and 
<br/>decisive leadership.  This is how the airline has supported our grassroots and commercial farmers. 
<br/>This is the reason we did not sell our planes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is more, Madam Deputy Speaker, because the airlines got the vaccination, Fiji was the 
<br/>safe region to travel.  We had opened our border to the tourists and Fiji was the third fastest growing 
<br/>economy in the world, according to Focus Economics. This is because of the decisive leadership by 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- That also brings my attention to ginger farming ,as highlighted by 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture.  Yes,  there  is  a  need  for  ginger  because  ginger  plays  an 
<br/>instrumental role in the production of most medication as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, a suggestion is to create value added supply chains in Fiji, that we do not sell ginger for 
<br/>ginger anymore.  We sell ginger, oil ginger, extract ginger paste, ginger powder, this will help to 
<br/>reduce the implications that we have, let us say, with Australia, who has strict border protocols with 
<br/>their  biosecurity.  So,  when  we  extract  the  water  content  out  of  ginger  and  turmeric  as  well,  we 
<br/>increase their shelf life.   This is something to look into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge the Local Government on not just cultivating crops 
<br/>but cultivating the next generation of farmers in Fiji and to help farmers to smoothy transition into 
<br/>the supply chain. I will give an example, Madam Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When a farmer in Fiji projects to grow on one acre of land, it does not necessarily mean he 
<br/></span><span>will harvest one acre of crops.  There are challenges he will face in cultivation, harvesting, logistics 
<br/></span><span>and by the time it reaches the supermarket or the restaurant or reaches the ship to be imported, that 
<br/>production  is  less,  the  prices  have  increased,  and  supermarkets  tend  not  to  indulge  with  local 
<br/>suppliers.  Supermarkets intend to buy from overseas because they buy large quantities, the unit price 
<br/>per orange or per apple is reduced and the local farmers are neglected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>620 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, what happens in some situations, when local farmers supply 
<br/>to the supermarket and if any of their produce is not sold, they are not paid for the entire amount they 
<br/>supplied, and this is an issue that needs to be looked at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The responsibility, Madam Deputy Speaker, is also on the honourable Minister for Sugar who 
<br/>is not here because the question on him is, how will he encourage the next generation of Fijians to 
<br/>enter the sugarcane farming industry?  That is a huge responsibility on him and also the budgetary 
<br/>allocation to get this task going. I believe that is a discussion that the honourable Minister for Sugar 
<br/>Industry and the honourable Minister of Finance can have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have also heard in the news, I think, on 7</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023, that 
<br/>there might be an increase in tax and also they have spoken about the Fiscal Review Committee. The 
<br/>increase in tax - just that news, has left people worried. But I urge the Coalition Government to reduce 
<br/>the duty placed on agricultural supplies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am aware of the concessions available but, please, consider reducing the duty on agricultural 
<br/>supplies because that will automatically reduce the unit cost of local production. This will benefit our 
<br/>farmers.  You in Government so you do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  common  example,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  is  the  plastic  seedling  trays  used  by  our 
<br/>farmers.    Just  imagine,  tomorrow  there  is  a  pandemic,  we,  as  Fijians,  need  to  ask  ourselves  the 
<br/>question,  are  we  ready?  Are  we  ready  to  be  locked  or  confined  in  our  premises?    Is  there  food 
<br/>security?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know the answer, and this is why Fiji, as a nation, we need to immediately invest in 
<br/>improving  our  agriculture  and  fisheries  and  our  food  systems.    We  believe  that  in  time  to  come, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, agriculture can be the backbone of our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this also brings me to the honourable Minister of Finance, who said 
<br/>in his morning Statement that he wants to hear more on economic debate. Well, Parliament is a good 
<br/>start.    So,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  humbly  request  you  to,  please,  allow  the  Opposition  more 
<br/>supplementary questions since the honourable Minister of Finance very strongly and confidently say, 
<br/>“He welcomes the debate, he welcomes the questions.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as a leader, I have the responsibility to cultivate the next generation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of leaders. Madam Deputy Speaker, 11 days ago … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, allow the honourable Member to complete his speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am also part of the US Embassy Youth 
<br/>Council where I get to see a lot of opportunities like fellowships, internship, grants opportunities, 
<br/></span><span>that  is  addressed  to  the  youths  of  Fiji.    So,  I  thought,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  a  Member  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, my duty is to cultivate the next generation of leaders and how do I connect this to the 
<br/>beneficiaries and our youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I walked into the Office of the Ministry Youth and Sports, and say, “Could you, please, list 
<br/>down  the  list  of  cooperatives  you  have  so  that  I  connect  these  donors,  these  agencies  to  the 
<br/>cooperatives?”.  However, I still have not got any response and it has been 11 days. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it is the last day of </span><span>Ram Naumi</span><span> and I would 
<br/>like to wish the Hindu families, my brothers and sisters, a Happy  </span><span>Ram Naumi</span><span>.  I wish prosperity, 
<br/>growth, success and may your aspirations and ambitions all come true.  I would like to make two 
<br/>statements - this is said in Hindi, that defines our Ramayana and Mahabharata, it goes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Jis par hamara hak na ho, aur use lene ki mann ho, tab Mahabharat shuru hoti hai, 
<br/>  Jis par hamara hak ho aur use chhod dene ka mann ho, tab Ramayan shuru hoti hai.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  it basically means, Madam  Deputy  Speaker, is  what does not belong to  us and it is 
<br/>something that we want to take by force, then a battles begins.  And what belongs to us and we still 
<br/>let it go, that is when </span><span>Ramayan</span><span> begins and that is how Lord Rama had let go of his throne and listen 
<br/>to his father’s decision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being said, Madam Deputy Speaker, that is the difference between </span><span>Ramayan</span><span> and 
<br/></span><span>Mahabharat </span><span>and speaking of differences, lastly, someone said to me that teaching economics and 
<br/>running the economy is two different things. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We will continue, honourable Members.  I had said that it 
<br/>was going to be the honourable Saukuru who is going to be speaking in second, but it is actually the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T. K. RAYALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to respond to the Report tabled 
<br/>by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources with regards to the 2016-2017 and 
<br/>2017-2018 Ministry of Agriculture Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me begin by commending the former Members of the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and also the current Members for the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Recommendation  No.1,  the  $451  million  Agriculture  Trade  Deficit  recorded  in  2016 
<br/>consists of the overall fresh chilled and value-added agriculture produce. This includes the imports 
<br/>of wheat and wheat products, rice, dairy products, potatoes, onion, garlic and livestock products.  If 
<br/>you compare the figure and consider only fresh and chilled agriculture produce, then there is a noted 
<br/>drop in the trade deficit from $255.2 million in 2016 to $245.9 million in 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I have quoted these figures not for argument’s sake but to highlight 
<br/>that the efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture Officials and  farmers alike in this country have not 
<br/>been in vain and will not be in vain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I salute every farming family in Fiji - every young farmer, woman farmer and, of course, the 
<br/>hardworking Ministry of Agriculture staff that work in sometimes trying conditions.  While most of 
<br/>us sit here in comfort, most of my Government field staff operated from below standard offices while 
<br/></span><span>living in disgusting conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  decrease  in  trade  deficit  is  the  impact  of  interventions  that 
<br/>supported growth and the expansion of agriculture production, ensuring improved food nutrition and 
<br/>income security for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>622 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji’s geographical location, tropical climate and other favourable 
<br/>conditions  contribute  to  the  country’s  comparative  advantage  of  producing  significant  crops  and 
<br/>livestock  products  such  as  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>,  </span><span>dalo</span><span>,  ginger,  turmeric,  cassava  and  vegetables,  together  with 
<br/>livestock namely, poultry and pork, which contributed to an average of 85 percent of totally fresh 
<br/>and chilled export over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The trade deficit for 2016-2018 has to be also attributed to the Category 5 </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>. Kava 
<br/>was hit hard which was the number one export, not in absolute terms but in the long term we suffered 
<br/>a setback for, at least, four to five years which is the period when kava or yaqona actually matures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Crop production was hampered also by the 2014-2015 drought in the Western and Northern 
<br/>parts of Fiji and was further compounded by the shock of the 2016 Category 5 Cyclone.  Drought 
<br/>and cyclones are two disasters with extreme ends when it comes to damage to the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  deal  with  a  production  system  that  is  biological  in  nature.  It 
<br/>requires time and continuous investment to bring it back to, at least, the same production level.  The 
<br/>loss of one productive cow results in the loss of six to eight subsequent carves in their sixth to seventh 
<br/>year with a multiplier effect. It takes, at least, three years to replace that same cow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In early April 2018, Category 1</span><span> TC Josie</span><span> hit the Western and Central parts of Fiji causing 
<br/>flooding, particularly in the main island of Viti Levu in the Western Division.  A week later on 10</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April, </span><span>TC Keni</span><span> passed closed to Viti Levu as a Category 3 system overnight, compounding the impact 
<br/>of </span><span>TC Josie</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Western Division, </span><span>TC Josie</span><span> and </span><span>TC Keni</span><span> have affected an estimated 77,000 people, 
<br/>while in the Northern Division 700 people are estimated who have been affected. The storm also 
<br/>affected the Eastern Division, particularly on Kadavu Island. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the Ministry considered mitigating the effects of climate change by introducing 
<br/>disease-resistance  and  drought-tolerant  crop  varieties,  livestock  pure  breeds  for  beef  and  dairy 
<br/>production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, has identified 
<br/>key priority areas that will ensure sustainable growth and expansion of the fresh and chilled export 
<br/>and reduction of the import bill in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the next four years, as I have already alluded to in my earlier speeches, the formation of 
<br/>co-operatives  will  allow  farmers  to  own  and  control  their  farming  entrepreneurship,  while 
<br/>encouraging member contribution to share responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Intensive livestock farming production system for mass livestock production and to improve 
<br/>meat quality to meet consumers and hotel preferences to provide opportunity also for proper waste 
<br/>management,  enhancing  Embryo  Transfer  Technology  (ETT),  mass  replication  of  breed  and 
<br/>production of maize and juncao to reduce import of nutritious feed components.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To that end, the Ministry is already in talks with major local investors who are interested in 
<br/></span><span>growing some of the components of the livestock feed that we currently import, only to be grown 
<br/>here, especially those that we can grow locally like maize, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Government will ensure that we tap into the potential value or value 
<br/>adding production to accommodate access of surplus production in the future through the provision 
<br/>of food processing machines, investment in research and development and capacity building.  I think 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>623 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that answers the honourable Member’s sentiments in the Ministry of Agriculture or the agriculture 
<br/>sector, going more into value addition as a way out of the impasse that is caused by fresh agriculture 
<br/>export.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, reducing deficit requires a holistic participatory collaboration and 
<br/>consultative approach of all key actors along the value chain.  Government will ensure, through the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture, that regular genuine dialogue and consultation with key players will drive 
<br/>the agriculture sector forward in targeting the reduction of its trade deficit now and in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation No.2, Government through the Ministry of Agriculture has in place a 
<br/>five-year Strategic Development Plan.  This, I have already alluded to in my earlier speeches, which 
<br/>will enable the Ministry to effectively track performance </span><span>and to monitor and evaluate every investment 
<br/>made by Government is sustainable and has an impact on the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  cascading  plans  include  the  Annual  Cost  to  the 
<br/>Operational Plan.  The plan is used to effectively manage costs daily, weekly, monthly et cetera to 
<br/>ensure that the Ministry is able to successfully achieve the goals that has been set.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of variance analysis, the Ministry has set up a compliance unit this year and an online 
<br/></span><span>software for real time monitoring of projects.  It has already been in use by the private sector in Fiji 
<br/>and few of the Government Ministries.  I must commend the honourable Seruiratu because this was 
<br/>one of the projects that we initiated during his time as Minister for Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture has experienced non-qualified Annual Financial Statements for 
<br/>the last two years, reducing around 20 qualification issues to zero. Madam Deputy Speaker, as part 
<br/>of  the  Ministry’s  reform,  a  series  of  project  and  budget  capacity  building  programmes  were 
<br/>undertaken by the Vivid Pacific and European Technical Advisers for Rural Sustainable Livelihood 
<br/>by the European Union to train project managers in the divisions on how to effectively and efficiently 
<br/>manage public sector projects.  This capacity building programmes further include monitoring and 
<br/>evaluation  framework,  governance  structures  and  the  sectors  situation  analysis  as  relevant  tools 
<br/>towards the project success. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  project  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  a  normal  part  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic sector ministries like the Ministry of Agriculture to monitor capital programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Government through the Ministry of Agriculture places emphasis 
<br/>on an organisation structure that is responsive to people’s needs.  The Ministry of Agriculture has 
<br/>been weakened with a number of vacant key positions and an organisation structure that I can only 
<br/>term  as  “cripple”.    The  Ministry’s  visibility  on  the  ground  as  I  have  already  alluded  to  earlier  is 
<br/>severely  affected  by  these  vacancies.    To  that  end,  the  Ministry  is  now  considering  a  functional 
<br/>organisation structure and has already embarked on the filling of these positions in consultation with 
<br/>the Public Service Commission to build a stronger and more resilient organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation 3, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government through the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture is conducting a weekly and fortnightly reconciliation of wages and salaries, payroll to 
<br/>payroll and payroll to general ledger on a monthly basis to ensure proper management of payroll 
<br/>expenses.  The Ministry is further complying with internal control procedures through the continuous 
<br/>recording  of  its  fiscal  assets  and  resources  and  it  regularly  conducts  quarterly  stocktake  and  the 
<br/>annual stock take of fiscal and biological assets with the Office of the Auditor-General via the 2004 
<br/>Financial Management Act requirements.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  a  way  forward  the  Ministry  has  strengthen  internal  control 
<br/>procedures  and  compliance,  this  will  ensure  that  the  Ministry  avoids  pilferage  and  ensure 
<br/>accountability of public funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  the  Ministry  has  established  a  Compliance  Unit  to  improve  overall  operational 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>efficiency and exercise an audited account of daily operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity and I once 
<br/>again thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture for his contribution to the motion.  I will just 
<br/>concentrate on Recommendation 1.  But let me just again put it into context, I think for agriculture, 
<br/>it is not only challenges but opportunities as well.  When we look at the agriculture sector, in terms 
<br/>of food and nutrition security, we must look after ourselves first and then we have people who are 
<br/>visiting us, our tourism sector.  That is a huge segment on its own and then the potential for exports 
<br/>as well.  So, there is a lot of opportunities but at the same time we need to look after ourselves first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am thankful to the honourable Minister for highlighting all the 
<br/>work  undertaken  despite  the  challenges,  disasters,  et  cetera  because  every  time  when  debate  in 
<br/>Parliament, the good thing now is  you are with  two honourable Deputy  Prime Ministers.   I have 
<br/>always been asking, where is the agriculture revolution that you talked about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You cannot do the change within a very short period of time.  Fix the policy issues, look at 
<br/>the strategies and then build the capacities, it is coming and the honourable Minister of Finance as 
<br/>usual will always say, “Agriculture contribution to GDP keeps going down, despite the figures going 
<br/>up but overall, as a percentage of GDP because other sectors are coming in, that has always been.  
<br/>Everyone here knows that, but it is good coming from you now because probably he can support you 
<br/>better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just focus on the opportunities. I have talked to the honourable Minister for Trade, let 
<br/>us  fix  the  archaic  laws.    We  tried;  the  honourable  Minister  knows  very  well.    In  his  Ministerial 
<br/>assignment, he has got about thirty something laws and there were discussions about bringing it to 
<br/>an  umbrella  law  because  it  is  challenging,  particularly  today  with  globalization,  global  trade,  et 
<br/>cetera.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  quoting  an  example  to  the  honourable  Trade  Minister  during  morning  tea  break.  
<br/>Because of the old archaic laws that we have, we cannot import fruits from China because most of 
<br/>the laws that we have were constructed around Australia, New Zealand, or maybe the Commonwealth 
<br/>systems.  We cannot directly import fruits from China because of the old biosecurity laws that we 
<br/>have; Australia can.  They import and then they re-export to Fiji. There are so many examples, but 
<br/>we  need  to  fix  this  and  I  would  suggest  to  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Trade because that is an opportunity.  Again, while still on archaic laws both for fisheries 
<br/>and  agriculture,  I  talked  about  nutrition.    Same  thing  in  fisheries,  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Fisheries knows this very well.  When it comes to aquaculture feed, right now in Fiji we do not have 
<br/>someone specialist who can do aquaculture feed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have Pacific Feed and Goodman Fielder.  They specialize in livestock feed.  There is a 
<br/></span><span>difference between livestock feed and aquaculture feed.  Aquaculture feed, it must float on water.  
<br/></span><span>The fish and the prawns must come up and if it sinks it must sink in chunks.  Unfortunately, what we 
<br/>have in Fiji now and it affects production. We do not have specialist feed for aquaculture and Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, for that we were looking at importing some corn species, particularly the hybrid.  
<br/>Again, because of the laws, we were told it threatens because we have sugar cane in Fiji, but we have 
<br/>research units in Fiji.  A lot of times, people say no but do not give us options, that needs to be fixed.  
<br/>We had a lengthy discussion with our Minister for Trade.     
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>625 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, we move to land.   We have a lot of idle land in Fiji.  The honourable Minister recalls 
<br/>the exercise that we did with the former Minister for Lands.  We went up to Naitasiri and then we 
<br/>ended up in Nausori.  I think Taiwan has a law, he brought out the idea because he probably went to 
<br/>Taiwan, and probably this is the opportunity.  We have a lot of land in Fiji where the property owner 
<br/>is not present.  Some live in New Zealand, some live elsewhere but the land is prime agricultural 
<br/>land, absentee farmers or absentee owners.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think in some countries we can have some laws where, sort of sub-leasing, where we can 
<br/>use it but we still compensate.  Because of the opportunities, we can make use of that land.  While 
<br/>still  on land, another area that we need to  work  on is  the wetland.   Because of deforestation and 
<br/>climate change, we have a lot of good flat land in Fiji, but we just need some engineering solutions 
<br/>to fix it so that we can use it well; go to Navua or the Rewa Delta.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  started  with  limited  funding  on  flat  land  drainage  a  few  years  back,  (I  do  not  know 
<br/>whether  that  is  continuing)  but  we  can  ask  our  friends  from  the  Netherlands  because  these  are 
<br/>opportunities that we can pursue further.  The honourable Minister for Finance again, we need to 
<br/>invest in the sector.  We have talked about the value chain, supply chain; we just need the dollars, 
<br/>that is investment.  It will bring back the return; you want that return and that is the opportunity.  We 
<br/>need to  diversify the economy,  huge potentials in agriculture, let us all support  the  efforts of the 
<br/>Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  agree  with  the  honourable 
<br/>Members.  I know we have got a very competent Agriculture Minister in our Government and the 
<br/>discussions I have been having with him, I think he is going to provide a good vision that is needed 
<br/>at this point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The percentage contribution of agriculture to GDP maybe small, but it still supports about 27 
<br/>percent of our population.  In other words the livelihood of about  27 percent of Fiji’s population is 
<br/>dependent  on  agriculture.    In  fact,  agriculture  is  the  biggest  employer,  83  percent  of  our  rural 
<br/>population are employed in the agriculture sector.  I know that the previous Government had put in 
<br/>place  agriculture  incentives  particularly  for  commercial  agriculture,  agro  processing,  biofuel 
<br/>production and some of those made sense.  I am sure going forward, we would be looking at that 
<br/>with the Ministry of Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I was in Vanua Levu and the number of issues that were highlighted 
<br/>by the farmers, for example the high cost of fertilisers, barriers to market for subsistence farmers, 
<br/>high transportation cost from farm to market, availability of machinery for land preparation, high 
<br/>cost of galvanised steel fence - a lot of these issues were raised by the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was listening to the contribution from the Opposition, not only on this motion, but on 
<br/>many others from yesterday, sometimes I (I can excuse the new honourable Members) sense their of 
<br/>exuberance and understanding of what the FijiFirst Party did.  I sat in the Opposition for eight years 
<br/>and some of the honourable colleagues from the other side were in Government.  Sometimes I thought 
<br/>of all the good things, the impression that was created that all the good things were created in this 
<br/>country since the FijiFirst Party or the Bainimarama Government came into being. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- That is true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Kumar is saying that is true; that is totally 
<br/>dishonest.  If you look at agriculture, the big projects and what we have today, we talked about the 
<br/>rice industry, this was conceived in the 1970s with the bipartisan support of the Opposition and the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government at that time like the Seaqaqa Sugar Project and many others, all the big hospitals, the 
<br/>Suva-Nadi Highway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the big developments upon which the developments are taking place.  The other day 
<br/>our  honourable  Prime  Minister  said  that  one  government  comes  and  goes,  the  other  government 
<br/>comes and builds on it. That is what we will do, some of the incentives that we provided there, we 
<br/>will reassess that and make sure that if it is working, it is maintained.  We do not want to change 
<br/>things just for the sake of changing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is interesting that the honourable Leader of the Opposition and former Agriculture Minister 
<br/>talked  about  budget.    I  can  give  him  some  figures  and  maybe  he  can  then  reflect  on  what  their 
<br/>government did as part of the budget and I know the other honourable Member from the Opposition 
<br/>who spoke.  Obviously, he is also being taught by someone …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, your Point of Order, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  urge  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister, he is the Deputy Prime Minister now not a member of Opposition to at least have some 
<br/>kind of respect for our newer members.  He has been doing this for the whole week, we respect him 
<br/>as a Deputy Prime Minister.  He needs to respect our newer members as Members of Parliament and 
<br/>stop trying to degrade them with regards to their speech.  They are being called ducks, they are being 
<br/>called parrots.  It is uncalled for to be coming from a Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am actually quite disappointed with 
<br/>the honourable Alvick Maharaj.  He just forgot what the honourable Member said.  The insult that 
<br/>came from him, I endured that kind of insults from him and many others for eight years and I took it 
<br/>as a matter of debate in Parliament.  Instead of telling their young honourable Member that he should 
<br/>stop insulting others, if he wants respect in this Parliament, he is standing up on a useless Point of 
<br/>Order and saying that I am insulting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me come back to what I was saying on the budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition talked about the budget.  If you look at the actual 
<br/>budget  allocation  for  the  last  eight  years,  it  was  $603  million.    The  actual  expenditure  was  $419 
<br/>million  and  if  you  divide  that  by  eight  years  on  average,  it  is  $52  million  and  if  you  compare 
<br/>expenditure in other sectors and on other entities and we have talked about the priority wastage then 
<br/>the answer would be quite evident to the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make, Madam Deputy Speaker, is when we hear the honourable 
<br/>Opposition Members talk about their Reports and some of the problems that exist, they actually forget 
<br/>that not too long ago they were in Government, and they were in Government for a while.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I think there has to be some honesty, Madam Deputy Speaker, from the other side when 
<br/></span><span>they talk about what is happening in each of the areas because we have just been in Government for 
<br/>three months.  Here we are told that these are the problems, this is what we need to do, this is what 
<br/>we need to fix it and we are listening to them because that is an admission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Review Report – MOA 2016-2018 Consolidated Annual Reports</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>627 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a very clear honest admission from them especially in the agriculture sector that they 
<br/>failed. They killed the dairy industry, in this Parliament many times we warned them that what they 
<br/>were doing, they sold…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU- Killed the spider. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They sold Rewa Dairy to a company … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Talk about Brucellosis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …and gave them 10-year concession, zero duty …  . 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Brucellosis 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and said that company will help build the dairy industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That company never had the incentive…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The company t produce milk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He does not understand the duty and all that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SEURIRATU.- No, we understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So they gave duty concession zero. All other importers,  32 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent, so that company imported… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The milk is produced in the market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD- Imported powered milk, butter slabs reconverted them … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-… and sold those at a very high price and their incentive was 
<br/>to  kill  the  dairy  industry.  There  are  many  decisions  that  they  have  made  which  has  led  to  the 
<br/>agriculture sector where it is.  The honourable Minister talked about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government obviously is going to look at all those blunders that 
<br/>were  made  by  the  previous  government.  We  will  do  our  best  with  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture to ensure that we rectify some of those, we set a new direction and make sure that we 
<br/>bring agriculture because in terms of diversifying the economy, there is real potential. You either talk 
<br/>about  climate  resilient  agriculture,  either  you  talk  about  commercial  agriculture,  there  is  a  real 
<br/>potential in diversifying our economy to agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Members for their 
<br/></span><span>contribution  to  the  Report.  The  Standing  Committee  will  take  all  your  contributions  into 
<br/>consideration. Lastly, I would like to thank the previous Chairman, honourable Sanjay Kirpal (even 
<br/>though he is not here) and your team. I thank them for their effort. I encourage the current honourable 
<br/>Committee Members to carry on the good work left by the previous Committee.
