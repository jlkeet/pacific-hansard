<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ministers may speak for 20 minutes and after they have spoken, I will invite the 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statements for no more than five minutes.  
<br/>There will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Finance Economic Management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Members,  I  rise  to  provide  a  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement on economic management.  I am doing this for three reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, I want to make it clear to everyone, just as you do when a business changes hands, that 
<br/>Fiji is under a new management.  This new management is Government.  It is not micro-managing 
<br/>the economy, as was the case previously.  I will talk a little bit about what that means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, I want to update Parliament on the current state of Government finances.  On that 
<br/>front, the news is not good and there are deep challenges ahead.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we knew this, 
<br/>given the rampant wastage, pilferage and mismanagement that was the practice before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third, I want to signal some changes that the Government is looking at now and on which it 
<br/>will take action as soon as possible. We understand that for everyone  - investors, consumers and 
<br/>citizens, a new Government must state its economic direction clearly to give them certainty about 
<br/>what lies ahead.  This is called transparency, accountability, good governance and ethical conduct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so let me turn to the first point - economic management.  The honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister allocated to me the portfolio of finance.  He was very clear about the name of our 
<br/>Ministry.  It was not to be the so-called ‘Ministry of Economy’, it was to be the ‘Ministry of Finance’.  
<br/>This is more than just symbolism.  This is a clear mandate to me on what my job is and what is not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Government must not think that it alone runs the economy.  The economy is run by all the 
<br/>people who contribute to it - the farmers, shopkeepers, employers, investors, landowners and all those 
<br/>who work in it everyday to sustain their families and produce profits for further investment.  It is not 
<br/>the Government’s job to dictate or to tell people how to run every aspect of their economic lives.  We 
<br/>have enough work to do already in tackling the problems we are facing.  Our job is to manage the 
<br/>Government’s finances and set economic policies in a way that serves our economic stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  said  in  Opposition  that  we  would  consult  our  citizens  on  economic 
<br/>policy.  We said we would tell the people what we are thinking and we said we will invite their views 
<br/>and seek out the best ideas.  That process has begun.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  most  people  know,  we  have  appointed  a  14-member  Fiscal  Review  Committee.    That 
<br/>Committee  is  tasked  to  examine  the  overall  setting  of  the  Government’s  fiscal  policy  and  make 
<br/>recommendations on how to re-balance Government revenue and spending, grow the economy and 
<br/>ensure that Government is fiscally sustainable over the next decade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is already hard at work and is tasked to report back in early May.  It has been 
<br/>advertising for submissions from the public and they are requested to be submitted by 5</span><span>th</span><span> April.  This 
<br/>week,  Committee  members  are  out  in  the  community  listening  to  the  public  views.    I  call  upon 
<br/>everyone who wishes to make presentation to, please, do so before the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want input and advice from the Fiscal Review Committee to help us set 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>563 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our economic policy and management over the next 10 years.  We need to think in terms of broader 
<br/>horizons so that we can plan better and invest better, that is its job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will hold the National Economic Summit in the third week of April, our first in more than 
<br/>a decade.  The previous Government did not hold one when in power.  They chose instead to rule 
<br/>through fear.  They believe that their cabal or businessmen or cronies knew best.  People were afraid 
<br/>to express critical views, even on economic policy and I know that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That climate and that mentality is now well and truly over.   This  Government  wants  to  hear 
<br/>opposing  views.    We  want  to  hear  criticism  and  we  want  to  encourage  economic  debate.    We 
<br/>understand that the Government does not always have all the answers.  We want to bring out people’s 
<br/>best ideas, make policy and set national directions together.  This is what we want to develop in our 
<br/>first year in office, through national dialogue and discussions.  There is a role too for our friends in 
<br/>the Parliamentary Opposition, they are the alternative government (I am not sure if they are).  They 
<br/>too must help and share the development of our national vision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me turn to the second part - the state of Government finances.  In this, I 
<br/>am  not  talking  about  the  economy  and  economic  growth.    In  fact,  this  is  reasonably  good  at  the 
<br/>moment, as we bounce back from COVID-19, aided by strong tourism returns and strong growth in 
<br/>remittances, and I am talking about how the Government earns and spends its money.  That is more 
<br/>critical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Government has been in office for three months.  In that time, I can tell you that I 
<br/>have been trying to get an overview of Government’s financial position, while trying to manage the 
<br/>daily  demands  of  economic  management.    Much  of  my  time  is  spent  on  troubleshooting  and 
<br/>firefighting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are urgent demands for spending, particularly in the health sector.  We are now paying 
<br/>the price for poor planning, unsound investment and lack of maintenance.  Human lives depend on 
<br/>health spendings so we cannot compromise, and we will not compromise.  But so much of what we 
<br/>are spending, our money only seems to be reactive ‘hand to mouth’ economic management.  Better 
<br/>planning would have saved millions, and this is what we must do now.  This is one legacy of the 
<br/>former Government that we have to grapple with and with the current budgetary provisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us begin with Government debt.  The only good news on this subject is 
<br/>that it is now opened up for public discussion.  In our more open and freer environment, there is 
<br/>greater debate, and I hope that as a result of that, there is greater understanding of our issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As Minister of Finance, I remain deeply concerned about the state of Government debt.  This 
<br/>currently stands at 85 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  This is well above the safe 
<br/>level of between 40 percent to 50 percent and the Coalition Government, Mr. Speaker, is not the only 
<br/>one worried about it.  There are many people out there - many investors, global institutions such as 
<br/>the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that are also urging the Government to 
<br/>deal with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were in this unfavourable position, Mr. Speaker, because in the last decade, and this is a 
<br/></span><span>fact, Government finances were managed poorly.  People-pleasing choices were made, like cuts to 
<br/>Income Tax and VAT without consideration and implementation of measures to mitigate the effect 
<br/>of these reductions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We forget now, but at one time, VAT was 15 percent and Company Tax was at 28 percent.  
<br/>People started paying tax after $16,000 in annual income, and not $30,000 like it is now.  This has 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>caused income disparities, a basic salary earner above the threshold paid the same tax rate as those 
<br/>raking in huge salaries at corporate profits… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …and  has  not  done  anything  to  put  more  income  into  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pockets of the majority of the salary earners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But if you want to cut taxation, Mr. Speaker, that means you must also cut spending and the 
<br/>Government did not do that.  The former Government and its leaders completely ignored prudent 
<br/>financial management and spending.  Borrow and spend was their only solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us all face some facts.  Nothing, Mr. Speaker, that Government provides us is free. In 
<br/>economics, we say there is no such thing as free lunch.  So, if we are going to give money back to 
<br/>people by cutting taxes in the end, it is Government services which will suffer.  In a phrase we used 
<br/>to hear very often, Sir, that is the reality of the matter.  How have we come to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government made many poor public investment choices, and they know that.  
<br/>The Government built costly rural hospitals, remote roads and multi-million-dollar police stations, 
<br/>seemingly, without any cost benefit analysis, but the former Government barely had enough money 
<br/>to  equip  and  maintain  them.    We  spent  ridiculous  amounts  of  money  on  Fijian  Broadcasting 
<br/>Corporation (FBC) and </span><span>Walesi.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FBC got $19 million over 10 years in lease cost and </span><span>Walesi </span><span>got over $60 
<br/>million.  We spent millions in the last 10 years in lease cost for new Government vehicles.  In the 
<br/>last 10 years, we added 8,000 more public servants to the Government payroll, rising cost and salary 
<br/>bills but no sound and sensible solutions to increase income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government offered the most generous cash incentives in the world to 
<br/>international film producers.  This  was not just tax  reduction; we actually wrote them cheques to 
<br/>come here.  We paid them over $200 million so far in the last 10 years and we must now find another 
<br/>$200  million  to  pay  the rest.    And  I  will  say  that,  again,  Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  still  another  $200 
<br/>million to pay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I should add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this sum is not in the Government debt figures.  This is 
<br/>on  top  of  the  money  that  the  Government  already  owes.    If  this  is  not  wastage,  pilferage, 
<br/>mismanagement  of  funds,  then  what  is,  Mr.  Speaker?    So,  as  Government  that  grew  larger,  the 
<br/>previous Government ignored all the warnings.  They were warned that we were not ready for an 
<br/>economic shock.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a sentence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we spent like there was no tomorrow. And then tomorrow 
<br/>arrived in the form of COVID-19.  The Government’s response to this crisis lacked imagination, but 
<br/>our debt ballooned to more than 90 percent of GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  economic  recovery,  that  number  has  fallen  back  to  85  percent.    However,  from  this 
<br/>point, it will be a serious challenge to reduce it, but reduce we must because we cannot bequeath a 
<br/>dead burden nation to our future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we received generous support from many international 
<br/>donors and lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  Governments, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>565 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like Australia and New Zealand, wrote us large cheques for hundreds of millions of dollars to help 
<br/>us pay the bills.  Japan lent us $200 million at almost zero interest rate for the next 40 years.  All 
<br/>those Leaders and Governments recognise that simple humanity demanded that we give help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many  of  the  poor  families  in  this  country,  Mr.  Speaker,  continued  to  be  helped  by  their 
<br/>families and friends overseas.  I know, Sir, many of them even today, collect their groceries paid for 
<br/>by their families and friends.  But now, the pandemic is over, and we must, once again, stand on our 
<br/>own two feet, and this is where our past will come back to haunt us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the new post-COVID-19 world, we cannot expect to simply borrow money at will.  Our 
<br/>current debt position will come under scrutiny.  Almost one in every $5 of revenue that Government 
<br/>collects, is now paid as interest to our lenders.  About 70 percent of this debt is local so, at least, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, this interest is returned to the local economy, but the Government still has to find money to 
<br/>write the cheques.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Offshore debt, Mr. Speaker, presents different challenges.  This is all in foreign currency, so 
<br/>if Fiji’s currency falls again, currencies like the US dollar (our debt), automatically goes up and so 
<br/>do our interest payments.  A lot of our debt is on variable interest rates.  It is clear that the pressure 
<br/>is  on  interest  rates  to  rise  and,  once  again,  we  will  have  to  find  more  money  from  Government 
<br/>finances to meet rising interest cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is another line of debate out there, emerging on our debt, and this line 
<br/>was stated before as well.  This line is, “Stop worrying, although the debt is high.  It does not cost 
<br/>too much if the Government can meet the interest payments.”  Yes, Mr. Speaker, at the moment the 
<br/>Government can do that.  The Government is not going to default on its debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I always believe that optimism is always good and we too are optimists.  I 
<br/>am an optimist, but we also recognise hard facts.  The optimistic scenario assumes ‘business as usual’ 
<br/>and the Government cannot continue with business as usual, so let me talk about why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last 10 years, we have been living in a debt-driven economic fantasy.  
<br/>We have been pretending that we can just carry on as usual and everything will be alright - this is not 
<br/>true.    For  the  last  10  years,  we  have  neglected  basic  infrastructure,  the  basic  physical  fabric  that 
<br/>underpins the way many of us and work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all assume everyday that there will be water in our taps, that our roads 
<br/>and bridges will work, that our natural environment will remain unspoiled,  that our hospitals will 
<br/>look after us when get our sick and that our children will get a decent education.  Every one of these 
<br/>assumptions is now at risk, and that is why I emphasise that we cannot just continue with business as 
<br/>usual.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thousands of our citizens know at first-hand our problems with water.  They suffer everyday 
<br/>from water cuts that affect not just our family lives, but economic productivity.  We have just heard 
<br/>from Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) that about half of the water that it carefully treats and prepares 
<br/>for us leaks through old pipes and into the ground.  It never reaches our taps.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the next five years, Mr. Speaker, we need to spend $800 million on our water systems to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>keep them going.  So, again, where did the money go in the past?  How was it spent?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  none,  I  repeat,  none  of  WAF’s  38  sewerage  treatment  plants  are  up  to  the 
<br/>required standards for the safe discharge of wastewater. That means, threat to the environment and 
<br/>the  health  of  people  would  depend  on  rivers  and  streams  close  to  populated  areas.  This  is  quite 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>alarming.  Why were we kept in the dark?  The cost to bring these up to standard will be around $200 
<br/>million.  But reaching our Sustainable Development Goals to public sanitation will cost billions more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, hundreds of our bridges will need replacement in the next decade. More than 
<br/>10 of these bridges are already at the point of critical failure.  This means at any day, at any time, we 
<br/>may need to close them because they will become unsafe.  This will create huge inconvenience to 
<br/>our people.  It will drive up costs of transportation and it is us, as consumers, who will bear those 
<br/>costs.  I am told that the cost of bridges alone in the next 10 years will exceed $2 billion.  Forget 
<br/>about the roads, Mr. Speaker, this is a different Budget.  I am talking $2 billion just for bridges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Lautoka Rubbish Dump is a serious threat to the environment.  Our intention 
<br/>is to ask the private sector to create a proper waste disposal facility in Lautoka, as has been done in 
<br/>Naboro. But of course, Local Government will have to pay the private provider for the services it 
<br/>provides. These costs could be upwards of $20 million per year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all know that health facilities and services are not up to standard, and we 
<br/>also  know  that  this  is  costing  us  lives  on  a  daily  basis.  Everyone  knows  that  the  Colonial  War 
<br/>Memorial Hospital (CWMH) is no longer fit for purpose in many ways.  It is in a state of decay.  It 
<br/>needs to be completely renewed; an investment that will properly exceed $500 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Lautoka Hospital and Ba Hospital public-private partnership between FNPF and Aspen 
<br/>Medical  will  also  involve  a  cost  of  about  $300  million.    The  project  is  currently  suffering  some 
<br/>serious delays.  But even if a PPP rebuilds a hospitals, Mr. Speaker, it must earn an economic return 
<br/>and that means Government must pay. This will be up to $30 million in new spending every year.  
<br/>And do not forget that all other services - the health centres, the drugs we now supply, et cetera, are 
<br/>not included in that.  We will have to continue paying for those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is now too late to avoid some critical failures.  Even if we have the money 
<br/>now and we are ready go, all these new infrastructure takes time to design and build. It cannot be 
<br/>done overnight, it cannot be done in 100 days, and it cannot be done in just four years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It will take many years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were in Government for 16 years, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Exactly! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Of course, now that we are burdened by serious Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debt, we do not have the money to spend, so somehow, Mr. Speaker, we have to find it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  while the  Government  is  fighting just to  protect  our basic infrastructure and 
<br/>environment, we also have to think about the human capital. We have yet to begin a serious dialogue 
<br/>about the investment we need in education.  We know that education is transformative.  We know 
<br/>that education is the quickest way to building a better and more prosperous society, but where do we

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>find  the  money  to  properly  pay  teachers,  build  schools  and  science  labs  and  all  the  spending  to 
<br/>achieve these outcomes?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What about better housing?  How are we to invest in the lives of our poorest people to lift 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them out of poverty?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What about reinventing the wheel to rejuvenate the agriculture sector, the dairy industry and 
<br/>the sugar industry?  Agriculture should be the bedrock of any solid economic foundation.  But these 
<br/>sectors have been ignored.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, let me come to the unforeseen risks we face.  We know that we are always 
<br/>at risk of economic shocks - a serious cyclone, even an earthquake or a tsunami.  These can cost us 
<br/>hundreds of millions of dollars, as </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> did.  We are fortunate over this cyclone season, so far 
<br/>we have avoided any serious weather events, but that may not be true next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  can  expect  the  world  to  get  us  some  help  from  our  usual 
<br/>neighbours and partners, who are always generous.  But that help, Sir, will not be enough.  We have 
<br/>to be able to borrow to rebuild in a short space of time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Damage caused by disaster is not just a human problem.  It is an economic problem, and it 
<br/>threatens economic growth and prosperity.  If lenders are now going to say, “Fiji has too much debt”, 
<br/>there are two risks - either they will not lend at all or they will say, “this is risky lending”, so they 
<br/>will raise the interest rate.  Despite all these, Mr. Speaker, we have to carry on with the ordinary day 
<br/>to day services of Government, the services that businesses and citizens depend on everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I say, again, we cannot continue with business as usual.  We cannot pretend that 
<br/>things can go on as before. The very basics services on which we all depend are now at risk.  We 
<br/>cannot afford to wait, we must act now, we must find the money now, and we must invest the money 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is economically imperative that people live their lives well. We have to give confidence to 
<br/>our entrepreneurs and employers that the infrastructure will be there to support their investments.  
<br/>And, Mr. Speaker, we can do this because we have to do this, but there are costs.  It needs sacrifices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, all these information should have been out in public years ago.  We need people 
<br/>to know and understand the challenges.  We need everyone thinking about them and working together 
<br/>to help us deal with them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what the last Government did not do. It hid these problems from the people.  It said, 
<br/>“Everything is great, we are doing so well, and you have more and better things than ever before.”  
<br/>But that was just not true.  How can you talk about all the new and improved things you are building 
<br/>and promoting when you are not telling us about the challenges just to maintain the things that we 
<br/>already have, even as the deteriorate around us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  must  end,  Mr.  Speaker.    The  people  must  know,  and  we  want  the  people  to  join  us 
<br/></span><span>collectively in overcoming these challenges.  So, Mr. Speaker, our personal commitment is based on 
<br/></span><span>inclusiveness, as stated by the honourable Prime Minister.  We want people to have the time to think 
<br/>about what we are proposing, to talk to us about it and, yes, to criticise it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget measures should not be prepared in secrecy. We can see the difficult choices ahead, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and these choices will not be popular, but we want people to be able to prepare and plan ahead.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Fiscal Review Committee is working, and we will wait for the final report, 
<br/>but  we  are  already  proceeding  to  implement  some  measures  that  require  policy  change.  In  this 
<br/>respect, the implementation of Stage 3 of the VAT Monitoring System (VMS) is suspended until 
<br/>further notice.  We are actively investigating the need for the VMS as a whole.  Businesses caught in 
<br/>the VMS have to spend time and money, including buying physical equipment to meet the system 
<br/>requirements, which is for Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS) to capture huge amounts of data.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  FRCS  does  not  have  the  personnel  or  other  resources  to  analyse  the  data 
<br/>anyway.  We also want  to hear from Stage 1 and Stage 2 VMS users about their experience, and 
<br/>carefully consider the usefulness of VMS at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the rollout of VMS Stage 3 was going to add thousands, in some cases, tens of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thousands of dollars in costs for a wide range of local businesses.  We are halting this right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are aware that the new tax online filing system, TPOS, has some critical 
<br/>teething  problems  and  these  are  causing  a  lot  of  frustration.  Online  filing  is  supposed  to  help 
<br/>taxpayers, not burden them, and it is part of my job to make sure that these problems are eliminated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am taking a personal interest, Mr. Speaker, in ensuring that these are resolved.  The FRCS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has created a working group to help solve this problem and identify improvements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I  am  conscious  of  time and that this  Parliament has  other business  to  attend 
<br/>today,  however,  I  believe  it  is  important  for  the  new  Government  to  begin  to  open  the  books  on 
<br/>Government finances for all Fiji citizens to see.  Only when everyone has all the information can we 
<br/>understand the urgency of our situation and work together on solutions.  And we will continue to do 
<br/>this - we will continue to put information into the public space, as our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>does  after  every  Cabinet  meeting,  so  that  people  have  the  fullest  possible  picture  of  the  deep 
<br/>challenges ahead of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to bring people together, Mr. Speaker, to develop the solutions.  Government cannot 
<br/>do this alone.  We have faith that our people in working together, can overcome these challenges, get 
<br/>our economic path back on course and help to rebuild the society which all of us aspire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, on this occasion of </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span> which commemorates the 
<br/>birth  of  Lord  Ram,  who  is  revered  as  the  personification  of  righteous  and  goodness.  Lord  Ram 
<br/>conquered demon King Raman, hence the event is marked as a triumph of good over evil. I want to 
<br/>wish everyone a happy </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span> and a joyous day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea and when we resume, I shall be 
<br/>offering the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to give their response 
<br/>to the statement that has been delivered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Parliament is adjourned.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.14 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to respond to the 
<br/>Ministerial  Statement,  or  what  sounded  more  like  a  litany  of  woes  to  my  ears.    The  honourable 
<br/>Minister has  realised we decided to  be in  the hot seat  as the seat  is  always hot.   You never have 
<br/>everything that you want, and you have to learn how to prioritise and do things that need to be done.  
<br/>That is always something that needs to be done.  Please, do not give up in the first 100 days in office 
<br/>with all the promises that you have made.  Do not give up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Stand firm and be strong and do your job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  philosophy  of  consultative  decision-making  lies  at  the  heart  of  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, where it has always been.  The Bainimarama Government was built on consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Really? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It was built on the Charter and the National Council for Building a 
<br/>Better  Fiji  (NCBBF)  that  got  everyone  in  this  country  to  look  at  what  were  the  causes  of  our 
<br/>problems.  And on the basis of all of those discussions, that has been at the heart of everything that 
<br/>has  been  happening  –  from  the  People’s  Charter,  the  NCBBF,  the  Roadmap  for  Democracy  and 
<br/>Sustainable Socio-Economic Development (RDSSED) and all the work that have been undertaken.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Over the years, that came out to be expressed in the Constitution that 
<br/>we have - massive consultations all around the country, has always have been based on this.  What 
<br/>you find out of this is found in this one and it has been the basis of everything this Government has 
<br/>been doing - based on consultation, based on discussions at all times.  You have tried to create this 
<br/>picture that there have been no consultations, but that is all hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me introduce that word to you - hogs are pigs and wash is the water that you use to wash 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the pigs.  All hogwash! Absolute hogwash!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Very good! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at what we have been doing, we do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>go and make a big song and dance about the consultations.  (Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Budget consultations were done and everyone is invited.  People can 
<br/>report  in  online.    Town  hall  meetings  were  held.    The  former  Prime  Minister  is  very  famous  for 
<br/></span><span>talanoa</span><span>  sessions.    We  gathered  the  information  and  all  those  information  was  then  fed  into  the 
<br/>policies, the budgets, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not go and make a big song and dance about it.  Our phone numbers were given to the

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people, and they call us at any time.  Have you given your phone numbers to people?  Have you done 
<br/>that?  Make sure you do that.  Open yourselves up.  Do what needs to be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member has always said, “This side of Parliament, we did 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not have ideas.”  You came up with your 100 day plan.  Has it been achieved?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- While you are sitting here, making little committees like this, people 
<br/>are asking, where are the things you promised us?  Where are the things you campaigned for?  People 
<br/>are asking for it to be done.  Where is it?  Why are you making these committees here and committee 
<br/>there?  Things need to move, roads need to be fixed, people need to drink, and prices of goods need 
<br/>to be brought down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes, yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You need to fix these things.  All you do is just complain, complain 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and complain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir, complained about infrastructure.  Where has he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gone?  He is gone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The person who started the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) is not here, but we established that 
<br/>institute to address the dilapidated state of infrastructure that was in this country.  That is why we 
<br/>established the FRA.  And as part of that initial assessment, they found more than 160 bridges needed 
<br/>to be fixed and we had a phase-plan to implement it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had a phase plan.  Your job is to take that plan and complete the rest.  Do not complain 
<br/>about it.   When we came in, we saw the problem, we did not say, “Oh, please, take this away from 
<br/>me.”  We hit the problem head on, and we addressed it.  So, stop! Stop all these complaining!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is a Government that invested so much in infrastructure, water, 
<br/>hospitals and now, he has the audacity to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we should not be building good 
<br/>rural hospitals.  People of Navosa, did you hear that?  That is what he said.  No rural hospitals.  He 
<br/>said,  “no  rural  roads”.    People  of  Nakida,  Naitasiri,  did  you  hear  that?    People  of  the  </span><span>Tikina</span><span>  of 
<br/>Noimalu, did you hear that?  That is what this Government is talking about.  This is the Government 
<br/>that has consulted and has built the infrastructure in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- When we were in Government, and we will be the next Government, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, all of these, please, honourable Minister, get the job done.  People are asking 
<br/>- get the job done.  Stop all these talks first under the mango tree or wherever, get the job done!  That 
<br/></span><span>is what you are there to do! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific Regional Education Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise according to the Standing Order 40, to 
<br/>give my Ministerial Statement today.  Before I begin my Statement, I would like to take this time to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>571 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wish all our Hindu brothers and sisters teaching around the country a happy </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span>.  May Lord 
<br/>Rama bless you with all the peace, prosperity and happiness on this auspicious day of </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  today  to  briefly  share  with  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament Fiji’s engagement with the regional education initiative, the Pacific Regional Education 
<br/>Framework  (PacREF).    The  Pacific  Regional  Framework  is  a  project  developed  to  support  and 
<br/>address persistent problems to improve the education system in the Pacific Region, particularly for 
<br/>the 15 participating Pacific Island Countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the PacREF Programme is a regional policy document that was endorsed at 
<br/>the 2018 Forum Ministers Meeting in the Republic of Nauru.  Since then, its Phase 1 Implementation 
<br/>Rolling Plan was developed covering the period 2020 to 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support the Forum Leaders’ Pacific Vision, the PacREF Programme prioritises each action 
<br/>on  quality  and  relevance,  free  learning  pathways,  and  the  teaching  profession  that  will  maximise 
<br/>sustainable gains in students’ learning outcomes and wellbeing.  These priority areas were set in 2016 
<br/>by education leaders in the Pacific and continue to be relevant to this day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An independent mid-term review of the Programme was undertaken in  2022 and found in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>general, the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Consistent feedback from stakeholders was very positive about PacREF’s progress, despite 
<br/>the  setbacks  caused  by  COVID-19  impacts  on  Pacific  education  systems,  and  there  is 
<br/>optimism that future gains would be made.  They also acknowledged that there are still many 
<br/>challenges  to  face,  but  stakeholders  believe  that  the  Programme  has  already  made 
<br/>recognisable achievements and is performing perhaps, better than expected.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Fiji, our education priorities align well with those of the PacREF Programme, which are:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improving quality and relevance of our education system; 
<br/>expanding learning pathways to enable all students realise their full potential within the 
<br/>education system;  
<br/>improving student outcomes and well-being; and 
<br/>development of the teaching profession.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PacREF seeks to promote fully inclusive learning opportunities and in this 
<br/></span><span>respect, the concept of inclusive refers to the inclusion of all learners commonly known as students 
<br/></span><span>at all levels of the learning cycle from early childhood to the secondary levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be inclusive is to ensure the curriculum is inclusive.  Teaching pedagogies of teachers, the 
<br/>assessment system and infrastructure must also be inclusive.  It means, inclusive education does not 
<br/>only refer to students with special needs or students with disabilities, rather, to all students, as some 
<br/>may be slow learners or facing language barriers which impact on their ability to learn in school.  All 
<br/>these considerations must be taken into account as we review our whole education system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the theme of the inaugural Conference of Pacific Education Ministers was 
<br/></span><span>“Empowering Education for Pacific People”, which I attended with Ministry staff held in Auckland 
<br/>from 20</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 to 22nd March, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some major issues that were identified and agreed to by the Ministers at the Conference were 
<br/>indigenous knowledge, culture and language.  The Ministers had agreed that indigenous knowledge, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>culture and language should be embedded in curriculum development in teacher training programmes 
<br/>and delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On teacher quality, the Ministers committed to increasing support to programmes that ensure 
<br/>quality  of teachers in  the region and providing the opportunity  for sharing best  practices through 
<br/>exchange programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  climate  change  and  resilience,  Ministers  agreed  to  strengthen  climate  literacy  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On gender responsive education policies, Ministers agreed to promote and empower women 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in leadership roles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Early Childhood Education, it was agreed to the centrality of early childhood learning and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Data  Integrity and Sovereignty,  Ministers  also endorsed the need and accessibility for 
<br/>quality data to support regional and national initiatives. It was also expressed the need to promote 
<br/>cyber  safety  and  ensure  cyber  security  measures  are  in  place.    A  sub-committee  chaired  by  the 
<br/>University  of  the  South  Pacific  will  further  investigate  and  report  at  the  next  Pacific  Heads  of 
<br/>Education Systems (PHES) meeting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On effectiveness,  Ministers committed to  the PacREF process  and will continue to  secure 
<br/>future  funding  for  such  an  important  regional  initiative  and  ensure  that  resources  are  directed 
<br/>accordingly with the view to maximise returns and producing student-centred results.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Student Inclusiveness, Ministers committed to ensuring that education is available to all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>learners irrespective of their challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  labour  mobility,  Ministers  continue  to  recognise  the  importance  of  labour  mobility 
<br/>schemes, noting that brain-drain has exacerbated, resulting in the need to strengthen local training 
<br/>providers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  National  Education  Financing,  the  Ministers  recognised  the  importance  of  securing 
<br/>adequate funding from their national budget processes and sought clarity on appropriate thresholds 
<br/>for their national context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Technical Vocational Training which includes sports development, the Ministers agreed 
<br/>to the importance of developing skills and student pathways to create opportunities that meet learner 
<br/>aspirations and abilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  2050  Strategy  for  the  Blue  Pacific  Continent,  the  Ministers  endorsed  the  linkages 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between education and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Education  Ministers  of  the  Pacific  reaffirmed  their 
<br/></span><span>commitment to PacREF and implore development partners and implementing agencies to provide 
<br/></span><span>support in progressing this critical agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above commitments set the basis for the development of a Phase 2 of 
<br/>the  PacREF  programme  to  come  into  effect  from  2025.    Fiji  will  be  considering  the  above 
<br/>commitments  and  work  in  collaboration  with  relevant  Implementing  Agencies  of  the  PacREF 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>573 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme  and  the  PacREF  Facilitating  Unit  to  integrate  the  above  commitments  into  our 
<br/>educational system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an important message that continued to resonate throughout the Conference 
<br/>was  the  maintenance  and  preservation  of  indigenous  languages,  cultures  and  traditions  of  Pacific 
<br/>people.  In such time that we now live in, we can easily be immersed in new ways of life brought 
<br/>about  by  globalisation  and  mew  technologies  that  can  take  us  away  from  our  identity  and  what 
<br/>characterises us as people of the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Traditional  knowledge  systems  play  an  important  role  in  fostering  learning  and  skills 
<br/>development  for  transformation  and  progress  of  a  child.  Therefore,  our  curriculum  and  school 
<br/>programmes must reflect our values, cultures, traditional knowledge and skills at the very foundation 
<br/>level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, one can argue that we are doing alright in this regard because the primary level of Fiji’s 
<br/>education system emphasises the teaching and learning of mother tongue, such as </span><span>Vosa Vaka-Viti</span><span>, 
<br/>Hindi, Urdu and Rotuman languages. However, the Ministry will see to it being strengthened and we 
<br/>need to ensure that our school curriculum integrate elements of vernacular languages so that students 
<br/>are able to speak and communicate in these languages which characterises our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we noted with satisfaction that access to education at all levels is satisfactory 
<br/>as shown by the enrolment rates in the Report. However, the area of concern is on the quality of 
<br/>learning as measured through assessment tools such as the Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy 
<br/>Assessment (PILNA).  We, therefore, need to introduce reforms into the curriculum and teaching 
<br/>pedagogies that will bring about changes in the learning outcomes of our students.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We may need to consider the available resources, their quality and relevance to support the 
<br/>teaching and learning process. We have learned through the PacREF activities that there are activities 
<br/>where Fiji can participate in that support curriculum reforms to improve their quality and relevance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Conference also highlighted the need to have data available to Ministries of Education 
<br/>in the Pacific to support planning and decision-making processes. Policy development and decision-
<br/>making must be evidence-based and this can only be possible through the availability of data within 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Education.  I  echo  the  sentiments  of  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister of Finance on the Government’s intention to review the Statistics Act to allow the collection 
<br/>of ethnic data which should support the management of students, students learning and community 
<br/>involvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has a data collection system which is usually and 
<br/>commonly  known  as  FEMIS  which  manages  the  students  and  teachers’  information.    One  of  the 
<br/>things that the workshop emphasised is a holistic collection of data which reflected against the Fiji 
<br/>FEMIS System, leaves a lot to be improved upon.  For instance, the FEMIS system collects data on 
<br/>teachers but fails to capture their marital status and spouse information. This has often resulted in 
<br/>different schools posting for husband and wives who are both teachers.  The FEMIS system will need 
<br/>to  be  adjusted  to  allow  for  better  collation  of  information.    Similarly,  any  other  forms  of  data 
<br/></span><span>collection which includes teacher reporting systems and examination statistics and records will need 
<br/></span><span>review to ensure it is user friendly and it is also robust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would say that Fiji has a lot to offer to our Pacific Island neighbours and 
<br/>also  to  learn from  their  experiences.  The PacREF programme provides the opportunity  for us to 
<br/>share  our  experiences  and  develop  partnerships  with  our  island  neighbours  in  alignment  with  the 
<br/>underpinning PacREF principles of regionalism.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The planned Education Commission and Summit will certainly take into consideration the 
<br/>commitments  made  and  how  best  we  can  align  to  those  commitments.  Ministers  during  the 
<br/>Conference  agreed that  our national  contexts are different  and that  there  is  no one size fits  all to 
<br/>solving our challenges. However, our challenges are similar and there is a great benefit in our working 
<br/>together as a region in determining and developing common strategies to resolving our challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>Statement  this  morning.  He  captured  a  lot  of  issues  in  relation  to  the  education  sector,  but  he 
<br/>specifically  talked  about  how  PacREF  or  the  Ministers  of  the  region  can  help  improve  Pacific 
<br/>education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to start off by saying that the Pacific Education Ministers actually provide the 
<br/>oversight to the whole of PacREF programme from setting its policies and priorities. But let us talk 
<br/>about PacREF - how was it established? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was established at a time when few Pacific Island Countries came together and they applied 
<br/>for funding through Global Partnership for Education (GPE) and when that funding came across, 
<br/>then the question was, how will the programmes be managed?  So, that led to the establishment of 
<br/>PacREF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  that  time,  Fiji  was  not  a  member  of  GPE,  so  we  were  not  part  of  the  Steering 
<br/>Committee, we were not having any say in the way PacREF was run. But what we did, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in early 2022 and I think it was in the month of June when we became a member GPE, we were 
<br/>given a funding of FJ$1.2 million to develop our education sector plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  education  sector  plan  was  an  area  that  we  were  working  towards  on  how  it  can  be 
<br/>developed, and there were three steps to it.  The first step was data collection.  You collect all the 
<br/>data on education sector. Data collection is, again, very important if you are having a consultation 
<br/>because you do not want to have a big forum where you get everyone in the house and they just talk 
<br/>about everything, not knowing what the achievements are.  Where are we?  So, data collection was 
<br/>very important, and data was collected by UNICEF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  data  collection  is  the  consultation,  what  you  call  Education  Commission.  Education 
<br/>commission is a subset of education sector plan that we developed.  So, you have the data collection 
<br/>then you have this big discussion of which direction you want to take using the data, after that is the 
<br/>development of the education sector plan. So, these were the three steps involved, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I am quite surprised that the honourable Minister did not mention about the Joint 
<br/>Oversight  Mission  Report  that  came  out  in  2022.    That  Report  clearly  stated  that  PacREF  is  not 
<br/>actually providing value for money.  There are a lot of areas where PacREF needs to improve and 
<br/>some  of  the  areas  that  was  highlighted  in  the  Report  says  there  appears  to  be  a  confusion  at  the 
<br/>country  level  about  how  PacREF  and  their  external  funded  programmes  can  and  should  align  to 
<br/>support national plans and objectives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  clearly  recalled  that  I  had  called  the  PacREF  Team  into  my  office  to  understand  what 
<br/></span><span>PacREF was all about, and, in fact, that is what the Report is clearly stating. The Report is saying 
<br/></span><span>that in a number of countries, the Ministry of Education staff were not even aware of PacREF and 
<br/>what it was doing. So PacREF was operating on its own, with very limited linkages  to education 
<br/>ministries and that is what the Report has picked up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, then there was non-alignment of programmes. For example, for Fiji’s case, 
<br/>PacREF was looking at ECE subsector, whereas Fiji went ahead with UNICEF to transform our ECE 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>575 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subsector from curriculum to policies to standard. So, a lot of work went in that area.  The Report 
<br/>also highlighted that there were too many staff who were given too many responsibilities, including 
<br/>PacREF responsibility.  So, what happens, a lot of time was taken away by the staff in achieving the 
<br/>real intent of why this Programme was setup. There were some of these drawbacks, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  there  was  duplication  of  resources  in  the  Pacific  and  worldwide 
<br/>resources are limited.  When you have too many organisations involved in programmes and trying to 
<br/>help a Ministry, a lot of money is wasted in the Secretariat level rather than getting some tangible 
<br/>results and that was a problem with the PacREF programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said all that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to also mention that FEMIS was setup by 
<br/>the  FijFirst Government.  It was never there before and the purpose of FEMIS is to collect real time 
<br/>data. Of course, the honourable Minister can go and tweak that infrastructure that is already there to 
<br/>find out or to analyse the type of data he wants to collect or that he needs.  So, there is provision for 
<br/>all that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us not forget, the students who were seated here need to be consulted in 
<br/>terms of how the education should be provided.  In the Education Sector Plan, there were three areas 
<br/>that we had already included: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Teacher welfare; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>TVET Programme; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>E-learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  these  were  the  three  clear  areas  the  Ministry  would  have  been  working  with  GPE  to 
<br/>develop these three areas.  When we put in our proposal, we had a wide consultation with the students 
<br/>and the teachers before we developed our programme, and we submitted it to GPE for their funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Current Status of Green Ginger Market in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a statement on the current status 
<br/>of the Green Ginger Market in Fiji, but before doing so, I would like to wish all my Hindu  honourable 
<br/>colleagues  a  happy  </span><span>Ram  Navami</span><span>.    I  know  that  there  are  many  of  my  Hindu  friends  who  will  be 
<br/>watching me on television, happy </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span> also to all of you - there are so many to name. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me first to inform this august Parliament on the significance 
<br/>of  ginger  to  the  agriculture  sector  and  to  the  Fijian  economy.    Ginger  is  among  the  top  five  key 
<br/>agricultural commodities for export after </span><span>yaqona, dalo</span><span> and turmeric.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2020  Fiji  Agriculture  Census  registered  661  ginger  farmers,  however,  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>latest quarterly report recorded a total of more than 2,500 ginger farmers, of which over 70 percent 
<br/>are located in the Central Division.  The total export earnings from ginger was valued at $6.37 million 
<br/>from the sale of more than 1,288 metric tonnes of ginger in 2021.  Export market destinations include 
<br/>Australia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Germany and the United States of America. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are only two major exporters in the ginger industry that are buying 
<br/></span><span>green immature ginger at $1.60 per kilogramme which is equivalent to $1,600 per metric tonne.  They 
<br/>are  Kaiming  Agro  and  Freshpac  Ginger.  The  two  Companies  each  have  a  quota  of  1,500  metric 
<br/>tonnes per year and their priority, of course, is always to their contracted farmers. The two exporters 
<br/>have so far this year met their quota.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,000 acres which translates to 10,000 tonnes of ginger 
<br/>are still on the ground.  This can be harvested as  immature or matured, depending on the market 
<br/>opportunities presented.  However, the Ministry has received a number of complaints in relation to  
<br/>the closure of the Green Ginger Market, despite so much ginger still on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I,  and  Ministry  Officials  have  met  with  the  two  buyers  to  ascertain  the 
<br/>concerns raised and to discuss options that may be available to help out with those farmers who are 
<br/>concerned.    The  discussions  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  multisectoral  collaboration  at  all 
<br/>levels, understanding the market conditions and honouring the signed contractual agreements.  At 
<br/>this juncture, I, first of all, would like to thank all players within the value chain for their respective 
<br/>roles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform Parliament of a loan scheme that was initiated by the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government in 2022.  This involved the signing of secured loans with the Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank to the tune of as much as $30,000 to $40,000 per farmer.  As part of the scheme, the farmers 
<br/>sign contracts with the major buyers for the supply of green ginger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, farmers have over-produced their allocated quota that have been given to them 
<br/>by the two major ginger buyers.  A problem that was further exacerbated by the stakeholders that 
<br/>rode  on  the  hype  of  that  loan  scheme  bandwagon  by  directly  supplying  ginger  seeds  to  farmers 
<br/>without consulting the Ministry of Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  initiative  to  boost  ginger  production  is  commended,  it  is  now 
<br/>evident from the over-supply of the green ginger currently experienced that very little though and 
<br/>foresight was given to the available market for the final product.  Farmers who took out secured loans 
<br/>under the scheme with FDB, now face the aura of inability to repay loans and likely losing out on 
<br/>their land titles altogether.  As Minister responsible for agriculture, farmers’ problems become my 
<br/>problem as they are the front-line clients of the Ministry.  I have spoken with the FDB CEO who has 
<br/>assured that the FDB will continue to support those farmers who are its clients under the scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  point,  I  would  like  to  make  a  direct  appeal  to  the  Australian 
<br/>Government.  It took us  more than a decade to negotiate the ginger pathway to Australia.  To be 
<br/>specific, it took us 13 years and I am glad that the honourable Seruiratu is now the Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, he knows the story very well.  After 13 years of negotiations, we finally managed to have 
<br/>a ginger pathway for fresh ginger into the Australian market.  Fiji has fulfilled all obligations under 
<br/>the pathway, only to be told that there exists a special strain of nematode, which is present here and 
<br/>not in Australia that disallows fresh Fijian ginger into the Australian market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say to the Australian Government to bring the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Initiative to 
<br/>life and not just mere words.  Fijian farmers deserve to supply fresh ginger into the Australian market.  
<br/>I also want to say to the Australian Government not to use technical barriers to trade as a way of 
<br/>keeping Fijian ginger out of the Australian market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have an option of selling Fijian fresh ginger to the Australian Ginger Farmers Association 
<br/>and they can rebrand it as Australian ginger, but as long as we get our Fijian fresh ginger out of the 
<br/></span><span>farms and have money in farmers’ pockets.  This is a win-win situation because ginger is sold in the 
<br/></span><span>retail markets in Australia for as much as $58 a kilogramme, and even at a landing price of $25 a 
<br/>kilogramme into Australia, they will still make a lot of money.  Of course, we understand that the 
<br/>Australian Government wants to protect its own ginger farmers, but we are asking the Australian 
<br/>Government to just give the Fijian farmers that small window of opportunity to get our ginger into 
<br/>the Australian market and make the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership real and not just mere words.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>577 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to assist affected farmers to cushion the impact 
<br/>of  loan  repayments  to  FDB  through  the  implementation  of  Crop  Diversification  Programmes  for 
<br/>other short term high value crops and the advice on proper farm management methods and technics. 
<br/>The Ministry will also assist through the procurement of approximately 200 metric tonnes of matured 
<br/>ginger  at  the  current  market  price  for  the  next  season’s  planting  material,  while  consequently 
<br/>controlling the supply of seeds that should meet contract demand.  The premature ginger market is 
<br/>around eight months  to nine months which is  around this to  the early month  of May, and should 
<br/>absorb around 1,000 tonnes by the two major ginger buyers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the large scale ginger producers normally keep at least 40 percent of their 
<br/>total crop as seed material for the next season which translates to around 4,000 tonnes. Further to 
<br/>this, the Ministry will continue to scope for potential export opportunities to meet the rising ginger 
<br/>production.  Lastly, the Ministry would like to advice ginger farmers to maintain the seed materials 
<br/>for the next planting season.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  forward,  the  Ministry  will  ensure  that  farmers  respond  to  market  demands  and 
<br/>continue to support the ginger farming programme.  However, the Ministry will be mindful of the 
<br/>coordination and execution of projected activities taking into account the lessons learnt this year.  At 
<br/>the same time, we want to advice farmers to be aware and comply with the needs and requirements 
<br/>of the market and to engage in formal contracts.  On the other hand, we also urge exporters to honour 
<br/>their contracts signed with the farmers as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that this Statement has given some relief to our ginger farmers, and 
<br/>I know that there are so many of us in this Parliament are ginger farmers.  Sorry, I want to declare 
<br/>my interest here.   
<br/>And I also want to declare other Members’ interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak on the Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will respond to the Ministerial Statement.  First, 
<br/>let me thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture for stating the facts that is confronting us when 
<br/>it comes to ginger. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will probably declare my interest as well.  I was a ginger farmer but now my son has taken 
<br/>over.  But since leaving Agriculture, I am still continuing with this, Mr, Speaker, Sir.  Honourable 
<br/>Koya  is  here  as  well,  we  know  all  the  discussions  that  took  place,  and  we  are  here  to  offer  our 
<br/>assistance as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  focusing  on  the  issue  that  we  have  based  on  the  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement, can I just also correct what I had stated yesterday about the situation at the Fiji National 
<br/>University (FNU). I mentioned about the laboratory.  No, it was not the laboratory, it was the clinic 
<br/>-  the  animal  hospital  so to  speak,  that  is  pending.  I  would  urge  the  Government  and  because  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister had raised, we have not been able to construct that clinic so that the veterinarian 
<br/></span><span>students can go through all the requirements and then be certified as qualified  veterinarians. Because 
<br/>the honourable Minister has raised, now it is your responsibility to construct that clinic, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go back to ginger, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As I have stated, I will not repeat the facts here, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but we are consulting.  For me, personally, I told the honourable Minister that members of the Fiji 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Crop and Livestock Council bring the issues to me because of the connection at the political level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of solutions, let me cut it short, I will urge the honourable Prime Minister that this 
<br/>issue requires political intervention at the highest level. I have asked the honourable Minister this 
<br/>morning, I will just base by statement on what you have stated, but I have also asked the honourable 
<br/>Minister that whenever a politician from Australia in that respect, the honourable Prime Minister as 
<br/>well, if he is in Fiji, please, raise this with the Office of the Prime Minister so that it can be in his 
<br/>discussion points because this needs intervention at the political level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  Ministers  can  help  as  well.  The  current  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and 
<br/>Immigration is also the Deputy Prime Minister, he was also a former Minister for Trade. Very briefly 
<br/>at Black Rock in October last year when he visited, not in the bilateral, but I did raise with him this 
<br/>issue as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Rural Development can also help because the current Minister 
<br/>for  Disaster  in  Australia  is  also  the  Minister  responsible  for  Agriculture,  but  it  needs  political 
<br/>intervention, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, at the highest level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The protocols have been established.  It took us 13 years to finalise the protocols, but we can 
<br/>understand the interest of the Federal Farmers Association and they are very powerful in Australia, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and they are protecting the domestic market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded too by the honourable Minister, ginger in Australia, Sir, is $54 per kilogramme.  
<br/>We can even sell here in Fiji, or the farmers can get it at $5 per kilogramme, for example, and then 
<br/>it can land as the calculation has been, but that is a big margin. Those are options that we can take as 
<br/>well  because  the  fresh  mature  ginger  can  help  us  solve  this  problem, Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  am 
<br/>urging Government to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other options that I would like to raise with Government as well. Let us look at 
<br/>continuing to have more of the existing markets, particularly the green ginger. What can we do?  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, what needs to be done is, let us look at the facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the biggest constraints that they have is the number of pools that they have.  A few of 
<br/>these current buyers just need space so that they can have more pools. Kaiming in Navua has about 
<br/>42 pools. Once all the pools are filled, no more, until they empty because the full pools have brine 
<br/>solution, and then from there into the processing and that is it. So, that can be an option, or more, and 
<br/>that  can  become  an  incentive  in  this  fiscal  review  that  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  is 
<br/>looking at because we need to have more facilities in order to process more as well because there is 
<br/>a lot out there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we were in Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the National Export Strategy and 
<br/>through the allocation in the Ministry of Agriculture, we have assisted the current growers and we 
<br/>have to look at other market segments and into other places as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  that  there  is  a  farmers’  association  who  are  based  in  Sabeto,  they  now  have  a 
<br/></span><span>processing plant in Namaka, whilst with them a few weeks back, they are also looking at selling to 
<br/></span><span>Dubai and the UAE, particularly. So, let us explore all markets, but the bottom line is, let us find a 
<br/>political solution to this so that we can sell more of the fresh ginger. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we were in Sydney, you would recall, I was having close 
<br/>conversations  with  Daniel  Stone,  our  Trade  Commissioner  in  Sydney.  The  Office  in  Sydney  are 
<br/>working on it already.  I have briefed the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade,
