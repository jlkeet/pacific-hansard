<h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting.  Yesterday’s sitting was quite a lively 
<br/>one and a noisy one as well, and I welcome those in today’s sitting, especially those in the gallery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be remiss of me if I do not mention the LLB students from our National University 
<br/>and not forgetting John and Lavenia Rokovucago, all the way from the Gold Coast, also sitting here 
<br/>today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Membership - Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  late  yesterday,  I  received  advice  that  honourable  Jovesa  Vocea, 
<br/>honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand have also been confirmed as members of 
<br/>the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC).  I also wish them well in 
<br/>their new undertaking for this parliamentary term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  did  announce  two  Members  yesterday,  they  were  the  local  sector’s  representatives  to 
<br/>GOPAC and these three are members.  Honourable Alvick has been a member for quite some time, 
<br/>that is why I singled him out and with the great experience he has, we look forward to his effective 
<br/></span><span>participation to continue as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper Conduct and Behaviour in Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members all I want to state at this juncture, and I wish to remind you that we 
<br/>must ensure that the provisions of Standing Orders relating to proper conduct and behaviour are fully 
<br/>observed, so as to ensure order and decorum in the Chambers and gallery.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>559 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand the excitement that continues to go across from this side of Parliament to that 
<br/>side and from that side to this side.  The excitement is so much, but again, please, ensure to show 
<br/>some respect because at the end of the day, there is nothing to be personally done here.  Members 
<br/>from  the  Opposition  will  be  going  across  to  the  Government  side  seeking  their  interventions  in 
<br/>projects  that  you  have,  as  well  as  the  Government  side  seeking  effective  participation  from  the 
<br/>Opposition in programmes they wish to undertake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As adults, honourable Members, I plead very strongly that it is not easy to Chair a meeting of 
<br/>adults and then it gets out of hand.  The last thing the Speaker would do is reprimand a Member and 
<br/>send him or her outside.  It does not augur well for us because we are a small Parliament, we happen 
<br/>to know each other and there is a need to work with each other.  Honourable Members, I hope to see 
<br/>an improvement in today’s proceedings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  I  would  like  to  wish  all  honourable  Members  a  very  happy  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperous </span><span>Ram Navami</span><span>.
