<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, please just take 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>note of the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Oral Question No. 23/2023 has been withdrawn as the honourable Minister has already

<br/>Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  to  ask  Oral  Question  No.  24/2023  and  the  Written

<div><span>Oral Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Toppers and TELS Scholarships 
<br/>(Question No. 21/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and  Minister for  Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  inform  Parliament  whether  Tertiary 
<br/>Scholarships and Loan Scheme Board will continue to receive applications for Toppers and 
<br/>TELS and issue scholarships? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loan  Service  (TSLS)  administers 
<br/>Government’s  scholarship  and  study  loans.    You  will  know  that  the  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>announced after the first Cabinet meeting that existing schemes for scholarships and study loans will 
<br/>continue in the current financial year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2023.  Therefore, TSLS will continue to offer 
<br/>scholarships and study loan scheme as approved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  extensively  announced  through  various  media 
<br/>platforms, the Tertiary Education Loan Schemes repayments have been put on hold as the Coalition 
<br/>Government prepares to forgive over $600 million in TELS debt and reset the funding of tertiary 
<br/>students moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, a Working Committee has been established which is co-chaired by 
<br/>the honourable Assistant Minister for Finance and the honourable Assistant Minister for Education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>629 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with  representative  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Education,  FRCS  and  TSLS.  The 
<br/>Working  Committee  has  been  tasked  to  evaluate  and  discuss  relevant  policies,  existing  Acts  to 
<br/>determine the best way forward to plan the proposed debt write-off. Of course, the plan will have to 
<br/>go  as  per  our  Financial  Management  Act  and  laws  will  be  submitted  to  Cabinet  in  April  and 
<br/>thereafter, we will let the general public know as to when that can be done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Working  Committee  is  also  currently  in  the  process  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>facilitating  necessary  legislative  amendments  to  existing  provisions  within  the  TSLS  Act  in   
<br/>consultation with the Solicitor-General’s Office.  It is crucial that necessary guidelines and processes 
<br/>are adhered to, given the significant impact such a policy would have. As such, Cabinet endorsement 
<br/>would be sort prior to any amendment to existing policies and Acts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Working Committee is also mindful of the subsequent impact 
<br/>of  the  policy  amendments  would  have  on  the  labour  market  given  that  we  must  ensure  that  our 
<br/>students are able to secure employment after the completion of their studies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as of 27</span><span>th</span><span> March, this is important statistics, a total sum of $655.2 
<br/>million has been paid out through the Tertiary Education Loans Scheme (TELS) with the total of 
<br/>$28.1 million recovered as of 28</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023. This Scheme started in 2014 so after eight years, 
<br/>this is the figures that we have.  A total sum of $617.4 million is currently outstanding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the scholarship, a total of $240.8 million has been paid out through the Tertiary 
<br/>Scholarship Programme as of 27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023.  Madam Deputy Speaker, the Tertiary Scholarship 
<br/>and  Loans  Service  Board  will  continue  to  assist  students  through  scholarship  programmes  where 
<br/>students would have to serve their bond term instead of making loan repayments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  a  comprehensive  Scholarship  Scheme  will  be  applicable  to  all 
<br/>students in fairness, equality and not based on race.  I know all these lies about the scholarships are 
<br/>going to be based on race was actively pursued by those sitting on the other side during the campaign. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government is currently focussed on the best way forward in removing student loan repayments and 
<br/>promoting and restoring scholarships for university students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And let me unequivocally tell the students who are currently studying in no uncertain terms, 
<br/>these are students currently on study loan agreements that your tuition and allowances will not be 
<br/>affected when repayment provision will be converted to bond conditions to serve the country.   Thank 
<br/>you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  have  a  supplementary  question;  a  lot  of 
<br/>promises were made during Election campaign.   Out of the many promises, one big promise made 
<br/>by SODELPA was that TELS will be forgiven.  We are tired of hearing from Government that TELS 
<br/>will come to an end.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance is, when will the loans be 
<br/></span><span>forgiven?  I have heard from the honourable Minister now that evaluation will be carried out, which 
<br/></span><span>means it is going to take time, that means further delay.  The people are very eagerly waiting for a 
<br/>definite answer.  When will this loan be forgiven?  When are you going to inform the parents and 
<br/>students? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am actually quite embarrassed at 
<br/>the level of comprehension of the honourable Member.  I have just explained very clearly and he 
<br/>knows that it is already out there, we have already announced that students are not paying the loan.  
<br/>I have just explained to him because we need some legislative changes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am actually baffled, Madam Deputy Speaker, at the level of comprehension, and the level 
<br/>of contribution that is coming from the Opposition is actually quite shameful. All they are doing is 
<br/>hurling insults whenever they can, and that is all they do. I have just explained very, very carefully.  
<br/>I am sure a Year 13 student listening to me right now would have understood that better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister have 
<br/>a, sort of, condescending attitude when he refers to Members.  We all know that he is a Professor, he 
<br/>has academic qualifications and he is a Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  My  question,  you  have  mentioned  that  the  loans  will  be  forgiven, 
<br/>people will serve a bond. Does that mean that everyone will automatically get a job in order to serve 
<br/>their bond?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- It is a good question. Honourable Usamate knows this very 
<br/>well, Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  and  I do not  know whether he was on a  scholarship, but  I  always 
<br/>studied during my days as a primary school student.  Some of them talked about, “Oh, this is the only 
<br/>time we have free education.”  I actually studied free as a rural student who had remission of fees in 
<br/>the 1970s and 1980s.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I got a government scholarship for five years and at that time, we did not have Form 7, we 
<br/>got  a  scholarship  to  come  and  do  Foundation  and  I  got  a  scholarship  to  do  my  Bachelors  and 
<br/>Education Degree at the University through scholarship by Government. All we did was to sign a 
<br/>bond.  The bond once to serve in the country.  The Government had no obligation to provide you 
<br/>with a job. Of course, at that time, if the job is available in Government which is the situation now, 
<br/>a student will get it but they sign a bond to serve the country. That is what the bond will be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Vacant Chiefly Titles 
<br/>(Question No. 22/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to ensure vacant chiefly titles are filled promptly? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  allow  me  to  say  Happy  </span><span>Ram  Naumi</span><span>  to  all  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hindu</span><span> friends around Fiji. Let me thank the honourable Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me first acknowledge the work that the Native Lands Commission has undertaken in Fiji 
<br/></span><span>since  its  inception  in  1905.    Its  most  famous  </span><span>Turaga  na  Veitarogi  Vanua</span><span>,  the  late  Ratu  Sir  Lala 
<br/></span><span>Sukuna,  did  extensive  work  to  ensure  that  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  and  their  institutions  endure.    It  is  fitting, 
<br/>therefore, that his legacy is remembered through the reintroduction of Ratu Sukuna Holiday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The passage of time from 1905 to date has provided us with the opportunity to reflect on how 
<br/>we can strengthen the foundation upon which the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>community sits. It is the very fabric of our 
<br/>society. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> </span><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>631 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chiefly  leadership  is  a  significant  pillar  to  our  nation.  The  return  of  the  Great  Council  of 
<br/>Chiefs demonstrates the Coalition Government’s commitment to fill the void caused by the unbalance 
<br/>perspective that revives the chiefly roles and their contribution to the governance of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Madam Deputy Speaker, we have a lot of catching up to do.  In my Maiden Speech, I had 
<br/>highlighted the total number of chiefly and customary titles in Fiji and steps my Ministry is taking to 
<br/>fill  the  3,322  vacancy  out  of  the  6,230  titles.    It  is  a  massive  task  </span><span>that  will  be accomplished  by the 
<br/>Ministry.  That is a bold statement, but we will trust that the revamping process to get us there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me begin by highlighting the current process in filling the vacant titles.  Once the </span><span>vanua, 
<br/>yavusa  </span><span>or  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>  formally  informs  the  Roko  on  their  decision  to  install  their  chiefly  or  titled 
<br/>position, the Roko Tui will recommend in writing to the Chairman of the iTaukei Lands Commission 
<br/>the support of the tribe on the person they have elected to fill the vacant position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission will verify supporting signatories against the Vola ni Kawa Buka (VKB) 
<br/>records and confirms the line of cession and genealogy.  It will verify supporting signatories against 
<br/>the  VKB,  check  the  validity  of  tribal  statement,  confirm  the  line  of  succession  and  confirm  the 
<br/>descendant of the leadership role with the </span><span>Mataqali </span><span>and </span><span>Yavusa.  </span><span>The Commission will compile a 
<br/>summary  to  the  title  concerned.  The  Chairman  checks  the  summary  and  advises  whether  the 
<br/></span><span>confirmed letter should be prepared, or if other clarifications are needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  relevant  Roko  Tui  is  informed  in  writing  if  the  submission  is  declined  with  an 
<br/>explanation.  If the Chairman confirms the proposed candidate, he signs the confirmation letter which 
<br/>will be sent to the Provincial Office for the Roko Tui to notify the title holder.  Then the Commission 
<br/>will register the new title holder in the VKB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  current  legislation  does  not  confine  the  filling  of  the  vacant 
<br/>positions within a specific period.  It is the </span><span>Vanua’s</span><span> prerogative to appoint its leaders, subject to its 
<br/>customary protocols which varies across Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Commission  and  the  Provincial  Council’s  Officials  only  play  advocacy  role  through 
<br/>awareness  programme.    Through  the  awareness  programme,  respective  tribes  are  informed  of  all 
<br/>sworn records at the Commission pertaining to them, including the traditional leadership protocols 
<br/>and succession guidelines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, 50 awareness sessions are targeted per year and will be intensified 
<br/>further.    The  creation  of  an  Awareness  Unit  with  proper  staffing  and  equipment  within  the 
<br/>Commission  and  empowering  the  Provincial  Council  Office  in  their  outreach  programme  to 
<br/>emphasise the importance of filling vacant chiefly titles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, training is also conducted.  As we have heard yesterday during the 
<br/>debate of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board Report, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, the iTaukei Trust 
<br/>Fund, the iTaukei Affairs Board and the Centre for Appropriate Technology and Development are 
<br/>currently in collaboration on the traditional leadership programme called the </span><span>Vuli ni Sausau Vou </span><span>and 
<br/></span><span>Vuli ni Sauvaki Vanua</span><span>.  Future traditional and chiefly leaders are trained on the importance of their 
<br/>role and also the component of the programme is the filling of vacant titles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the iTaukei Land Act was amended in 2013, to allow the Minister 
<br/>for iTaukei Affairs to issue regulations.  In coordination with the Solicitor-General’s Office, we have 
<br/>now completed the first  ever draft VKB Regulations which I will submit to Cabinet.  It will also 
<br/>assist in filling vacant posts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  recently  completed  my  visit  to  the  14  Provinces  and  the  most 
<br/></span><span>pressing issue for the iTaukei is the iTaukei Lands Commission.  Steps to address this have begun.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>632 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fundamental issue for the Commission which, in a big way, contributes to the delay in 
<br/>filling of vacant titles is the institution as a whole. I am referring to the legislation, the organisation, 
<br/>the systems and processes and human resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  institution’s  strategic  approach  is  to  fill  vacant  titles.  The  institutional  strengthening 
<br/>process of the Commission is a priority for the Coalition Government and the work on this has already 
<br/>started.    The  iTaukei  Affairs  Board  has  endorsed  that  in  principle  and  I  will  also  seek  the  Great 
<br/>Council of Chief’s (GCC) blessings when it meets in May.  I will eventually take it to Cabinet for 
<br/>endorsement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Institutional strengthening will also impact the iTaukei Lands Act 1905.  There are archaic 
<br/>provisions which need to be reviewed.  We also need to  empower the Commission to effectively 
<br/>address vacant chiefly titles, among other issues, through the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President had advised the nation at the Opening 
<br/>of  Parliament  that  the  principle  iTaukei  legislation  and  iTaukei  institutions  will  be  reviewed  to 
<br/>improve their service to the iTaukei.  The institutional strengthening of the Commission will also 
<br/>address delays in filling vacant titles, supported in His Excellency’s Address.  I am relying on the 
<br/>support from both sides of Parliament to see this through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  A  supplementary  question;  I  would  just  like  to  ask  the 
<br/>honourable Minister on the status of the chiefs that need to be installed.  I understand that there are 
<br/>over 6,000 chiefs all over Fiji and there are 3,000 yet to be installed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  exercise  of  getting  approvals  from  chiefly  families,  in  the  last  20  years  that  I  have 
<br/>served in the tourism industry, there seems to be a certain complication because the material status 
<br/>within the hierarchy in villages and </span><span>tikina</span><span> seems to have pushed their way through.  I just want to 
<br/>ask the honourable Minister if there is a system whereby there is a check-off on those chiefs that are 
<br/>recognised?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For example, if you would go to a destination in Fiji that deals with the </span><span>tikina</span><span> and there is a 
<br/>chief in that </span><span>tikina</span><span>, then when you go into the specific area which is owned by a specific </span><span>mataqali</span><span>, 
<br/>then there is always a discussion, for example, “no, this land belongs to the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>.</span><span>”</span><span>  Is there any 
<br/>way or system that the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs checks, even if the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> owns the land, that 
<br/>he still has to have the authority from the chief or the </span><span>yavusa</span><span> or the </span><span>tikina </span><span>to get that permission so 
<br/>that you can deal with the business that you would like to have in there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the current status now with regard to land, if he 
<br/>wants to lease or anything regarding to the land, we still go for the 60 precent, whether you are the 
<br/></span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span> or </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span>, it has to be decided from the members.  That is what is 
<br/>happening now because when chiefs are not installed, there is a big difference between the </span><span>yavusa</span><span> or 
<br/>the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> - there is no leadership there.  If there is leadership, it will be easy to solve those types 
<br/>of problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I will go very slowly.  The chiefly title 
<br/></span><span>belongs to the </span><span>Vanua.</span><span> </span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span> belongs to the </span><span>Mataqali </span><span>or </span><span>Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> belongs to 
<br/>the </span><span>Yavusa</span><span>.  The role that iTaukei Affairs or the </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> plays is when it is going to register 
<br/>– </span><span>vakamatanitutaki</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have told us the steps and according to the actions that you are putting into place how to 
<br/>encourage  them  to  fill  up  those  vacancies.    What  can  be  done  to  encourage  them?    Is  there  a 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>633 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>programme, for example, </span><span>veivakararamataki</span><span> programme to help them come to a decision as a group, 
<br/>even if there are different factions in dispute for a very long time?  They could have a different history 
<br/>all along passed down from different genealogies that they have.  What do you have to assist in this 
<br/>plan to enable them to come to a decision before they reach NLC to register?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- I will just try to repeat it.  We have the </span><span>Sauvaki ni Vanua </span><span>who are already 
<br/>out there going to the communities to explain them the importance of the chiefly title that they hold 
<br/>to be filled.  We also have the Provincial Councils, they have their KPIs to go out into the field to 
<br/>make sure they get as many titles as possible to be filled out there in their Provinces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, perhaps the final question.  We definitely 
<br/>want the chiefly titles to be filled and we fully understand that that is the </span><span>Vanua’s</span><span> prerogative.  You 
<br/>are  targeting  50  awareness  sessions,  perhaps  in  a  financial  year.    The  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister; with the 50 awareness, hopefully, this year what is your expectation on the number of titles 
<br/>that perhaps, can be resolved and filled as well from this awareness as an average probably? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition for your question. That is 
<br/>the target from the Commission.   The </span><span>Sauvaki ni Vanua</span><span>, the Provincial Councils and the </span><span>Sausau Vou</span><span>
<br/>is an ongoing thing, but I have already advised the Commission if they can increase the number of 
<br/>awareness to be carried out for a certain year, to make sure we fill most of the titles that have been 
<br/>vacant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the new Act comes into place, it will help us to make more decisions on the chiefly 
<br/>titles, which we cannot touch at the moment.  For those who are disputing, if we see that it is not in 
<br/>line with the dispute, that we can solve at the village level and the Provincial Council level.  For now, 
<br/>the number is quite low.  We will try and increase the number to make sure we can fill in the over 
<br/>3,000 titles that have not been filled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Skills Shortage in Fiji - TVET Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 24/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament if TVET is the answer to 
<br/>skill shortage in Fiji and abroad, and what is the current direction of the Ministry in regard to 
<br/>the TVET Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker,  I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question.    The  question  comes  in  twofold,  which  signifies  the  very  important  stature  of  TVET 
<br/>training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first part of the question is regarding technical vocational.  As we all know that TVET is 
<br/>an essential component of our education system because TVET subjects and courses promote and 
<br/>support economic growth of a country.   So, the answer is, yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  question  is  regarding  the  direction  that  the  Ministry is  taking  in  regard  to  the 
<br/></span><span>TVET Programme.  First and foremost, we learn from past mistakes that have been happening in the 
<br/>programmes.  Secondly, we have to put a lot of emphasis on TVET training and courses in our schools 
<br/>and training institutions.  There is also a need to ensure that we tap into the students’ TVET potential 
<br/>at a much earlier stage in the school system, for example, we might have to explore Year 7 and Year 
<br/>8, the senior primary schools rather than bringing it at Year 9.

<div><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, some initiatives regarding the increase in the recognition of TVET 
<br/>training institutions is the re-visitation of the TVET curriculum which is currently being done by the 
<br/>Test Department within the Ministry of Education.  We are also in the process of registering Fiji 
<br/>Vocational Training and Technical Centres.  Also, we are supporting new institutions like Pacific 
<br/>Polytech Limited, which is recognised as a higher education institution.  These two Campuses are 
<br/>located  at  the  former  Technical  College  premises  in  Tagitagi,  Tavua,  and  Waiyavi,  Lautoka 
<br/>respectively.  The Ministry has already been given the greenlight to develop a national policy on 
<br/>TVET to address the gaps and set a direction on TVET education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education 
<br/>inform Parliament if there is shortage of teachers in technical and vocational subject areas?  If they 
<br/>have the shortage, please, specify the areas?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  for  the 
<br/>supplementary question.  You have enticed me to go back in history in terms of the setting up of the 
<br/>technical colleges.  We will give the answer to the supplementary question that you have raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have alluded to with the first step because we learn from our mistakes. In 2015 and 2020 
<br/>the technical colleges received about $44,777,000 in grant (that is a huge amount) and $279,000 was 
<br/>spent on tools and equipment between 2016 and 2019. Madam Deputy Speaker, all these investments 
<br/>have unfortunately gone to waste.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In those instances, Madam Deputy Speaker, teachers have come with those investments also 
<br/>were dismissed by the Ministry of Education and also by the Fiji National University. So, yes that 
<br/>should give an answer to your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to ask my supplementary question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education.  Hot topic has always been TELS and now we are talking about 
<br/>TVET, I do not know when this Government is going to remove TELS, there has been promises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, not sure when they will remove TELS, however, 
<br/>we  are  on  TVET.    Since  the  honourable  Minister  has  said  that  TVET  is  an  important  vocational 
<br/>training sector for our students. The question is, will the honourable Minister continue free education 
<br/>for TVET students  or they will continue with  TELS?  If free education is  there, what  sort of  free 
<br/>education will they continue? Will be it be race-based or how it was before or will they continue with 
<br/>current trend?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is the kind of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lies that they were telling before the election?  They lied outside of Parliament… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … they are inside of Parliament now, they are lying again.  
<br/></span><span>The former honourable Prime Minister is misleading and creating ill-will.  This man is creating ill-
<br/></span><span>will  by  talking  about  race-based  scholarships.    The  former  honourable  Prime  Minister  on  many 
<br/>occasions; before the election and after the election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order?

<div><span> </span><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>635 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I just clarified in my answer to the question that it is not going 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be based on race.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, you should ask him to withdraw that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question and comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I will ask the honourable Minister for Education to please 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>repeat himself if you need to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Can I ask the honourable Member to repeat the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Please make your point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, will free scholarship for TVET students continue 
<br/>or will it be based on different racial backgrounds or will there be differences in their scholarship 
<br/>setting? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you very much for making the question very clear.  There 
<br/>are about 36 schools that are currently engaged in terms of vocational programmes.  The unfortunate 
<br/>part is that these schools give Certificates 1 and 2 to these students. The fees are paid by the Ministry 
<br/>of Education on an annual basis and the Certificate that has been provided or given to these students 
<br/>are  not  recognised  by  the  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  and  TSLS.  So  Government  is  also 
<br/>paying for the students education fees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Minister was very quick at 
<br/>just  going  round  and  round  and  giving  incorrect  answers  so  far.  Because  he  does  not  know  the 
<br/>answers and he was going round and round and he will give me a similar answer to this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry had completed the stocktake of all vocational schools around the country. What 
<br/>are the plans to offer courses based on market for these vocational schools?  Meeting the market 
<br/>demand for vocational courses and how you are going to revamp it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I have just answered the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, you have not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- She should have been listening rather than trying to.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I have already answered the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I did not ask how many vocational schools. 
<br/>I am simply asking what are your plans to ensure that the courses you offer at these vocational schools 
<br/>are market driven? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It sounds like a new question but I try to answer even though it 
<br/>is a new question.  There is always an assessment done between stakeholders and the needs of the

<div><span>Taxi Permit Lottery System 
<br/>(Question No. 25/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament what system does the Ministry intend to utilise that will be 
<br/>more transparent than the existing taxi permit lottery system? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>the question. There are two taxi systems administered by LTA; this is one of legacies of the previous 
<br/>Government which is confusing and cumbersome.  The two systems include the base stand system 
<br/>that required municipal councils to provide base and stands to taxi permits holder  and the second 
<br/>system being the zone system which is only used in Nadi and Lautoka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are more than 8,000 taxi permits existing of which more than 1,500 permits belongs to 
<br/>the zone system and the remaining 6,500 belong to the base stand system.  Due to the public outcry 
<br/>from the existing municipal base stand taxi operators, that they were continuous encroachment from 
<br/>the zone system taxi operators in Nadi and Lautoka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  open  taxi  ranking  system  was  introduced  across  Fiji  to  accommodate  both  systems.  
<br/>However, this then brought in more challenges and enforcement issues adding further complexities, 
<br/>example congested and conflict in certain locations that have taxis in both base and zones are cross-
<br/>transmitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on transport zones to Land Transport Authority, it identified 34 on 
<br/>transport zones to assist with the issuance of taxi permits throughout Fiji. This taxi transport zone 
<br/>covers  a  zone  distance  measurement  of  18  kilometres  that  equates  as  a  taxi  which  operates  a 
<br/>maximum  of  20  kilometres  on  a  taxi  metre.  The  transport  zone  distribution  covers  the  two  main 
<br/>islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, including the maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  quota  on  the  number  of  new  taxis  to  be  operated  from  the  specific  zones  were  also 
<br/>established.    The  transport  quota  was  derived  taking  into  consideration  the  existing  taxi  supply 
<br/>operators that demand the taxi…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, there is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Minister is beating around the 
<br/>bush.  The simple question the honourable Member has asked, does the Ministry intend to utilise that 
<br/>will be more transparent than the existing taxi Permit Lottery System. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Which you created? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We will allow the Minister to continue with his reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="83">Page 83</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>637 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, if they are listening properly, I am 
<br/>reading the basis of which will come to the answer and it needs to be explained that way.  You cannot 
<br/>just answer it without the thread.  So that is what I am explaining.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The LTA had conducted an assessment of the quotas and determined that are few zones, like 
<br/>the Suva zones are already over-supplied with taxis, so the focus on the issuance of taxi permits in 
<br/>future will be particularly in the rural areas and outskirts of towns and cities.  In the lead up to the 
<br/>barrel draw which happened, a total of 2,647 applications were received for Nadi 1 and Nadi 2 and 
<br/>Lautoka 1 Transport Zones, of which 2,536 were deemed eligible by the Independent Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For your information, the requirement for a taxi permit is specified under the Land Transport 
<br/>(PSV)(Amendment) Regulations 2017 5E (2).  I will not go into that.  From the 2,536 applications 
<br/>that went into the barrel draw for the respective Transport Zones, 1,553 taxi permits were issued to 
<br/>accommodate the available transport quota.  Unfortunately, this process has not been completed as 
<br/>the taxi barrel draw only occurred in Nadi and Lautoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The barrel draw is not a transparent way of issuing taxi permits and is a cumbersome process 
<br/>that  involves  a  lot  of  resources,  for  example,  manpower  and  paperwork.    It  was  also  unfair  and 
<br/>discriminatory distribution of taxi permits that allows those with inferior motives rather than genuine 
<br/>ones to operate a taxi, not to mention the influx of complaints causing a redraw.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of those permits which were acquired through the barrel draw have been transferred 
<br/>under sale and purchase agreement for profiteering purpose and applicants who were issued such taxi 
<br/>permits have neglected the reason for the issuance of the permits.  This leads to monopolisation of 
<br/>taxi permits in the market.  The permits issued under the barrel system was signed and designated 
<br/>tag  zone  taxi  operators  under  open  taxi  ranking  are  flocking  to  the  urban  areas  to  operate,  thus 
<br/>neglecting  the  demand  for  taxi  services  in  the  rural  areas  and  urban  fringes.    That  is  one  of  the 
<br/>negative out of the many impacts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  this  FijiFirst  legacy  issues,  I  have  directed  the  LTA  to  re-assess  and  device  new 
<br/>methods of issuing taxi permits.  It is unlikely that we will be using the lottery system again as a 
<br/>more transparent system.  The acquiring of permits through sales and purchase are also under review.  
<br/>It  is  shocking  to  learn that some taxi permits are sold  for up to  $60,000.  This  defeats  the whole 
<br/>purpose of issuing taxi permits and it is just plainly wrong.  It encourages unethical behaviour and 
<br/>corruption  in  the  industry  and  distorts  the  whole  economics  of  the  transport  industry.    However, 
<br/>transfer taxi permits on genuine grounds such as death, medical and migration will still be considered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, the FijiFirst question which is posed to us indicates that it agrees that the lottery 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is, of course, not a proper way of issuing permits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me just say I do not think the 
<br/>honourable Minister has done himself any justice by not answering what was asked.  He actually 
<br/>convoluted everything.  As the matter of fact, the question was quite simple.  It was his statement… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I answered at the end. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It was your statement earlier on, I think you blurted it out in the press 
<br/>that the taxi permit lottery system that was used was not transparent.  How much more transparent 
<br/>can you get than a barrel lottery draw?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is the question?

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- That is the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Please. just shut up and listen for God’s sake.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is the question.  Too many running commentary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Address the Chair, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Maybe they need to be told to shut up, Madam Deputy Speaker, because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am asking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that is the case, honourable Minister, that you are attacking the transparency of the barrel 
<br/>draw that took place, what are you going to do? Are you going to revoke all the permits that were 
<br/>given under that lottery permit?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- No, I did not mention that we will revoke it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM  DEPUTY  SPEAKER.-  One  final  supplementary  question  and  please  get  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  To the point?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Absolutely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The point is this, what system will replace this system that you 
<br/>say is not transparent?  What system?  You have talked about the weaknesses and all that but what 
<br/>system?  Do you have a system, or you are going to do a consultation to find a system?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The question, just to emphasise that this is not a dictatorship.  
<br/>It is a democratic Government and consultation is a key essence of this Government.  That is why 
<br/>…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Your Point of Order, quickly, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The Point of Order, the relevance to my question.  There is no 
<br/>relevance from the answer.  The honourable Minister is telling us that they do not have any system 
<br/>that should replace this.  So, he is now going into consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, take your seat, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It would be totally ridiculous just to pluck a replacement out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of thin air.  So, in a normal process, have these people worked in organisations before or not? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a normal process, in  a normal transformational change or change management process, 
<br/>you would go through consultations, you would assess all issues, all consultations, all options will

<div><span>Domestic Air Services Subsidy Scheme 
<br/>(Question No. 26/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update Parliament on the Domestic Air Services Subsidy Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/>question.  If you would allow me, honourable Deputy Speaker, if I just put a bit of history behind the 
<br/>scheme.  It started in 2003.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  through  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  established  the  Domestic  Air 
<br/>Services Subsidy Scheme to ensure that the necessary schedule air services are provided to outlying 
<br/>islands,  communities and businesses.  I am  referring  to  something here that was commissioned in 
<br/>2003.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The findings and recommendations of the Domestic Aviation Strategy Study Report on the 
<br/>viability  of air services  to the outer islands  were identified  and it was discovered that most were 
<br/>uneconomical  commercially,  meaning  that,  if  you  provide  those  services  to  the  outer  islands,  the 
<br/>airfares  could  not  meet  the  cost  of  operating  those  services.  These  routes  were  Gau,  Koro, 
<br/>Vanuabalavu, Lakeba, Cicia, Moala, Ono-i-Lau and Rotuma.  The Report had looked at the economic 
<br/>viability of these government community services as well as establishing the most effective way of 
<br/>continuing operations on the eight identified routes vis-à-vis through a subsidised scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Air Subsidy Scheme is an incentive to air operators.  Airlines 
<br/>that have been awarded the tender are compensated in the form of a subsidy for air services they 
<br/>provide on these uneconomical routes.  The scheme is strictly on the basis of an open tender to all 
<br/>licenced air operators in Fiji who have the interest and most importantly the capacity to carry out the 
<br/>air service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first tender was awarded in 2004, where two domestic airlines, </span><span>Air Fiji</span><span> and </span><span>Sun Air</span><span> were 
<br/>provided the subsidy incentive for servicing these subsidised routes.  Over the years, the Moala route 
<br/>was withdrawn from the scheme due to the unwillingness of one domestic operator to service the 
<br/>route without the government’s incentive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in 2005 Ono-i-Lau route was then included on the Subsidy Scheme; 
<br/>twice a month services.  However, in 2011, the Ono-i-Lau route was discontinued due to very low 
<br/></span><span>passenger demand for the twice a month service that have been offered on subsidy.  Statistical data 
<br/></span><span>that was presented in 2015 reflected an average carriage of only 2 passengers per return flights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the safety aspect of the operation required an approval process on a case by case 
<br/>basis from the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji.  This process involves a risk analysis to be conducted 
<br/>and a temporary registration of route granted as appropriate for the flight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>640 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In recent years, given the losses incurred by the airline service in Kadavu, the Government 
<br/>had included Kadavu in  the Subsidy Scheme.  The current  subsidy is  for a period of three years, 
<br/>commencing from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 expiring on 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2025.  That is an update on where we are 
<br/>on the Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the question here is, we all understand how the 
<br/>subsidised routes work, it is similar to the maritime industry.  There are non-economical routes, so 
<br/>we have to service these people because there are people in the maritime area et cetera, with respect 
<br/>to shipping and of course with the airlines. One begs a question – are you doing or has there been a 
<br/>feasibility study done already with respect to the routes that are being offered by the Government?  
<br/>When I say that I am talking about in terms of traffic flow, in terms of cargo and in terms of tourism, 
<br/>etcetera.    Has  that  been  done,  or  do  you  intend  to  undertake  this  with  respect  to  this  particular 
<br/>subsidy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what we currently have is still has to run 
<br/>for another year or two and the studies will be undertaken.  As we speak, Ono-i-Lau has requested 
<br/>for the resumption of that service.  There are new islands that are asking for airports to be built and 
<br/>for services to be provided.  It is quite illuminating for most of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For me personally, I only flew on big routes, and I did not realise that what we needed to do 
<br/>for these small islands.  I could share some of the costs with you here, for instance, to fly to Cicia 
<br/>with the Twin Otter would cost the airline some $30,400 a month.  But the total airfare they collect 
<br/>is $9,086.  So, the difference between the operation cost and what they collect as air fare is quite 
<br/>significant.  So that is one of the reasons why we provide this subsidy that goes back to the time in 
<br/>the early 2000 to provide these services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the interest of Parliament, we allocate about $1.6 million a year for subsidies.  So, it is up 
<br/>to us, if the demand picks up and tourism and cargo, we can increase this so that we can get more 
<br/>services into the outer islands.  But it is a scheme that is there today, it is working and it is up to us, 
<br/>based on demand on how to increase it for the reasons being mentioned tourism, cargo and the likes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Just a small one, Madam Deputy Speaker.  Maybe this an advice also.  
<br/>With these outer islands that we do have traffic going into, merely they wanted to know whether 
<br/>there is going to be encouragement, for example the Minister responsible for SMEs and cooperatives 
<br/>with respect to getting more cargo out of these areas so it becomes a little more lucrative.  I know we 
<br/>were trying to encourage with respect the cooperatives, virgin coconut oil is one answer.  There is a 
<br/>lot that can be done.  Is there a serious indication from you that this is actually going to be done with 
<br/>respect to trying to make these routes a little bit more lucrative, because we know that there are only 
<br/>two airlines that were involved, </span><span>Fiji Link</span><span> and </span><span>Northern Air</span><span>?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, that will certainly be the way forward for 
<br/>us, to also consider cargo in a big way.  We have to understand that only two types of aircrafts are 
<br/>now flying - Twin Otter,  Bandeirante and Islander also. The airports are, in some cases cannot take 
<br/>a full load of Twin Otter and Bandeirante.  So those are factors that need to be part of the equation 
<br/>when you decide to go that way, because you are talking about a full load Twin Otter and a full of 
<br/></span><span>Bandeirante now.  But of course, we are not limited to those types of aircrafts. There are some airports 
<br/></span><span>today, that cannot take both these aircrafts on the full load.  So those are the certain limitations we 
<br/>have to consider.  We are taking steps to ensure that the airports and those outer islands are fully 
<br/>compliant to take the Twin Otter and the Bandeirante.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  would  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/>consider putting refuelling facilities within the different islands that will allow your aeroplanes to

<div><span>island  hop?    Basically  this  means  that  it  can  fly  to  Ono,  re-fuel,  come  to  Cicia,  re-fuel,  come  to 
<br/>Vanuabalavu, re-fuel and then come to Nausori?  Would the honourable Minister consider looking 
<br/>at those options to have refuelling facilities and island hop? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  appreciate  the  sentiments  being 
<br/>expressed.  It is quite challenging.  The honourable Member is a boatman and he understands about 
<br/>boats and how we transport things and fuel, setting up these re-fuelling stations, it will be something 
<br/>that we will look into going forward.   I guess the other day I spoke about the framework for tourism, 
<br/>and these are all part of spreading the benefits of tourism.

<div><span>Combating COVID-19 
<br/>(Question No. 27/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament if 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is really out of the woods in terms of combating COVID-19? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ravunawa, a medical colleague, for his question this evening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, before I go to the answer, I would like to just elaborate on some 
<br/>facts  behind  the  answer.    Yes,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  is  continuously 
<br/>monitoring the national, regional and global trends of the COVID-19 infection and our public health 
<br/>advice is centred around the situation of our infection here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are in a different phase of the pandemic now than we had in the 
<br/>last two to three years ago. The virus is now widespread in the community, but our levels of immunity 
<br/>are high enough that our hospitals are not being overwhelmed with severe cases and even deaths. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Madam Deputy Speaker, the World Health Organization (WHO) in January this 
<br/>year determined that COVID-19 is still a public health emergency of international concern, while 
<br/>also acknowledging that we are likely in a transition point of the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the WHO COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update published last Wednesday on 
<br/>22</span><span>nd</span><span> March, 2023, over 3.7 million new cases and over 260,000 deaths were reported globally in the 
<br/>last 28 days, that is, from 28</span><span>th</span><span> February to 19</span><span>th</span><span> March 2023 which reflected a decrease of 31 percent 
<br/>and 46 percent respectively, compared to the previous 28 days which was from 23</span><span>rd</span><span> January to 19</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>February this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The report noted that some regions, including the Western Pacific regions which Fiji is a part 
<br/>of recorded decreases in new cases and deaths.  However, what it noted was that the updated report 
<br/>acknowledges  that  the  numbers  are  underestimates  of  the  true  number  of  global  infections  and 
<br/>reinfections and that is what we also see here in Fiji as well due to the reduction in testings and delays 
<br/>in reporting in many countries. Therefore, Madam Deputy Speaker, with the current regional and 
<br/></span><span>global  disease  trend,  our  small  island  nation  is  not  out  of  the  woods  yet  in  terms  of  combatting 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  the  answer.    My  simple 
<br/>question is this, how can you better prepare for the next one, given that according to WHO the next 
<br/>pandemic is not a question of “if” but “when”?  How can you prepare better for the next one?

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for his supplementary question.  To answer his question on how better we can prepare, I think the 
<br/>preparatory parties started from the last Government and we are just continuing from there in terms 
<br/>of capacity building within our investigative abilities, I think Fiji’s CDC is being propped up now 
<br/>with the new capabilities in diagnostic care.  We also have our team that is stationed in Nadi which 
<br/>is looking after the border security part of it and that team made up of doctors, health inspectors and 
<br/>even RFMF is being seconded there to help with our Border Protection Unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other than that, we are still vigilant with our monitoring, like I have said, in terms of our 
<br/>regional and international trends that have seen.  Also, to do with that, continuously monitoring our 
<br/>cases within the hospitals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in terms of preparedness there is a lot of work being done at the moment.  Like I said, it 
<br/>was done from your previous Government and as the new Government coming in, we will try and 
<br/>improve on that and see how best we can improve on that, involving not only the government side 
<br/>but other stakeholders as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question; given that 
<br/>the “No Jab No Job” policy has been lifted, if you can confirm that the Ministry is still advising those 
<br/>that have not been vaccinated to go and get vaccinated if you can? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  DR.  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Member  for  that 
<br/>question.    Yes,  we  are  still  advising  for  the  continuation  of  the  vaccination,  especially  for  our 
<br/>vulnerable population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  We  have  managed  to  flattened  the  curve  under  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>decisive leadership, strong leadership and the whole of Government response towards the pandemic 
<br/>in 2019-2020 and we thank the former Minister, the Permanent Secretary -  Dr. Fong, the whole of 
<br/>the Ministry of Health workforce and also the whole of Government in the mitigation towards the 
<br/>containment  of  COVID-19.    My  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is;  can  the 
<br/>Minister inform Parliament if the vaccination for the younger population are still ongoing or it has 
<br/>been stopped? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  As  I  have  said,  with  regards  to  the  ongoing 
<br/>programme for vaccination, it involves the vulnerable population and children is one of the categories 
<br/>coming under the vulnerable population.  With children it is based on the consent of the parents.   
<br/></span></div>
