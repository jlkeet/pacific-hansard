<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, the global pandemic significantly impacted the Fund’s returns to 
<br/>investment.  The  Fund’s  investment  in  the  tourism  sector,  namely  the  Radisson  Blu  Resort,  was 
<br/>severely  hit.  To  some  degree,  the  Fund’s  diversified  investment  portfolio,  including  its  offshore 
<br/>investment, softened the gravity of the COVID-19 impact on its financial performances and return 
<br/>on investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fund engaged Mercer Investments of Australia to review its investment portfolio. The 
<br/>objective of the review was to ensure the diversification of the Fund’s assets with manageable risks, 
<br/>and the delivery of consistent returns on investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fund’s car park space at the corner of Stewart Street continue to deliver 
<br/>constant revenue annually and its tenants were given a rental concession of 25 percent during the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, for the year, the Fund’s net assets decreased from $325 million to 
<br/>$267 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee heard of the Fund’s plans to diversify its revenue streams 
<br/>and its optimism for better years ahead of recovery by building resilience based on its diversified 
<br/>investment portfolio and staff to bring smarter value to its stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament for their efforts and input which has greatly assisted our 
<br/>Committee in the completion of this Report.  I would also like to thank the Members of the current 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs and I wish them all the best in this new term of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also extend my gratitude to the Chief Executive Officer of the iTaukei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trust Fund Board, Mr. Aisake Taito, and his staff for their assistance in the review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report to Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
