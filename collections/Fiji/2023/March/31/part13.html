<h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Standing Order 6 that so much of Standing Order 23(1) is suspended so as to 
<br/>allow Parliament to sit beyond 12.30 p.m. today to complete the remaining items listed on 
<br/>today’s Order Paper. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure 
<br/>I speak for all of us that we had hoped to finish by 12.30 p.m. after a long week.  However, there are 
<br/>two more End of Week Statements from the honourable Naupoto, as well as honourable Usamate.  
<br/>It is Friday and it is Members’ day, so we look forward to hearing from them, as well as their replies.  
<br/>So, I beg the Parliament’s indulgence that we agree that we sit beyond 12.30 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As there are no responses, then I call on the Leader of the Government in Parliament if she 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wishes to make a reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing more to add, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
