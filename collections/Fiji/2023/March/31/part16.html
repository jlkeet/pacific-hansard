<div><span>MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
<br/>HONOURABLE MACIU KATAMOTU NALUMISA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliamentary Response - Friday, 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/>Mr. Speaker Sir, rates is a major revenue stream of Municipal Councils, as rightly pointed out 
<br/>by the honourable Member in her question.  If all Municipal Councils were collecting all the rates, they 
<br/>would be able to undertake a lot of investments in their Municipalities and enhance service delivery to 
<br/>ratepayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  Cities  and  Towns  in  Fiji  have  an  estimated  44,749  ratepayers  with 
<br/>approximately 85 percent of ratepayers being residential ratepayers. As residents of towns and cities, 
<br/>people of Fiji are required, in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972, to pay town/city rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  rates  assist  Municipal  Councils  in  providing  services,  such  as  solid  waste  management 
<br/>services,  beautification  and  open  space  upkeep,  sanitation  control  management,  organising  national 
<br/>events  and the performance of regulatory  and enforcement  functions, inclusive of transport, traffic, 
<br/>building and litter, whilst also investing.  Municipal Councils are able to use the revenue to improve 
<br/>and enhance services  and  create  an  environment  to  encourage  investments  and  economic  activities 
<br/>within their Municipalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Suva City Council has the highest number of ratepayers with 9,441  or 83 
<br/>percent residential ratepayers, out of the 11,468 ratepayers.  Nasinu Town Council comes a close second 
<br/>with 11,377 ratepayers, of which 10,953 are residential; whilst the Lautoka City Council has the third 
<br/>highest with 8,169 ratepayers of which 91 percent (7,419) are residential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  delay  in  rates  payment  has  severely  hindered  the  service  delivery  capacity  and 
<br/>implementation of capital projects by the Municipal Council. I wish to re-emphasise that the ratepayers 
<br/>have an obligation to contribute to the cost of running the cities and towns, to be able to receive the best 
<br/>services and have good infrastructure in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, as per section 64 of the Local Government Act 1972, Councils are required to 
<br/>carry out Sexennial Valuation every six years to determine the unimproved value of rateable land.  It is 
<br/>worth noting that the Councils carried out the Sexennial Valuation between the years 2007 and 2021 
<br/>upon the required interval and rates were increased and implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal Councils implemented the increases in rates as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Tavua  Town  Council  increased  rates  based  on  the  2002  valuation.    Following  the  2020 
<br/>valuation, the Tavua Town Council requested the Ministry to implement the rates increase in 
<br/>2021, but the Ministry had asked them to put it on hold.

<div><span>ii.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Rakiraki  Town  Council  undertook  Sexennial  Valuation  in  2012,  hence  rates  increase  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented in 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Lautoka  City  Council  and  Ba  Town  Council  increased  rates  in  2021,  based  on  the  2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sexennial Valuation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Nausori Town Council valuation was done in 2022, but the increase in rates was put on hold, as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per instructions from the former Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Nasinu  Town  Council  undertook  Sexennial  Valuation  in  2013  and  the  rates  increase  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Labasa Town Council implemented rates increase in 2017, based on the 2016 valuation. The 
<br/>Council is currently undertaking the valuation, which may have an impact on rates in the future. 
<br/></span><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Suva City Council and Lami Town Council implemented the rates increase in 2012, which was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a result of the valuation done in 2011. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Levuka  Town  Council  had  the  last  Sexennial  Valuation  done  in  2021,  but  yet  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented. The current rates are based on the valuation done in 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Savusavu Town Council last valuation was carried out in 2022 and yet to implement, the rates 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are based on the 2013 valuation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Nadi Town Council undertook the Sexennial Valuation in 2017 and the rates increase was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●</span><span> </span><span>Sigatoka Town Council rates are based on the 2013 valuation. The 2021 valuation is yet to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, when there are outstanding rates, it attracts 11 percent compound interest rate, 
<br/>as per Section 78 of the Local Government Act 1972.  Compound interest does not apply interest rates 
<br/>fairly for the ratepayers.  The Ministry of Local Government is working on reviewing the 11 percent 
<br/>compound interest to ensure that the application of interest is changed from compound to simple. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, one of the factors for massive arrears in rates is the Covid-19 pandemic which 
<br/>has not only affected rates but also other aspects of economic growth.  Another reason for the increase 
<br/>in  arrears  is  the  new  subdivisions  and  rezoning  of  land/spaces  in  respective  Municipalities.  The  new 
<br/>subdivisions and change of zones mean that the rates will have to be imposed on the subdivided lots 
<br/>and a new rate to be imposed on the new zoning of the lot rezone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, replies to the Written Question are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Collection of rates is the most critical issue. All Municipal Councils records reveal that at the 
<br/>end of 2007, they were owed $28.3 million in rates. This indicates that over 50 percent of 
<br/>ratepayers in the country have some outstanding rates and charges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to highlight three Municipalities that have the highest  amount of rates arrears. Due to 
<br/>the arrears prior to 2007, approximately $2.3 million has been accumulated in interest rates due 
<br/>to the compounded interest rate of 11 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suva City Council has the highest outstanding rates. However, collection rates (arrears and 
<br/>current year) for the last 16 years ranges between 80 percent to 99 percent. The Council has a 
<br/>good collection for the current year’s rate.  Suva currently has approximately $32 million in 
<br/>outstanding rates. It is important to note that for 2023, the invoiced amount was $18.5 million, 
<br/>and Suva has collected $15.3 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>iii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Nasinu Town Council, being a Medium Council, has the second highest outstanding rates 
<br/>of $12 million as of 2023, while Lautoka City Council’s outstanding rate is $11.5 million or 
<br/>the third highest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to highlight that the Small Councils, such as Savusavu, Sigatoka, Tavua, Rakiraki and 
<br/>Levuka are performing well in rates collection, both current and arrears. It is important to note 
<br/>that rates are the source of revenue for Small Councils, and they ensure that collection is done 
<br/>on time. Comparing outstanding rates from years 2007 to 2012, the arrears had decreased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, due to changes in rates, following the Sexennial Valuation and compound interest, 
<br/>the arrears started increasing from 2013.  The arrears increased significantly in 2020 and 2021 
<br/>due to the pandemic. This affected the rates collection by the Small Councils, as ratepayers 
<br/>faced difficulty in paying the rates. After recovery from the pandemic, the Councils are back on 
<br/>track with innovative ideas and strategies in place for collection.  (Please refer to </span><span>Annex 1 </span><span>for 
<br/>the Municipal Council Rates Information from 2007 to 2022). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Municipal Councils, in consultation with the Ministry, have prepared their rates plan that will 
<br/>assist ratepayers facing financial difficulties. We have witnessed job losses in our country due 
<br/>to  the  pandemic.  Hence,  the  plan  will  accommodate  those  financially  affected,  given  that 
<br/>ratepayers liaise with their relevant Councils on the way forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ease the burden of rates arrears, the Ministry of Local Government has provided three rates 
<br/>amnesty periods (one in 2017 and two in 2019).  During the amnesty period, all compound 
<br/>interest on arrears was waived, if any residential ratepayer paid their principal amount of rates in 
<br/>the given time. This arrangement allowed residential ratepayers to pay off their principal rates 
<br/>in arrears and at the same time, enabled Municipal Councils to clear their books. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government intends to provide rates amnesty in 2023, which will be in 
<br/>two  phases.  This  will  be  submitted  to  Cabinet  in  the  next  Sitting  for  consideration.  
<br/>Furthermore, the Ministry has been continually providing waiver on interest and rates for cases 
<br/>where ratepayers have been facing genuine hardship as per the Local Government Act 1972. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Councils are now improving in their rates collection after recovering from the pandemic. 
<br/>The Councils overall have managed to collect 74 percent from the current rates billing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry together with the 13 Municipal Councils, conducted a Rates Profiling exercise to 
<br/>ascertain the total outstanding rates and to identify the challenges in rates recovery processes 
<br/>faced by the Councils. By identifying these challenges, the Councils have been working on 
<br/>strategies to improve rates recovery and enforcement powers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rates Profiles compiled by the Councils will provide important data to the Ministry to 
<br/></span><span>provide policy direction to the Municipality on rates recovery. The provisions will have simple 
<br/></span><span>and practical methods to collect rates arrears and interests therein. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Councils have implemented strategies to encourage rates payments and they include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●  </span><span>Extension in the discount period (5 percent to 7 percent). 
<br/></span><span>●  </span><span>Payment of rates by installments under an agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>iv.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●  </span><span>Liaising with the Ministry of Lands and Housing Authority as landlords of large 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>number of ratable lots. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Issuing reminder notices once invoices are raised (quarterly basis). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●  </span><span>Online payment is already in place on MPAiSA platform and with BSP Bank. 
<br/></span><span>● 
<br/>●  </span><span>Attornment of lease – relevant to commercial properties. 
<br/></span><span>●  </span><span>Small Claim Tribunal – less than $5,000. 
<br/></span><span>●  </span><span>Placing of charge or caveats on properties. 
<br/></span><span>●  </span><span>Deduction at source (payroll). 
<br/></span><span>●  </span><span>Arrangements with law firms (transfer of properties to settle rates). 
<br/></span><span>●  </span><span>Arrangements with Banks (client to arrange settlement of rates whilst seeking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>loans). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●  </span><span>Online banking options and MPAiSA agreement to be drawn with Vodafone and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Banks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>●  </span><span>Legal actions to recover rates, for example, sale of properties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, positive steps have been taken by the Councils to ensure that all developers 
<br/>will now be required to clear their rates owed to the Council prior any further development 
<br/>being approved. This is now a mandatory check prior to accepting building applications.
