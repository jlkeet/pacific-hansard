<div><span>Deteriorating Road Conditions – Northern Division 
<br/>(Question No. 30/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works  and  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on how and when will the Government address the deteriorating 
<br/>road conditions experienced around the country - in places such as Natewa West Roads, the 
<br/>Natewa  East  Roads,  Buca  Bay  and  Natewa/Tunuloa  Road,  Nabalebale  to  Kubulau  Road, 
<br/>Naikawaga  Road,  the  Hibiscus  Highway  from  Labasa  to  Savusavu  (and  the  one  from 
<br/>Savusavu to Labasa via the Wainigadru route) and the Nadi to Lautoka Highway? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  answer  the  question  from  the 
<br/>honourable Member, not really from him maybe the honourable Prime Minister and Mr. Speaker 
<br/>will also be listening to my answer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question specifies mainly roads in the Northern and the Western Divisions.  The  Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority (FRA) is currently undertaking a feasibility study in the Northern Division to check 
<br/>on  the  viability  of  projects.    Pre-feasibility  study  includes  determination  of  technical,  economic, 
<br/>environmental,  social  and  gender,  land  acquisition  and  other  resettlement  aspects  regarding  the 
<br/>construction of roads. All roads mentioned are in the FRA’s planning and design phases in terms of 
<br/>major  improvements.    There  are  usually  four  phases  that  are  undertaken  by  FRA  on  road 
<br/>construction - planning and design, procurement, construction and the last phase being operation 
<br/>and maintenance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of unsealed roads, these will be looked through in terms of routine maintenance and 
<br/>normally it is monthly and secondary routes in a span of two to three months.  For sealed roads, 
<br/>there  is  a  rip  and  remake  treatment,  as  you  already  know,  which  was  undertaken  from  the  last 
<br/>Government and is continuing.  Sir, FRA will continue with this aggressive maintenance, especially 
<br/>after the Budget, and joint and better efforts to address the urgent needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  specific  roads  mentioned  from  Natewa  West  Road  to  Naikawaga,  these  are  all 
<br/>currently accessible and undergoing maintenance. Under the revamped Public Works Department 
<br/>(PWD), we will undergo full rehabilitation of all rural roads during the next four years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Hibiscus Highway, this is fully opened and following the routine maintenance, but as 
<br/>stated, we had issues regarding the FijiFirst budget, but this is being rejigged to cater for the ongoing 
<br/>situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Nadi to Lautoka Highway, we have rectified the Saweni-Lautoka stretch which has 
<br/>been  a subject  of a lot of complaints and also Nadi  is  currently being  worked on, especially  the 
<br/></span><span>roundabout in front of the temple and a few other key areas.  I will be following up on that personally 
<br/></span><span>in terms of those areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I will also declare my interest, I was born and bred in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lautoka, so I am going to ask a supplementary question regarding the Nadi-Lautoka Highway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just quickly, honourable Minister, the FRA was engaged in a rip and remake programme and
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just quickly, honourable Minister, the FRA was engaged in a rip and remake programme and 
<br/>there are also plans afoot and in place with respect to the four-lane that was going to be done between 
<br/>Nadi and Lautoka, considering there is quite a substantial amount of traffic that now actually travel 
<br/>between Nadi and Lautoka.  Will the Government continue with the rip and remake between Nadi 
<br/>and Lautoka, or are we going to be going ahead with the four-lane highway that was scheduled to 
<br/>happen between Nadi and Lautoka? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously, the rip and remake will continue.  
<br/>On  the  four-lane  highway,  as  I  have  mentioned,  the  feasibility  study  is  still  being  carried  out, 
<br/>continuing from what the FijiFirst Government promised.  I am commending you for that, but we 
<br/>will continue that work, given the economic aspects in terms of that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just emphasise in terms of FRA, they had a budget of $365 million, but most of that 
<br/>was expended for December.  In terms of maintenance, it should have been $100 million but only 
<br/>$70 million was budgeted for and not only that, $25 million had been spent on emergency works in 
<br/>the previous year which was supposed to offset in this financial year which it did not happen. Those 
<br/>are some of the legacy issues which, I as Minister, have inherited.  We are working on addressing 
<br/>those.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also mention by the FijiFirst Government before the Election that there will be a 
<br/>supplementary budget on the road rehabilitation and contractual obligations, assuming that you will 
<br/>win the Elections, but you did not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They did not win, Sir.  They had the wrong assumption in terms of that and overspent, so 
<br/>now we have to struggle.  Anyway, we are rectifying that and as you have mentioned, we will take 
<br/>it and address it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  has  spoken  about  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supplementary budget, likewise, I would like to ask, where is the mini-budget?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Address the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Coming  to  it,  do  not  worry.    Can  the  honourable  Minister  inform 
<br/>Parliament whether the roads within the Municipalities are still under Fiji Roads Authority (FRA)?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Prof. B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Can you keep shut, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, please, warn him!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  why  I  brought  this  matter  to  the  attention  of  Parliament  is 
<br/>because it seems that no one is bothered to repair the damaged roads within Municipalities.   It is 
<br/>more or less a blame game.   I just want to know whether it is still under FRA, and they will continue 
<br/>repairing the roads, or no?   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>647 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, did you get the question that was raised?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yes,  I  understood  the  question.    The 
<br/>arrangement when the FRA was set up was for them to cover the Municipalities and Municipalities 
<br/>to refund the cost to FRA. FijiFirst was supposed to do that, but they did not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, to continue, with the Coalition Government bringing back Municipal Council elections, 
<br/>that will be the start of the process  - to rectify that issue regarding  municipal roads.  So, again, 
<br/>another legacy issue which is on my table to fix.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say to the honourable Minister, it is not 
<br/>an  issue  related  to  FijiFirst  budget  or  what  we  promised  or  winning  the  elections,  you  are  in 
<br/>Government, you are in control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Everyone is looking up to the Minister to get the job fixed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know these road conditions before we handed 
<br/>over in December, because I am from the North too as you know.  My question is, the children in 
<br/>Adi Eleni District School</span><span>,</span><span> that is, between Wainunu and Kubulau are walking kilometres to get to 
<br/>school, when will you get that fixed?  This is just one of them.  We do not want to hear about the 
<br/>plans that you have, those are long term projects, but get those ones that need to be fixed to be fixed 
<br/>now.  When are you going to fix it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mentioned yesterday, they do not seem to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understand the organisational and change process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, they buggered-up the budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And that is what we are trying to fix, and now we are fixing it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- You know very well it was good before you came in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- On that particular issue, yes, that is an existing issue and it 
<br/>involves a major slip and FRA is already working on it.  There are geo-technical issues there so it is 
<br/>just not a small and simple slip, and definitely I will be following up on that.

<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the deteriorating road condition is due to the 
<br/>Coalition Government, not doing proper consultation and I will give an example.  For the Natewa 
<br/>West Coast Road… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  …the  main  FRA  contractor  in  Vanua  Levu  is  Fair  Deal 
<br/>Earthmoving Contractors Limited and the sub-contractors are Kashmir Civil Construction and Bula 
<br/>Contractors Limited.   The issue is, the honourable Minister did not consult with the main contractor 
<br/>and the sub-contractors.  Now, the subcontractors are not getting jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They had depots there that fixed those roads, now all those depots are closed, and all the sub-
<br/>contractors have moved back to Labasa. Why did the honourable Minister not do proper consultation 
<br/>with FRA and the main contractor in Vanua Levu, Fair Deal Earthmoving Contractors Limited with 
<br/>the sub-contractors who maintained those untarsealed roads?  Why?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Long winded one but he ended up by asking a question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of basic legal understanding, you 
<br/>have a contract  and there is  a sub-contract  to  the main contract  and under that there are sub sub 
<br/>contracts.  As a Minister, I cannot interfere because that was …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Point of Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Let the honourable Minister finish his reply, honourable Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Because that would constitute abuse of office, and I do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>want,  after four years, when you come into government you might investigate me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am proceeding very carefully with these contracts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- No, no, the work is being done, but the original problem is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you.  You spent most of the budget on campaigning, that is the problem.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On fixing roads where your voters were, that was the problem and that is why the budget is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>buggered up.  We are fixing it with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think the second Oral Question has lapsed since the author of the question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is not present today and now we will move right onto the third Oral Question for today.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>649 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Funding for New Ministries 
<br/>(Question No. 32/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics inform Parliament on how the Government 
<br/>is funding the new Ministries and Departments for which there was no specific budgetary 
<br/>allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>the question.  In fact, Mr.  Speaker, this question is really based on a lack of understanding of the 
<br/>Financial Management Act of 2004, so let me contextualise the issue by quoting a few sections of 
<br/>the Financial Management Act of 2004.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Reallocation of appropriations on assignment of government business  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21.  (1) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If ministerial responsibility is assigned by a ministerial assignment in a way that 
<br/>is not reflected in the most recent Annual Appropriation Act or in the budget 
<br/>estimates tabled with the Bill for that Act, the Minister may authorise amounts 
<br/>appropriated by that Act to be reallocated - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>to  new  heads  of  appropriation  and  appropriation  categories  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>administered by the same or different budget sector agencies; or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>between  existing  heads  of  appropriation  and  appropriation  categories  to  be 
<br/>administered by the same or different budget sector agencies, or both, in order 
<br/>to reflect the new assignment of ministerial responsibility.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sub-section (5) states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(5)  In this section -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ministerial assignment" means an assignment by the President of responsibility 
<br/>to a Minister under section 103 of the Constitution.”</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, section 22 of Act which deals with the redeployment of appropriation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“</span><span>(1)   The  Minister  may,  with  the  approval  of  Cabinet,  authorise  the  redeployment  of 
<br/>amounts  appropriated  by  the  most  recent  Annual  Appropriation  Act  for 
<br/>administration  by  the  Ministry  to  the  heads  of  appropriation  and  appropriation 
<br/>categories to be administered by one or more other budget sector agencies.”</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In simple terms, this means that with Cabinet approval, budgeted funds can be moved across 
<br/>appropriation  Heads  or  Ministries.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  line  with  section  7  of  the  Act,  the 
<br/></span><span>financial responsibility of every Head or appropriation is under the management of the head of the 
<br/></span><span>agency referred to as the responsible officer and in most cases, these are the respective Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the appointment of the Coalition Government, the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister assigned various ministerial portfolios to each one of us, including some reshuffle of certain 
<br/>programmes  to  different  Ministries.    This  happens  every  now  and  then.    The  honourable  Prime 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister  has  the  prerogative,  even  with  the  existing  Appropriation  Act,  to  assign  ministerial 
<br/>responsibilities and change from one to the other.  For example, the Department of Public Enterprises 
<br/>and Climate Change was moved from the Ministry of Finance (formerly Ministry of Economy) to 
<br/>the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.    Similarly,  from  the  former  Ministry  of  Waterways  and 
<br/>Environment, the Department of Environment was moved to the Office of the Prime Minister while 
<br/>the Department of Waterways, Sir, was moved to the Ministry of Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  apart  from the movement of programmes, the Ministry of Tourism and 
<br/>Civil  Aviation  was  created  as  a  new  Ministry  which  included  the  merger  of  the  Departments  of 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation, and we are happy that it is now a full-fledged Ministry.  Similarly, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Multi-Ethnic Affairs was included as part of the Ministry of Sugar to become the Ministry 
<br/>of  Sugar  and  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs.    So,  how  do  we  operationalise  these  changes,  which  means 
<br/>change in financial responsibility?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  to  earlier,  there  are  adequate  provisions  in  the  Financial 
<br/>Management  Act  to  operationalise  the  changes  in  ministerial  responsibilities  and  align  financial 
<br/>responsibilities with ministerial assignments.  As such, we have managed to effectively change the 
<br/>reporting lines and responsibilities for programmes that have been affected and eventually in the 
<br/>new budget, we will fully move these programmes under the appropriate Ministries and Heads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, within the first month in Government, we undertook a redeployment of 
<br/>$100 million which catered for almost $44 million towards the $200 Back to School payment which 
<br/>benefited 222,000 students throughout the country at a very appropriate and critical time where the 
<br/>parents and students needed support.  We got a lot of positive feedback from people throughout the 
<br/>country that, that money was used properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $10 million as first tranche of payment to USP was done, $7.5 million was also put aside 
<br/>to extend the 10 percent bus fare reduction for six months from February to July 2023 (the previous 
<br/>Government had allocated it until February and I know why), additional funding for the Fiji Roads 
<br/>Authority  (FRA)  and  other  funding  allocations  to  meet  some  of  the  immediate  priorities  of  the 
<br/>Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as pointed out by the honourable Minister, there was an allocation for FRA - 
<br/>$200 million for the whole, apart from the ones that we had to borrow.  That $200 million was spent 
<br/>in six months.  By 31st December, they had used all the money because they were campaigning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He yells because he knows that is what he was doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Talk about yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  newly-established  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/></span><span>Aviation  is  operating  on  the  current  financial  year  budgetary  allocation  of  $35.2  million.    This 
<br/></span><span>includes  a total  of $30.3 million allocated to  the Department  of Tourism and $4.9 million to  the 
<br/>Department of Civil Aviation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  slightly  different  from  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs had no budgetary allocation when it was formed and as such, its 
<br/>operations are currently funded from the Ministry of Sugar’s budget, and the honourable Minister is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>651 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>preparing all the responsibilities and briefs and aligning it for the next budget so that the Ministry of 
<br/>Multi-Ethnic Affairs within the Ministry of Sugar and Multi-Ethnic Affairs will get the appropriate 
<br/>budget.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, we are also redeploying staff, Mr. Speaker, within the Civil Service to ensure 
<br/>that  the  Ministries  are  adequately  staffed  to  effectively  deliver  on  Government  priorities.    For 
<br/>example, certain staff from within the Corporate and Human Resources Division under the Ministry 
<br/>of Waterways and Environment are being transferred to the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs because 
<br/>the Ministry of Waterways is merged with the Ministry of Agriculture, and Environment is shifted 
<br/>to the Office of the Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are being efficient and smart about resource allocation and see how best 
<br/>we can cater within the available resources before mobilizing new resources.  And as I have pointed 
<br/>out, there were a lot of things happening within the Civil Service in terms of appointments, in terms 
<br/>of the appropriate budget, so the responsibility of the Ministry of Civil  Service now is under the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Public  Service  Commission  is  being  revamped.  They  are  taking  a  handle  on 
<br/>appointments  and  looking  at  appropriateness,  not  only  the  number,  but  the  effectiveness  of  staff 
<br/>within the Civil Service.  This is important, Sir, as we have to learn to actually live within our means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I want to say in response to the question that we have already 
<br/>started preparations for the next Budget.  We will be receiving submissions from different Ministries 
<br/>by 6</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2023. We are also receiving a lot of submissions from the private sector, civil society, 
<br/>youth, women’s groups, trade unions and the general public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiscal Review Committee is doing its work and, obviously, all these works will feed into 
<br/>the National Economic Summit, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will give a Ministerial Statement on the Summit 
<br/>next week, so that is how we have managed these things. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you for the response, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  
<br/>We have heard you - you have stated about the $400 million allocation and where you are deploying 
<br/>those funds.  But one thing that I did not hear in your answer this morning is from which allocation 
<br/>because deploying funds to another entity means depriving services, projects, whatever that have 
<br/>already been lined up.  We need to be clear on that because there are expectations and there are 
<br/>services that need to be delivered.  So, how do you prioritise those redeployment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  a  rather  new  question,  but  I  will 
<br/>answer that.  I think the question was, how we are funding new Ministries and I have answered that 
<br/>effectively.    The  question  now  is,  where  did  we  get  the  redeployment?    That  is  an  appropriate 
<br/>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  I can say to  the honourable Leader of the  Opposition and as my  colleague said,  their 
<br/>Budget was buggered, we have used the Financial Management Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that 
<br/>we  identify  all  the  wastages  and  where  the  expenditure  was  not  done.    We  have  seen  that  this 
<br/></span><span>expenditure cannot be disbursed or used in the next two or three months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had appropriate consultations with the Ministry, with Permanent Secretaries, people 
<br/>who had worked with them and they are the very same people who are giving us the advice that this 
<br/>money was just an allocation.  And some of the allocations, Mr. Speaker, before the Election, was 
<br/>all about campaigning.   They said, “Aww, we are allocating this much.” They made all these big 
<br/>announcements when, in fact, the money was not there.  I will give you an example, Sir, of what I

<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  if  they  let  me  speak,  they  are  becoming  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nuisance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is a very important point I want to make which I said earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You haven’t answered my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have answered your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If you heard, Mr. Speaker, of what I said yesterday about the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture’s budget, that for over eight years, the allocation was $603 million.  But 
<br/>what was actually spent on agriculture in those eight years was only $400 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what they were doing, Mr. Speaker, and this was like hiding from the public and lying to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them, you come to Parliament for the Budget before Election… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You’re full of drama. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- and you say, “We are going to do this.  We have allocated 
<br/>this much.”  But they actually knew that the money was not there, and they will not be able to spend 
<br/>that money within a year because nothing was planned and nothing was done.  So, it was all about 
<br/>political gimmick.  For them the Budget was a political gimmick. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last Budget was precisely that, and we are glad that we did not bring a supplementary 
<br/>budget because it gave us an opportunity to understand the mess that they made, and we have given 
<br/>ourselves time.  So, when we come into the next Budget, it will be a budget that will be transparent… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  It  will  be  a  transparent  budget,  it  will  be  an  appropriate 
<br/>budget, it will not be a political budget, as we did, Mr. Speaker, without deployment.  We put out 
<br/></span><span>that $50 million allocation to help our students not for politics, not before Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Soon after coming into Government,  we felt  the need, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>heard the people and we did that.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>653 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- A supplementary question for the honourable Minister of Finance.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do understand that the Coalition Government’s 100 day promises is just around 
<br/>the corner but what else is around the corner is April Fool’s Day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our people have greatly suffered during the pandemic and the ramifications 
<br/>and consequences is still felt.  However, the honourable Minister of Finance  had gone about the 
<br/>redeployment of funds.  But what funds does he have allocated for the next pandemic or any calamity 
<br/>for our people to sustain themselves?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  remember many years ago, one of my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>friends played prank on me on April Fool’s day.  So, I said to him something, and he said, “Well, 
<br/>only fools understand April Fool’s Day.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  But  let  me  answer  the  question.    The  question  from  the 
<br/>honourable Member was good, it was an appropriate question.  What is the Government doing to 
<br/>plan for emergencies?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 is one thing.  In this country and throughout the Pacific, we hope 
<br/>and pray for six months that we do not have cyclones and flooding.  There is always this impending 
<br/>threat on budgets, and I think the question is appropriate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Government, we need to look at how we can build into our budget or within the budget 
<br/>of the Ministry of Health,  and we must always keep that fiscal space to ensure that when we do 
<br/>have emergency, we will not end up with what we ended up with when the COVID-19 pandemic hit 
<br/>us because we had to rely on our overseas partners, our development partners, and we had to borrow 
<br/>more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to manage our budget in a proper way so that there is always fiscal space and if 
<br/>there is an emergency, the Government is in a position to borrow and the Government is in a position 
<br/>to redeploy funds immediately to ensure that we deal with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bus Fare Subsidy Scheme 
<br/>(Question No. 33/2023)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the Bus Fare Subsidy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I thank the honourable Member for the question.  The Transport 
<br/>Assistance Scheme is only given to those students who met the eligibility criteria or for those whose 
<br/></span><span>parents or guardians’ combined household income is $16,000.  The threshold of $16,000 was never 
<br/></span><span>formalised in the Transport Policy and this was only done through the Cabinet approval this year.  
<br/>The current scheme only allows students to use the subsidised bus fare cards from 6.30 a.m. to 9.00 
<br/>a.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Transport Assistance Unit at the Ministry of Education is responsible for registering a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>card for a particular student and sending it to the Education District Office.  The various District 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Offices then informs the school for card pick up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  a  particular  student  loses  a  card,  he  or  she  needs  to  get  a  lost  card  letter  from  the 
<br/>school, from the District Office or from the Headquarters.  This letter is then taken to Vodafone 
<br/>where students get a replacement card and Vodafone charges $5 for a second or third replacement 
<br/>card, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once a student receives a replacement card, the student is to inform the school of their recent 
<br/>card number so that the replacement card can be updated on FEMIS system which will allow the 
<br/>Ministry to top up and transfer funds to the correct card number.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The application for transport assistance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  done  annually  and cards  are 
<br/>topped up by the Ministry on a termly basis.  The number of students assisted so far in Term 1 2023, 
<br/>a total of 145,000 students have been assisted under this initiative.  Out of this, 70,000 students have 
<br/>been assisted with e-ticketing where 30,000 students have been assisted with Stage 1 fares, 26,000 
<br/>with Stage 2 and 13,744 with Stage 3 fares.  The other 35,000 students are those who travel by RSL 
<br/>and boats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are few challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding this assistance.  One is the lengthy 
<br/>timeframe that Vodafone takes to activate the topped-up cards which is three working days, and this 
<br/>is  what  we  are  currently  working  on  to  address.    Concerns  have  also  been  raised  by  parents  of 
<br/>students who are not able to travel on earlier buses, such as 6.00 a.m. buses because the activation 
<br/>time is 6.30 p.m.  Approximately, 2,000 taps for students’ fares are between 5.30 a.m. and 6.30 a.m. 
<br/>using unsubsidised cards because it is not until 6.30 a.m. when the subsidised cards are activated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In case of emergency and unforeseen circumstances that will lead to school closure during 
<br/>the day, these are not being considered under the current  activation period, and we are currently 
<br/>working on that to improve the activation times on cards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we wish to reassure the students, parents and guardians that bus fares, RSL 
<br/>and  boat  fare  subsidies  will  continue,  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  will  consistently  undertake 
<br/>monthly  reconciliations  to  reconcile  the  records  with  those  maintained  by  the  provider  of  the  e-
<br/>ticketing services, including the close monitoring of the utilisation of cards.  The necessary policy 
<br/>review will take place to enable a more efficient process, ensuring that no one is deprived of access 
<br/>to education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister explain how the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensures that the unused money in the card is returned to the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  not  had  any  experience  where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>students come back with unused monies on their cards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The bus fare scheme was rolled out by the FijiFirst Government.  Can 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  inform  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  plan  to  ensure  that  the  bus  fare 
<br/>assistance is not abused? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is not the FijiFirst, it was the Military Government that started 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it.  That is not part of the FijiFirst initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- But they are continuing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Seriously! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>655 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  Could I hear from the honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a correction, the bus fare subsidy started 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in 2009.  It was not the FijiFirst Government’s initiative, so it has to be corrected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the abuse, I think the honourable Member … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Who is providing the answer, honourable Minister for Education? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you.  Carry on, honourable Minister for Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- … as a former staff of the Ministry of Education, would be well 
<br/>aware of the amount of abuse that have been undertaken in the Ministry of Education regarding this 
<br/>transport funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question is probably relating to their Minister who had probably been sleeping on the 
<br/>job at that time.  I think we are well aware about those who have been referred to FICAC for such 
<br/>abuse and this is what the Ministry is trying to adhere to, to ensure that these events are not repeated 
<br/>in the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- You did not answer my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Already answered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Responsibilities – FRA to PWD 
<br/>(Question No. 34/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works  and  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on which responsibilities will be shifted from the FRA to PWD, 
<br/>and how will these be financed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the honourable Member had been paying attention to my response to His 
<br/>Excellency  the  President’s  Address,  I  had  clearly  specified  there  the  answer  to  his  question  on 
<br/>institutional strengthening and revival.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had mentioned that the focus of Public Works Department (PWD) will be primarily on rural 
<br/>development and connectivity.   Its responsibility will include the maintenance and upgrade of rural 
<br/>roads  and  river  crossings,  initially,  and  we  are  also  discussing  about  water,  electrification  and 
<br/></span><span>sanitation.  This is an ongoing process.  I wish to reiterate that this PWD will be a new PWD, not 
<br/></span><span>the old one.  The process of rural roads from Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) to PWD will be ongoing 
<br/>until this Government has achieved its objectives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have mentioned about the staff.  The fact of the matter about Civil Service is that they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been mentally imprisoned in the last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>656 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This Government came in to unlock them from their mental 
<br/>imprisonment.  It is a process that we are currently undergoing and that has been experienced in the 
<br/>whole Civil Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are ongoing consultations between the Ministry and FRA and there is agreement that 
<br/>rural roads will be an area which will be our focus.  You will also note that some of the roads are 
<br/>classified as non-FRA, so these are various roads, including approaches to villages, some of the farm 
<br/>roads, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  the  FijiFirst  Government  ignored  those,  and  that  is  what  we  will  also  be 
<br/>focusing on.  The total length of this is about 1,300 kilometres located mainly in the two main islands 
<br/>- Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, including some of those we have already mentioned.  We are looking 
<br/>into PWD now into delivering what we have been tasked with.  Sir, I also mentioned in terms of the  
<br/>process, you will understand that, Sir, and that will be included in the Budget process which we are 
<br/>currently undertaking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only that, we have also discussed with our international development partners and they 
<br/>are  willing  to  assist.    I  would  like  to  share  here  that  in  terms  of  the  FRA  Depots,  which  was 
<br/>mentioned, a lot of these are in neglected conditions and those will be reinstated, rectified and also 
<br/>assets placed in there in terms of quick response, in association with FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the issues that are brought up can be immediately addressed in a timely manner, 
<br/>especially for our rural roads. We have to be cautious of our school children who are struggling on 
<br/>these rural roads to get to where the bus comes in.  Sir, that is my answer to that question. Thank 
<br/>you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question in relation to the question 
<br/>that  I  had  asked  before.  Given  that  the  announcement  of  introducing  PWD  now  has  somewhat 
<br/>affected the FRA giving out contract tenders for unsealed roads, while we wait for PWD and also 
<br/>the re-establishment of their depots and buying of the machines to attend to the various roads that 
<br/>will be in their area, can we keep the current structure between FRA and the main contractors and 
<br/>subcontractors to maintain the current conditions of the road? What other systems do you have in 
<br/>the meanwhile before we wait for the re-establishment of PWD so that our roads are not affected 
<br/>and unattended? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is acknowledged and that is why I said 
<br/>that we will be working with FRA on that.  It is not that I have ignored the issue, I have actually met 
<br/>people  who  have  been  affected  and  we  are  working  on  that  in  terms  of  the  issues  regarding  the 
<br/>contractors.  Of course, as I have mentioned, it is not for one to replace the other, it is to complement 
<br/>each other, and that is why we are going through it carefully so those issues that you have mentioned 
<br/>can be addressed adequately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to add to that I wanted to mention that another area in terms of road 
<br/></span><span>construction was the quality of the roads. Before we used to have the PWD Lab, unfortunately, (I 
<br/></span><span>wanted  to  say  that  it  was  closed  by  FijiFirst  Government)  it  was  done  away  with.    So  that  is 
<br/>something we need to reinstate because at the moment, those labs are run by contractors and there 
<br/>needs to be independent analysis of the quality of the roads.  For example, one of the Engineers told 
<br/>me that they are using red basalt rock on the surface of the Walu Bay Road which that should not be 
<br/>used because that dissolves easily. So, it should not be used near the surface, but as a base.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>657 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Wrong material. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So that is the kind of testing which we need to do in terms of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensuring quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in terms of cost, I did my own research on some of the cost comparisons. For example, 
<br/>PWD  still  engages  in  some  road  construction  and  Irish  Crossings.    In  Lautoka,  they  did  three  - 
<br/>Koronubu Irish Crossing which costs $375,000; Benai Irish Crossing - $647,000; and Drasa Irish 
<br/>Crossing - $953,000.  So, the FRA contractor, the cost of one Irish Crossing at Paipai, Vakabuli, 
<br/>Lautoka was $1.6 million.  So, on average, PWD-managed Crossing without the contractors was 
<br/>$658,000.  So, $1.6 million compared to $650,00, so that is the kind of analysis we are doing now, 
<br/>moving forward in terms of ensuring cost effective use of taxpayers’ fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister, you raised a very general statement -rural roads. For someone who has worked in the rural 
<br/>areas, rural roads are categorised.  Can you tell me what are the categories and which ones will be 
<br/>priority to you as far as rural roads is concerned?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I do not have the categories with me but I know that there are 
<br/>community roads, farm roads and main access roads.  Some of that are managed by FRA, so what 
<br/>is not, we will be working for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. I.B. Seruiratu interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We will also tarseal the road to your village in the North so 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that will be priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  I  came  into  office,  a  number  of  people  have  visited  my  office  and  some  of  their 
<br/>concerns involve roads to communities where subdivisions had been done but there are no proper 
<br/>roads there.  So, I had visited one in Labasa where the iTLTB did the subdivision but there is a 
<br/>virtually no road but just a path.  So, we can work with the subdivision provider on that, of course, 
<br/>they need refund the cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, honourable Minister, for the answer. I think, perhaps,  a little 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bit more familiarisation with the rural roads might help with your answers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just quickly, honourable Minister, we understand what you said with respect to PWD, we 
<br/>understand  what  the  future  holds  for  us  with  respect  to  that.    But  if  you  are  going  to  be  doing 
<br/>primarily just rural roads (I see the honourable Attorney-General shaking his head) ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It could be expanded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- If it is, but for the time being, you are saying primarily it is just rural 
<br/></span><span>roads, it will still require asset purchase.  Will you be engaging in the asset purchase that will be 
<br/></span><span>required with respect to doing these rural roads because it is phenomenal exercise and a massive 
<br/>expenditure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, honourable Member, that is an exercise we are 
<br/>currently undertaking and one of the priorities is the equipping of depots.  We have already engaged 
<br/>with our development partners in terms of assistance regarding that.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen that the Australian Army has an agreement with the Republic of Fiji Military 
<br/>Forces in that regard, and that is also an area which we can partner in terms of optimising the use of 
<br/>resources.  We will also be making Budget submissions on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, it is a gradual process in terms of assessing the needs for a particular depot, 
<br/>the  population  and  determining  what  kinds  of  assets  will  be  placed  there,  of  course,  taking  into 
<br/>account the contractors who are already there, so it will be complementing each other.

<div><span>Rural Housing Assistance Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 35/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  update  Parliament  on  Government’s  intention  to  revamp  the  Rural  Housing 
<br/>Assistance Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question on 
<br/>the update of the revamped Rural Housing Assistance Programme.  As a matter of background, it 
<br/>was first established in 1976 by the Government of Fiji to provide affordable housing assistance to 
<br/>support the housing needs of rural and maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  had  been  administered  and  implemented  from  its  initiation  by  the  same  Ministry  until 
<br/>2018-2019 Financial Year, when the last Government moved it over to the Ministry of Housing and 
<br/>Community  Development.    We  were  going  to  return  it  to  the  schemes  that  used  to  be  provided 
<br/>before.  There will be three schemes:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme 1 involves the procurement and cartage of housing materials.  Applicants can pay 
<br/>for building materials through a deposit made into the Ministry’s Trust Account and the 
<br/>Government will cover storage and cartage cost of the building materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Scheme 2 is the construction of a 24 foot x 16 foot housing structure, through a specifically 
<br/>designed  funding  arrangement.    The  applicant  provides  a  one-third  cash  contribution 
<br/>towards the total cost of construction while the Ministry contributes the remaining two-
<br/>thirds of the cost.  It also includes completion extension of an existing structure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Scheme 3 involves the one-third component provided by the individual who is applying, 
<br/>providing the building materials themselves, and that is what we have worked out with Fiji 
<br/>Pine and the Ministry of Forests to help with the villagers or the members of  the rural 
<br/>community  providing  the  one-  third  component  through  providing  timber  and  other 
<br/>structural materials in-kind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, the budgeted amount that we have is already in place.  We are thinking of 
<br/>having about 10 established staff and 19 unestablished staff.  That is the planning that is going on 
<br/>with the $2.9 million projected budget - $2 million capital and $900,000 operating budget.  That is 
<br/></span><span>the planning that has gone into it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to the building code, will the Ministry 
<br/>also  provide  engineering  plans,  there  should  be  cyclone  resistant  structures.    Even  if  they  have 
<br/>already built the one-third and Government brings the two-thirds, will there be any standard that the 
<br/>Ministry will do as a compliance or requirement for applications?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>659 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/>All the plans that we have are going to be consistent with the structural standards.  I think one thing 
<br/>that we would like to be thankful for, in that last cyclone that we had, what we found that most of 
<br/>the structures that were built by the Ministry of Rural Housing using these structures withstood the 
<br/>cyclone that came, and we are very thankful that these structures have proven themselves.  Yes, we 
<br/>will continue with that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I if may just offer an advice on Scheme 3, before 
<br/>I raise my question.  One lesson from the past, and I ask that the honourable Minister consider this, 
<br/>when you Scheme 3, most of them build the house without a plan and then they come to Government 
<br/>to  complete  the  house.    If  we  can  ensure  that  if  they  build  on  their  own  and  then  come  for 
<br/>Government assistance, they must build according to a certified plan because of your DRR policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question is, just confirm you are now going back to the 24 foot x 16 foot plan, because 
<br/>when it was under the Ministry for Housing and Community Development, they had developed a 
<br/>new plan according to the Koroipita model?  I just want confirmation on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/>Yes, we are going back to the 24 foot x 16 foot plan, but also making sure that the structural standards 
<br/>withstand the Cyclone 4 category will be maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yellow Ribbon Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 36/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Justice  inform  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether the Government is still committed to the Yellow Ribbon Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it behoves me given how this issue was ventilated 
<br/>yesterday in terms of your direction from honourable Naivalurua and from the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister that this question is being asked.  Yes, certainly, so let me give some perspectives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rehabilitation is, of course, a key part of any justice system.  Yellow Ribbon is a very core.  
<br/>I need not explain again the history of Yellow Ribbon.  Obviously, you have been here for the last 
<br/>two sessions.  But if I may, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of those listening in today, just give a 
<br/>brief breakdown or history of Yellow Ribbon, which I did not capture in my response earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Yellow Ribbon is based on a model that was devolved in Singapore.  
<br/>The Yellow Ribbon motive was drawn from a song, </span><span>“Oh tie a yellow ribbon around the Oak tree.”</span><span>
<br/>The song tells a story of a prisoner who sought assurance from his wife that on his release, she would 
<br/>still want him to be part of her life.  He wrote to her saying that if she was still interested, she could 
<br/>let him know by tying a yellow ribbon on the Oak tree in the City Square.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On his homecoming to the ex-convict’s relief, there were hundreds of yellow ribbons on the 
<br/></span><span>tree.  Three lines from the song sums up the helplessness of the offender on his knee for forgiveness 
<br/></span><span>from the family and the community - </span><span>“I am really still in prison, and my love she holds the key.  A 
<br/>simple yellow ribbons what I did to set me free.” </span><span> Yes, it was launched in Fiji and sitting on the other 
<br/>side, the honourable Naivalurua, was the Commissioner then and initiated the process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But let me remind this Parliament that the initiation of the Yellow Ribbon comes from the 
<br/>passion of those who hold position.  It is not the creature of FijiFirst, it is the most humane thing one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>

<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can do when you have the passion to  serve, and that is what  honourable Naivalurua did.    It  was 
<br/>continued by honourable Vasu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  visiting  the  Corrections  Service  more  than  once,  I  would  say 
<br/>probably three or four times in my interaction with the Fiji Corrections Service.  That just goes to 
<br/>show that I am deeply committed to it.  I have also had the pleasure of as a civil servant on a policy 
<br/>level  looking  at  the  prison  system,  both  at  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  and  at  the  Attorney-
<br/>General’s  Chambers.    I  was  privileged  to  continue  that  capacity  as  a  presiding  Judicial  Officer 
<br/>(Magistrate) dealing with convicts.  I also had the pleasure in the last two years as a private lawyer 
<br/>to represent people who have interactions with the law.  Yes, they are broken people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On my visit to Naboro, this is what I said to them, “You are not here forever, it is only a 
<br/>short learning curve.  You will be released into the community.  It is very important that you take 
<br/>up the skills, learn from the opportunity and take it home.”  Yellow Ribbon provides that extension 
<br/>from prison as articulated by honourable Bulitavu.  The community, and may I say this, let us not 
<br/>be stuck with what the offender did.  When that offender is convicted, that is the end of the process.  
<br/>The prison system takes care of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One day at a time and hour, that person will be released into the community.  We must be 
<br/>grateful  with  open  arms  and  welcome  them  irrespective  of  what  offence  they  did,  whoever  is 
<br/>listening out there.  The problem we have here is, we have certain members of a community who 
<br/>have perceptions that certain people cannot be released even though if the law provides for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my duty as an Attorney-General, I am going to make sure that the lawful process must be 
<br/>complied with – no one is above the law.  The law speaks for itself, and we must respect that. It is 
<br/>important where people are making judgement on who should be released and when.  The law will 
<br/>dictate that process, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I invite here is our co-operation, your open arms.  We must be humane.  Our faith tells 
<br/>us that we must love them.  The principles of love as advocated by the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this country is filled with people of faith and let me say this, we should not be put 
<br/>down, let down, ridiculed on the basis of faith.  The honourable Leader of the Opposition is a man 
<br/>of faith.  In our maiden speeches, a lot of us do speak about faith.  What is the problem with that?  
<br/>Read your history. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Standing Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- 1835, so what I am saying is this.  All this faith, they encapsulate the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>principle of love and forgiveness.  Now, having said that, let me just go into ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I am just reminding the FijiFirst that they cannot take credit for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yellow Ribbon Programme.    You were in government, do your business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Are you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I am doing.  You are going to watch what I am going to do.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- You just sit.  You are not the Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Koroilavesau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Can he just concentrate his answer to the question?.  Stop 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>preaching to us, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Yellow Ribbon, if I may remind and honourable Naivalurua knows, it encapsulates four 
<br/>principles.  One is awareness, acceptance and actions; all of them summarise to what is love.  They 
<br/>are the Yellow Ribbon Walk as you understand, and I invite honourable Members, let us participate 
<br/>in this Walk.  Let us show that we care for them.  There is the Yellow Ribbon Employment Expo, 
<br/>the Expo was first convened in 2018 in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  objective  of  the  programme  is  to  market  the  skills,  competency  and  professional 
<br/>expertise of offenders to prospective employers.  Since its inception in 2018, FCS managed to obtain 
<br/>the support of 220 companies both in the private and public sectors and has secured employment for 
<br/>47 prisoners.  The challenge now is to increase the number engaging.  Mr. Speaker, I am asking the 
<br/>honourable Naivalurua and honourable Vasu who are going to assist me in this regard.  I am going 
<br/>to capture there the skills so that we can move on to another level as the essence of your question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other is more important which I did not touch on the other day, it is Yellow Ribbon 
<br/>Provincial Faith-Based Symposium.  This is where civil societies come into play and provide support 
<br/>to the Corrections Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  told  that  there  is  a  formation  of  a  Community  Actions  for  Rehabilitation  of  Ex-
<br/>Offenders  (CARE).    The  CARE  network  has  engaged  the  services  of  provincial  councils  and 
<br/>religious organisations to assist in the reintegration of ex-offenders back into society.  There has 
<br/>been a MOU signed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  note  the  provinces  of  Serua,  Namosi,  Rewa,  Tailevu,  Lomaiviti,  Lau,  Kadavu, 
<br/>Nadroga/Navosa have signed.  I note that Cakaudrove is not here, nor Bua nor Macuata – I encourage 
<br/>the CBM provinces to join.   As you understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of our offenders are 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, so for them to feel the compassion, and for us to show what we preach, we really should 
<br/>step in, and the provincial council is critical into this approach and likewise the church.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last programme is the Yellow Ribbon Sow a Seed Programme.  The Programme was 
<br/>launched in 2018.  It is a volunteer mentorship programme for young, first offenders between the 
<br/></span><span>age  of  18  to  25,  and  these  basically  are  young  offenders  (first  time  offenders),  who  come  from 
<br/></span><span>dysfunctional families.  This is a common occurrence in prisons, the systems betray these young 
<br/>people because of the circumstances.  This is a very positive project that needs to be encouraged so 
<br/>that they can come out and be a responsible member of society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have volunteered, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be the ambassador for this Programme because it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very critical.  It is important that we need to provide the opportunity, another good future, no one

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should be left behind and that includes the members who are in the Corrections Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, we all understand that the Yellow Ribbon Programme 
<br/>is about giving people, ex-convicts, a second chance of life and their successful reintegration back 
<br/>into the community.  My question is, are there plans to extend this Programme to those previously 
<br/>with conviction and discharged, who are seeking employment under the Pacific Australia Labour 
<br/>Mobility (PALM) scheme facilitated by the National Employment Centre?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Did you get the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- No I did not, can it be asked again?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  TUICOLO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  are  there  plans  to  extend  this  Programme  to  those 
<br/>previously with conviction and discharged, who are seeking employment under the Pacific Australia 
<br/>Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme facilitated by the National Employment Centre?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Yes,  if  I may answer, Mr. Speaker, because recently there was a 
<br/>delegation from Australia who provides employment for unemployed youths and I did explore this 
<br/>issue  with  them.    They  were  receptive,  but  the  mechanism  as  how  it  will  be  done  is  yet  to  be 
<br/>determined.  But that is a matter of principle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, it will involve the permission and negotiation with the Australian Government.  
<br/>There is also an issue, and it is a recurring matter.  If you have a previous conviction, we understand 
<br/>you cannot go.  Your previous conviction lasts for 10 years, so if you convicted those 10 years, you 
<br/>cannot go.  The current arrangement with NEC, if you have a previous conviction, even though it is 
<br/>over 10 years, you cannot go and that has been a subject of discussion with my Ministry and the 
<br/>Ministry of Employment because it is a recurring issue, especially so where people who have more 
<br/>than 10 years, they cannot go and more importantly those who are caught for minor offences – drunk, 
<br/>annoyance, curfew.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> from the villages, from Nadogo, Macuata cannot go because of curfew, and 
<br/>this is sad.  If I may, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of them because of the circumstances they were in, they 
<br/>were kind of forced to plead guilty because they were arrested in groups.  Lawyers were not allowed 
<br/>to see them, Legal Aid, there were like 30 or 40 contained in a cell for one or two days …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Which government, which government?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- The FijiFirst Government did that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is the police.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- And when they were produced, if I may … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do not pick and choose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  …  and  I  did  say  this  from  personal  experience,  when  they  are 
<br/></span><span>produced,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  have  no  other  option  but  to  plead  guilty  not  knowing  that  one 
<br/>moment or five seconds  of saying that will stop them from going abroad.  That is being addressed 
<br/>now for the simple reason we want our unemployed youths to go.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  First  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>response  and  his  offer  to  be  the  ambassador  but  normally  when  you  become  an  ambassador  of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>663 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something important like the Yellow Ribbon Programme, you have got to be outside the walls but 
<br/>you  cannot  be  an  ambassador  inside  the  walls.    So,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>commitment to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Yellow Ribbon Programme was imported from Singapore through the kind 
<br/>heart of the Commissioner then at  no cost  to  Fiji  - that  was in  2008.  Since  then,  this  particular 
<br/>programme has been developed, improved and it is now a Fiji product so to say.  There is also now 
<br/>a  realization  that  from  being  a  successful  rehabilitation  model  programme,  it  can  also  be  an 
<br/>exportable product.  Therefore, my question to the Minister is are there plans to export the Yellow 
<br/>Ribbon Product to other countries?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, no policy decision has been taken but I guess the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way to answer it, Fiji being the leader in the Pacific, there is no harm, we should.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Yellow Ribbon Programme is assisting a lot 
<br/>of prisoners.  There are two aspects of it - one is training the prisoners when they go out of prison 
<br/>on how to get accepted.  The other aspect is the community accepting them which FCS for some 
<br/>time has been having issues on how to go about dealing with the fact that there are communities and 
<br/>families and the honourable Attorney-General rightly said that they children from broken families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No matter how much we train them, when they go back to their broken families, they are 
<br/>actually in the same situation which led them to commit a particular crime.  So, are there any concrete 
<br/>programmes or if you are going to develop any concrete programmes to create this awareness in the 
<br/>community whereby the community starts accepting the prisoners when they complete their term in 
<br/>prison.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I will answer that from experience.  This is an ongoing programme 
<br/>but one would say, for example the Methodist Church because it is the largest denomination and it 
<br/>is all over the place.  They have monthly meetings, they have meetings on a quarterly basis.  Those 
<br/>are the avenues that can be used and obviously the provincial councils.  It is a problem that we cannot 
<br/>solve.  What we can do, we can reduce.  Unfortunately, some of these inmates when they do come 
<br/>out, will never be accepted.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament since  we have 
<br/>a short day today to prepare us for our End of the Week Statement.  We still have a Question to go 
<br/>and then we will return when the bell is sounded after 20 minutes.  Parliament is adjourned.

<div><span> Border Management Information System (BMIS) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 37/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration inform Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the current Border Management Information System (BMIS)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  her 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to put it simply, an Integrated Border Management System or IBMS is a system 
<br/>that consolidates all the necessary information for our dealings at the border.  This includes permits, 
<br/>border control visa processing, citizenship appeals, refugee management, passports, controversial 
<br/>list and payments processing for all these activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current IBMS, Mr. Speaker, that the Fijian Immigration Department uses was introduced 
<br/>in 2013 by a Sri Lankan company called Informatics International Ltd (IIL).  In the past 10 years, 
<br/>three components of the IBMS have not been operational and we are forced to do them manually at 
<br/>present.  They are refugee management, appeals and citizenship processing and certificate printing.  
<br/>In fact, in the last few days of the Sitting, I have been sitting here in Parliament to sign some of these 
<br/>documents myself, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2013, the Government has spent in excess of $2.8 million to maintain the system.  In 
<br/>truth,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  even  paying  for  those  modules  that  I  mentioned  above,  that  are  not 
<br/>functioning.  In addition, if the Immigration Department wants to make small changes to the current 
<br/>system, they must ask IIL to do that which requires an expensive fee and this is a waste of money, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, and I would like to inform Parliament that the Immigration Department is in the process 
<br/>of acquiring a new IBMS with the help from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also glad to inform the House that this will be at no extra cost to the Fijian taxpayers.  
<br/>The new system will be set up by IOM and then it will be handed over to the Fijian Immigration 
<br/>Department, who will then own the system in its entirety.  We expect the new system to be online 
<br/>by the late 2015 with an initial trial period where the old system and the new ones will be running 
<br/>in parallel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also placed greater emphasis to our border security and the security of the 
<br/>information that deals with that.  When I was in Australia in February, I had the opportunity to meet 
<br/>with  the  Australian  Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  the  honourable  Clare  O'Neil,  and  we  shared  our 
<br/>common concerns on data integrity and border control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outcome of that  conversation has resulted in  closer collaboration with  the Australian 
<br/>Ministry of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force.  In two weeks, Mr. Speaker, a team from 
<br/></span><span>both these organisations which include the Australian Border Force Commissioner will be in Fiji to 
<br/></span><span>do initial scoping work on how Australian partners can help us in this area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, and answer supplementary questions, may I just take this 
<br/>time  to  digress  a  bit  and  I  want  to  offer  my  sincere  condolences  to  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>  o  Lalagavesi,  in 
<br/>particular </span><span>na i Tikotiko e Vuniduva</span><span>.  I think the funeral service is being held right now for the late 
<br/>Ratu Epeli Ganilau and later on his interment at Vuniduva.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>665 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I would like to offer to you and the people of Lalagavesi, particularly the Ganilau family, 
<br/></span><span>ena i Tikotiko</span><span> </span><span> Vakaturaga e Vuniduva</span><span>, my sincere condolences at his loss and I am sure many of us 
<br/>in this Parliament have been affiliated to Ratu Epeli in more than one way or another.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  on  a  brighter  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  now  that  I  have  got  the  floor,  I  would  like  to 
<br/>congratulate my good friend, the honourable Seruiratu, on assuming the Office of the Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition.  By the same token, I would just like to add that seated right behind him is honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua.  Both honourable Seruiratu and I, were once carved by that old man. </span><span> Oya na kena i 
<br/>tukutuku ga va Waini‘eli</span><span> - old man.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But seriously, Mr. Speaker, and I am sitting here, you have come a long way and this Team 
<br/>A,  Team  Alpha,  Team  Bravo,  Team  Charlie,  long  way  back  in  the  1990s  under  honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua’s leadership and it is such an awe today, even for me sitting on this side, I know we are 
<br/>on different sides of the House but we share respect for each other in many regards that the captain 
<br/>has  taken  the  back  seat  and  the  crew  member  is  now  the  captain  of  the  ship.    So,  once  again,  I 
<br/>congratulate not only the Leader of the Opposition, but may I acknowledge that in very great part, 
<br/>the shaping done by the honourable Naivalurua.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, supplementary question.  You have forgotten honourable Naupoto. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The floor is yours, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Maybe today is Naivalurua Day.  He was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my Commanding Officer in Lebanon, a really tough taskmaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But thank you honourable Minister for enlightening us with the BMIS.   My question is, the 
<br/>BMIS at its current stage, does the blacklist or the watchlist system work well and is any of us sitting 
<br/>on this side in that list?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you answer that, honourable Minister, I just want to share a short 
<br/>story.  I encountered my </span><span>Tavale</span><span>, honourable Naupoto, at one of the barber shops here in Suva.  The 
<br/>first  thing  that  I  asked  him,  “Hey,  </span><span>Tavale,</span><span>  is  my  name  on  the  blacklist  or  what?    Thank  you, 
<br/>honourable Minister.  You may carry on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>supplementary question.  I, perhaps, will address later on some of the major gaps in the IBMS at the 
<br/>moment and one of those is exactly that, the blackholes within.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had people who have come through our border that the system cannot detect and 
<br/>through the intervention of other international law enforcement agencies, we have found out that 
<br/></span><span>they have already been  here  for quite a while.    I am  going  to later on,  maybe address  this issue 
<br/></span><span>differently.  I want to assure the honourable Members of the other side, there is no cause for concern 
<br/>on any other matter.  One thing I know that I only have the powers to reopen matters for prohibited 
<br/>immigrants, not for anyone that is here to leave Fiji or anything.  This information on individuals 
<br/>that is captured and kept by them - the Department of Immigration, is something that each individual 
<br/>can go and ask for themselves, but we can assure Parliament today that there is no cause for concern, 
<br/>honourable Naupoto.

<div><span>          Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his answers 
<br/>and, of course, for acknowledging the honourable Naivalurua as well.  But I also thank him for not 
<br/>revealing how we used to be back then as young Subalterns, and I have asked honourable Naivalurua 
<br/>not to share that information as well to the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  simple  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  and  maybe  we  seek  assistance  as  well,  the 
<br/>honourable Koroilavesau has raised a question about him being pulled aside in Nadi, going through 
<br/>Immigration.  It has happened to me as well, Mr. Speaker, when we went.  Although carrying a blue 
<br/>passport, I am still pulled aside at Immigration.  The same thing with Veena, when she was coming 
<br/>back, she was pulled aside as well.  She returned her diplomatic passport on the day she left office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the rest of us, we were awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but 
<br/>we have now taken the initiative to return it, although we kept it with us, but we did not use it.  We 
<br/>are  using  our  blue  passports  but  we  are  still  being  harassed  at  the  airport.    Can  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister assist in this, please?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>for his question.  Let me first offer my apologies for that.  It is not necessary, and no one should be 
<br/>subjected to that, particularly any Member of this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me assure the honourable Leader of the Opposition and all my colleagues on the other 
<br/>side of the House that it is not our intention to create any hassle for anyone and that really should 
<br/>not be the issue at all. I am sure there is some elements of confusion that needs to be cleared and 
<br/>this, I am going to look at according to the request by the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I 
<br/>apologise, once again, thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no other supplementary question, that brings us to the end of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Oral Questions.  We will go straight into the first Written Question.

<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice:

<div><span>Rates are an important source of revenue for Municipal Councils, however, over the 
<br/>past  years,  collections  by  Councils  have  been  in  dire  arrears,  as  reported  by  the  previous 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Reports. Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>The arrears of annual situation for each Municipal Council spanning the period January 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2007 to 23</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2022; and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry anticipates seeing some turnaround? 
<br/></span></div>
