<div><span>Oral Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on PALM and RSE Schemes 
<br/>(Question No. 11/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on whether the Minister supports the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility 
<br/>(PALM) and Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Schemes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Member for asking the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.  Sir, the short answer to that question is, ‘yes’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Minister, I do support both Schemes and I wish to further add that during 
<br/>this Sitting, there is going to be a detailed Ministerial Statement on that, and that is when all other 
<br/>clarifications will be provided and honourable Members will be welcomed to ask questions at that 
<br/>point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- A supplementary question, Sir; can the honourable Minister explain if 
<br/>the decision to remove the No Jab No Job Policy enacted by the FijiFirst Government in line with 
<br/>majority of the international practices at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic affects the eligibility 
<br/>of Fijians to have equal access to places on the PALM Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that is a new question.  I will answer it later 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Minister has stated that, that is a totally new question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It is not, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What are we going to ask?  On Monday when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I started asking the honourable Minister for Sugar, all was ‘new’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, all ‘new’!  What is going to happen to this Parliament?  As Opposition, we have the right to 
<br/>know the response from relevant Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- And I am here to guide us, that is my role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- So, please, accept my decision, that is a new question and you need to raise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it later on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Can I have another go? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  No,  you  were  given  one  chance,  let  the  other  Members  raise  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supplementary question

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will be looking forward to the honourable 
<br/>Minister’s statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the challenges that we have seen in the past for those people going overseas to work 
<br/>is sometimes the social issues that come out of it when part of their family is there and part of them 
<br/>is here.  Under the PALM Scheme now, they are allowing spouses to go across.  I am just wondering 
<br/>whether the Ministry has been tracking that and what it is doing about those issues when people are 
<br/>separated, and all the social issues arise out of that?  We did something, I would like to know what 
<br/>they did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I seek your indulgence again.  I had just stated that I 
<br/>am  going  to  deliver  a  full  Ministerial  Statement,  inclusive  of  all  those  issues  in  this  Sitting  and, 
<br/>thereafter, questions can follow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think we will take that as the answer because he is going to provide that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through his Ministerial Statement later on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very wrong, very wrong! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Premila Kumar, I have made my decision there, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, I apologise, honourable Koya.  He stood up first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Scheme  started  under  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.  Initially, it was Seasonal Workers Scheme, then it came to Pacific Labour Scheme and 
<br/>then collectively, it became PALM.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It started back in the 1940s and 1950s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Ahre bhaiya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- </span><span>Batao, batao. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are full of jokes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, from this side of Parliament, we totally agree that 
<br/>this is a very good Programme and Scheme for Fijians.  A lot of Fijians have actually benefitted from 
<br/>this Scheme by going overseas.  The issue that arises, Sir, from business perspective, since there is a 
<br/>lot of labour mobility - labourers are going to Australia and New Zealand, there is a huge gap that 
<br/></span><span>has been created in Fiji.  What is the Ministry doing, along with the Department of Immigration, to 
<br/></span><span>bridge the gap that has been created by our Fijians leaving to go offshore under this Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- </span><span>Ahre,</span><span> he told you the answer already. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our immigration laws, as far as foreign workers are 
<br/>concerned, are very clear.  We work with the Department of Immigration to facilitate any employer 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who applies to get foreign workers to work there, and they have to follow the terms and conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I have a very simple question, honourable Minister.  I am hoping that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you answer this rather than someone else.  Someone else seems to be jumping up on everything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister, one of your fellow Ministers has just mentioned to us earlier and has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also mentioned some figures in the press with respect to the number of tourism workers who have 
<br/>actually  left  the  country  and  it  could  have  been  under  this  particular  PALM  Scheme  or  the  RSE 
<br/>Scheme.  Those numbers came back as 14,000 to 16,000.  Can you confirm those numbers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  I  will  confirm  those  numbers  once  I  have  ascertained  them,  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Sustainable Tourism Framework 
<br/>(Question No. 12/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  development  of  the  National  Sustainable  Tourism 
<br/>Framework? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Member for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the last three years, we have been guided by the Fijian Tourism 2021.  
<br/>It is our national sectorial plan, sometimes we also call it a masterplan or the Tourism Policy Plan.  
<br/>The crux of it was to grow Fiji’s tourism to an industry valued at $2.2 billion by the end of 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I acknowledge the work of my predecessor, there were fundamental 
<br/>principles that needed more attention - principles such as inclusivity and equitability, and principles 
<br/>that matter.  These, coupled with our vulnerability, means that we need to look beyond immediate 
<br/>gains more seriously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Sustainable  Tourism  Framework  (NSTF),  the  successor  to 
<br/>Fijian Tourism 2021, will outline the strategic direction of the tourism sector.  At this point, I would 
<br/>like to acknowledge the support of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as our partner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  development  of  the  Framework  is  based  on  thorough  research  and  broad  stakeholder 
<br/>consultation and tourism-related industries, Government, Civil Service, Civil Society Organisations, 
<br/>communities and development partners.  I remind the other side of Parliament that the approach we 
<br/>take  is  inclusive  and  consultative.    In  fact,  I  am  hoping  that  the  Opposition  will  contribute  to  its 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Framework  will  clearly  lay  out  policy  direction,  development  and 
<br/></span><span>investment  strategies  and  an  action  plan  for  the  first  three  years  of  implementation.    A  key 
<br/></span><span>undertaking  of  the  Framework  is  to  gather  inspiration  and  direction  for  the  tourism  industry  by 
<br/>leveraging Fiji’s natural, cultural, physical and reputational asset base, as well as resolving challenges 
<br/>and building resilience to be more globally competitive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  first  phase,  we  are  undertaking  a  comprehensive  Tourism  Sector 
<br/>Assessment to determine the current state of the Fiji Tourism Industry.  This includes reviewing the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div>
<div><span>546 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current  laws,  policies,  plans  and  incentives.    We  want  to  ascertain  where  we  are  now,  determine 
<br/>where you want to be, what the challenges are and where the opportunities lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have established a private sector-led Steering Committee to oversee the 
<br/>development of the Framework and to provide technical contribution. The Committee consists of key 
<br/>partners, such as the Fiji Hotel and Tourism Association, Fiji Airways, Tourism Fiji, Society of Fiji 
<br/>Travel  Associates,  Savusavu  Tourism  Association  and  Suncoast  Tourism  Association.    And  for 
<br/>greater  coordination,  we  also  have  key  development  partners  who  bring  relevant  expertise  and 
<br/>independence,  such  as  the  Global  Green  Growth  Institute,  Office  of  the  United  Nations  Resident 
<br/>Coordinator and the Asian Development Bank’s Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, so it 
<br/>is quite inclusive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have recently concluded a series of 13 Public Private Sector Dialogue 
<br/>sessions.    The  idea  is  to  share  best  practices  and  gather  feedback  that  will  form  the  Framework. 
<br/>Topics discussed covered critical areas such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>diversification, not only in terms of geographical locations but the type of tourism that Fiji 
<br/>wants to attract; 
<br/>intensifying linkages between sectors to drive more economic benefits from tourism; 
<br/>creating inclusive workplaces for women and the vulnerable groups; and  
<br/>improved regulatory and institutional frameworks to improve the enabling environment and 
<br/>drive private sector growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following each session, recording is made available publicly on our website 
<br/>for transparency.  The Ministry has also activated a public consultation survey to get a buy-in from 
<br/>the people of Fiji because tourism is everyone’s business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, four focussed groups’ discussions have been held to verify data and discuss 
<br/>in-depth issues and opportunities in areas of conservation, agri tourism and tourism value chain.  The 
<br/>Ministry will also use a national economic summit to feed into the framework.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  intend  to  finalise  the  Framework  for  validation  by  May  this  year, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following which it will be presented to Cabinet. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must inform Parliament that this is something that 
<br/>was instigated prior to this Government and it was instigated, not really shelved, but we were just 
<br/></span><span>waiting for budgetary stuff to be done, and I am glad it is actually happening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the question here, honourable Minister is that, because this is actually a Framework for a 
<br/>national sustainable tourism, the establishment of this particular Framework will require evidence-
<br/>based  data  and  recommendations.    I  understand  what  you  are  saying  about  inclusivity  and  the 
<br/>question really is, how is this information being sought?  Is it just locally or are we actually seeking 
<br/>it from institutions such as International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO)?  
<br/>They are Observatories that actually exist, and they come under the purview of the UNWTO. That is 
<br/>such beneficial information to Fiji that it would be remiss of us if we did not tap into that.  So, the 
<br/>first question is, are we going to use that kind of information because these Observatories give us 
<br/>very critical information in terms of development?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, let me assure the honourable Member that every source 
<br/>will be used in arriving at what we need to establish as our Framework.  I just came back from a 
<br/>presentation by a Professor at the Reserve Bank of Fiji today - one of our local boys, and he presented 
<br/>and took another angle to our tourism, the challenge in tourism and we will use quite a bit of what he 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>547 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presented today. Yes, whatever source is out there, Sir, we will use it, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Airways  is  an  important  stakeholder  in  this 
<br/>Framework and I understand that when the honourable Minister was sitting on this side, opposed the 
<br/>purchase of Fiji Airways aircrafts. Can the honourable Minister advise us that if he would have sold 
<br/>the aircrafts or returned, would we have achieved the outcome of the Framework and would that have 
<br/>affected the tourism arrivals in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  that  was  a  new  question  and  also  very  high 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hypothetical, so it does not really deserve my reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, can the honourable  Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  inform  Parliament  of  the  participation  approach  to  the 
<br/>development of the Framework? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He’s already explained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R.  GAVOKA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  highlighted,  it  is  going  to  be  very 
<br/>inclusive and all private sector players are in this.  I have named them, and we have had 13 sessions 
<br/>of consultations across the country.  By the end of the day, it will be something that will hear the 
<br/>voice of a vast majority of our people - a little different from the way that the other Government used 
<br/>to do, like we were just told there is a masterplan and that it is.  This one is going to be very different, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inconsistency in Retirement Age – Civil Service 
<br/>(Question No. 13/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament why is there inconsistency in the retirement age in the Civil Service? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to answer this question, and I thank the honourable Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  do  not  understand  the  relevance  of  this  question,  as  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister had provided a very clear and detailed explanation during the post-Cabinet announcement 
<br/>in early July.  But just to help the honourable Member, I understand that he needs to be reminded of 
<br/>what the honourable Prime Minister said, who said as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The civil servants retirement age has been increased to 60 years and the contract-based 
<br/>appointments  of  civil  servants  has  been  removed  to  allow  for  permanent  contracts  for  the 
<br/></span><span>government workers.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also announced the revision of the retirement age of Civil Servants to 60 years and that 
<br/>was going to be effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023. He also announced that because there were shortage 
<br/>of teachers, doctors and nurses and we know mainly why, the increase in retirement age to 60, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, applicable for teachers, doctors and nurses was backdated to 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is, in short, the answer to honourable Usamate’s question and I do not know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what sort of inconsistencies he was talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his reply to 
<br/>the  question.  Obviously,  raising  the  retirement  age  from  55  years  to  60  years  will  always  be 
<br/>advantageous  to  those  who  are  already  employed,  it  gives  them  another  five  years.  I  think  for 
<br/>everyone that is  in  employment, such a policy is something that they welcomed, although not  so 
<br/>welcomed for those who are trying to enter the job market.  They would not find it advantageous.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have noticed over the past - I do not know whether it is this week or last week, we have seen 
<br/>that there is an intention by Government to also raise this in Local Government, I think, by making 
<br/>adjustments to the legislation there.  I realised that the Civil Service does not include statutory bodies 
<br/>and the Forces but there is also an important question of relativity of benefits across all those whose 
<br/>employment is funded by Government.  Does the Government, therefore, intend to look at how this 
<br/>new retirement age might be applied across all agencies where Government is funding?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, there are no inconsistencies.  The 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  would  know  that  the  Republic  of  Fiji  Military  Forces,  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service and the Fiji Police Force are governed by different Acts and so, that is something 
<br/>that will have to be decided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to Local Government, Mr. Speaker, the Local Government Act will have to be 
<br/>changed if we have to increase the retirement age which this Government reduced it from 60 years 
<br/>to 55 years.  So, the Cabinet decision has been made that a Bill will come into Parliament to change 
<br/>the Act so that Local Government workers can also retire at 60 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for other Government entities and public enterprises, they are all governed by their own 
<br/>Act and it is up to the Boards and those organisations to look at the retirement age on the basis of 
<br/>what they need and perhaps, take signal from the Government in terms of what is happening in the 
<br/>Civil Service.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  just 
<br/>mentioned in his answers that all the contracts are gone and permanent establishment because of the 
<br/>retirement age moving from 55 years to 60 years.  Can the civil servants of this country expect an 
<br/>automatic transfer or is there going to be a process whereby they are going to be given permanent 
<br/>establishment?  Can some clarity be given on that, because the contracts are already gone, so what is 
<br/>the next process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  unlike  the  previous  Government,  we  are 
<br/>going  to  strengthen  the  Public  Service  Commission  (PSC)  and  basically  we  want  to  ensure,  like 
<br/>before,  that  PSC  will  have  an  Open  Merit  System.    The  PSC  is  looking  at  how  to  deal  with  the 
<br/>movement of people from contract to permanent employment.  But the decision has been made by 
<br/>the Government that all those people on contract will become permanent employees, and the process 
<br/>will be determined by the PSC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do understand that to increase the employment 
<br/></span><span>age to 60 years, it is harder for the younger graduates to enter the workforce.  What is your approach 
<br/>to  unlock  youth-led  potential  and  opportunities  for  carbon  sequestration  efforts  giving  rise  to 
<br/>employment and greener entrepreneurships in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  kind  of  a  new  question,  but  I  will 
<br/>nonetheless answer that.  I think this misnomer or misconception that somehow raising retirement 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions

<div><span>549 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>age  is  going  to  create  more  jobs  is  actually  coming  from  those  who  do  not  understand  what  is 
<br/>happening in the labour market.  If you look at the trend around the world, the retirement age in most 
<br/>countries, even in countries like Papua New Guinea, has been raised.  So, Governments are looking 
<br/>at a combination of getting a system where young people can move in through internship, creation 
<br/>of jobs, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Creation of jobs is based on what is happening in the economy and the size of the civil service 
<br/>and the needs of different sectors of the economy in terms of making sure that the civil service is 
<br/>catered for in a way that supports that.  So, apart from that aspect of just looking at whether this is 
<br/>going  to  create new jobs  or loss of jobs, that is not  correct.    I think it was created by the former 
<br/>Government to somehow suggest that if you reduce retirement age, you are going to create more 
<br/>jobs.  It does not happen that way, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>First Home Ownership Initiative Assistance Programme 
<br/>(Question No.14/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the First Home Ownership Initiative Assistance Programme?

<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) 
<br/>on  Sustainable  Cities  and  Settlements,  Target  11.1,  states  that  by  2030,  ensure  access  for  all  to 
<br/>adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, and upgrade slums.  In trying to ensure that 
<br/>the  target  is  met,  owning  affordable  homes  became  a  global  challenge.    The  rising  prices  of 
<br/>purchasing or constructing a home was costly that it imposed pressure to the young and middle age 
<br/>income earners, hence renting a home was more economical.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the declining home ownership faced globally, solutions were fostered 
<br/>by countries on addressing the implications it had on the economy, resulting in Government seeking 
<br/>ways to effectively resolve the decline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a brief background on the Home Ownership Assistance Programme that was also done 
<br/>overseas,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  1</span><span>st</span><span>  July,  2020,  Australia  introduced  the  first  Home  Owner  Grant 
<br/>Scheme as a one-off grant payable to first home owners who met the eligibility criteria.  Accordingly, 
<br/>an analysis was recently conducted by the Australian Government to assess the effect of the scheme 
<br/>on the housing market.  It was noted that the First Home Owner Grant was an effective scheme to 
<br/>enhancing housing affordability for the first-time buyers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The First Home Ownership Programme was introduced in 2014…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  So, we are on the right path.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.-… to assist low and middle income earning households to home 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ownership.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- You can thank the government for the initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- To qualify for this Programme, the applicant’s total household 
<br/>income will need to be $100,000 and below or less if he or she is a Fiji citizen, above the age of 18 
<br/>years and has never previously purchased or owned a home in Fiji.

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  2014,  only  households  earning  $50,000  and  below  annually  were 
<br/>assisted with a grant of $5,000 to purchase their first home and $10,000 for those who were building 
<br/>their first homes.  Until 2018-2019 financial year, the grant was increased by $5,000 and expanded 
<br/>to include households with an annual income between $50,000 and $100,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Households  earning  $50,000  and  below  had  a  payable  grant  of  $10,000  to  purchase  their 
<br/>homes and $15,000 to construct their homes.  The newly introduced upper income range at $5,000 
<br/>to  purchase  and $10,000 to  build their first  homes.  The first  land purchase programme was also 
<br/>introduced with a payable grant of $10,000 for households that were purchasing their first residential 
<br/>land and were earning an annual income of $50,000 and below.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from August 2020, the grant assistance was further increased to $15,000.  
<br/>Households in the range of $50,000 and below were assisted with a grant of $30,000 to construct 
<br/>their first home, $15,000 to purchase, whilst households earning below $50,000 and $100,000 had 
<br/>$20,000 to build their first home.  However, the grant to purchase their first home remained at $5,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the inception of this Programme, a total of more than 3,149 had benefitted with a total 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pay-out of nearly $38 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- From this assistance, more than 1,800 households had their first 
<br/>homes constructed with a total grant pay-out exceeding $28 million and 1,200 households purchased 
<br/>their first homes with a total pay-out of over $9 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the current financial year, the Ministry has a total budgetary allocation of $6.5 million for 
<br/>the  First  Home  Grant  Programme  and  have  paid  out  more  than  $3.3  million.    A  total  of  183 
<br/>households have benefitted from this - 96 received grant to build their first home and 87 households 
<br/>purchased their first home. Sir, 110 households who were assisted were earning below $50,000 and 
<br/>the remaining 73 households were in the higher income range.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme is ongoing…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very good.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- …and the Ministry will be reviewing its policy … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We will expand it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- … to incorporate a monitoring and evaluation framework.  We 
<br/>will also be exploring - options are incomplete houses to support those who have taken the initiative 
<br/>to construct their first home and lack funding to complete them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir;  does the First Home 
<br/>Ownership Programme consider households who want to construct their first home on </span><span>mataqali </span><span>or 
<br/></span><span>communal land? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member, for a very good question.  One 
<br/>of the current criteria in order for them to qualify for the assistance is that the must have a registered 
<br/>title  or  registered  lease  or  certificate  of  title.    Households  who  want  to  be  assisted  under  the 
<br/>Programme to construct their first home on </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or communal land must provide a valid lease 
<br/>title.  This simply means that they need to get consent from, at least, over 60 percent of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>or landowning unit and conduct a survey in order to receive a residential lease.  Titles can be used to 
<br/>access this grant to build their own, addition to the remaining criteria.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another assistance that is also available is the Rural Housing Assistance Scheme which can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also be explored for those who also want to be assisted under Rural Housing Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I thank the Minister for his response, very honest response and to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How will the honourable Minister ensure First Home Ownership Assistance Programme is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fair and transparent?  That is the first part of the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Only one question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The second part of the question is linked to the first one, how does the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry ensure that the money that is given is actually used by the recipient?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I think there are two parts to your question.  The first part is on 
<br/>the  transparency  of  the  Programme.    I  think  the  Scheme  is  very  transparent  in  the  sense  that  for 
<br/>someone to qualify, there are certain criteria that are clearly stated for someone to qualify for that 
<br/>kind of assistance.  It is a very stringent criteria and it applies to all members of the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second part of the question is on monitoring, whether the applicant or recipient receives 
<br/>whatever grant the Government gives.  For the Ministry, most of the programmes or the grant were 
<br/>paid through commercial banks as well as other lending institutions, so that is the duty of the lending 
<br/>institutions because they also have very stringent policies in place.  They also ensure that before they 
<br/>give out  any assistance,  that the applicant  or recipient  adheres or complies  with  the policy of the 
<br/>lending institution and the money is used for its intended purpose.  We do not just give out money 
<br/>directly to the applicants, there is a system that one has to go through in order to obtain grant from 
<br/>the Government.  So, we have lending institutions where money is paid to ensure that it reaches and 
<br/>meets the purpose the grant is meant for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government initiated the very successful 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First Home Ownership Initiative Assistance Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What is the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I am coming to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Do not worry!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  The  honourable  Minister  has  confirmed  that  the  Government  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue with the Programme. Can he inform us of the demand for this Programme?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Thank you, honourable Member for the question.    Housing is a 
<br/></span><span>basic need, so the demand for housing is always there and it is the duty of this Government to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that we are also going to provide housing assistance to those who actually need the assistance and 
<br/>will continue to provide that assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, the demand is there, and the Coalition Government will continue to provide 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assistance to those who need to be assisted through the First Home Ownership Grant.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rebranding of the FBC Logo 
<br/>(Question No. 15/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  disappointed  that  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister is not here to answer the question, but I will go with any of the three Deputy Prime Ministers 
<br/>here.  My question is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  inform 
<br/>Parliament on how much money was spent in the rebranding of the FBC logo and explain 
<br/>how it came back to using the original logo? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer the question on behalf of 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister who had to go for another engagement, an urgent one. Well, I can tell 
<br/>the honourable Member that the cost was actually much less than the $207,000 luxury vehicle that 
<br/>was ordered for the former CEO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me tell say that the cost of total rebranding, Mr. Speaker, invitations, set-ups, logistics 
<br/>and evening client function exercise was only $26,800 - 12. 5 percent of the $207,000 for the luxury 
<br/>vehicle.  That is the cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Thank  you  for  your  response  but  you  really  did  not  answer  my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have answered your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You did not answer the second part.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it cannot be 
<br/>taken as supplementary because he did not answer the first question. Why did you go back to the old 
<br/>logo? That was not answered, and I am still on the first question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the question was,  how much did it cost and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>simple answer to that question is, it is the Government’s prerogative. This is a new Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Shame on the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- If you come back with something, we can change it again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Members are acting like a bunch 
<br/>of jokers.  I mean, they should have some sense to listen. They ask a question, and I am answering 
<br/>that question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. K.K. Lal interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- </span><span>Bhaito, bhaito.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hey, sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Lal, resume your seat.  You make so much noise.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>553 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are trying to follow the debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Member on the other side who is sitting at the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back is really becoming a joke.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. K.K. Lal interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, you leave that to me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What I am saying, Mr. Speaker, is that the rebranding was 
<br/>decided by the new Board which met in consultation with the Government and they had decided that 
<br/>they  need  to  restructure  FBC.    It  was  a  mess,  it  was  a  political  tool,  it  was  used  by  the  former 
<br/>Government as a political propaganda tool.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Forget about the logo, what a waste. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Government and the Board decided that FBC should be 
<br/>put in a new light. It is going to become an organisation that will become profitable under the new 
<br/>Board, with the support of the Government and it will become an organisation that people will like 
<br/>and understand that it is going to change from a propaganda mouthpiece of the former Government 
<br/>to a State broadcaster which is going to provide the service that the people of this country deserve.  
<br/>That is why we did the rebranding and that is why we did the restructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Short-Change of Cane Price – 2019 to 2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 16/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  update 
<br/>Parliament of the total amount short changed to cane growers from the guaranteed price of 
<br/>$85 per tonne of sugarcane in the three seasons from 2019 to 2021? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I thank the honourable Deputy Speaker for asking this question. Yes, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there was a short-change, but let me go back prior 2019 and start from 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017, the previous Government gave $85 per tonne.  In 2018, they also gave $85 per tonne.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened in 2019?  The former Minister for Economy said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“What’s new in this budget is that we will be setting up a stabilisation fund, funded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in partnership with FSC of $85 a tonne for all cane payment for the next three years.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, come 2019, instead of paying $85, they paid $82.21 - a shortfall of $2.79. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Shame on you people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- In 2020, they paid farmers $82.41, a short change of $2.59. In 2021, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paid the farmers $81.93, a short-change of $3.07 cents.  I will tell you what happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that case, the farmers lost $13.87 million and you fooled the cane farmers.  I am a cane 
<br/>farmer.  I lost $8,500 in the short-change. So, I will tell them, through you, Mr. Speaker, that a saying

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>goes that you can fool someone some time but you cannot fool someone all the time.  And that is 
<br/>why, Mr. Speaker, since they fooled the farmers, they are sitting on that side of Parliament.  And you 
<br/>will sit there for a term of…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  Just a point of clarity, the gesture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the honourable Member is unparliamentary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  You’re the ones who are shouting at us… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  He needs to control his gesture, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- …just let him talk! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, you have been in Parliament for quite some time now 
<br/>and this never happened before - this type of clapping, yelling, beating of the table, which affects the 
<br/>decorum of the Chamber.  Both sides are doing that.   I thought only the Opposition side was doing 
<br/>it but all of a sudden, the Government side was doing it as well. So, given that, we will just leave it 
<br/>there  and  request  honourable  Members  to  ask  relevant  supplementary  questions  or  otherwise  we 
<br/>move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I just want to inform the honourable Minister that the short-change that 
<br/>he has been talking about which he has not revealed was for the industry cost and that was paid on 
<br/>behalf of the farmers. Please, go and do some research. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Can you keep shut please, I am not talking to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Irrelevant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- My supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we are on the price,  
<br/>can the honourable Minister for Sugar inform this Parliament on whether there will be any top-up on 
<br/>the final payment of $6.85 because that is the time when farmers need more money to prepare for 
<br/>harvesting?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question.  I will answer that when he re-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>submits his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I was trying to ask you whether can you answer that, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or is it a new question altogether?  But now, you have jumped the gun as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, it is better we leave it at that, and go on to the next question.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reduction in Social Welfare Programmes 
<br/>(Question No. 17/2023) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty  Alleviation inform 
<br/>Parliament if the social welfare assistance put in place by the previous Government will be 
<br/>reduced? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. The simple answer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is, ‘no’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  A  supplementary  question,  Sir.    Recently,  the  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  made  a  comment  while  speaking  at  the 
<br/>National Federation Party’s Rakiraki Branch Annual General Meeting, that many of the 96,000 plus 
<br/>social welfare recipients should not be receiving assistance from the State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Assistant Minister to make such a comment in public reveals the … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What’s your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- …uncaring nature of the Coalition Government for the poor and needy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of our country.  My question is… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- …can the honourable Minister confirm whether a study was undertaken 
<br/>to  back  what  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation 
<br/>revealed publicly? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  again,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>supplementary question.  In fact, Sir, what we are currently undertaking now is a review of the Social 
<br/>Protection Programme, that is, in partnership with DFAT.  Already, Mr. Speaker, upon our inquiry 
<br/>into  the  beneficiaries  who  are  on  the  Programme,  there  are  beneficiaries  who  have  passed  on  or 
<br/>deceased, but they continue to be paid out to the beneficiaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  because  there  was  a  lack  of  monitoring  by  the  previous  Government,  we  are  now 
<br/>working with Fiji Care, and I want to thank Fiji Care for coming forward to help us with an online 
<br/>portal,  where  the  Social  Welfare  Officers  are  now  able  to  access  information  on  those  who  have 
<br/>deceased that have their beneficiaries come to claim.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that particular portal are information of the thousands of people who have been on it.  They 
<br/>can now provide that information so that we can remove the beneficiaries from the system.  That was 
<br/>not done by the previous Government, so there were a lot of beneficiaries who were receiving under 
<br/>Programme  who  were  not  being  monitored  and,  therefore,  Fiji  Care  is  now  providing  that 
<br/></span><span>information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, we have found from our beneficiaries that, yes, there are beneficiaries 
<br/>on the Social Welfare Programme who are able-bodied and are able to be employed. That is, in the 
<br/>full picture of it, is what the Ministry will undertake.

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  Social  Welfare  Graduate  Programme  which  the  previous  Government  did  not 
<br/>really explore which needs to be done.  It is part of the Ministry’s mandate to use the Budget to ensure 
<br/>that there are people in the Programme who are able-bodied.  Yes, there were many who were not in 
<br/>the Programme because of COVID but now, Mr. Speaker, we are out of COVID, there are now jobs 
<br/>available, we can train our people in the Welfare Programme to graduate out of the Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what the Ministry is now committed to do.  Yes, I support the statement stated by the 
<br/>honourable Assistant Minister because we need to move them out of the Programme and that is the 
<br/>commitment by the Coalition Government - to take people out of poverty, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You go and tell the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- …to educate them in the TVET Programmes that are now going to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be available so that they can be employed to fill the labour market shortage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  A  supplementary  question;  can  the  honourable  Minister  confirm 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether the figures that the honourable Assistant Minister mentioned is correct? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I think the honourable Assistant Minister said not all 
<br/>the 96,000 people should be on the Programme, she did not state an actual statistics, so it was not 
<br/>misleading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Listen to what she is saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, what is misleading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Member of the Opposition who had asked the original question and 
<br/>who has brought it now to the proper forum about whether we are going to reduce their assistance 
<br/>because this was not the experience during the campaign. I will tell you what the candidates were 
<br/>doing - they were going around misleading the public that we, as a Government, when we would 
<br/>come into power we would reduce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is what you people are doing now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- No one ever said - they misled by misinforming the voters. The voters 
<br/>came to us when we were going to meetings around in our campaigns, they were telling us and asking 
<br/>us  the  question,  “Are  you  going  to  reduce  the  pension  scheme?  Are  you  going  to  reduce  social 
<br/>welfare?”  We ask, “Where are these questions coming from?”  They said, “Oh! There are candidates 
<br/>from FijiFirst and they are going around saying it.”  Lying, because they were hoping to get … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Lying before the Election and lying in Parliament now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  And  even  further,  Mr.  Speaker,  during  the  blackout  period,  the 
<br/>Advisory Councillors were going around to tell people that this is what was going to happen - creating 
<br/>fear and intimidation and lies.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, yes, so they want to come and talk about an Assistant Minister who they are 
<br/>saying is lying and misleading? They were doing that during the campaign.  Yes, so that is a long of 
<br/>it.  We are not going to reduce it - stop misleading the public!
