<h3>REVIEW REPORT ON THEITAUKEI TRUST FUND BOARD 2019 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE   
<br/>ITAUKEI TRUST FUND BOARD 2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  Report  on  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  Board  2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report which was tabled on 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  was  established 
<br/>through the iTaukei  Trust  Fund Act  2004, to  provide financial autonomy to  the Great  Council of 
<br/>Chiefs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei Trust Fund was also established to foster advancement of indigenous Fijians and 
<br/>Rotumans by promoting initiatives that will better their standard of living and enhance appropriate 
<br/>cultural traditions and values.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fund  contributes  towards  boosting  the  capacity  of  Fiji’s  cultural  sector  through  the 
<br/>provision  of  scholarships,  especially  services  in  language,  culture  and  heritage  and  financial 
<br/>assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my sincere appreciation goes out to the Members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament on their efforts in scrutinising and compiling this 
<br/>Review Report and for tabling it to Parliament in August 2022.  Having said that, Sir, I also wish the 
<br/>existing Committee Members the very best in their Committee deliberations for this Parliamentary 
<br/>term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the scrutiny process, the Committee requested for public hearing, and also received 
<br/>written responses on the issues that were identified by the Committee, which were then clarified by 
<br/>the iTaukei Trust Fund Board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the cause of the Committee deliberations, several pertinent findings were 
<br/>made.  We  noted  that  the  Board  made  significant  inroads  in  both  organisational,  direction  and 
<br/>development. It achieved a gross revenue of $8.1 million and a net from operations of about $1.4 
<br/>million  for 2019, compared to  $3.9 million  in 2018.  The decrease in  profit was attributed to  the 
<br/>written down value of the burnt </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fund launched its Strategic Development Plan of 2019 to 
<br/>2023,  which  outlines  the  five  priority  areas  which  are  prudent  financial  sustainability,  language, 
<br/>culture  and  heritage,  communication,  leadership,  entrepreneurial  and  business  skills  and  human 
<br/>capital management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  also  pleasing  to  note  that  the  Fund’s  investment  continue  to 
<br/></span><span>satisfactorily  grow  during  the  year  with  its  investment  portfolio  continuing  to  generate  positive 
<br/>returns in funding the mandated objectives of the Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  has  highlighted  its  findings  for  the  Fund’s  financial  and 
<br/>operational performance for 2019, and subsequently made recommendations to improve its overall 
<br/>performance and continue to diversify investments both, locally and overseas.

<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends the team of dedicated and motivated individuals, 
<br/>who  have  worked  together  to  bring  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  Board  to  new  heights  through  the 
<br/>enhancement of its service delivery through investments.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I invite, honourable Members, I would like to inform the House that 
<br/>I have received the list  of speakers from both honourable Whips  - the Opposition and that of the 
<br/>Leader of Government Business.  There are eight speakers, and the order is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A. Tuicolo; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Ratu J.B. Niudamu; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Public Works and Meteorological Services, and Transport; 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; and 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  contribute  more  to  the  Report  before 
<br/>Parliament for debate on the review of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2019 Annual Report, at the 
<br/>outset, I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs in the last term of Parliament that comprised of the honourable Minister for Health 
<br/>and Medical Services; honourable Tuicolo; former Members of Parliament - Mrs. Salote Radrodro,  
<br/>and Mr. George Vegnathan and the Committee was Chaired by myself, in the effort of putting this 
<br/>Report together and subsequently table it in August of last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee requested the Board to provide an update on the </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span>
<br/>which was destroyed in a fire in December 2019.  The Board informed us that based on the fire report 
<br/>from the National Fire Authority, the Police had closed its investigations and plans were underway 
<br/>to redevelop the </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were informed that the </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span> - building with contents, was insured for $6.5 million.  
<br/>The insurance pay-out was received on 11</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2020, and this has been invested, while the 
<br/>Board was waiting for the commencement of the redevelopment of the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period under review, the Fund reviewed its treasury functions which 
<br/>resulted  in  the  renegotiation  of  the  term  deposits  in  favour  of  high  interest  rates.    The  Fund  also 
<br/>continues to diversify Australian investments in providing adequate return, despite the volatility in 
<br/>the stock market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Fund offshore investment, the Board decided for the first time to review the whole 
<br/>investment  portfolio,  to  provide  an  independent  assessment  on  the  effective  stewardship  of  the 
<br/>Fund’s investment.  The Committee had recommended that the Fund fast-track the implementation 
<br/>of recommendation by Mercer (Australia) to realise the effectiveness of the review being carried out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I wish the Management, Board members and Staff of iTaukei Trust Fund Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well and continue to generate positive returns in funding the mandated objectives of the Fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Report before us 
<br/>from  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs.    I  would  like  to  thank  and  congratulate  the 
<br/>Chairperson of the Standing Committee on her appointment and her team for tabling this Report.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would also  like to  thank the Chairman and members of the previous Standing  Committee for the 
<br/>Report that is before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Minister of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board falls 
<br/>under my portfolio.   The iTaukei Trust Fund, as was already mentioned, was established through the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004, to provide financial autonomy to the Great Council of Chiefs.  The 
<br/>Fund  was  also  established  to  foster  the  advancement  of  iTaukei  and  Rotumans  by  promoting 
<br/>initiatives  that  will  better  their  standard  of  living  and  enhance  appropriate  culture,  tradition  and 
<br/>values. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fund  contributes  towards  boosting  the  capacity  of  Fiji’s  cultural  sector  through  the 
<br/>provision  of  scholarships,  specialised  services  in  language,  culture  and  heritage  and  financial 
<br/>assistance.  At this juncture, I would like to pay tribute to our former Prime Minister, </span><span>Turaga na Tui 
<br/>Kobuca, </span><span>the late Laisenia Qarase.  His visionary leadership established the Fund that was envisioned 
<br/>by previous leaders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From an initial investment of $40 million, the Fund has expanded to its total asset of $323 
<br/>million in 2019.  The Fund stands as a testament on the ability of the iTaukei institution to manage 
<br/>its investment, given the right governance and support structures.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a special 
<br/>area that the Coalition Government, through my Ministry, would like to strengthen and grow to the 
<br/>next level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now address the recommendations by the Standing Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span> That  the  Fund,  through  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>  Fieldwork  Project,  continue  its  research  and 
<br/>documentations of distinct iTaukei and Rotuman cultural practices in Provinces and Districts, 
<br/>to help revitalise traditional skills and knowledge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fund continues to implement the Vanua Fieldwork Project.  The </span><span>Yasana</span><span>
<br/>(Province)</span><span> </span><span>of  Rewa  Vanua  Fieldwork  was  completed  last  year.    Documentaries  and  resource 
<br/>materials have been traditionally handed over to the </span><span>Gone Marama Bale na Roko Tui Dreketi </span><span>at the 
<br/>Rewa Provincial Council Meeting in 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the </span><span>Yasana </span><span>of Rewa fieldwork documentaries are currently 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being aired on the Fiji Television platform “</span><span>Na i Lololo</span><span>”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, the focus is on the Province of Tailevu and the preliminary work has begun.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intention is to roll out to all the 14 Provinces and Rotuma.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Vanua  Fieldwork  is  undertaken  after  the  conclusion  of  the  Sausauvou  Leadership 
<br/>Programme.    This  Programme  is  intended  to  equip  upcoming  traditional  leaders  with  effective 
<br/>leadership management and good governance skills.  The delay in the project was due to COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation 2</span><span>
<br/></span><span>That the Fund fast-track the implementation of recommendations by Mercer (Australia) in 
<br/></span><span>relation to the review of its investment portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an official delegation will be visiting Mercer; the Fund Investment Broker 
<br/>and Fund Managers in Australia to discuss the best way forward for the Fund.  The trip is planned 
<br/>for April this year.  The current value of investment in Australia now stands at AU$70 million.

<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>493 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation 3 
<br/></span><span>That the Fund continue to diversify its investment portfolio so as to generate positive returns 
<br/>for the funding of its mandated objectives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that the Fund continues to diversify its investment portfolio.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outcome of Recommendation 2 is expected to generate optimal returns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/></span><span>That the Fund continues to monitor the progress of the Valenibose</span><span> </span><span>Redevelopment Project to 
<br/>ensure works are completed according to the given timeframe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  update  Parliament  on  the  progress  of  the  Valenibose 
<br/>Redevelopment Project.  The basic design and drawings are in the final stage.  Once the full detailed 
<br/>drawings and costs have been finalised, they will be presented to the Board for approval.  Once the 
<br/>approval, the tender process will proceed for the appointment of the building contractors.  The Board 
<br/>will approve the awarding of the tender. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  construction  is  planned  to  commence  from  June  this  year  and  practical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completion towards the end of 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Board and the staff of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>excellent achievement and the positive impacts on the lives of those they serve.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the motion 
<br/>before Parliament for debate on the review of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2019 Annual Report 
<br/>which was tabled in this august Parliament on 30</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a former member of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs,  I too 
<br/>would like to thank the former Members of the Committee - the former Chairman, honourable Viam 
<br/>Pillay, the former Deputy Chairperson, Mr. George Vegnathan, the Minister for Health and Medical 
<br/>Services, Mrs. Salote Radrodro and Ratu  Tevita  Niumataiwalu  as an Alternate Member, for their 
<br/>contributions  towards  the  review  of  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  Board  2019  Annual  Report  and 
<br/>compilation of the Committee Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I must also acknowledge the Secretariat team namely, Sheron Narayan, Marica 
<br/>Tuisoso  and  Rupeni  Mudunavuku  -  for  their  dedication  and  support  towards  the  formulation  and 
<br/>completion of this Review Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to commend the work of the former Chairman of the Board – 
<br/>Mr. David Kolitagane, and the Board Members; the CEO – Mr. Aisake Taito and his team, for their 
<br/>dedication  and  commitment  towards  the  achievement  of  the  Fund’s  mission  in  developing  and 
<br/>facilitating initiatives that will improve the quality of life and enhance culture, tradition and values 
<br/>of  iTaukei  and  Rotumans  through  language  and  cultural  programmes,  leadership  management, 
<br/>entrepreneurship,  and  prudently  investing  the  iTaukei  Trust    funds  to  earn  superior  returns  while 
<br/>complying with the iTaukei Trust Fund Act, and to enhance the long-term value of the Trust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee made few observations and noted that the Fund achieved a gross 
<br/>revenue  of  $8,095,992  and  a  net  profit  from  operations  of  $1,438,770  for  the  year,  compared  to 
<br/>$3,984,876 in 2018.  The decrease in profit was attributed to the written down value of the burnt </span><span>Vale 
<br/>ni Bose</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the Committee also noted that the Fund’s investments continue to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>grow satisfactorily during the year. This was a direct result of the review of the treasury function and 
<br/>the  full  settlement  of  the  $8  million  loan.    Shares  in  the  RB  Patel  and  Fijian  Holdings  Limited 
<br/>increased during the year due to a share split. The Fund’s tourism investment at the Radisson Blu 
<br/>Resort Denarau business area continues to generate positive returns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee has made four significant  recommendations to  resolve issues 
<br/>identified by the Committee. With that being said, I would like to briefly speak on Recommendation 
<br/>No. 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/></span><span> That  the  Fund,  through  the  </span><span>Vanua</span><span>  Fieldwork  Project,  continue  its  research  and 
<br/>documentations of distinct iTaukei and Rotuman cultural practices in Provinces and Districts, 
<br/>to help revitalise traditional skills and knowledge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this recommendation is in line with the Funds third mandated objective in which 
<br/>the Fund sponsors research into languages, arts and culture of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Rotumans, and the 
<br/>better understanding and preservation of their heritage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the Vanua Fieldwork Project is to research and document distinct 
<br/>cultural practices and to produce educational  resources for  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  Research and documentation 
<br/>also involve the revitalisation of traditional skills and knowledge.  Community members, the men 
<br/>and  women  and  young  and  old  are  engaged  in  this  process,  including  the  Provincial  Office  to 
<br/>facilitate knowledge transmission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we live in a truly connected world, we can access any culture we like with the 
<br/>swipe  of  our  finger.    We  can  also  learn  about  traditions;  we  many  never  experience  first-hand. 
<br/>Therefore, Sir,  I totally  support the recommendation on the continuation of the Vanua Fieldwork 
<br/>Project and expanding the project to our Provinces and Districts as the exercise will document distinct 
<br/>cultural  practices  and  produce  educational  resources  for  our  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  and  Rotuman  brothers  and 
<br/>sisters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute and also support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion before this august Parliament.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to make a short contribution to the 
<br/>motion at hand.  I wish to thank the previous Chairman and current Chairperson and Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs for the report on the iTaukei Trust Fund Board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  thank  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr.  Aisake  Taito,  and  his  Management 
<br/>Team in the work carried out in 2019.  I note that the Trust Fund has carried a huge amount of work 
<br/>towards the effort of strategic investment and foresight in the development of the iTaukei Trust Fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  note  of  the  activities  of  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  as  defined  in  the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004, in section 4, prescribing the purpose of the Fund and the function of 
<br/>the Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note the third recommendation of the Report and one which the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fisheries and Forestry fully welcomes and support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, 
<br/>is  looking  to  establish  a  cooperative  collaboration  with  key  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of 
<br/>Cooperatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>495 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cooperative model is a proven one that has worked in many countries 
<br/>globally  and  one  that  is  encouraged  to  be  replicated  in  Fiji  to  empower  inland  and  coastal 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  establishes  a  structure  that  the  Ministry  will  drive  its  intention  to 
<br/>diversity from traditional agriculture, forestry and fish farm to a more integrated agro-forestry and 
<br/>fisheries farming.  The Ministry has launched its initiative model on the International Day of Forests 
<br/>on 21</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023 at Korotari Forestry Station in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are some investments I know that would boost household income and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic recovery and will interest more beneficiaries to further invest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to make my contribution to this motion, 
<br/>highlighting the linkage of recommendations in the Report to the work of my Ministry.  I, therefore, 
<br/>commend and support the Review Report to in this august Parliament.  Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  making  my  contribution  to  the 
<br/>motion  this  afternoon,  allow  me  to  also  pay  my  condolence  to  your  </span><span>Vanua  o  Lalagavesi</span><span>  for  the 
<br/>passing of the late Ratu Epeli Ganilau,  </span><span>Na i Taukei Vuniduva</span><span>, a well-respected and distinguished 
<br/>gentleman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Review Report of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board for 
<br/>the year 2019.  As the Chairperson of the Committee had alluded to earlier, the iTaukei Trust Fund 
<br/>Board is a crucial institution established in 2004 by the Fijian Government to advance the wellbeing 
<br/>of  the  indigenous  Fijian  and  Rotuman  communities.    Through  its  efforts,  the  Board  promotes 
<br/>initiatives  that  uplift  the  standard  of  living  of  these  communities  while  enhancing  their  cultural 
<br/>traditional and values.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 
<br/>and its CEO, Mr. Aisake Taito, for the various initiatives available to our indigenous communities 
<br/>and  one  that  is  really  delightful  is  the  leadership  training  for  young  leaders  in  the  indigenous 
<br/>community whereby the honourable Minister had already alluded to, the </span><span>Vuli ni Sauvaki ni Vanua</span><span>. It 
<br/>prepares our young leaders in taking leadership role in the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> and as we all know, the strength of 
<br/>the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> will depend on its leadership, and I am really grateful for that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Chairperson  and  Members  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee and also the last Committee for the preparation of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  express,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  gratitude  to  the  Committee  for  their  insightful 
<br/>observation  and  recommendations.    I  particularly  commend  their  proposal  to  fast-track  the 
<br/>implementation  of  recommendations  made  by  Mercer  (Australia)  concerning  the  review  of  the 
<br/>Fund’s investment portfolio.  This review provides an independent assessment of the Fund’s effective 
<br/>stewardship of its investment which is vital in fulfilling its mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mercer (Australia) review will serve several essential purposes.  Firstly, 
<br/></span><span>it will assure the Fund that its investment policies and portfolios are sufficient to provide maximum 
<br/></span><span>returns necessary to meet its mandated objectives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, it will safeguard the governance and stewardship role of the trustees as the findings 
<br/>will provide a clear roadmap for effective stewardship of the investment portfolio in the long term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, it will ensure that the Fund employs financial resources in areas that yield optimal

<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>returns while providing financial stability, growth and sustainability in the long term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am delighted to note that the Fund’s investment portfolio increased from 
<br/>$200.5 million in 2018 to $316.7 million in 2019.  The implementation of Mercer’s recommendations 
<br/>will lead to an even more significant increase in the Fund’s investment portfolio.  This will enable 
<br/>the iTaukei Trust Fund Board to earn superior returns while complying with the iTaukei Trust Fund 
<br/>Act.  Furthermore, it will enhance the cultural traditions and values of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and Rotumans through 
<br/>language and cultural programmes, leadership management and entrepreneurship.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I urge all honourable Members to support the Review Report of iTaukei Trust 
<br/>Fund Board for 2019 and the implementation of Mercer’s recommendations.  The Fund’s investment 
<br/>portfolio is crucial in advancing the well-being of the indigenous Fijian and Rotuman communities, 
<br/>and we must ensure that it continues to deliver positive outcomes for these communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  2019  Review 
<br/>Report of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board.  It is a key report in the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>governance structure and 
<br/>framework, and it is critical that we look at it in association with the other institutions which make 
<br/>that up - iTLTB, </span><span>Veitarogi Vanua</span><span> and other institutions within that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, let me ask the question, the other side of Parliament has always expressed the 
<br/>legacy of FijiFirst.  We do acknowledge that, but we also need to ask, what are the legacies they have 
<br/>not mentioned?   When we talk about </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> governance structure, that is a key question.  What 
<br/>have they left behind in terms of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>governance and development?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we read this Report, we need to look at that in consultation or closely with that kind of 
<br/>question.   I note  from  the Report the gross revenue has been mentioned  and also  the profit from 
<br/>operations of $1.4 million and the attribution to the decreased profit to the burnt </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span> or the 
<br/>GCC meeting house.   We, as a Coalition Government will be convening the GCC meeting, unlike 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government which removed it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the iTaukei Trust Fund, there is also an objective there of boosting the capacity 
<br/>of Fiji’s cultural sector through the provision of scholarships, special services in language, culture 
<br/>and heritage which is good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  scholarships,  we  know  the  key  areas  which  are  gaps  in  skills  these  days, 
<br/>particularly  within  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  communities  and  that  is  an  area  which  could  be  targeted  with  the 
<br/>revitalisation of that scholarship.  The other side of Parliament would label my suggestion as racist.  
<br/>It is not racist; it is a methodology of assistance targeting a gap in skills.  They have repeatedly said 
<br/>that, it is on the record.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other area is leadership, entrepreneurial and business skills.  This is again very critical, 
<br/>especially  for  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  governance  in  terms  of  management  of  resources.    So,  financial  skills, 
<br/>business planning, project management and I do implore, especially with Nadave as an institution to 
<br/>include these kinds of training.  Again, with those entrepreneurial business skills, we have to ask the 
<br/>question, what has FijiFirst done for </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>business?  What have they done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Zilch.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  You do not know what we have done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What percentage of our GDP is attributed to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>?  This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the data we need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>497 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Be honest man! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- And you have not provided that data.  That is what I am talking 
<br/>about in terms of the relevant data which needs to be developed, but the FijiFirst abolished ethnic 
<br/>data - data on ethnicity. That is required in terms of development.  When we look at statistics, we 
<br/>streamline various data - indigenous, women, et cetera.  Unfortunately, FijiFirst did away with that 
<br/>and that is where the gap in the statistics is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We look after everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- But in terms of the data we have, the Household and Income 
<br/>Expenditure Survey 2019-2020 confirm 30 percent live in poverty, of which, 74 percent are </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>
<br/>So, what does FijiFirst, in terms of real economic development, business development ensuring that 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> make up a better percentage of economic output in terms of the GDP - there is nothing, we 
<br/>do not have anything in terms of data.  So that needs to be re-developed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I do commend the iTaukei Trust Fund for the Vanua Fieldwork Project and that has been 
<br/>mentioned in terms of the revitalisation of the traditional skills, knowledge and recording, which is 
<br/>a key development.  When we look at iTaukei Affairs, it is incumbent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I mentioned and also to look back at the legacies of the last 16 years under Bainimarama 
<br/>and FijiFirst, I would say it is a shameful episode in terms of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> governance and development 
<br/>in  this  country  -  from  the  abrogation  of  the  1997  Constitution,  the  removal  of  the  entrenched 
<br/>legislation  and  various  other  issues  which  happened  from  then  till  now.    We,  as  a  Coalition 
<br/>Government will be rectifying all those, as mentioned by the honourable Minister for Fijian Affairs.  
<br/>Everything will be rectified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Potholes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  We  will  be  working  with  you  as  we  are  encouraging 
<br/>partnerships on the review of this.  We are thankful to the honourable Leader of the Opposition for 
<br/>responding positively and I hope, honourable Bala will also respond positively instead of interfering 
<br/>with me every time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, the GCC, which was removed, will be rectifying that because the reason 
<br/>for the removal is uncertain. There was just no valid reason, and it is an institution for consultation 
<br/>for indigenous issues; that is all.  It is not a political institution or anything, but of course we will be 
<br/>going through the review which has been announced by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>and that will ensure that it will be an institution which is independent and not involved in politics, as 
<br/>always been the criticism from the other side, except for development issues which will be brought 
<br/>in by the Ministers.  That is all!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  heard  the  other  side  of  Parliament  talking  about  various 
<br/>developments but let me remind them that they were guided by the sunset clause.  They need to be 
<br/>reminded of that.  It is not that I am bringing up the past, I am just saying that they were guided by 
<br/></span><span>that in the last 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- And we have to rectify that, that is what I am trying to say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Oder - 60.  He should talk on relevance, there is no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sunset clause in the Report.  Please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, confine yourself to the content of Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The reason I said that is …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No, you don’t have to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- …because in there it is stated clearly that there has to be a 
<br/>sunset on indigenous institutions, that is what  it says, and that indigenous institution includes the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund and the framework is included also.  I want to read out a quote from there, but I 
<br/>might be kicked out of Parliament for incitement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I will not read it because I know I might be subject to the Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Please, please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- All these was done without consultation and in a dictatorial 
<br/>manner but I know that the Opposition side of Parliament, I mentioned to honourable Bala, “You 
<br/>will be sitting here and I will be sitting there.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- (Inaudible)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Since that has happened and there have been goodwill on both 
<br/>sides, we will be working together to rectify these issues.  When we look back, the whole thing was 
<br/>just totally unnecessary from 2006 to 2022 and we are back to square one today because we will be 
<br/>working on rectifying some of those issues, not for political sake but that is what is requested by our 
<br/>people.    It  is  not  only  that  by  the  indigenous  people,  but  it  is  also  for  good  national  governance 
<br/>because you have frameworks for consultations and other ethnic people in Fiji do understand some 
<br/>of the issues which are raised by the Great Council of Chiefs which is good for national unity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that maybe honourable Bulitavu will speak after me, and he will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addressing some of the issues I raised, but honourable Bulitavu was with us…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- He was also really with us on some of those issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- He was with us on trying to rectify those issues and I thank 
<br/></span><span>him and the honourable Leader of the Opposition that we will be working together as mentioned by 
<br/>the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Good try, good try. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- … to rectify and especially there are some constitutional

<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>499 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amendments, we will be working together. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution to the motion that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is before Parliament on the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2019 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- </span><span>Maaro</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- First of all, I would like to acknowledge those who had put the 
<br/>iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004 together.  One in particular that I would like to specifically mention is 
<br/>the  former  Member  of  Parliament,  Adi  Litia  Qionibaravi.    She  was  one  of  the  founders  of  that 
<br/>particular  research  that  led  to  the  Act  and  the  establishment  of  the  commercial  arm  of  the  Great 
<br/>Council of Chiefs (GCC).  That is why the iTaukei Trust Fund Board has the role as stipulated in 
<br/>section 4 of that particular Act that comes from the original iTaukei Affairs Act on the advancement 
<br/>and the good governance of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and how to advance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would have thought that the Minister for iTaukei Affairs would have given some history and 
<br/>throw some light into why the commercial arm of GCC was one of the key deliberations of the GCC 
<br/>then.  It was embedded into one of the documents that most of you will know, called the ‘Blueprint 
<br/>-    50/50 By 2020’ by Mr. Laisenia Qarase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In 2004 when this Act came in, the building was already there.  Then in 2006, there was a 
<br/>change in government and there was a committee that came into place that most of us should know, 
<br/>it was called the State of the Nation and Economy Report that led to the People’s Charter for Change, 
<br/>Peace and Progress.  There was a committee that was specifically tasked under the Charter that was 
<br/>to look into the review of our indigenous institution that was led by the former Colonel Apakuki 
<br/>Kurusiga.  That Committee, in that review, had gone into plans and policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would disagree with the honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau where he said that during those 
<br/>times and even in the FijiFirst Government, that the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> legacy was left behind. This Committee 
<br/>continued and the status where the iTaukei Trust Fund is at now is due to the change of direction that 
<br/>was led by the Committee under the leadership of Colonel Kurusiga and also the Minister for iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs then.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One that I will also acknowledge is the late Ratu Epeli Ganilau, who was the Minister for 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs at that time, even led up to the time when the GCC was suspended and also the events 
<br/>that  led  up  to  other  things.    Probably,  the  Bainimarama  Government  at  that  time  saw  that  for 
<br/>indigenous issues, they need to be prioritised before the resurrection of the GCC later.  But again, the 
<br/>issue here is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) that 
<br/>most of you used to talk about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the UNDRIP, there are clauses that talks about, there needs to be economic advancement 
<br/>of  indigenous  rights  as  part  of  our  collective  group  rights  and  this  is  one  of  it,  that  was  of  the 
<br/>programmes that the FijiFirst Government had continued.  If the FijiFirst Government had left the 
<br/>legacy of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people behind and the development in business or accelerating them into the 
<br/>commercial sector, then we would not have had this Annual Report being debated here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That is something that needs to be clarified and I think that has 
<br/>been subject to many political debate and campaign and has formed many political ideologies.  Most 
<br/>of the indigenous political parties do campaign on this especially on the sunset clause argument, the 
<br/>20 or so degrees that they talk about.

<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But again, the things that continued were more important to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He’s seen the light. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He has not seen the light.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  …  that  helped  in  the  economic  empowerment  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back to the Report, one of the biggest achievements that the iTaukei Trust Fund Board has 
<br/>achieved, if you look at the number of real estates it acquired here in Fiji, it owns the Radisson Blu 
<br/>Resort,  that  is  the  business  auxiliary  unit.   That  is  part  of  the  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  assets  and  few 
<br/>properties in Suva.  In Suva Street, they have got shares in RB Patel and other stock exchange markets 
<br/>around the world. They have also got that investment in Australia and in the United States of America 
<br/>through the leadership of its current CEO, Mr. Aisake Taito, and the other committees that look into 
<br/>other policies on how they can generate funds through investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those investments that come into the Fund, the no returns from investment go into indigenous 
<br/>development - development of our culture, our language and other things that the honourable Minister 
<br/>was talking about.  The field work that he was talking about in Rewa, that is attached to a historical 
<br/>history of Rewa - on the ancestor of the Rewa people from Burebasaga.  It is the migration of Ro 
<br/>Melasiga from Verata to Rewa, that is the core of that project that is funded by iTaukei Trust Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Tell them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That will be educational to those who would want to know Fijian 
<br/>history and the migration and how the Burebasaga Confederacy developed.  These are some of the 
<br/>things probably that is important as to why the iTaukei Trust Fund is there.  The Trust Fund also 
<br/>helps in other educational programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In indigenous language, the Trust Fund partners with the University of the South Pacific on 
<br/>Diploma  in  Indigenous  Studies  where  it  allows  most  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  teachers  who  want  to  advance  into 
<br/>language studies are able to work as teachers and also at the Fijian Affairs level.  Not only that, but 
<br/>the  biggest  achievement  also  we  have  in  this  term  of  Parliament,  two  of  them  are  upstairs  as 
<br/>Interpreters of Parliament.  They were also part of this programme on indigenous language.  This is 
<br/>the development that took place after the Kurusiga Committee came in and the development under 
<br/>the Bainimarama Government and the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.-  So, the indigenous  educational  part, FijiFirst  did  not  leave any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indigenous people behind… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  …he  took  them  together  and  this  is  the  thing  that  we  need  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>correct and some of the things in our political narrative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Tell them about the business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  We  will  go  into  the other  things.    If  you  look  into the  Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report, there is a verbatim attached where the CEO, Mr. Aisake Taito, was summoned to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>501 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee and there were two Opposition Members at that time who were part of that Committee – 
<br/>honourable Salote Radrodro and honourable Ratu Tevita Navurelevu.  They had asked questions to 
<br/>the CEO and the CEO had explained to them their queries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  in  terms  of  the  other  thing  that  the  honourable  Tuisawau  had  talked  about  on  the 
<br/>entrepreneurship  development  of  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  people  and  that  the  FijiFirst  Government  did  not  do 
<br/>anything, let me remind him if he could read the verbatim which was in 2022.  The CEO now, Mr. 
<br/>Aisake Taito, had said that in 2021, they gave an expression of interest where two were selected (was 
<br/>under  the  FijiFirst  Government),  to  be  trained  at  Nadave,  to  be  on  business  paths  to  become 
<br/>entrepreneurs.  So, the first pioneers in Nadave happened in 2021 and that was under the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government; entrepreneurship of the indigenous people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  The  other  achievement  that  happened  too  was  the  </span><span>Sauvaki  Ni 
<br/>Vanua</span><span> and it was under the FijiFirst  Government. About 30-plus traditional leaders from Navosa 
<br/>graduated at Nadave.  That is in the Report.  If you look at the Report, those were the achievements, 
<br/>yet again, the Government is saying that the FijiFirst Government had done nothing to the indigenous 
<br/>people.  These are some things that we really need to correct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that you need to look at is the other programme by the iTaukei Trust Fund 
<br/>called the </span><span>Solesau.  Solesau</span><span> is an educational programme that is put in a kit, available online for the 
<br/>Fijian diaspora overseas…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- … who want to learn their culture, heritage and language.   So, 
<br/>these  are  the  things  that  the  FijiFirst  Government  ensured  through  the  Sustainable  Development 
<br/>Goals and also the other indigenous laws that are there to ensure that </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>are on par and that we 
<br/>do not lose our culture and language.   We thank the former Prime Minister and Minister for iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs for that visionary leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That is something that I hope the Government will work upon - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what has been achieved and what needs to be done, moving forward on how to empower that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We are trying to fix your damage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  There  was  an  important  question  that  was  asked  by  Salote 
<br/>Radrodro in the verbatim and that is if the iTaukei Trust Fund will be venturing in other areas for 
<br/></span><span>economic empowerment of iTaukei, but the focus now is still on culture and language. I see the path 
<br/></span><span>that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is trying to take in terms of how the Trust Fund can assist 
<br/>the  indigenous  in  forestry  and  fisheries  projects,  but  again  they  can  talk  amongst  themselves  as 
<br/>Ministers on how... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We are trying to fix your damage.

<br/>agriculture  and  fisheries  where  funds  will  be  available  with  the  Trust  Fund  but  that  needs  to  be 
<br/>discussed with the .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.-  The past Government was idle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That needs to be discussed by the Board too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the important thing that we need to know and understand - the iTaukei Trust Fund, 
<br/>why the FijiFirst Government continued to ensure the advancement of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people economically 
<br/>and  through  this  Fund,  protecting  this  Fund.    That  was  one  of  the  mandates  of  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  that  has  ensured  where  the  Fund  is  at  the  moment  and  also  it  helps  the  current 
<br/>Government moving forward with the objectives that are there, what other things, the new ideas that 
<br/>should come from you…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You will get it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- ... to continue the journey.  You are in the driver’s seat now, so 
<br/>you need to continue.  Stop trying to say that the FijiFirst Government did not do anything.  We have 
<br/>done enough.  We are yet to see what you can do for the indigenous people and this ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- 100 days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Five days left.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- ... is the challenge that you have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- 100 days.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- I think only five days is left for the 100 days and other things that 
<br/>people  were  promised  during  the  Election,  but  this  is  your  time  to  shine.    Stop  acting  like  the 
<br/>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- No, no.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That is one of the things that I want to remind them.  Stop acting 
<br/>like an Opposition, act like a Government.  In the last two days, this side of Parliament is acting like 
<br/>a government in waiting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- And you people should not be confused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You will be waiting a long time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Wait for the next budget, not long.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Get your act together.

<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>503 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, thank you, thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  We  all  support  the  Report  and  what  the  Committee  had  done.  
<br/>Thank you to the Committee and the review and everyone, I think the 2013 Constitution looks after 
<br/>everyone especially the protection of indigenous Fijians in the 2013 Constitution on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, 
<br/>Section 28 and  also  on  customary chiefly titles  and ranks, it is  protected.  Native land cannot  be 
<br/>alienated so the protection is there by law.  Now we work on our advancement through economic 
<br/>development, and I think the Government  and the Opposition can work together to  achieve more 
<br/>things ahead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, for a while I was kind of really bemused by the 
<br/>contribution from the honourable Bulitavu.  Honourable Usamate had remarked from the other side 
<br/>that he has now seen some light.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M D. BULITAVU. Yeah, come!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I was just wondering that very soon he will see the light again 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and probably start supporting us from the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I come back to some of the comments that were raised by Members from the other 
<br/>side, Mr. Speaker, let me just begin by saying again and the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>quite rightly pointed out that the iTaukei Trust Fund Act was established in 2004 under the former 
<br/>Prime Minister, late Mr. Laisenia Qarase, basically to guide the operation of the Fund.  So, in terms 
<br/>of the funding, Mr. Speaker, the objective of the Act was to provide the financial autonomy to the 
<br/>Great Council of Chiefs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was, Mr. Speaker, repealed in 2012 by the military regime.  Just hearing some of them 
<br/>from the other side, the arguments that we had throughout the eight years that I was sitting on the 
<br/>other side and honourable Tuisawau is right, whenever we raised issues that directly affected our 
<br/>indigenous community, those who are sitting that side and were sitting this side, labelled us as racists. 
<br/>But they do not know, Mr. Speaker, that the GCC was abolished only because the GCC refused to 
<br/>support  the  2006  </span><span>coup</span><span>.    That  was  the  beginning  of  what  they  started  to  do  without  doing  the 
<br/>appropriate consultation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just putting things into perspective - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Providing funding for undertaking promotion and sponsoring of programmes in the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Rotuman languages and cultures; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Providing funding for the management and leadership of entrepreneurial skills of the </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Rotumans;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Sponsor  research  into  languages,  arts,  cultures  of  the  iTaukei  and  Rotumans  and  better 
<br/>understanding and preservation of their heritage, and  any  other  purpose  approved by  the 
<br/>Board as advantageous to the beneficiaries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board does not receive any government funding.  
<br/></span><span>But we know and honourable Tikoduadua knows that the Government actually took away $20 million 
<br/></span><span>that  was  for  the  Fund.    It  was  grants.  All  that  talk  from  honourable  Bulitavu  about  government 
<br/>supporting the Fund to look after the interest of the iTaukei community is all hogwash, as honourable 
<br/>Usamate says all the time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, Mr. Speaker, that honourable Tuisawau raised and we have raised this on 
<br/>many occasions is that, the former Government refused to recognise the fact that we needed ethnic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>504 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>data to target our policies into appropriate sectors and for appropriate issues.  When the Bureau of 
<br/>Statistics Report came out, Mr. Speaker the former Government Statistician (Mr. Kemueli Naiqama) 
<br/>did the right thing.  He produced the Household Income and Expenditure Survey Report which laid 
<br/>down ethnic data and showed some very important statistics  which could have guided polices for 
<br/>both, our indigenous communities and our other ethnic communities because both, Mr. Speaker, have 
<br/>different  problems.    If  you  look  at,  for  example,  maternal  health  or  say  for  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  woman  as 
<br/>compared  to  Indo-Fijian  women,  different,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  unless  you  collect  statistics  to 
<br/>understand where the target should be, you cannot do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Household  Income  Expenditure  Survey  (HIES)  showed  and  honourable  Bulitavu  and 
<br/>honourable Usamate, they are all sitting there, they did not defend it, they did not support what we, 
<br/>in the Opposition, at that time wanted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The statistics showed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulitavu was in the Opposition, but he was supporting the Government. And I 
<br/>do not know, I was told that the Government was providing a lot of funding for projects in his area. 
<br/>That is why he supported the Government from the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, let us get this right, Mr. Speaker, and we, as a new Government, we want to set a new 
<br/>agenda and new direction and one that will for unity - one that will bring people together and one 
<br/>that will allow people to understand each other’s concerns.  If you do not allow ethnic data, you are 
<br/>not going to get that understanding. People will continue to have different kinds of prejudices. People 
<br/>will continue to speculate.  People will continue with rumours. It is better to bring this to the fore, 
<br/>talk about it and Parliament is the best place to talk about it. So, for all those who say under the 
<br/>pretext of common and equal citizenry…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, just a while ago, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the Indian women and </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>women are different. This morning, we …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Lal, you have risen on a Point of Order, could you state your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Standing Order 60, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- This morning we spoke about women empowerment. And here, we have 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister creating division by saying that Indian women and </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>women are different.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- He should withdraw that comment, Mr. Speaker, he is already dividing us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – iTTFB 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>505 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you can continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, whenever the honourable Member 
<br/>opens his mouth, he shows his lack of understanding and comprehension as to what I was saying.  I 
<br/>was not talking about the differences, I was saying that when you look at maternal health, you find 
<br/>different situations, different indicators and different statistics. That is all I am saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, obviously, the Great Council of Chiefs will commence soon, and it may be 
<br/>an opportunity to review the Act and perhaps, bring back the repealed provision which will allow the 
<br/>Great Council of Chiefs to be financially autonomous and basically through assistance from the Fund 
<br/>and, of course, the Government will have to look at what is the financial situation and how that needs 
<br/>to be taken into account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to bring back this debate and I think it is a healthy debate when we talk 
<br/>about  ethnic  data,  we,  as  a  government,  have  already  decided  that  we  are  going  to make  the  Fiji 
<br/>Bureau of Statistics more independent. We are going to review the Act. We are going to adequately 
<br/>resource the organisation  so that they are able to,  not  only collect  ethnic data but  also  get  proper 
<br/>analysis done and have the capacity to give us that information that will allow us to make good policy 
<br/>and targeted policy for all those in different regions or parts of the country or according to different 
<br/>ethnic groups. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember, Mr. Speaker, many years ago, we did some study of our Melanesian community 
<br/>in the Kalekana area.  All the data when it was aggregated into two different ethnic groups did not 
<br/>show that the poverty rate amongst that community in that locality was extremely high. No one knew 
<br/>about it.  And so, there was never any attention paid to address and look at the causes of how those 
<br/>things were happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, having ethnic data does not necessarily mean that you are going to device 
<br/>racist policies. This is what they thrived on for all these years. They talked about one in Fiji, but they 
<br/>actually exploited.  They went and campaign on the basis of race, that was what they did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- And what about you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, it is very important, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are talking about potholes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Don’t point at me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Actually,  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Bala  was  talking  about 
<br/>potholes. Perhaps, he should think about drowning himself in shame in those potholes because that 
<br/></span><span>is what they left us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-As a government, they have left us….

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we take as good as we get, but when you get insulting 
<br/>by telling someone to go and drown himself in a pothole, that is offensive.  He should take that back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, let me say that the honourable Member talked 
<br/>about potholes.   All I am saying is that, that is their legacy when they were in Government and they 
<br/>left it for us to handle, so we are going to fix all that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- When?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- For eight years, Mr. Speaker…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- People are suffering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …he was part of the government … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No money! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …and he was the Minister for Infrastructure. They have left 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing. They made this country broke.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No money! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was what they left us.   People understand what mess 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you left us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying that this is a very important Fund. As I have said, we 
<br/>need  to  look  at  how  investments  can  be  strengthened  and  how  the  income  derived  from  those 
<br/>investments can help us to provide more funding in the areas that I have pointed out which was the 
<br/>original objective of the Fund set up by the former Prime Minister.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to give her Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- , Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the honourable Members 
<br/>who have contributed to the debate this afternoon.  I noted that all honourable Members have spoken 
<br/></span><span>at length on the various recommendations in the Report and of the organisation as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  an  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  woman  and  Member  of  the  Coalition  Government,  I 
<br/>respectfully note and commend the plans to commence construction of the </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span> in June of 
<br/>this year.  I also note that construction should be completed by the end of 2024.  This is line with the 
<br/>Coalition Government’s commitment to bring back the </span><span>Bose Levu Vakaturaga</span><span> with the first meeting 
<br/>scheduled for May this year.
