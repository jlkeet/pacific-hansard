<h3>ELECTION OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION</h3>
<div><span>ELECTION OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  for  nominations  for  the  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand in this Parliament to nominate a Member, 
<br/>who  is  husband  to  Mrs. Litia  Vulakoro,  and  a  loving  father  of  two  daughters  and  one  son.    This 
<br/>Member has always put his family first and we know how proud he is of his family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has served Fijians in many roles, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a solider, as Minister for Defence 
<br/>and National Security, along with being Minister for Foreign Affairs for a short time.  With that, he 
<br/>also served in his recent role as Minister for Defence and National Security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of his best jobs was Commissioner Northern, a job that he was so obsessed with that he 
<br/>started recognising himself and telling the people that he hailed from the North and not Tailevu North. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has been named as Fijiâ€™s COP23 High Level 
<br/>Climate Champion.  He places the same care in his work as he puts in his family, and he treats every 
<br/>Fijian as part of his family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am  honoured to  have  worked  with  him for these number of years.   I  call him mentor,  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>teacher and most importantly, a very good friend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I nominate honourable Inia Seruiratu to be the Leader of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are there any other nominations from the Opposition? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no further nominations, I, therefore, declare honourable Inia 
<br/></span><span>Seruiratu,  being  married  to  the  North  and  is  part  of  the  North,  to  be  elected  as  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition to take his seat and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communication from the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>461 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>also allow, at this moment, the honourable Leader of the Opposition to say a few words. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  all  honourable  Members,  this  is 
<br/>unexpected.  I was not expecting to deliver a speech after being elected as Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>but I am, indeed, honoured and privileged for this opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am here to serve all Fijians and, of course, being the Government in-waiting, we are here to 
<br/>ensure that we work with the Government and at the same time, keep them in check. Of course, we 
<br/>hope  that  we  will  work  according  to  the  expectations  of  our  people  and  most  importantly,  bring 
<br/>prosperity and unity in the Fiji that we aspire to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to assure all honourable Members that we, in the Opposition, will do our best in the 
<br/>role that we play because it is critical for Fiji and, of course, for all Fijians in that respect, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Once again, thank you and I am, indeed, thankful to all the honourable Members, particularly 
<br/>our Party Leader and the General-Secretary, who are not with us in Parliament.  Of course, to the 
<br/>honourable Members who have shown faith and trust in me for this critical role, I hope and pray that 
<br/>I will deliver to the best of my ability with the help of God and, of course, with the support of the 
<br/>Members of the caucus and all Members of this august Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just before we proceed, I would like to re-echo what 
<br/>was said in Parliament when your predecessor was appointed as Leader of the Opposition, having 
<br/>heard from the honourable Prime Minister and as well as myself, that we will accord whatever should 
<br/>be accorded rightly to that high office, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  We will try to ensure 
<br/>that all privileges are provided, there shall be no hindrance or checks and balances being imposed 
<br/>unilaterally to that high office of yours from this Office, as we had experienced in the past. That I 
<br/>would like to confirm from this high Office, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
