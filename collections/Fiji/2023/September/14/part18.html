<body><h3>DRAINAGE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>DRAINAGE (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday 11 th September, 2023, I move: That the Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 22/2023), be debated and voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023. The Drainage Act 1961 was enacted and provides for the execution of the drainage work amongst other things. The Act is administered by the Ministry of Waterways which was established in 2017 to address the threats of flooding to Fijian communities. In 2018, the Act was amended to allow the Ministry to assume the responsibility of drainage systems and functions of Drainage Board under the Act. Regrettably, adequate consultation and planning had not been undertaken prior to the removal of the Drainage Boards. This morning Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Agriculture spoke at length on the need for drainage board and this has also been discussed in previous discussions. There has been noticeable decline in the overall production of sugar cane as well as non-sugar cane commodities produced from the drainage scheme areas attributed to the transfer of responsibilities of drainage systems to the Ministry. It does not make sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this responsibility is vested with an independent body of individuals in the specific divisions. Four divisions in Fiji than we amend that to be directed by the Ministry which is based in Suva. It is anticipated that the re-establishment of the Drainage Boards will improve the service and maintenance of the drainage scheme areas whilst contributing towards the increase in the production of sugar and of course non-sugar commodities produced in these areas. The Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 accordingly seeks to amend the Act to revert the responsibility of drainage systems to the Drainage Boards. The Bill is urgent for the government, given that the Ministry of Waterways has put in place plans for the financial year, for the Drainage Boards to undertake this responsibility and shift the burden from the Ministry. There has been widespread consultation with the Office of Solicitor General, Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and statistics, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral</p><div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 1871 Resources, the Ministry of Local Government, Municipal councils, Ministry of Sugar and the Sugarcane Growers Council. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have outlined in detail the 30 provisions of the Bill, and I cordially commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Mr. Speaker.- honourable members the floor is now open for debate on the motion. Just before I offer the floor, three speakers that have been identified by the honourable Whips. The debate will be led by honourable Maharaj and then should be followed by honourable Tuisawau and later on by honourable Tunabuna. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, we supported the second motion that came to this floor but then we were asked to repent on our decisions to support the motion. So unfortunately, after repenting for a while I need to tell the government a little bit of background on how the Ministry of Waterways came into the picture and why the Fiji First government back then, had to repeal the Drainage Act of 1961. Mr. Speaker, in 2017 a new Ministry of Waterways was formed and was responsible for dredging Waterways, realigning drainage system, managing river banks, mitigating floodings and managing storms and rain water. The new Ministry was responsible for co-ordinating smart agriculture irrigation system as well. Many of our waterways flood frequently, not just the river mouth but up-stream and beyond. This flooding reaches towns and makes roads and our highways impassable. We see floods as an act of God but often they are direct results of human activity and human negligence. Heavy silting is a result of decades of neglect, illegal development, land degradation and changed weather patterns. And we are experiencing heavy flooding because these waterways have not been dredged or maintained for years. The Land and Water Resource Management Division within the Ministry of Agriculture was transferred to a new Ministry. This was done back than to go away from the bureaucratic process imposed by the Drainage Board. Government back then allocated $24.2 million in the budget for functioning of the Ministry and the Green Climate Fund was providing funds as well. However, Mr. Speaker, we needed more than funding to fix our waterways. We also needed technical expertise and in this context, there were discussions with Global Green Growth Institute. Through this Ministry government tackled head-on, issues of flooding in Nadi. Nadi is Fiji’s gateway to the world and the fastest growing urban centre. After a framework was developed by the Ministry of Waterways, the Japanese Government committed $385 million to fix the flooding issues in Nadi. Mr. Speaker, furthermore, the repealed Drainage Act in1961 provided for the declaration of drainage areas authorised in the execution of drain works and provided for the establishment of the Drainage Board for the maintenance and improvement of certain drainage areas. In 2017, the Ministry of Waterways was established by the Fijian Government to address the growing threat that flooding posed to Fijian communities – a threat that is projected to worsen as a result of the effects of climate change and of course, to have a holistic approach to water management issues in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, since its establishment the responsibility of maintenance and drainage system and management of waterways has been handled by Ministry of Waterways. Mr. Speaker, the Ministry and the Drainage Board shared the same function of maintaining the drainage system. The Drainage (Budget Amendment) Bill 2023 amended the Act to facilitate the transfer of the roles of Drainage Board to the Ministry. What it did was, essentially all the</p><div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div><p>1872 Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 responsibilities of the Drainage Board went to Ministry of Waterways and Environment. The Bill was actually quite explicit in the responsibilities that actually got transferred across the ministries. Furthermore, the Drainage Board through the experience lacked expertise. It was confined to drains only, hence the reason we actually developed a Ministry of Waterways so that not just drains but other aspects of water and drains were also captured. I will give a common example. If you look at USA in the State of California, there is North California and there is South California. There is very low amount of rain in South California. What the Californian State Government has done is to capture any rainfall that goes into the sea. It only goes if it is allowed by the State Government. Otherwise, they have catchments to capture the rainfall. Having said that, as I said the Drainage Board did not actually have the expertise and looking at Fiji, with the amount of rainfall that we have, it is still a very bad scenario for us that we still have issues around Fiji whereby people they do not have clean drinking water. It was a holistic approach back then not just look after the drain but to actually come up with the Ministry which can look after all these aspects. Mr. Speaker, in fact we upgraded the Board to a Ministry. There was not any Ministry previously for Waterways, it was just a Board because expertise was lacking in the Drainage Board and that is why we came up with the Ministry. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Clean water? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- So that expertise can come and help the Ministry of Waterways to see what the problem is? That does not mean, Mr. Speaker, if it come up with an institute we need to give it time. If it is not working we need to look at the mechanism, it does not mean we dismantle the institute itself. That is what the current Government is doing. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Ministry is still there?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Listen:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What is the use of being a Board when it will have the same ..:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.-... function as to what the Ministry is doing. It does not make sense, Mr. Speaker. The issue is, these people want to start operating where from where they left back in 1997 or 1998... (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- We are looking at the modern world, we are looking at the modern nation, Mr. Speaker, we are looking at modern ways of doing things.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Blocked drains:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- ...that is how we want things to be done:</span> However, Mr. Speaker...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. TUBUNA.- We received complaints everywhere:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> Dismantling all the institute will not help, Mr. Speaker. What kind</p><div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 1873 of urgency is there to bring this Bill under Standing Order 51? It can be sent to the Committee for further consultation and be brought back to Parliament...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- To the farmers:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr:</span> Speaker, what was happening when the Drainage Board was there it was full of corruption, nepotism and favouritism. Drain was done without a mouth to the drain. HON. S. TUBUNA.- Who? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- On both sides there used to be a dead end. If I am in the Drainage Board if you go to places and you talk to farmers the people who are actually sitting in the Board they were the ones they were the farms... HON. S. R. DITOKA.- Drainage what kind of Board? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Drains used to be done first, Mr. Speaker,.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Speak to the farmers..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.-...that is why we actually had to go away from the Drainage Board:</span> We brought a consolidated team together, form the Ministry with the Permanent Secretary to ensure that this system does operate, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, we do not see there is a reason that we need a Drainage Board back, all we need to do if the mechanism is not working to improve the mechanism, so that farmers and all those people who are affected by floods are helped. With that contribution, Mr. Speaker, I do not support the motion HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I rise to contribute to the motion, to amend the Drainage Act 1961. What the Honourable Members has mentioned is not really the purpose of this Bill. It is basically to rejuvenate the Drainage Board, in addition to the functions of Waterways - it is not really replacing one for the other. It is basically to enhance. I thought at the beginning you said you were supporting the Bill. If you look at the provisions of the Bill, it is very clear. There are some critical elements of the Bill, for example, if you look at 3(2)(a) on survey, that is very important in terms of baseline data. I mentioned earlier that baseline data is always critical in planning, as alluded to by our former Ministers. That is something we will continue to improve on. Not only that but when we are looking at this, we are also looking at the ecologically vulnerable areas, taking into account climate change so that is important. What drainage measures are desirable? That again, is a critical area. and there are elements of compensation there. In my province the contractors just came and dug up everything including the mangroves, the plantations and everything, so that is an example of what we are talking about. In some cases, there has not been proper supervision in some cases of the work done in Waterways. In Rewa, some of the work which was done resulted in river blockage. For example, there is the Naqio River towards the bank of the Rewa River. They buried it and replaced it with small culverts, so that resulted in worse flooding that is just an example. The other one is near Waivou Village - the work resulted in more flooding in that village, so</p><div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div><p>1874 Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 people are questioning the work of waterways - is it resulting in improvement or deterioration. So that is why it is very important to bring it back to complement the Waterways, not only that but in some areas such as Rewa, Tailevu South if you look at the roads, some of the roads there have been affected by the raising seawater or climate change, but it has been made worse by the neglect of the drains near those roads the irrigation and all that. I refer in particular year to Cautata, Nadali and Dreketi in Rewa. Again, this would be really specific - it is not general Ministry-wide but specific areas which the Drainage Board will be focused on. You mentioned that the Board was plagued by corruption – where is the evidence, you do not have any evidence. You cannot just make general accusations my friend. The Board needs to include those at the ground level like the Mata ni Tikina who know the waterways, drains and the movement of the tides, etc. I saw some of the works the result is just the total opposite. If you look at clause 7 on drainage funds, that again is very important – you have to do the assessment, survey plan, consult scope, implementation plan, programming and budgeting. That is what this is about, which is very critical in moving forward so that there is a systematic rational plan to do the work. Right now, it is a very urgent issue because there is a lot of blocked drains there, Bro, if you come, I will show you. If you look at the explanatory note, regrettably, let me quote that: “Adequate consultation and planning had not been undertaken.” MR. SPEAKER.- Did you say, Bro? (Laughter) HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Sorry, I did not mean to insult anyone. Honourable Maharaj, my apologies. Finally, there is a need, as explained, you have mentioned Green Government Fund, yes, that is an area where we need to utilise opportunities for climate financing, incorporating lowlands, rivers, climate resilient infrastructure, and as I have mentioned, blocked drains and poor roads, it has impacts the roads. We all need to work together in close collaboration with the PM’s Climate Change Office, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture and Public Works Department in planning that. Those are some of my comments and I commend the Bill to Parliament and thank the other side for the support. I have to admit something, today, there is a change in the whole atmosphere of this environment in Parliament. I know a lot of us know that and I acknowledge that. Some of us were in the last Parliament. Honourable Veena Bhatnagar was in our Committee and she asked me, “Why you always oppose everything, even the good things?” I told her, “No, I just oppose for the sake of opposing because I am in the Opposition.” (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Thanks for saying that publicly:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> Wait, I have not finished. But that was the reaction, I suppose the dialogue from this side. It was negative and negative reaction, but now, it is positive and you people are responding positively, and I am so happy about that. Sorry, I called you Bro, because of that. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- So we look forward to further dialogue and working together:</span></p><div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 1875 Thank you, very much for some of the Bills that you have supported, and I believe that we have a very positive future for Parliament going forward, even though we will be wining the next Election. (Laughter) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I offer the floor to honourable Tunabuna, I would like to acknowledge at this time those who are in the gallery - a gentleman by the name of Mr. Rami Sherman, who is a retired Israeli Defence Officer who took part in the rescue mission of the hostages at a terminal in Uganda, sitting there with Ana Rokomokoti, who is a lawyer and her husband and others, especially Tarai from Sydney. Thank you so much for listening to the debate in Parliament and for your presence here. (Acclamation) MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to honourable Tunabuna, our lone ranger sitting on this side. HON. T. N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before Parliament this afternoon on the Drainage (Amendment) Act. The part that I am going to speak on is on the establishment of the Drainage Board. Before I proceed, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Agriculture for the Ministerial Statement given this morning, which had covered a lot of technical areas of the work that is done in the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways. That also covered the part that I wanted to contribute to in today’s session. I also wish to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the support given to the Statement that was given this morning by the honourable Minister for Agriculture. I will be very short and brief and also will only focus on the experiences that I faced when I served at the Ministry of Agriculture for close to 35 years as a staff of the Ministry of Agriculture. I have had a lot of experience not only in the livestock sector, but we had close collaboration with the Land and Water Resources Management (LAWRM) Division which was then transferred to the Ministry of Waterways. I thank honourable Maharaj for some of the developments that he has mentioned but I believe he can get a fair bit of what had happened at the Ministry of Waterways Office so that we can brief him more on why we had wanted the change that we have in the Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the close to 35 years that I worked with the Ministry, I had a lot of experiences with damages that we normally experience in terms of natural disaster. One in particular, the floods that we have had in the last 30 years. We assessed a lot of damages and the losses; it was so high that some people had thought of relocated and moved away from agricultural areas. We had a lot of losses in the agriculture production, both for crops and for livestock and livestock feed. We had a lot of infrastructural damages, roads, waterways which include culverts, floodgates and we also had damages to homes, their belongings, farmhouse and farm sheds and as I mentioned, farmland who are normally badly affected with the floods. Even then we had the Drainage Board, now when the Drainage Board was removed unfortunately, we had seen an increase in saltwater intrusion into agricultural lands and this included lands under sugarcane, lands under rice, those that were used commercially for other root crops and those that were also used for home consumptions. We had an increase in water logging condition for low-lying areas, this was not from salt water but from fresh water down from rain side areas due to clogging rains. We had a lot of risks to losses, and we had an increase in unavailability of lands suitable for agriculture. I have a very bad experience when I was in Labasa two and three years back when we had</p><div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div><p>1876 Drainage (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 hurricanes when Labasa Town was under water, and this was mainly due to flooding water that could not go through the bypass drainage system that we have in Labasa due to non-existence of the Drainage Board and the support that is normally given to the Drainage Board. The same would have happened to few of the towns and cities here in Viti Levu. Currently, we received a lot of complaints with damages due to increase in high water level due to clogging drains that are not maintained, and they used to be maintained under the Drainage Board. The Bill before the Parliament Mr. Speaker, Sir, affects farming families. It affects people who live out in the rural and also affect those who live in towns and cities that are situated in flats. I respect the Statement given this morning and the support given by the honourable Leader of the Opposition that climate change is here to stay. All we need to do is to mitigate the risks that are associated with climate change and as mentioned by the honourable Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, we need to address sustainable land management systems. We will need to work together, and we will need to formulate policies that best address our current situation. I, therefore, support the Bill before Parliament. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- I think the gist of the speakers, Mr. Speaker, is basically the cause an effect. The cause when the Drainage Board was taken away and what is the result. And that is being articulated very well by, honourable Tunabuna, from a technical point of view. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this respect, honourable Tunabuna started his career in the Ministry of Agriculture and finished off in the Ministry of Agriculture probably more than 30 years. So, he is speaking from experienced likewise from the honourable Minister for Agriculture. MR. SPEAKER.- And the Pacific too.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.:</span> Very well, Sir, I fail to acknowledge that.</p><p>The more important point, Mr. Speaker, is the issue of independence. Agriculture is a very big Ministry with a lot of responsibilities. Now the Government thinks that it is best that we vest this authority to people we are going to empower but we have expertise and also have a good understanding of the localities and they are based throughout the four Divisions of Fiji. We need to address the issue of flooding in drainage. This Coalition Government has taken aboard listening to our supporters and true to all our promise we have delivered this. This is not only for our people but for the people of Fiji. I commend this Bill before Parliament. Question put. Votes cast - Ayes - Noes Not voted - 29 23 3 Motion agreed to.
