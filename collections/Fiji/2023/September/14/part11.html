<body><h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3><h4>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h4><p>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Police Force 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Police Force 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 Annual Reports. These were tabled on 14 th July, 2023, and it was referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to review and report back to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee conducted a joint submission and consultation with the Fiji Police Force and the Ministry of Home Affairs and Defence when we were dealing with these Reports. You will notice that a year is missing from those two Reports (2018-2019), but that was the Report that we had debated earlier in the week, and these are the two Annual Reports in between. In these deliberations, we also tracked the live comments that were coming in on the Facebook page as they were watching the deliberation and we put forward to the Committee two of those very good points that were raised during the discussion. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report is written in a way for ease of reading. If you just go straight to the recommendations, we referenced a paragraph in the recommendation, and you can go straight to the paragraph, and we have provided an explanation as to why the recommendation is there. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p><div><a name="4">Page 4</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>1829 (Report handed over to the Secretary-General) HON. V.

Review Report – OAG Performance Audit on the Monitoring of Implementation of the Sugar Development and Farmers Assistance Programme from 2016-2019 HON. E. Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Review Report on the Performance Audit of the Office of the Auditor-General on the Monitoring of Implementation of the Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance Programme from 2016-2019. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audit was limited to evaluation and checking of the Grant Policy and Management Framework, administration of the Grant, monitoring and reporting and evaluation. From 2016 to 2019, there were around 22 Grant programmes and the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) alone, received the second highest funding of around $39.8 million after the fertilizer subsidies component of $46 million. At the outset, the Committee recommended the audit work carried out by the Office of the Auditor-General in examining whether the SDF from 2016 to 2019 was efficiently and effectively administered, and if the objectives of the Grant were met. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee reviewed this Performance Audit Report and conducted a round of consultations with all the relevant stakeholders, including the Ministry of Sugar, the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), Sugarcane Growers Council, Sugarcane Growers Fund, Fiji Sugar Research Institute, South Pacific Fertilizers Limited and selected sector farms. The Committee noted and agreed with the audit findings of the Office of the Auditor-General during the implementation of the SDF Grant from 2016 to 2019. On the Grant Policy and Management Framework Administration, it was found that there was no formal written one during the audit and the Ministry was in the drafting process, the audit was carried out in 2021. On the administration of the grant, accountability and transparency in grant management was generally weak, grant allotment lacked a transparent system, grant agreements and payment vouchers were found missing in some cases, and some conflicts of interest were not being declared by FSC, and farmers do not always receive funds on time. On monitoring, it was not performed to the requirements in an Annual Work Plan at farm level, there was absence of proper system, processes and resources for effective monitoring, plus independent checks were not carried out by the Ministry. On Reporting and evaluation, the programme has yet to be evaluated and reported against its objectives when the audit was conducted.</p><div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div><p>1830 Communication from the Speaker 14 th Sept., 2023 The Committee, in its review, agreed with the recommendations of the Auditor-General, that the findings were bad and appalling, and we were surprised. However, the wording was timely, considering the funds of around $39.8 that was disbursed at the time the SDF Grant had been in place from 2016 to 2019. There were instances of cheating or defaulted farmers, fraud and misuse of funds. It brought memories of the agriculture scam that happened in the past. At this juncture, it is pleasing to note that most of the audit recommendations are currently put in place and being implemented by the Ministry and in FSC, however, there is still a hurdle of having the appropriate number of human and technical resources to carry out the administration of the Grants. Mr. Speaker Sir, there were 22 programmes then, and now it has increased. In addition, the Committee found that there is lack of close and full collaboration and assistance and sharing of information between the main stakeholders in the sugar industry. I am pleased to state that the current honourable Minister for Sugar has taken necessary and positive steps, not only to improve back-office functions in the sugar industry, but to improve sugar production and provide tangible returns including profitability, to all the stakeholders including Government. Overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Sugar and the CEO of those stakeholders, who were consulted during the interview, as well as providing written response at that time. I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Committee who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report namely, honourable Sakiusa Tubuna, honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem Chand. I also wish to thank the Alternate Members of the Committee who took part in the consultations namely, honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure and honourable Naisa Tuinaceva. Most importantly, in view of the Committee’s findings, Sir, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts recommends that Parliament takes note of its recommendations in this Report. With those few words, I commend this Report to Parliament. (Report handed over to the Secretary-General) HON. E. Y.
