<body><h3>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- LTA CEO.</h3><h4>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- LTA CEO.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Our locals:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- These Boards of these statutory bodies give professional scrutiny and due diligence in everything that they do. They have the accounting companies that help them:</span> The other thing, maybe my time is going up, but what I want to say, I am sitting here, listening and thinking that the problem with the Government is that you are caught in a time warp. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- You keep thinking that whatever worked in the past is best for the future. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism always used to tell us...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Righting wrongs:</span></p><div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1893 HON. J. USAMATE.- … Boeing is better than Airbus; always. Now, we are happy with Airbus. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Do you really know him? HON. J. USAMATE.- Now, I am sure that he is happy with Airbus. All the time you are talking to us about looking back, but one of the other things that I find funny, there is a contradiction to what they are saying, Sir. They are saying we should apply this to all of these organisations but then there are some organisations that they do not include. Why are they not included?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- They will be included:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Does that mean they will have a different set of rules? The organisation that is not included here is Fiji Roads Authority. Where is Fiji Roads Authority? (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- I also want to know if No. 2, the Agricultural Marketing Authority is different from No. 27 the Fiji Agro Marketing Authority. Are these two different entities or they are the same? This thing is full of errors.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Full of errors:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Full of errors, it is a sign of incompetent drafting.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Blunder after blunder:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Blunder after blunder after blunder:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, the Government also needs to get over this ever-driving need that they that bites them inside to get rid of everything that FijiFirst has done. Get over it! At the beginning of the year they talked about scraping FICAC, now eight months or nine months into the job they realised FICAC is good for this country. They used to talk about, and my very good friend, the honourable Tuisawau was always asking about waqavuka, waqavuka, waqavuka! Who is the shareholder? Now, they buy an aeroplane through exact the same mechanism. (Laughter) Always talking about Walesi, no good, Walesi no good, Walesi, no good! Now, they praise Walesi and want to use Walesi.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Watch the rugby on Walesi:</span></p><p>(Laughter) HON. J. USAMATE.- Honourable Filipe Tuisawau commented about the change in the way the Opposition is carrying out its role, the much more enlightened Opposition. HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Hear, hear!</p><div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div><p>1894 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 HON. J. USAMATE.- The reason for this is clear. When we were in government, I always called the Opposition to come into the light, be enlightened, do things in the best interest of Fiji, rather than opposing, opposing, opposing, opposing. Every single thing - oppose, oppose, oppose!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is what you people are doing. Now we are doing it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> To be an enlightened Opposition, we are now showing you how an Opposition that is in the light acts. When there are things that we believe that we need to agree with, we will agree. We do not disagree for the sake of disagreeing. You have just shown, you are so enlightened that in this State Land Bill that you have passed, you have taken away the hope from the dispossessed people. People who are living on no other land, you have taken their hope away from them. Even though they got into the land in an illegal fashion, you have taken that away from them. That is your enlightenment, to let such people, what you are basically saying to them, “sink or swim, I do not care about you.” This is the freedom that you are talking about that you bring to this country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support this motion. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, ….</p><p>(Chorus of interjections) MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, he has not even started.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> They are fearful, they are fearful.</p><p>(Laughter) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Please, do not bomb them! PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- … earlier this morning, the honourable Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations talked about the fact that they need to repent. I was wondering if you look at the military government, the Bainimarama Government and the FijiFirst Government, you are looking at 15 years to 16 years. Some of them with the Bainimarama Government, some of them were the FijiFirst Government, so essentially, they need to repent for 14 years to 15 years or at least a minimum of eight years, but we will give them a discount, they should repent for four years. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is why honourable Usamate, he has got a favourite word, “hogwash”. What he said just a while ago is an example of real hogwash. (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Isa:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr:</span> Speaker, usually my friend honourable Usamate makes sense, but today he was full of contradiction. He talked about Airports Fiji. Airports Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you increase the departure tax to $200, even honourable Kumar would have probably made better profit than the CEO who was there. There is no comparison to what he was saying and</p><div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1895 both, honourable Maharaj and honourable Usamate, were totally confused. They went on and talked about the Higher Salaries Commission, a very good example of the contradiction. He actually did not understand what the Higher Salaries Commission was. He should have gone and did some research on what it used to do. He said, “Higher Salaries Commission did not have people who have the commercial acumen or who are not going to be able to understand what happens.”</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Go and check the Daily Hansard:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> He is not saying, that is, the people who appoint the Higher Education Commission. The things that they did, Mr. Speaker, and I tell you what happened. There are two things that happened with the FijiFirst and the Bainimarama Government. There is a fundamental difference between Rule of Law and Rule by Law. They did not follow the Rule of Law…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Really:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> … right from 2006, their Decrees, even when they got into government, they did not follow the Rule of Law but they Ruled by Law. Every time something did not work, they will come with the law because the former Attorney- General, the former Prime Minister and some of them who were there they were so used to Rule by Decree. So, when they did the 2013 Constitution under Section 174, they made sure that all the Decrees that they made during the military government was actually preserved in the 2013 Constitution and they got so used to it. So, when they came as a democratic government, they continued to Rule by Law. I will tell you the fundamental difference between Rule of Law. Following the Rule of Law, Mr. Speaker, means fairness.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> What is your Point of Order? (Laughter)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Quote the Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.:</span> What number? HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I stand under Standing Order 60, the speech must be relevant and Standing Order 61 basically says, “… when speaking Members must confine their observations to the subject under consideration.”</p><h4>Mr. Speaker, I think it has been about four minutes.</h4><h4>HON. J. USAMATE.- Two minutes left.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.- Please ask him to be relevant:</span> The diatribe we have heard over and over again, Sir. It is like a broken record. (Laughter)</p><div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div><p>1896 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 Please, ask him to be relevant. We have heard what he wants to say. His already said it a million times. Stick to the topic. Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 61 is what we are objecting under, please ask him to be relevant. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just explain why what I am saying is very relevant because that is what the Higher Salaries Commission is going to do.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Preach it out:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> When you have arbitrary and discretionary powers, removal of the Higher Salaries Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allowed the Ministers, honourable Kumar said that someone gave her a reference honourable Maharaj that honourable Kumar used to hire. Some Ministers, even when they discretionary powers, even if they can be arbitrary about who they appoint, they used independent people to do that, but the power without the Higher Salaries Commission that Ministers and boards had was arbitrary and discretionary. Any situation where there is arbitrary discretionary power, it is bound to be misused at some point in time, Mr. Speaker. That is exactly what happened.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> What are you saying?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> The boards were ruled by the Ministers ….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- No:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The boards were appointed by the Ministers. The boards were dictated by the Ministers because the power was arbitrary about the salaries:</span> So, Mr. Speaker, the Higher Salaries Commission…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> What is your Point of Order? HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Standing Order 62 – Improper Motives. When speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member. (Honourable Members interject) HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Deputy Prime Minister is trying to say that the Boards appoints the Minister. He is trying to say that as if there is something wrong. The Boards are always appointed by Ministers, what is wrong with that? This is improper motive, trying to say that there is something sinister in a Board appointed by the Minister. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, you may continue honourable Minister. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am actually flabbergasted and surprised with the level of intervention, I mean, Point of Order. They are actually misusing the Parliamentary time. They sound so irrelevant because they know that what I am saying is correct.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- It is hogwash:</span></p><div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1897 HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- This is how they did that and we were on record in this Parliament pointing out to them. Whenever they found that things were not working, if a Board that they appointed was not working, then they bring a law and change it.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Your Board at Fiji Airways:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.:</span> They are saying, “Oh, because the system is not working”, just like the Land Transport Authority. (Honourable Members interject) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The Lands Department is not working and if it is not working, you do not look at why it is not working. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when something does not work, their approach was, bring a law, change it. That was ruled by law because they were so used to rule by law and rule by law is unfair, it is not accountable and not transparent. The re-instatement of the Higher Salaries Commission will bring about that accountability and transparency and allow the Higher Salaries Commission to do its own. It does not mean that they cannot hire experts or independent bodies to determine the market, this is the kind of logic that they used. The other point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I want to make is when the Higher Salaries Commission was there, they were able to look at the market. Honourable Usamate suddenly said that we need to hire good people. He is assuming that the members of the Higher Salaries Commission that this Government is going to appoint will not have that kind of experience. That is the assumption he is making. HON. J. USAMATE.- How do you know? HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Because they were practising cronyism and nepotism. They were appointing people who were not qualified.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Fiji Airways Board:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were so used to discretionary powers:</span></p></body>
