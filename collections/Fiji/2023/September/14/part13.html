<body><h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h3><h4>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> The Minister for Agriculture and Waterways has given notice to make Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40. The Minister may speak up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I will invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. I now call on the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways to deliver his Statement. Dredging and Engineering Works HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a Ministerial Statement on Dredging and Engineering Works on major rivers and creeks in Fiji, to control flooding and obtain low value minerals and/or for construction works. The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; our waterways are a major source of livelihood for our people. However, they also often cause hazards to our people during periods of extreme weather conditions. In particular, during increased rainfall periods, sediments and silt are washed into rivers and creeks which lead to flooding in low lying areas. Our communities are exposed to these flooding events on an annual basis, and it is a challenge that requires addressing most effectively and efficiently at all times. The irony of it all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we, as a nation, have to prepare ourselves for nature’s onslaught in the form of natural disasters like floods, et cetera, every year regardless of whether we like it or not. The Department of Waterways is committed to providing a safe and secure environment from flooding, through the desilting, dredging and river engineering works of major river systems in Fiji. The Department has already undertaken many activities to address these crucial issues and will continue to do so in this financial year. We have many rivers and creeks to be looked after and these become important prior to the rainy season. Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of the 2021 to 2022 financial year, a total of 41,870 metres of drains were desilted; 15,911 metres of creeks were desilted in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions, while 400 metres of new drains were excavated in the Western Division with an estimated</p><div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div><p>1832</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 investment of close to half a million dollars. For non-municipal area drainage, a total of 95 drainage schemes have benefitted from this initiative with a total cost of more than $180,000. Further to the 2021 to 2022 financial year, a total of 165,828 metres of farm drains were desilted, while 270,197 metres of creek were desilted, benefitting a total of 72 communities in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions with an investment close to half a million dollars. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the current financial year, the Department of Waterways has committed $3 million for the dredging of the Ba River mouth channel, the Labasa River mouth channel and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Nadi River Diversion near Yavusania Village in the Province of Ba. From the dredging works, a large number of communities in the greater Ba and Labasa areas are expected to benefit from this project. Additionally, the Department has allocated $200,000 for the National Waterways Programme which involves survey and flood mapping exercise of five major river systems, including the Rewa, Ba, Sigatoka, Nadi and Navua Rivers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Waterways has committed $3.8 million for contractors to carry out riverbank protection of the following Villages - Matainoco Village in Tailevu, Bua Lomanikoro Village in the Province of Bua, Matanisivaro Settlement near Qauia River, Wainimakutu Village in Namosi, Waciwaci Village in Lakeba, the upper Sigatoka River and Naivilaca Village in Noco, Rewa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Waterways is currently in the process of formulating a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Government stakeholders to be tabled to Cabinet for approval, and the stakeholders include the Department of Environment, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and iTaukei| Lands Trust Board on a programme called ‘Public Private Partnership (PPP) - Emergency Desilting of Rivers and Creeks’. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme will look after the desilting and dredging works of more than 130 identified rivers and creeks around Fiji. Government stakeholders will facilitate all necessary approvals and permits on behalf of the private contractors who will be carrying out the flood mitigation work on the ground. To recover costs, the private contractors will sell the dredge spoils to construction companies and authorities. Mr. Speaker, the desilting of rivers and creeks will benefit our communities in many ways. It will reduce flooding events, as well as ensuring the protection of livelihoods and infrastructure since the rivers and creeks are an integral part of our ecosystems, they need to be restored and maintained. The risk of flooding is predicted to be high in the future due to the modification of the environment from development activities. Therefore, the Department is monitoring these activities and implementing mitigation strategies to reduce those risks. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to assist with the current waterways’ programmes and to further assist stakeholders as the sugar and now the non-sugar areas, we need to re-establish the Drainage Board. I had alluded to this during my Maiden Speech in this august Parliament and to enable this to happen, we will need to review the current Drainage Act 1961. To-date, we have made a submission to Cabinet and that submission has been approved. The Drainage Act for Fiji was enacted in 1961 which is quite archaic and does not meet our current needs for the development of the agriculture sector. The Act provides for the declaration of drainage areas, authorise the execution of drainage works and provides for the establishment of drainage boards for the maintenance and improvement of certain drainage areas. However, due to certain amendments, some of those powers have changed.</p><div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>1833 Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past, three Drainage Boards was set up in three Divisions namely; the Central, Northern and Western Divisions. The Central Division Drainage Board comprise of 40 drainage schemes, covering an area of 10,428 hectares; the Western Division Drainage Board comprise of 40 drainage schemes, covering an area of 247,000 hectares; and the Northern Division Drainage Board comprise of 20 drainage schemes, covering an area of 211,000 hectares. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past, Drainage Subsidy Funds, through the grant, were budgeted for and provided to the three Drainage Boards through the then Land and Water Resource Management Division to administer and undertake the following: 1. Drainage improvement works of the existing drainage schemes and waterlogged areas; and 2. Drainage infrastructure development maintenance and rehabilitation within our drainage scheme programmes, these include the establishment of seawalls and outfall structures such as floodgates to reduce saltwater intrusion into farming areas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, previously, the main purpose of drainage improvement works within the drainage schemes was to clear waterlogged areas and reduce the impacts of flooding. Our situation now, in addition to drainage, is to look at irrigation to improve farming areas, as well as the use of nature-based interventions for the restoration and maintenance of watershed areas in Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review of the current Drainage Act 1961 will enable us to re-establish the Drainage Boards and ease the workload for the Waterways Division under the Ministry of Agriculture. This will also outline the scope of work to be covered by the Drainage Board and other stakeholders and it will provide the necessary legal powers for the Drainage Board and Waterways Division to carry out their work effectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to deliver this Statement. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate for their response, honourable Minister, for clarification’s sake, is Matainoco Village part of Rewa or Tailevu? HON. V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Matainoco Village is part of Tailevu but it is called Matainoco and is directly opposite Noco. MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the Ministerial Statement, I again convey my apology through you, for leaving Parliament early yesterday on an urgent and rather serious matter that I need to attend to. I did receive the call during dinner and consulted the Caucus so no disrespect of Parliament and to Government as well, given the importance of the motion that was before Parliament. I wish to thank the honourable Minister for his Ministerial Statement and I hope that this will be the last Ministerial Statement from the honourable Minister that I will respond to. I am asking my members of the Caucus if they can also stand up and talk about agriculture and waterways issues. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has correctly highlighted the importance of maintenance of our drains in Fiji. I know for a fact that as the former Minister for Disaster Management, I remembered the 2018 Easter flooding in Ba that caught everyone by surprise. Changing weather patterns in Fiji, particularly the pattern of rainfall, what we are experiencing in</p><div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div><p>1834</p><h4>Ministerial Statements</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Fiji now as a result of climate change, we can easily be bombarded with three months of rainfall in five to six hours. We can say that this overwhelms the capacity because most of our infrastructure and let us except the fact that most of the infrastructure that we have now was designed for that period but what we are experiencing now will take time and it is going to cost money as well. We need to start working on improving these infrastructure because of the change in weather patterns as a result of climate change, particularly. The honourable Minister has justified the reasons behind these dredging works but, perhaps what is, sort of, missing, honourable Minister, from your Statement is about the iron ore that will be used for the construction or probably I have missed it, but it is an opportunity as well. He has talked about the private contractors that are given the spoils - I think this is under the current arrangement. In fact, those spoils are owned by the Ministry of Lands, but I think under the current arrangement because of the lack of capability, I will talk about that as well and maybe if the honourable Minister of Finance can help the honourable Minister for Agriculture on this, that is why they have the current arrangement. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at it in two ways. Firstly, we need the investment and the opportunities out of the iron ore. I will use Ba River, for example, it is rich in magnetite which is an element for iron, and we negotiated with the Land and Water Resource Management LAWRM back then to hold dredging, although we were experiencing flooding in the Ba River, particularly the first few kilometres from the Ba River Mouth because it is rich in magnetite. Although they were asking for the mining licence, but the difficulty in that ore is because it needs to be separated - sand that has the component of magnetite and the normal sand. The easiest way to separate them is when it is still wet and that is why there was a bit delay. It is also present in the Sigatoka River, Sir, but you will recall that we had a bit of argument about the Sigatoka River a few years back. So, it is about mitigating and adaptation that we need to take up. We are aware of the environmental implications but there are opportunities in there that the honourable Minister of Finance needs to look into. While still with the Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated that the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways needs support. He does not have a dredger on his own Ministry now.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> First time, increase the budget.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> The budget is only $3 million for this year, it is insufficient, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but get him a dredging equipment. The Dauqeuqeu has done its time, it is gone. We used to have two. We did the Qawa River and the Labasa River in 2008 and that is why Labasa was safe for the last few years. If you delay the dredging, Labasa will come under water again. Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why he needs the support. Another thing we need in order to support dredging is a reactive measure, but we need to be proactive as well. I am going to talk about Sustainable Land Management Practices, particularly to our farmers. That is something that we need. We have talked about environmental issues, I remind the honourable Deputy Prime Minister again, do not bring environmental issues and then run away as well under cover. This is an environmental issue, it is also a husbandry practice issue, but for us to avoid. There are reports of soil erosion in Fiji which most people are not aware of. We are losing a</p><div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1835 lot of our good soils because of unsustainable land management practices. I will continue to support the Ministry of Agriculture in its efforts on sustainable land management practices because this is a proactive measure to reduce soil erosion so that we can also minimise drainage works. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to provide all the support for deforestation and reforestation. The honourable Minister for Forestry needs to look into this. The honourable Minister for Rural Development, on the other day, talked about Tukuraki. If you go back to the study on Tukuraki, it is when we change the forestry practice, when we brought in pine, pine has needle leaves whereas native Fijian trees have canopies, and that is one of the contributing factors to the landslide in Tukuraki way back in 2012. That is why we need to minimise reforestation and deforestation and, of course, sustainable land practices. These are proactive measures that will help us minimise drainage works and save cost for the Government, which we can use for other benefits. I thank you for the opportunity. MR. SPEAKER.- Before we proceed, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Australian delegation visiting us today, especially, when it is led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, honourable Senator Paddy Wong, and Australia’s High Commissioner to Fiji and Special Envoy to the Pacific, Mr. Ewen McDonald. (Acclamation) We warmly welcome you to the Parliament of Fiji and hope you will enjoy your visit to the Fiji Islands during your visit here. May God bless the cordial relationship (a cordial one) that the great Government of Australia has with our Fiji Government. Thank you, Madam.</p></body>
