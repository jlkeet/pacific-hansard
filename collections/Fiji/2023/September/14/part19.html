<body><h3>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday 11 th September, 2023, I move: That the State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 23/2023), be debated and voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023. The State Lands Act 1945 provides for the administration of State land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 13 of the Act deals with protection leases. At the outset, this should be a clear indication of the sensitivities surrounding leases under the Act. What was done through the State Land (Budget Amendment) Act 2021 was to remove the requirement of obtaining consent from the Director of Lands for any mortgage, charge, pledge, caveat or for any such lease to be dealt with by any court of law or under the process of any court of law with the least amount of consultation ought not to have been done. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2021 Amendment Act also amended section 13 of the Act to provide the consent of the Director can only be refused where there is a breach of any lease condition or where such application to deal with the land is not in accordance with the law. Mr. Speaker, in 2022, section 16 of the Act was amended. It deals with who may now be lessee or lessors. The State Lands (Amendment) Act 2022 amended the Act to empower the Director to re-enter land and cancel any lease, licence or approval notice of lease in instances where occupants of the land have as a result of dispossession of land or due to political upheaval or cancellation or non-renewal of their leases or licenses resorted to seek refuge on the land for which they were not lessees under the Act. In these instances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lessees permitted such persons to use the land it did not obtain the consent of the Director, making the arrangement unlawful under the Act. In effect, this amendment in a way regularises what in fact were illegal arrangements by allowing the Director to re-enter land and cancel the lease license or approve the notice of lease. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be remiss of me not to state this fact outright. A Committee then was set up to confirm the contravention of section 16 when in fact the Act provides for the process to be followed. Let me repeat again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Committee was setup to confirm the contravention of section 16 when in fact the Act already has a process to be followed. This Committee has not sat nor heard any such application to-date and therefore have no added value. The Bill, therefore, seeks to ensure that the amendment made in 2021 and 2022 are removed to respect the status quo that existed prior to these amendments. Sir, from the Government’s end, there were wider consultations on the Bill and based on the outcome of these consultations, this Bill is now being introduced in Parliament. On Monday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had highlighted the key provisions or salient provisions of the Bill. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament.</p><div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div><p>1878 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. As usual, just take note of the one hour and the seven minutes allocated for each speaker as well. I have in front of me a list of speakers who have been identified by the Whips. There are two speakers from the Government side – honourable Vosarogo and honourable Kamikamica. From the Opposition is honourable Kirpal and honourable Koya. We will try and alternate the speakers before the Right of Reply is given. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to Bill 23 of 2023 for an Act to amend the State Lands Act which was introduced to this august Parliament. In fact, the two Bills which were introduced, one was Bill No. 26 of 2022 and the was Bill No.16 of 2021. Firstly, I will be speaking on Bill No. 16 of 2021 which is introduced by Bill No. 23 of 2023. This Bill was supposed to help the poor Fijian in a proactive manner to secure mortgage from financial institutions and caveat without any hindrance or running around. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lessee secures the lease from the Ministry of Lands that is the custodian of all State lands in Fiji. Once the registered lease is given to an individual, the leasehold title is an interest in land entitles the lessee an indefeasible right to use and hold the property; right to use or occupy the property for a specific period and the lessees of the said property has all the right to enjoy the term of lease. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the lessees of State land wishes to get a loan from financial institutes or banks, Bill No. 16 of 2022 made it easier as the lessee can mortgage their lease to the lending institute and get the loan in the short period of time, without running around to the solicitors to act for them, and also save money in the form of fees from the Ministry of Lands. For the poor State land agricultural farmers like sugarcane farmers who take a few thousand dollars of loan for a short period of time due to some urgent need were given relief of not paying unnecessary consent fee of $115. It was a burden on the poor lessees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just have learnt that even though this Bill has not been enacted or passed, there has been a fee schedule already with the Ministry of Lands which was sent to me. It seems that the Government is more of getting revenue than helping the poor farmers or the poor people. This is between the lessee and the lending institute, nothing to do with the lessors of the land. Lessees take the loan as per lessee’s interest in the remaining term of the lease. If the lessee fails to repay, the onus will be on the lending institute to recover, but it does not affect the Government being the lessor, as they will get the rental, premium as per in the lease condition and reassessment of rental will take place normally. It does not affect or decrease the value of the land, if you do not take consent for mortgage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know very well being a Minister for Lands, I was a junior staff in the Ministry, both of us are valuers by profession and not forgetting politician too. Is the Coalition Government giving extra burden to our Fijian people by amending the State Lands Act to make money in the form of fees when the price of goods have increased and the increase in VAT is already affecting the poor people. HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear! HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- The Bill also boosts investor confidence level in State lands since no investor wants to waste time. They want to get on with the investment project. The consent takes weeks and months, and it is a waste of time. The other consents are still intact such as transfer, rezoning, subletting, sale, subleasing, building, et cetera, as these have a direct impact on the Director of Lands being the lessor.</p><div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 1879 The other Bill which is the amendment where the Committee was formed to regularise the informal settlements on State land. Regarding informal tenants and houses, majority of the houses are on agricultural land, and we have seen that they have been living there for ages. They have water metre and EFL connections. To regularise them and give them a title which will benefit them, they can take a loan to have a good house, and with a good title means they will be living healthy lives because they will have a house which they can build in accordance with the building plan. That was the reason for having the Committee to regularise the informal settlements. If you go anywhere in the Western Division, you will see that in the agricultural holdings there are more than two houses where one house is for the owner. The lessees have sold the land illegally. So, it was to regularise the tenants who were sitting there to give them good tenants. In that way, the Government will get revenue in the form of rental when it is regularised and subdivided, and a good title is given to them. This was a wise thing which the government was doing. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to reconsider the Bill No. 23 of 2023 as it does not have any adverse effect to any stakeholders, but in fact it encourages other Fijians to lease land. It increases the value of the land and in return, the State benefits in land rental which is a Government revenue. The current Act reduces unnecessary running around for any Fijian lessee and for the betterment of all stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you want the real truth and reconciliation, it should start from this Bill if the Government wants to serve the people of Fiji. With those views, I oppose the motion before this Chamber. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Again, thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to address Parliament on the Bill that is presently being debated. I mentioned that my acknowledgment for this afternoon has finished, I was just remined Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I apologise by honourable Tuisawau, I am sure that I am going to be supported by honourable Naivalurua to acknowledge again in basketball, Suva Grammar School wining the three girls’ titles that was fought over the school break. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers in Cabinet and Members of Parliament, I rise to present my contribution to the State Lands (Amendment) Bill tabled before Parliament. This Bill is fundamental to the effective and efficient administration of State Land in Fiji whereby the safety mechanism is reinstated to safeguard not only the State Land leases but also to ensure that financial institutions have given money or lent money for investments are protected. The amendment made by Act No. 21 of 2021 have lessen the authority of the Director of Lands as provided for under section 13(1) and that section essentially prohibits any lessees from dealing with any leases without the consent of the Director of Lands first being obtained. By background Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the other side of Act No. 22 which we have appealed on the previous sitting of Parliament, so this cousin of that Act needs to go out as well because you cannot have two land tenure and management system at the same time. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment made by Act No. 21 of 2021 allows for lessees to go directly to the banks, lending institutions without the Director’s consent to use lease as a collateral for their borrowing. Therefore, that Amendment brought about by section 21 has impeded or affected the Director of Lands’ powers under the Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the commencement of Act No. 21 of 2021, revenue generated from fees that are paid for application of consent have really taken a drastic turn. For example, if I can</p><div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div><p>1880 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 take two years of each, post the introduction of the Act and two years up until now. In 2019 and 2020, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources was able to receipt $48,087 from 109 consent applications received from lessees. In the two years post the 2021 Act coming into force, just below $8,000 was recorded as revenue. So, a total loss to Government coffers of $40,000. It is also important Mr. Speaker, Sir, to note that lending institutions have now assumed risks of verifying companies and individuals who have come to them for mortgages. Furthermore, after the implementation of Act No. 21 of 2021 lending institutions raised their concerns with the Office of the Director of Lands in relation to the security in their investments. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry in consultation with Association of Banks in Fiji then agreed to formulate a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate data sharing through an online portal daily so that they could both understand the dealings that are taking place between those who lease and the banks who provide the funds over the lease. There is justification, Mr. Speaker, for repealing the State Lands (Amendment) Act 2022, in particular, the insertion of section 16(4) by Act No. 26 of 2022 effectively meant that the Director can re-enter land and or cancel lease provided there are no encumbrances on the land. This was in contradiction to the previous process of the Ministry whereby if there is even encumbrance on the land, the Director of Lands could still re-enter the land and recover what is owed to the State. The Committee to this date, Mr. Speaker, has not resolved any issues or cleared any case presented for its consideration. This august House needs to be informed that even after being tabled before the Committee, applications still need and require the Director of Lands’ endorsement and following through with the relevant process. So, it is just an addition to bureaucratic processes that are not good for good governance. Sir, it does not really streamline the processes but indirectly add another layer of bureaucracy to the existing process that was there before. Mr. Speaker, we often say this, “when it is not bad, do not fix it”. There was nothing wrong with the processes that were there before. The Director of Lands was capable and indeed carried out the job. When there, he or she finds that there are illegal occupation of land and if there needs to be rectification or regularisation, that was processed before because it was within the Director of Lands’ powers to decide what to do in order to regularise them. So, we say, Sir, that because it was totally unnecessary to begin with, it is not necessary to maintain it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully and wholeheartedly support the Bill that is before Parliament this afternoon. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, just a little comment in response to the honourable Minister of Lands, he said there were some $40,000 that was being collected with respect to consent fees and then when this amendment came about, it was reduced to $8,000. It is a small price to pay with respect to facilitation in terms of investment and in terms of those that were dispossessed off their land. I think that is a small price to pay if you really, really look at it. Mr. Speaker, you will be well aware of this Bill because you made a very historical contribution on this when it was on the floor. For those who were not here in Parliament when that took place, this was borne out of the proposition that a lot of people were dispossessed off their land whose leases were not renewed and, essentially, they became refugees. A lot of farmers who own State Land had made arrangements with these people and said, “look give me $1,000 or so and you can put your house in the corner of that land.” There are a lot of these cases especially in Nadi, as you are well aware, Sir, being a former Minister and also being quite aware of that particular circumstance, but you did make some references which I will refer to.</p><div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 1881 Mr. Speaker, what this amendment had done or sort to do was, for example, give the Director of Lands the ability to cancel the head lease or the lease itself to be able to issue separate leases for those people who had been living there bona fide since the land was given to them. Again, obviously there was a particular system put in place that everyone is referred to with respect to a Committee that was chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Housing and Community Development and consisted of the Permanent Secretary for Lands, Office of the Solicitor-General and anyone else, for example, who they wished to include in that Committee, maybe the Director of Town and Country Planning, et cetera. Once they established this in a particular area and sold off the land to these people, albeit illegally under the law as technically speaking, they had been occupying this particular piece of land for maybe 30 or 40 years, they will then be able to cancel the original lease and be able to issue these leases with the Director of Lands. He or she will be able to do that, so it is being facilitated to those that were actually living on the land. This is essentially what this did, Mr. Speaker. Obviously, we cannot cancel the lease if there is an encumbrance on it. If there is a mortgage on it, or a caveat on it, then those legal issues need to be taken care of before any new leases were issued. Consultations did take place at that time when the amendment was done, with many groups and various people made submissions. There was a lot of frustration on the ground with respect to this particular situation that is being referred to but what transpired was at that time the Director of Lands hands were tied. She could not do anything, she could not move because the current law would not allow her to do it. A lot of people who actually just sold the land on that basis are nowhere to be found. They had moved on or migrated so what are you supposed to do as they had allowed these people to build these houses on a particular piece of land. Now, let me just refer this Parliament to a lot of wisdom, we all know that. He contributed at that time and said that in the introduction of the motion that is to do with this particular motion, we are trying to amend and provide areas of redress for people that are already there or to check out how they have come upon that particular piece of land. Specific reference was made to Malolo and other places that the honourable Speaker was actually quite aware of. I think in the end, there was stark realisation as this needed to be done, it was facilitative and it is facilitative for those that become landers because of the law having also being out of pocket because they paid the person who actually had the lease. As I have said, the honourable Speaker showed a lot of wisdom at that particular time by saying that the Committee would need to do a lot of investigation - he supported the idea. As you can see, it was very bipartisan in terms of what was being done at that time. You cannot portray that they did something wrong. You have to look at the reasoning by which it was done. There are also supposed to be regulations - these things take time the former Minister for Lands is here. Little bit more consultations and conversations and he would have been able to tell you how far things could have gone. There are a lot of findings that needed to come before everything was complete and hunky dory, so to speak. Mr. Speaker, in fact, what the amendment did then was give the Director of Lands the ability to issue another lease to these people lawfully whereas before, the hands of the female Director of Lands hands were tied. She would get a lease done on that reject piece of land which they were occupied. Under the law because a person who owns his parcel of land, owns his lease under the law, they have to cancel the lease so no one can actually occupy that piece of land so literally they would be thrown out of that piece of land before anything could be done, you have to issue another lease over that whole land. Mr. Speaker, for this, the Director for Lands can actually cancel the lease and these people would still be protective because it does say so in the Bill itself. I will actually quote what it says:</p><div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div><p>1882 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 “For the avoidance of any doubt, any occupant of the land referred to under this section including the lessee shall remain on the land, subject to any terms and conditions of any lease, license or approval notice of a lease granted after the enactment of the State Land Act.” There is no sinister move behind it, honourable Attorney General - nothing at all. It was just being facilitative. I think that is what the honourable Speaker, who was an MP then in the Opposition, caught on too - that it was being facilitative. It was being of assistance to those who were basically lead up the garden path. Mr Speaker, just to qualify it also, this was not to do with squatters. This was actually to do with people who had gone to occupy the land because the original lessee allowed them to do so. It was not that situation and that committee is useful. We have to be very independent when we think about this. What was it for? there’s nothing sinister about it no power taken away from the Director of Lands like you might want to see it as. It was not but in fact, it was empowering her more to do the right thing. Mr Speaker, with those few words, I do not support the motion before Parliament. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, three words come to mind when I am listening to the other side - grasping at straws. The reason why I say that is very simple. As alluded to by honorable Vosarogo, the truth is this change was brought in on the back of the will go out at the back of Bill 17. It was hidden in the Consequential Bill. It was never discussed and all of a sudden, the change happened. HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yes, true! True! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- As the honourable Vosarogo mentioned, this is the cousin or the brother or the sister of the other Bill and so in some respects Mr Speaker, Sir, the destination of this Bill or this Act that we have, would follow the same way as Bill No. 17. I would just like to read to them what His Excellency the President said in his maiden speech, and I quote: “The views of all communities must be heard and I urge the people’s coalition Government to ensure all initiatives, draft legislations, must go thorough consultation, process for better outcomes, to ensure inclusiveness, foster greater ownership. Government must ensure that draft laws are deliberated in consultation with relevant stakeholders particularly through the standing committee process, petitions must be accommodated so that the views of the people must be heard in Parliament.” Mr Speaker Sir, we on this side of Parliament are doing our best to try and consult unlike that side of Parliament. It is reflected in the statistics in terms of Standing Order 51. As an example of our desire to consult, we heard the honourable Members on the other side about the need to look at the Heritage bill in a bipartisan manner, so we withdrew it. And so, Mr Speaker, before we talk about the detail of the Bill, the very fact that they did not consult is actually something we will need to bring out in this type of debate. I can assure those on that side, for those of us, that might have Bills are coming through, we will endeavour to consult properly. Apart from being the new Fiji, this is a new democracy that we are trying to promote in Fiji.</p><div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 1883 Sir, it is strange what they have done in the first amendment in section 13, and for the life of me, I am still trying to wonder why this was brought in. I hope, in this term of Government, we will find out the real reason why this thing happened. They were talking about poverty, but the irony is that the ITLTB process was a lot faster than this process. I hope that they disclose the real reason before this side of the Parliament finds out the real reason. We have some inkling….</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- No consultation:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- But I am encouraging them to self-disclose before we disclose to the people of Fiji of what actually happened. Secondly Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Director of Lands as alluded to as well by honourable Vosarogo, perhaps we had given too much power to the Director of Lands through this amendment, and we are regularising that as well. As we know Sir, too much power in one person’s hand can be very risky. Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of ease of doing business, like I said this is a classic example of what they try and talk about, but they do not follow through. This amendment created an extra process or additional process for the banks to follow through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), so this nonsense about being efficient, they are overlaying it with additional process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this Act came into being, it was full of contradictions. There was no transparency, no consultation so like Bill 17 – it is gone. HON. S. S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, knows about it. He was the former Minister for Lands. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just forgot to highlight but I will do so now. During the discussion of this Bill on 30 th July, 2021, this august Parliament actually congratulated our seven gladiators winning the Olympics in Japan. I also note there was a reference made by the other side that it was not part of the budget. This is what I read about what the former Attorney- General said: “Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament of the Friday 6 th of July, 2022,</p><h4>I move that the following Consequential Bills be debated, voted upon and passed …</h4><p>(9) State Land (Budget Amendment) Bill 2021” HON. F. S. KOYA.- …Who said that - a Point of Order, Sir… MR. SPEAKER.- Yes.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, no one said that it was not part of the Budget.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> What is the Point of Order honourable Koya? HON. F. S. KOYA.- SO 74(1)(a) – there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament. He is trying to mislead Parliament, because no one on this side said that it was not in the Budget. I think either you misheard it…</p><div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div><p>1884 State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 MR. SPEAKER.- I am still looking at this Standing Order, honourable Koya.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He is reading what is in the Daily Hansard:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> Practice of Parliament, I may raise a Point of Order? There is a breach of Standing Order or practice of Parliament and that is a breach of Parliament practice that you mislead the Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Carry on. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Sir, the point here is that, I think maybe the Attorney-General was misguided here, no one on this side of Parliament said that it was not part…</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> …he is reading the Daily Hansard .</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- I am reading the Daily Hansard:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> No, the statement before that, Sir, you said that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> Are yaar , not a Point of Order.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> Not Are yaar, suno re…thora suno bhai… HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Not a Point of Order, you are making a mountain out of a molehill. All he did was pointing out a fact that it was part of the Consequential Bill. (Honourable Members interject)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You made your point:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order! HON. F. S. KOYA.- I love the mountain out of a molehill - for eight years we sat here and he made so many mountains, Sir. (Laughter) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this - because it came as part of the Consequential Bill for Budget purposes, there was no consultation. HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- The point is this, because it came as part of the consequential for the Budget, there was no consultation, simple as that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Yes, there was.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.:</span> If you look through my brief there was wider consultation, and may I refer to the honourable Usamate’s comment. Give me the opportunity and I will do so. HON. J. USAMATE.- Where is this? What did I say? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- The Daily Hansard of 30 th July, 2021, if we take a moment, honourable Usamate said, and I quote:</p><div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1885 “I fully support this Bill Mr. Speaker, Sir, because it does two things. First it benefits the government and it benefits lessees in a short of time for them to process their dealings and also reduce backlog. Two, at the same time it does not compromise the status of government of the state as a landowner.” We just listened to honourable Vosarogo, we lost income, we created a committee, we did not deliberate, it did not work.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.- This is ridiculous:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Fiji being a small island State cannot have two jurisprudence or two types of land dealings:</span> When you have i Taukei and land, it is too small - this Act has to be amended. This is what we campaigned for, and we are doing it today. I commend this Bill to Parliament. Question put. Motion agreed to. [State Land (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 23/2023), moved under Standing Order 51 passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. ……. of 2023)]</p></body>
