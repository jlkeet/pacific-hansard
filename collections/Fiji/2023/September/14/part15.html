<body><h3>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>HIGH COURT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 11 th September, 2023, I move: That the High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 20/2023) be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the High Court (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023. The High Court Act 1875 provides for the establishment of the High Court of Justice for Fiji. In 2021, the High Court (Amendment) Act 2021, amended the Act and the Magistrate Court Act of 1944 to establish the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Anti-Corruption Division of the Magistrate Court respectively. Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of background, Fiji had ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption in 2008. Consequently, we all set up the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) committed to effectively combat corruption in order to promote transparency and accountability for the attainment of zero tolerance of corruption, set the foundation for good governance and create sustainable development for the benefit of all citizens of Fiji. As mentioned by my predecessor in this august Parliament when the 2021 amendment was being updated upon, the 2021 amendment was to allow the consistent application of anti-corruption Jurisprudence in relation to corruption cases, the specialisation of Judges and Magistrates in anti- corruption law and the adherence to international norms and standards to anti-corruption. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the consistent application of anti-corruption jurisprudence in relation to corruption cases, what is to say that it would not be developed if the anti-corruption matters were not presided over in the normal courts. If anything, by allowing all normal courts to consider anti-corruption matters, this would allow for Judges and Magistrates to further learn and develop the jurisprudence and learning on any anti-corruption matter, as the current case as it be. For example, all Magistrates hear family, civil matters and they also hear criminal matters. There is no distinction in the type of criminal matters whether it is anti-corruption or any other offences that is covered under the Crimes Act. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the 2021 amendment was to provide for the establishment of the specialised Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and Magistrate Court in Fiji, in practice, this has not been the case. There are currently two specialised anti-corruption courts, and both of these are in Suva. This has meant that for the jurisdictions where there are no specialised courts, such as the outer jurisdictions, the same Judges and Magistrates who hear general, criminal or civil matters will also preside over anti-corruption matters. This essentially defeats the whole purpose of having specialised and anti-corruption courts.</p><div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 1857 As mentioned during the debate in the 2021 amendment, 17 countries had established specific anti-corruption courts. While we, as a country should always strive for the development and betterment of our legal system and its jurisprudence, it is also important to contextualise the application of international legal norms and the standards of our national legal systems noting its peculiarity to a country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we do not have specialised courts in Fiji, such as, Family Courts, Tax Tribunal and Employment Relation Courts, these courts were established by reason of necessity, and more so, the volume of matters that had to be specifically considered within these specialised courts. The same cannot be said for the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court Act. From 1 st May to 31 st July this year, during the fourth quarter, the Investigation Department of FICAC recorded a total of 280 matters. Of these 280 matters, 265 matters were carried forward from previous quarters, the Legal and Prosecution Department of FICAC had also provided that as of 31 st July this year, there are 180 cases pending before the courts. Essentially it is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is less corruption-related cases being filed on a day-to-day basis. With 180 pending cases before the courts, this is not a great number that it warranted the establishment of a specialised court. If anything, there should have been consideration for the establishment of specialised courts for serious sexual offences. For instance, as per the rape and sexual offences statistics released by the Office of the Director Public Prosecution in 2020, 246 people were charged with a total of 531 counts of sexual offences. In 2021, 203 people were charged with a total of 461 counts of sexual offences. In 2022, 302 people were charged with a total of 768 counts of serious sexual offences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if anything, this alarming statistics should have warranted the establishment of a specialised sexual offences court. While the 2021 Amendment was purportedly to address issues of inefficiencies, lengthy litigation and backlog of cases clearly as per the statistics provided by FICAC, unfortunately, this has not been the case. Mr. Speaker, Sir, another point to note is that while the 2021 Amendment established the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court, with the matters appealed to the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, it would still be heard with other matters by the same appellate Judges, as other Appellate Judges have not been specialised to reflect the Anti-Corruption Division as established for the lower courts. There is also the argument that the Anti-Corruption Courts duplicate the already existing courts that have potentially led to a wastage of what is already much needed resources in our courts system. Corruption matters can be handled within our existing court framework without the need of specialised courts. The resources that had been used for the maintenance of the anti-corruption court could be and should be used to strengthen the justice system as a whole, including the training of judges, prosecutors as the case may be. Accordingly, the Bill seeks to amend the High Court Act 1875 to disestablish the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court respectively. As already stated on Monday, 11 th September, 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been consultations with the Office of the Chief Registrar, Office of the Solicitor-General and also public consultations were held in Suva, Nadi and Labasa. Mr. Speaker, Sir, noting the intention of the 2021 Amendment, it has not provided specific improvement. May I say again, it has not provided specific improvement to the administration for dealing with anti-corruption matters. For this reason, it is imperative that the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court should be disestablished. Accordingly, Mr.</p><div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div><p>1858 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and the debate will be limited to one hour only. The Secretary-General of Parliament will be doing the timing, as usual, and I think we each will be provided seven minutes at least, six minutes first bell sounds and then the balance will be sounded on the second bell. We have one speaker from Government and three from the Opposition. Honourable Bulitavu will lead the batting followed by honourable Ratu Niudamu before the honourable Minister for Lands will be making his contribution and then the honourable Leader of the Opposition could be rounding it off. HON. M. D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a brief contribution to the motion that is before Parliament and that is the High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023. Again, Sir, FICAC has been subject to plenty political debates in the past and in the present. We have heard and I have quoted the honourable Attorney-General from a few months ago after he had labelled FICAC as being weaponised by the previous government. But again, FICAC has got a purpose and as he had rightly stated, it was part of the 2008 United Nations Convention Against Corruption when we ratified that. It was part of the 2013 Constitution and also moving forward like other jurisdictions, there are 17 jurisdictions around the world that have special Anti-Corruption Courts. We followed suit in 2021 with the idea that has been alluded to by the honourable Attorney- General and as stated by the mover of the motion then the former Attorney-General, which was to improve consistency in the jurisprudence of the Court and also the backlog. But the honourable Attorney-General has stated that administratively, from what they have seen after implementation, there is no problem. But again, from this side of Parliament, I would suggest we give it a time again given that we could see other jurisdictions - how they move forward after taking that second step we did in 2021 after domestication, and our commitment to those international treaties. Now we can put more resources into a court system so as to improve the deliverables of a FICAC. Also, as part of the functions of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law, and Human Rights, we deal with the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Annual Reports. We have also heard from the former Commissioner for FICAC and the various developments that is happening in FICAC, and how to achieve its vision and mission and that is to provide an anti-corruption society. We have various programmes like the Good Kiddo Programmes and other awareness programs that is done in public with members of the public. Various Government Ministries have also developed their own Anti-Corruption Policies and Booklets. These are all measures in place that have helped awareness on how to reduce corruption. As the honourable Attorney-General said that the number of cases that is gone before the Court has really gone down. It also shows the hard work that is being done by FICAC. And how to take FICAC to another level is the duty that the honourable Minister is tasked to do given this independent body reports under him. But again, more resources can be put there and we can develop jurisprudence in this particular Division of the Court where we can get more specialist Judges, Magistrates and other technical aspects of that. Look at how other jurisdictions have developed after they have established this specialised Division of their Courts. If that analysis can be done and assessment, then we will be in a better position after you have taken this bold step. Again, he has mentioned there could be other areas we can move into like the Sexual Offences Court and other special Courts but those are things that should improve our Court</p><div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 1859 system, that the honourable Attorney-General after this consultation will know that there is much needed resources in the Court system in order for cases to be dealt with much more quicker. Those are a few things that I would like to share but this side of Parliament is of the view that is to give more time to this independent institution given our commitment to the United Nations Concession for Corruption. Also, we can resource this more but one of the reasons is stated in the background of the Bill - the difficulties that they have in this particular Anti-Corruption Division and proceedings in outer islands - that could be improved by putting more budget in this particular institution. HON. RATU J. B. NIUDAMU.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution on Bill No. 20 of 2023 regarding an amendment to the High Court Act 1875. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the honourable Attorney-General’s submission to this august Parliament this afternoon regarding the background of this Bill, I have some reservations. As alluded to earlier by honourable Bulitavu it is not only the first time for a specialised court to be established in Fiji. We understand that there is a Family Division of the High Court, the Court of Review which was established under the Customs Act, the Tax Court which was established under the Tax Administration Act of 2009 and most recently, the Employment Relations Court which is under the Employment Relations Act. However, it is not only about the specialisation of Judges and Magistrates, but I believe it is the workload of Judges and Magistrates. To date, we have seen that pending cases are still in Court backdated to 2019 and some to 2016. With this Bill being enacted, all these cases will be transferred back to the normal courts, and it will create more workload for the Judges and Magistrates. I have read the Background of this Bill and one of the main issues which came up in the background which I have read, is the instances which were dealt with outside the respective Anti- Corruption Division, such as proceedings in the outer islands. I believe there are not many FICAC cases because offenders of this nature are white collar crimes, mostly in our towns and cities. Therefore, for example, someone staying in Rakiraki would have to travel from Rakiraki to Lautoka High Court which is the only High Court in the Western Division, just for his anti-corruption case to be heard in the normal courts. There are already pending criminal cases. Magistrates already have pending family, civil, criminal cases and on top of that, these anti-corruption cases will come up again. I agree with honourable Bulitavu that the honourable Attorney-General should review this Bill again or, if he can, give some more time for this Bill to be considered, particularly if the views of the Judges and Magistrates can be heard. From my experience in going to Court nowadays, accused persons are also complaining. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a legal maxim that "justice delayed is justice denied". If the Government comes up with this Bill to be enacted, I ask the honourable Attorney-General to consider the backlog which is currently in our normal courts so that the accused or the suspects are not affected by these changes. That is my contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament and people of Fiji; we started off with a very serious Bill this afternoon, so before I participate on that Bill, I have been told that I have about seven minutes. Firstly, let me take some time, Mr. Speaker, with your leave. I know we have had some special mentions this week at Parliament, with birthdays of two of our Members of Parliament - the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; not to mention the acknowledgement and congratulatory remarks made by honourable Bainivalu to the</p><div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div><p>1860 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 winning QVS Deans team and acknowledging Natabua. For the first time and historically, Natabua reached the Deans final, which is an achievement on its own, so we congratulate them, and I think the honourable Prime Minister also congratulated the Natabua Team and its management. Today, Mr Speaker, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate Suva Grammar School for their feat in winning the four netball titles that was available in the girl’s grade under 14, under 15, under 17 and under 19, which is a clean sweep for Suva Grammar in 2023. I do not know whether it has happened in the past and I do declare my interest because my daughter plays in one of those teams. I take this time to acknowledge both the players, the support of the Principal and the staff, master Navi specifically and not forgetting the SGS rise up and the old scholars. In my next contribution I will mention Suva Grammar again so I think I will leave that for then. Mr Speaker, on the 3 rd of March 2021, I wrote an opinion soon after I think, this amendment took its passage through Parliament in February, if I am not wrong, of that year. I mentioned that the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court and the Magistrates Court was not warranted in 2021, and I did not see any significant reason why it is even warranted now. I will explain, Mr Speaker, to the benefit of this Parliament, the reason why I say those comments. Firstly Mr Speaker, when that Bill went into Parliament or came through Parliament in 2021, I suspected that no one who really practiced in the criminal corridors, was ever consulted. Fiji Law Society (FLS) was not consulted which was at that time, the only body that a lot of lawyers were a part of, not to mention that there was a separate criminal bar that was not formerly an association, but we would meet quite often - normally across the coffee house at the FBC building. Because it didn’t have, Mr Speaker, the wide consultation that this Bill has had in this Parliament today, as explained by the honourable Attorney General, at that time (in my view) it lacked the energy it needed for that Bill to take its course through Parliament in 2021. As I mentioned, and as alluded to by the honourable Attorney General this Bill has had consultation. The Fiji Law Society has been consulted, practitioners have been consulted and various stakeholders had also been consulted before Government decided to bring this into Parliament. Mr. Speaker, Sir, FICAC was also established as a Decree No. 11 in 2007 and it commenced on 4 th April, 2007. So contrary to the belief that was held by the two previous speakers we did that because we ratified the anti-corruption convention by the UN. The UN Anti-Corruption ratification came in 2008, we started FICACA in 2007. What was really the reason for the establishment of FICAC as an anti-rot body? It was seen to be a flagship of the Bainimarama Government at that time. As you remember Mr. Speaker, Sir, at that time, it seemed to have been one of the things they had to check off, that they had now satisfied one of the reasons why the overthrow of a properly elected government was done in the previous year in the month of December. Two years later in 2009, they threw away a properly consulted Constitution of 1997. Yet, Mr. Speaker, even way, way back then in 2007, they did not see it fit, even at that time, to establish the accompanying specialised courts. It took the FijiFirst Government almost 14 years later to finally decide (wait hold on a minute, we have got an anti-rot body) we need anti-rot courts. That is what happened in 2021. Mr. Speaker, Sir, fourteen years later, it is flabbergasting for the government in 2021 to cook up an anti-corruption court to supplement the work of the anti-corruption body that they established 14 years previously. Mr. Speaker, Sir, why do we need specialised courts? What usually triggers a country to set up these specialised courts? We have specialised courts and the two previous speakers have alluded</p><div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 1861 to that - the Family Court and the Employment Court. We also have the Juvenile Court, but what is peculiar about these courts is when the enabling issue legislation is enacted, it brings the courts with it. That is what happened and that is what did not happen in these anti-corruption regime that we are talking about today. One of the reasons why specialised courts are usually established is because there has to be a bona fide reason, not just reason. A bona fide reason why it should be established. For example, one of the reasons why specialised courts are established is because a government might find if there is an increase in offending of a type of offence or similar offences of similar nature. For example, when a Bill to introduce the Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court at that time in 2021, Fiji was facing horrendous statistics on sexual offences, rapes, indecent assault and even minor acts, domestic violence against women, young girls and the vulnerable of our society. The second reason I want to express here today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is when there is a need for specialised courts, there has to be trainings that has to accompany the setting up of those courts and respective judges, staff, prosecutors and all the players that are involved. Again, for example, when a child complainant in a sexual offence is giving evidence, there has to be special mechanism built around the courts to ensure that a degree of sensitivity is afforded to those who are participating in the trial. Special playrooms, for example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, here in Suva have to be set up so that young victims are able to be accommodated next to their best environment when they are giving evidence. Other issues like recordings and camera or proceedings in camera, and separators to stop the line of 3.09:31 from victims to see the perpetrators. These are all things that specialised courts have to go through. MR. SPEAKER.- Could you round off, honourable Minister? HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- The long and short answer to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that there is no justification for the establishment of anti-corruption division of courts. And I say this out of experience Mr. Speaker, Sir. When someone, for example, from Rakiraki is charged fresh by FICAC, that person has to be taken to Ba or if the Ba Magistrates Court is not sitting, all the way to Lautoka just for a five-minute appeal. Who does it cost? It cost taxpayers because they have to be transported all the way to Ba. If Ba Magistrates Court is not sitting all the way to Lautoka. Nadi for example Mr. Speaker, if someone is charged in Nadi all the way to Lautoka Magistrates Court who is authorised to sit at Anti-Corruption magistrate, not there but all the way to Ba. It costs to set-up these specialised courts. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, these offences are not new, they have always been there in the penal code, in the prevention of bribery offences, always been there nothing special about these cases. They can be prosecuted like every other offence and so there is no reason why Mr. Speaker, the Anti- Corruption division of the High Court and the Magistrate Court should be maintained, it should be returned back as normal. All the Magistrates and the judges can deal with them and also will be able to accumulate the experience that is needed in their own personal development as judicial officers. I support the Bill Mr. Speaker. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Three lawyers have spoken and thank you for allowing a bush lawyer to also contribute to the motion in the Parliament. My simple question is, is it a problem of the law itself, the act itself or is it the process that enables this law to operate effectively? I ask that question again, is it a question about the law itself or is it a question about the effectiveness of the administrative system that is to support this law so that it can be effective.</p><div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div><p>1862 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 Let me assure the honourable Minister for Lands that this is not something that was just cooked up by the Fiji First Government in 2021 and I will refer to this consultation document that was done in 2007 before the establishment of FICAC and of course it talks about the effectiveness of Fiji’s legal system as well. So, it is nothing that was cooked up by the Fiji First Government.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Consultation was cooked up:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> This consultation is more reliable than the last economic summit where you only have one, two, sometimes no attendance at all Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is more than a thousand consultations throughout Fiji.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- False participation. Justify the coup:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> The effectiveness of Fiji’s legal system, I will not go into the details. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Why did it take14 years? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Minister for Lands is aware of the BT 1994 report, the Commission of enquiry report by justice John Corners. This are some of the reference materials used in this document that led to the formation of the Anti-Corruption Court. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Anti-Corruption Community, what did they recommend? HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- You have talked about the rectification, I will not go into the rectification Mr. Speaker, Sir, but this is what I want to read to the honourable Minister and the honourable Attorney General, page 121 of this document, if you are interested, I suggest you read this document. It talks about specialised courts. this is what it says, the issue of creating specialised courts has also been raised as one way of assisting the people of Fiji by giving particular and specialised attention to specific sorts of legal cases.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> 14 years took too long.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- But nothing cooked up:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Domestic violence cause:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You focus on environmental issues:</span></p><p>(Laughter) There is already a specialised division of the Courts to deal with family and juvenile matters. This gave birth to the Charter...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Charter did not ..:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- The recent Employment Promulgation establishes a separate division for employment matters:</span> This is it, Sir, FICAC supports the creation of a corruption division of the High Court. In relation to specialisation in the High Court Beattie concluded that administrative divisions in the High Court stating that the better approach” this is, why I asked is it about the law or is it about the processes and systems and the resources that have to support it in order for it to be</p><div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 1863 effective? This is what Beattie said, ‘that it was not desirable to create a separate civil, criminal, commercial, family and administrative division in the High Court stating that the better approach was that a reasonable degree of specialisation should be encouraged whenever practicable on an administrative basis. On an administrative basis whenever it is practicable, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My simple question is, again, is it about the law or is it about the processes and the resources as already alluded to by honourable Bulitavu. Because it was just during FijiFirst days that we are dismantling it. We are here for the future of Fiji. We need that effective court systems to support investment in the country and these are avenues that bring investor confidence into the country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Let us not be short-sighted:</span></p><p>(Hon. M. S. N. Kamikamica interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Cut out the politics:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Order, order! Carry on, honourable Member. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us look at the national interest. Let us look at how this will benefit every Fijian at most particularly creating that environment that investor friendly environment so that we can grow the economy, so that we can employ more people, so that we can do more development and most importantly create that better Fiji that we want. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may first reply to the issue of delay. Yes, the issue of delay in our court system is systematic, it is chronic because it is based on the resources, it is based on the system and processes. As for the Western Division there is a new Court in Ba which will be opened this year and honourable Niudamu is fully aware that there will be a High Court sitting in Ba for the first time, that will be addressed in terms of the issue of delay. The honourable Chief Justice is putting in place processes into improving the disposition of matters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may address this, this is the first time ever for a Chief Justice in his Acting capacity has personally audited the files of all judicial officers in this nation. He is fully aware how many pending matters Justice A has, the length of those matters and some of these processes have been put in place. Some of them have been directed to finish those pending matters. Yes, we all know at the Summit it was clearly outlined that it can only have confidence in a judicial system if there is a rule of law, if people can see that the matters are concluded. Government is trying its best, of course, you have seen there is a new Justice of Court of Appeal and Supreme Judges who have been sworn in and there will be more. But what I can tell you is this, this side of Parliament have localised emergency. That is the achievement we have made because I firmly believe and we also believe that we cannot allow to pay exorbitant salaries to people who are not residents when we have oversupply of lawyers and experienced lawyers. That is a fact, and if you ask about poverty that is one simple reason and I can tell you, I really do not want to divulge the details but it is so unfair. I say this because I am the one who was affected, we found out that the local Judges, Magistrates terms and conditions of employment are not as the same as those who are from overseas. Yes, data Mr. Speaker, Sir, specialize court is only warranted if there is data it is simple, if there is not data to justify a special court, Mr. Vosarogo has outlined</p><div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div><p>1864 Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 clearly the issue of people traveling from one end of the town to the other. I actually had a personal experience, first I was told I have a client in Nadi to be produced in Nadi, as I was getting ready I was told ‘you have to go to Lautoka’ then in 10 minutes’ time I was told ‘go to Ba’, and I had to rush from Nadi to Ba and I have had to go and wait for the FICAC Officers to arrive, about two vehicles and it did not last than five minutes for that matter, so these are the problems. And mind you, my colleagues from the other side, there has been a consultation within the Judiciary, support from the Judges and also from the Chief Justice. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Bill before this Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast - 29 Ayes Noes - 24 Noted Voted - 2 Motion agreed to. [High Court (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 20/2023), moved under Standing Order 51 passed and enacted by Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. … of 2023)]</p></body>
