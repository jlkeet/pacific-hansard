<body><h3>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h3><h4>COMMUNICATION FROM THE SPEAKER</h4><p>Clarification on Deferment of Parliamentary Business Honourable Members, before we move on to the next Agenda item for today, I would like to make a clarification only.</p><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Ministerial Statement</h4><p>1831 There have been some rumblings in the corridors of Government as to the agreement that was reached yesterday, which saw the deferment of the outstanding issues in our Agenda of yesterday to the November Sitting. However, it seems that the communication that was brought to me yesterday was not probably taken down to the level of the Chairperson of the Standing Committee. This has nothing to do with the Opposition but more so to do with the Government. The honourable Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in Parliament may have taken that initiative on her own without consulting the Chairpersons of the two respective Committees yesterday on the deferment. In that respect, I apologise to the Chairs of the respective Committees, and hopefully you can iron that out amongst yourselves in Government as to what really is the role of the Leader of the Government in Parliament and that of the Whip. I hope this has been well clarified in your attending that attachment to the State Government of Victoria where the Whips were invited to attend so that they can better understand their role. There are two roles - one as Government Whip and the other one as Leader of the Government in Parliament, quite distinct and quite separate. I hope that clarifies the issue and we shall now move on.</p></body>
