<body><h3>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h3><h4>LOCAL GOVERNMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023, I move: That the Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 21/2023), be debated, voted upon and be passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate of the Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 which was tabled in Parliament on Monday, 11 th September, 2023. As mentioned on Monday, Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1972, to increase the retirement age of officers appointed to municipal councils from 55 years to 60 years. Simply put, this is to align to Government policy and to the retirement age of civil servants. Furthermore, the Bill seeks to amend the Act to remove the requirement of the calculating interest on overdue rates using the Compound Interest Method. It also removes the interest rates as this would be prescribed by regulation moving forward. The amendment will enable the Ministry of Local Government to enact regulations in relation to overdue rates. The Ministry intents to change the method of calculating interest to simple interest methods as this will reduce the burden of taxpayers. Furthermore, the current interest rate of 11 percent will also be reduced. Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I assure this Parliament, there has been wider consultation on this matter between the Ministry of Local Government and the Office of the Solicitor-General. There</p><div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 1865 were also public consultations in Suva, Nadi, Nausori, Lami, Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu. I have explained the clauses of the Bill on Monday and I do not intend to do so. If you may recall this under Stading Order 41, there were enormous support from the other side for this to be tabled under Standing Order 51, and I hope that the Opposition will support the Bill. MR. SPEAKER.- Just a reminder honourable Members, the debate is limited to one hour, and please abide by that ruling and timing when the bell is sounded by the Madam Secretary-General. Just before I offer the floor, there are three speakers from the Government side and one from the Opposition. As such, I offer the floor to the honourable Premila Kumar to lead the batting before the three others from the Government that have asked to make their contributions. HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on Bill No. 21 of 2023. The law of any country cannot be static. There is a need to capture the realities on the ground, which is driven by the ever-changing nature of our world after post-pandemic period. It is imperative to respond effectively to new challenges emerging post COVID-19. What may have worked in the past may not be effective or appropriate for the current situation after COVID-19. Mr. Speaker, Sir, policy flexibility and adaptability are essential to ensure that policies remain relevant and impactful. We understand there is a shortage of skilled and unskilled workers in Fiji. The municipal councils are also facing this issue and as a Government, one has to respond to such challenges. One way to do that is by increasing the retirement age. Many governments globally have increased the retirement age to address the challenges in the labour market, including upskilling and reskilling. The FijiFirst policy on retirement age then was to give jobs to youth. Our youth are migrating in big numbers for greener pastures. Many have moved on, on student visas. So, looking at the current labour shortages in Fiji, there is a need to increase the retirement age even beyond 60, provided the workers are in good health. We need workers to keep the business and the economy going. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular Bill has two components as the honourable Attorney-General has mentioned. One is the retirement age, and the other component is the compound interest. Let me just give the reasons why these changes were brought in, in regards to the Local Government Act. In 2009, an amendment was made to the Local Government Act to establish compulsory retirement age for municipal council staff. This was introduced based on a High Court ruling in favour of a council employee, because the Local Government Act did not specify the retirement age. Hence, the Ministry of Local Government decided to introduce 60 years to be the compulsory retirement age across the board. Later, it was changed to 55 years to bring uniformity with the national government policy, and that was mainly the reason. Now, moving on to the compound interest, this was initiated by me when I was the Minister for Local Government. The Ministry had prepared the Cabinet Paper but we needed more information from town and city councils, that is what is the principal amount owed by the ratepayers and what is the interest amount. This information was very important because the idea was to write- off the interest amount and recover just the principal amount. This exercise was done and we also noticed that most Councils had aged debt that needed to be written-off, taken care of and we had to clean up all their books as we had done previously with Water Authority of Fiji because it does not give a good impression to an organisation when you go through the financial statement that shows that a lot of money is being owed. Besides that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know if that is not reflected well in the financial statement then there is a problem in making decisions. Business decisions cannot be made with such accounts, so the accounts had to</p><div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div><p>1866 Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 be cleaned. Mr. Speaker, Sir, above all, in my view then and still is, we had to look at the consumer protection fee. Compound interest is not fair to consumers and in this case, not fair to the ratepayers. Over the years we have seen financial institutions, for example, banks and hire purchase companies, they moved away from applying compound interest and they moved to simple interest. We saw the need to move in that direction as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, compound interest can be highly beneficial when you are saving or investing money but definitely not beneficial when you owe money because at the end of the day, one will accumulate more debt. So, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with compound interest, the amount you owe will simply grow faster and it becomes extremely difficult then to pay if off and that was the situation with the ratepayers then. Ratepayers who owed rates made arrangements with town council, they went on the payment plan with the hope that they will be able to clear their arrears, but they found that the compound interest rate of 11 percent on overdue rates did not reduce their arrears, so they were more frustrated, that here I am trying to make some payments but yet at the end of the day, nothing is moving. I had consultations with ratepayers and they simply discussed then that they were facing financial stress caused by compound interest, and compound interest of 11 percent, that is extremely high. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had to consider moving away from compound interest to simple interest simply because of the plea made by the ratepayers then and it was the right thing to do. Above all, the idea was as I mentioned, to clean up the accounts and provide this relief that the ratepayers really needed. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the write-off debt we knew can never be recovered. Some debts were as old as 15 years, 20 years, 30 years while some ratepayers had passed on and there was no chance of recovering any of these debts. One of the critical components when we considered this policy of writing-off debt, we had to develop other policies to make sure that we do not have similar issues in the future, and that was to improve the collection policy and the credit policy of each and every municipality. One of the exercises that the CEOs of municipal councils and the Special Administrators had to carryout was rate profiling. They had to understand who the ratepayers were, how much money they owed, why they owed that money, can they pay that money or not, do they live in Fiji or do they live abroad? That was a massive exercise to get the details and to create a database for all those information. The Municipal Council managed to complete all that and that is when the decision was made to move on to the next step which was the writing-off of the debt as well as moving from compound interest to simple interest. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution on the Bill before Parliament. I sincerely thank the honourable Kumar for supporting the Bill this afternoon. It is a very important Bill, not only important for the municipal councils, it is going to benefit everyone that lives within the 13 municipalities around our country. I wish to say a few issues, Mr. Speaker, just to support the Bill before Parliament. The Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2003 represented not just a change in law but a transformation in the lives of our people driven by unwavering commitment, empathy and the desire to progress. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us be clear about the essence of these amendments. They are not just about words on paper, they are about the hopes and dreams of our fellow citizens, hardworking 1,184 municipal council employees and 44,749 diligent ratepayers who keep our communities</p><div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 1867 thriving. As alluded earlier by honourable Attorney-General, the Ministry in consultation with his office as well as the Supervisor of Elections travelled around to all the 13 municipalities around our country from 24 th April to 10 th May, 2023. We embarked on a journey to listen, engage and truly understand the needs to desires of our people. What we found was nothing short of inspiration. The feedback received from these consultations resounded with positivity and hope, our people the backbone of our nation stand united in support of raising the retirement age for municipal council employees from 55 years to 60 years. In unison, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they also champion the transition from compound to simple interest calculations for overdue town rates and city rates applauding the reduction of the interest rate from 11 percent to 5 percent. It is a relief. Harmony of financial freedom that will ease the burden carried out by our ratepayers. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment to the retirement age is not just a mere adjustment of numbers. It is about fairness. It harmonises the retirement age ensuring that every public officer regardless of their role is granted the dignity of the retirement age of 60 years. It is unity that transcends disparities and enforce the sense of togetherness. The amendment to change the interest rate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, seeks to transition from the complex web of compound interest as alluded to earlier by honourable Kumar to the simplicity of straight forward calculation. It does not just reduce the interest rate. It liberates the ratepayers from the shackles of excessive financial burdens. It simplifies their lives, allowing them to plan with clarity and ease. Behind the amendment lies the rational. It is very important to know that in increasing the retirement age, it is about fairness, erasing disparities and about ensuring that every public officer is treated with respect that they truly deserve. For change of interest rate, it is about financial predictability for our Municipal Councils about fostering compliance, lightening the administrative load and above all, about relieving our ratepayers. For our ratepayers, it is about lessening their financial burden given the clarity they need to ensuring that their debts do not become insurmountable mountains. In conclusion, I stand before you, not just a Minister but as a fellow citizen, someone who believes in a brighter future for all. These amendments underscore our unwavering commitment to harmonious policies, operational efficiency and a symbiotic relationship with our people. I urge all Members of Parliament to support this Bill with all your heart. Let us rally behind the course of transparency, fairness and progress within our local governance framework. With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I fully support the Bill before Parliament this afternoon. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute briefly in support of the motion and I just want to reflect a little bit on the retirement age. First of all, I wish to thank the honourable Prime Minister and my Cabinet colleagues that as soon as we came into Government, extending the retirement age of the civil servants to 60 and at the same time taking away the contractual appointments and replacing them with tenure. The contractual appointments and the reduction of the retirement age were imposed unilaterally, there was no consultation with the representatives of the workers and the trade unions were completely ignored. The whole motive was union busting because once you have contractual appointments, there is no collective bargaining. They never entered into collective bargaining anyway and at the same time instil fear in the workers because you do not know whether your contract will be renewed or not, you just</p><div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div><p>1868 Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 have to keep quiet and do what you are told. So, it was a bullying tactic, Sir. That is how people were treated. HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Shame! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the civil servants are now a very happy lot of workers and as the saying goes, a happy worker is a productive worker. HON. K. K LAL.- No back door!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> It is hurting, I know, it is hurting them, Sir.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> No back door!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, they have to repent.</p><p>(Laughter) They need repentance. Unfortunately, municipal workers had to wait because the Act had to be amended and I am so thankful to honourable Nalumisa for bringing this Bill to Parliament together with the honourable Attorney-General for introducing the Bill. Now the municipal workers who have been eagerly waiting for the retirement age to be extended to 60 and also being put on tenure, will be happy as well. My only request to the honourable Minister is to please include all those who have turned 55 after we effected the civil servants’ retirement age to 60. I am hoping that they will be included, Sir. I know for fact, as a former trade unionist that all the Ministries and most of the other employers are now negotiating with the unions, talking to the unions, collective bargaining and the like. (Chorus of interjections) HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Minimum wage! HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Democracy! HON. A. D. SINGH.- Some municipalities have already received their salary pay increases, so thank you very much to the Coalition Government. MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Minister sounded a very humble advice and that is to repent. (Laughter) HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Bill that is before Parliament. As I mentioned in my last participation, one more acknowledgement of Suva Grammar School, we talked about Julius Caesar yesterday and yesterday afternoon there was mention of the plays. Recently over the break, Mr. Speaker, the Suva Grammar School Language Department successfully exhibited Julius Caesar, the play after a very long time. Our time at Queen Victoria</p><div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Suspension of Standing Orders</h4><p>1869 School, they played Julius Caesar and Hamlet but no more. Suva Grammar has started a good thing! We encourage the good thing and so it is something that now occupies students who are not into sports and not into other extra-curricular activities that we traditionally know schools for. So it is a good thing that they have started that this year and I congratulate Suva Grammar School for a wonderful exhibition of Julius Caesar over this school break. My contribution, Mr. Speaker, to the Bill is going to be very short and it will only relate to a case that I handled a year ago for and on behalf of a handful of former Suva City Council workers who obviously had to be retired off at the age of 55. They had issues, they had outstanding loans, they had outstanding hire purchases that they needed to pay simply because the date of their retirement was changed as alluded to by honourable Premila Kumar. We are happy, Mr. Speaker, that we have obtained support from the honourable Premila Kumar on the Bill that is before Parliament and hopefully that is going to be same attitude that we will receive from the Opposition this afternoon. I support the Bill that is before Parliament, Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, today is really a historic day. It is the first Bill that is fully supported by both sides. This week must be so special, we had the honourable Tikoduadua’s birthday and yesterday, happy belated birthday, honourable Prime Minister. We thank the Opposition that hopefully …. MR. SPEAKER.- And honourable Bulitavu as well. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Oh, honourable Bulitavu! We hope, Mr. Speaker, that in the future we will see wisdom in terms of the law that we reform because it just to ease everything;, ease of business, ease of administration, of course, in this case, as articulated by honourable Vosarogo, there was a substantial number of people who were affected by the retirement at 55. They had commitments, bank commitments and this Bill will address that. I commend the Bill, Sir. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Motion agreed to. [Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2023 (Bill No. 21/2023), moved under Standing Order 51 passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. ……. of 2023)] MR. SPEAKER.- Before we continue with the other Bills that are before us, just for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move her Suspension Motion.</p></body>
