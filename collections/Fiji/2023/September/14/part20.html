<body><h3>HIGHER SALARIES COMMISSION BILL 2023</h3><h4>HIGHER SALARIES COMMISSION BILL 2023</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday 11 th September, 2023, I move: That the Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 (Bill No. 24/2023), be debated, voted upon and passed.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023, which was tabled in Parliament on Monday 11 th September, 2023. Before I begin, I would like to highlight that since tabling the Bill a minor anomaly has been identified. (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- In Clause 16(4) was wrongly referred to as subsection 3. I would like to bring this to the attention of Parliament to clarify the reference that is to delete 3 and substitute 4. HON. A. BIA.- How come? (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a precedent has already been set in this Parliament on the 29 th July, 2022.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are just doing what you people did:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. D. TURAGA.- The former Attorney:</span> General was speaking on the 11 th Bill said, and</p><div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div><p>1886 I quote: Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 “In respect of the first Budget amendment (Bill No. 28/2022) before I do speak on the Bill itself, Sir, I would like to point out a typesetting error” which is similar in this case. “If honourable Members could look at Clause 5 of the Bill and the heading is “ Sections 115A and 115B ” inserted.” If you read Clause 5 it says, and I quote: “The principal Act is amended after section 115 by inserting the following new sections”. He further said and I quote: “You will see the next heading, “ Investigation or complaint by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service ”. As the heading above suggests, you have ‘15A’ but it should be ‘115A’, so I dropped off by typesetting - apologies for the typesetting error”. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a precedent has been said it is only referenced to ‘3’ supposed to be ‘4’ and I asked for the leave of this Parliament before we move on. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that amendment has been put forward as well and what we will do is that by virtue of the precedent case we will continue and we will take both the amendments when the approval has been finalised and given. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may continue, as mentioned on Monday, the Higher Salaries Commission Act together with subsidiary legislations was repealed by the Higher Salaries Act 2011. As a result, the Higher Salaries Commission was abolished. Pursuant to the Act of 2011, the salaries which used to be considered and determined by the Commission is determined as the case maybe by a Minister, authority or body prescribed under any written law which appoints or has authority over any such Board, corporation, government-controlled company, authority or body following the approval of the Minister responsible for Public Enterprise and the Prime Minister. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to establish the Higher Salaries Commission to ensure that the salaries of Chief Executive Officers or any other similar titled position of any Board, corporation, authority or board of any government-controlled company is not so excessive and lavish that it shocks the ordinary people of Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to quote one good example. I will not name the officer but someone who is actually paid more than the honourable Prime Minister. We also have to the shock of this side of Parliament that some people are being paid $350,000 a year, some are half a million, someone a million dollars … HON. K. K. LAL.- Who?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- unheard of in the history of this nation:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) Mr. Speaker, Sir, establishing the Higher Salaries Commission does not mean we want to reduce everyone’s salary. The intention is to ensure that taxpayers’ money is not being wasted that is the bottom line. Establishing the Higher Salaries Commission, we have to consider the pay</p><div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1887 disparities caused by the current practice by the former administration of Government in the last 16 years between Chief Executives and other Staff Members, which is not a good practice for any workplace. We will not deprive anyone of their rightful pay and the Higher Salaries Commission will conduct all necessary consultation needed to make the best decision, not only for top executives but also for the people who pay for their salaries, the taxpayers. Therefore, the intention of High Salaries Commission Bill is to re-establish the Higher Salaries Commission and guide the determination of salaries of top executive positions of prescribed bodies. There have been a consultation with the Ministry of Civil Service, Ministry of Public Enterprise, and the Office of Solicitor-General. I have touched all the salient provisions of the Bill and I will not repeat it again. I commend this Bill before the Parliament. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, ever since we received this particular Bill on Monday we have been trying to figure out the intent of bringing this Higher Salaries Commission back into play and as Attorney General has elaborated just a while ago it seems like when they got to know that some of the CEOs who are best fitted for a particular job are getting more than what Ministers and Prime Ministers are getting led to actually coming up with this particular Bill which will be enacted by the Parliament because they have the numbers so that they can actually reduce the salaries of the CEOs. This Bill has been done in haste and I will be explaining why some of the things are still missing from the particular Bill that is before us. Mr. Speaker, as alluded to by the Attorney General there is no such laws in place that actually states that the Prime Minister’s salary should be the highest compared to others. (Chorus of interjections) We heard what he said honourable Deputy Prime Minister. There was a reason back in 2011 as to why the Higher Salaries Commission was removed. The Higher Salaries Commission was empowered to consider and determine the remuneration of every senior officer, holder in any public office, including statutory entities, public corporations and Government commercial companies. Unfortunately, the Higher Salaries Commission which had been in existence since 1983, led economical understanding and sufficient knowledge of the market force and used to apply public service approach and comparison in determining the renumeration of these entities. The lack of commercial knowledge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is forcing this Government to actually come up with this Bill to get the Commission back. Furthermore, the establishment and the process of the Higher Salaries Commission was very cumbersome, bureaucratic and time insensitive. In addition, the process followed by the Higher Salaries Commission in determining the renumeration of the senior positions, failed to obtain a proper independent assessment of these salaries by professionals who had the necessary expertise in making such analysis. By removing Higher Salaries Commission by Decree 2011, the salaries of the Chief Executive Officers of any board, corporation, authority or body and the salaries of the holders of such other offices in those board, corporation, authorities, or bodies, would have been determined by the members or Directors of the board, corporation, authority or body, appointed under any written law establishing any such board, corporation, authority or body, following approval of the honourable Minister responsible for Public Enterprise and the honourable Prime Minister. It further went on to say, the salaries of the Executive Officers of every government controlled</p><div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div><p>1888 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 companies and salaries of the holders of such other office in those companies, as prescribed back then in Schedule 2, would have been determined by the Board of Directors of any such company following the approval of the Minister responsible for Public Enterprises and the Prime Minister. The salaries of every Permanent Secretary or other officer who manages a Ministry or department for which a Minister responsibility, and such other person, again as prescribed in Schedule 3 back then, would have been determined by Public Service Commission following approval of the Prime Minister. The salaries of the Executive Officer of every city, town and district council constituted under Local Government Act and salaries of holders of such office and those council would have been determined by the Minister responsible for Local Government following approval of the Prime Minister. When honourable Premila Kumar used to be the Minister for Local Government, she used to actually engage PWC as an independent analyst to determine which particular CEO of which particular town council should be getting what amount. What was required by the members or Directors of any board, corporation, company, commission or authority to conduct an independent assessment of renumeration sought to be reviewed before submitting any recommendation. Mr. Speaker, Sir, such an independent assessment would have brought necessary transparency and impartiality in the determination of renumeration of senior officers of these commercial entities. These were the reasons why the Higher Salaries Commission was removed. Now going on to the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we see that the Commission is going to consist of a chairperson appointed by the Minister, again something that the Opposition, for the past eight years have been harping on that Ministers should not be appointing members of the board. And now, in this particular Bill, they are doing the same thing they had been advocating against. (Chorus of interjections) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Listen, listen! Again, a nominee from the Minister responsible for Finance, a nominee of the Minister, and only two out of five, only two to be the experts in economics, financial, industrial or commercial matters appointed by the Minister. Moving further on, “Powers of the Commission”, I have been the Chair of the previous Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, never did we actually see, under section 8(1), for the purpose of this Act, the Commission has the same powers and authority to summon, witness and to admit and receive evidence as are conferred on Commissioners of the Commission of enquiry under section 9 of the Commission of Enquiry Act 1946. Why are such powers actually given to this Commission? No other Commission receives this kind of powers - Commission of Inquiries initiated by President. HON. MEMBER.- Why? HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- So that these people can call all the Chief Executive Officers and inquire about their salaries, reduce it and there will be a big question mark, Sir. Again, Mr. Speaker, if we go back and see - Functions of the Commission 7(1)(b): Conduct Consult with the: (i) Board of Government; (ii) Commercial Companies;</p><div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1889 (iii) Commercial Statutory Authorities; (iv) Statutory Organisations; and (v) any other body when reviewing and determining salaries. If you go to Schedule No. 1, there are lists of prescribed bodies from 1-27. Now, what happens to Head 9 of the Budget Estimates - Independent bodies? Head 13 - Independent Commission Mr. Speaker, Office of the Auditor-General, Fijian Elections Office, Judiciary, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and Media Industry Development Authority, Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission, Electricity Fiji Limited, Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, Fiji Teachers Registration Authority, Tertiary Scholarship and Loan Board and Public Rental Board - these are not even in the list. Why the rush to bring this kind of Bill under 51 that these entities are missing?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Very poor:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.:</span> As I said it just rang the bell in the ears after hearing what the Chief Executive Officer of FCCC is getting, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, the last one is Annual Report No. 25. Without limiting the Right of the Commission to report at any time the Commission must as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year publish an Annual Report on the Performance of the Commission functions under this Act during the year and must submit a copy to the Minister who must table it in the Parliament. Mr. Speaker, we have seen in the past we have been recommending that all the Annual Reports should be tabled and presented within three months once the financial year comes to an end. So why is this Commission being given a privilege that they can prevent an Annual Report whenever they like or has it been overlooked not to give a timeframe of three months?</p><h4>With those words, Mr. Speaker, I do not think we support the Bill that is presented to us.</h4><p><span class="speaker">HON. S. L. RABUKA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I will be very short, and I speak in support of the motion. Obviously, it is a Government Bill moved by the honourable Attorney-General. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a long time we have had the Higher Salaries Commission. The last Chairman died a few months ago, the late Taufa Vakatale, who was the last Chair of that Commission. It is important in a developing country like ours surrounded by many developing countries and also watched by developed countries that we maintain some rationale in the way we deal with our Senior Executives and also recruit and correctly remunerate them when they come and do the work that we advertise for them to come to do. It is very important then that we get the right calibre of people and get from them what we expect of them as we recruit them. So, I feel that having a Higher Salaries Commission that has the freedom to survey and research what people in those similar positions are getting other jurisdictions in other economies and try and scale that to the economy of the country. That is all it is. It is not giving all CEOs in this sort of industry in the same level of salaries applicable to the other jurisdictions around us. That is simply what this is for, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his contribution to this motion and also to the Attorney-General for the motion itself in looking at the</p><div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div><p>1890 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission. One of the most fundamental things about the success of any organisation, of any country or of any entity is the capacity of its leadership and this is true for any ministry, country and community and it is also true for a lot of the organisations that we have that come under the banner of what we wanted to come under the Higher Salaries Commission. Here, I am talking about statutory bodies, I do not know whether it covers the Government Commercial Companies but I think from the list, it is about the statutory bodies. One of the things that we had problems in the past, especially before we came into election was the difficulty of getting people to take up these appointments that had the right calibre that is required to innovate and transform these organisations that we have. We had a lot of these problems, I think, in the aftermath of 2006 where many people were reluctant to take up the jobs because of travel bans that affected not only themselves and their families. Of course, if you are not able to get the right people into the jobs, it is going to have an impact on how well that organisation does. This was one of the problems that we had, the difficulty of getting the best people with the right competencies, experiences and capabilities to be able to run the organisation that we have. All the statutory bodies that we have in the schedule listing on page 11, it is very important that we get the right people. I think one of the adages that we have in talking about managing organisations and running organisations that the most important job, the most important thing is to get the right people into the bus. If you get the right person on the bus, the bus will go in the right direction. If you have the wrong person in the bus, no matter what you do, the bus will go in the wrong direction; that is an adage that people have. If you want to move in the right direction, you have to do that, so it is always important that we get fit for purpose executives - the right set of competencies, the right abilities and very important, the right experience in a variety of situations. If you want to move an entity that is working in a country where other people in that sector are only used to certain levels of performance to what they have seen around them, and if you want to transform that to a levelled performance that you see in other countries, you need people that have experience in those kinds of settings because they have that understanding of what it means to take an entity from this level to that level. If you have people that ever only work in this level of entity, they have never had the experience of moving an entity from this level to that one, you need that sort of experience. You need the ability to innovate. We need people to have the opportunity to work in modern competitive environments to take these organisations forward. One of the problems that we have when we do this, even under the old Higher Salaries Commission was the kind of barriers that were inbuilt in the people who lived in these Commissions. A lot of the people who were working in the old Higher Salaries, they lacked that commercial knowledge and sufficient understanding of market forces and how competitive it is to get the kind of people that we can look for the right kind of person because as I said, you must be able to get the right kind of person for the job. There was a tendency to apply a public service approach in determining salaries. Traditionally, we based remuneration on inputs rather than outputs. We really need to base it on outputs rather than just inputs. Today we have heard the commentaries about the high pays of CEOs and we have heard the comment from the Attorney-General which I think demonstrates that archaic way of thinking. The archaic way of thinking that a Prime Minister in a country should earn the highest salary – that is very archaic thinking. I have worked in organisations where the CEO gets less than someone in that organisation. That is very archaic thinking. If you are thinking about where you want to take the organisation, then</p><div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1891 all of those archaic ways of thinking need to go out the backdoor. You need to come up with new ways of thinking to be able to move this organisation to deliver the kind of performance that we want; it happens everywhere. In Fiji, we have the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, specialist expertise is required. Specialist expertise must be compensated, you can keep that person. If you are going to get a group of people then to determine salaries who are not able to take these sorts of forces and needs into understanding, then they will be archaic in the way that they are to apply that salary. If you apply the wrong salary, you will get the wrong person and they say, if you pay peanuts, you will get....</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. MEMBER.- Monkeys:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Of course, this is it! This is the issue that we always face. We have seen the success of this approach that we have used here without the Higher Salaries Commission. We have seen the phenomenal performance of Airports Fiji Limited. (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- The improvement in Airports Fiji Limited. The low dividends that they used to get to Government and the phenomenal explosion when you get the right people in... (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.-...they build in new ways of doing things. That is what happens when you get the right person on the bus and you have the right way of appointing salaries for these people. We have seen what happened in Fiji Pine. People are talking about FBC. Yes, you have seen what happened in FBC.... (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Can you remember the FBC of the past? (Chorus of interjections) HON. J. USAMATE.- Look at the FBC of today. That is an example of what I am talking about. When you have the right way of allocating salaries, you attract the right person, you get the right performance. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes! HON. J. USAMATE.- Traditionally in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, low level jobs in the Civil Service are always paid higher than the private sector, low level jobs always presented higher. But the higher-level jobs, it is a complete difference, complete reversal. So, what do you have? You have a lot of people who work in the Civil Service, when they move up they want the higher salaries, where do they go? They jump outside. Here, a trend around the world, we want governments to be smaller so that they maintain the policy and the regulatory component of their jobs, you move your direct operations outside of government and you want them to be nimble, agile and move fast. When you do that, you need CEOs who can make things grow and if you are hampered by a system which limits the amount of money</p><div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div><p>1892 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 that you can pay to these people, you will get what you pay for. The system that we have had so far... (Hon. L. D. Tabuya interjects)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> … how are salaries determined now? We have Boards...</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Look at Fiji Airways:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.-..:</span> whose job, they have a fiduciary duty to do their best for their organisation. In these Boards you always have a human resource subcommittee, you have experts that are there, lawyers, HR people and they will then bring in the PriceWaterHouseCoopers of this land to look at the salary things that you are talking about, the relativity of salaries and looking at salaries here and offshore. So if a company like Water Authority of Fiji had decided, we want to move Water Authority of Fiji from here to become something like a company that you find in Singapore, you need to find the right kind of person.... HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Why Singapore? HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes, why not? Why not? What is wrong with you people? Why not?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We are locals:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> Then you need to attract the kind of person, they will come up with the salary package and then under the current system offer that to the Ministry of Public Enterprises. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. J. USAMATE.:</span> So what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir,….</p></body>
