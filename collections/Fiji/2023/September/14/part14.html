<body><h3>QUESTIONS</h3><h4>QUESTIONS</h4><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, please take note of the following: I am allowing honourable Maharaj to ask Oral Question No. 126/2023. 1. 2. Oral Question No. 130/2023 for the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection will be the last Oral Question to be asked today, since she is attending another Government engagement. 3. Oral Question No. 131/2023 will be omitted from the Order Paper, given that the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways has delivered a Ministerial Statement on the same subject matter.</p><h4>Oral Questions</h4><p>Plans for Resolving Breakdowns at Rarawai Sugar Mill (Question No. 126/2023) HON. A. A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry inform Parliament if there are plans in place, along with a proper timeline, to solve the numerous breakdowns at the Rarawai Sugar Mill, which is affecting farmers, lorry drivers and national productivity?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, I have an eight-page reply.</p><p>(Chorus of interjections)</p><div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div><p>1836</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 MR. SPEAKER.- Order! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Listen! Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Bala for raising his concerns regarding the Rarawai Mill. Unfortunately, he has not been here yesterday and today, and I am not sure whether he is seriously questioning me.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is not your concern:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Frivolous answer:</span></p><p>(Chorus of interjections) HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure honourable Bala knows the very answer, it is more of a heritage and an inherent issue that this Coalition Government has to resolve, unfortunately, due to many decades of neglect. HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rarawai Mill is some 137 years old, older than all of us here.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. V. PILLAY.- We all know:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> Unfortunately, this old icon did not have a comprehensive or preventative maintenance plan. All maintenance was more of a responsive one and on a piecemeal basis. Apart from that, the Mill has been hit by a number of natural disasters over the past many years. It is no secret, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Mill’s frequent breakdowns are causing significant disruption to our farmers, lorry drivers and ultimately, our national productivity. I want to state that these issues are not only with Rarawai Mill, the other two Mills as well - Lautoka and Labasa Mills are no exception. Both are similarly aged. Let me repeat, the issues are longstanding and have not just appeared now since we are in Government. Previous Governments did not take any feasible measures to address these issues effectively and here we are with the legacy issues of the past to deal with.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C. J. SINGH.:</span> During the prime days of the sugar industry with the preferential price from the European Union, new modern mills should have been built decades ago. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we are in Government, we will clean up the mess and build this industry. HON. F. W. R. VOSAROGO.- Hear, hear! HON. C. J. SINGH.- To address some of these issues and ensure uninterrupted operations of the Rarawai Sugar Mill, we are working on a plan that incorporates both, short-term and long-term measures. The pressing issue at hand revolves around the two boilers that are dubbed as the heart of the sugar mill. These two boilers were originally installed way back in 1958 and 1976 respectively. Given</p><div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1837 the advanced age of these boilers, they are in urgent need of replacement. Currently, we just cannot push these boilers to their optimum operating capacity but to run well below its intended capacity. As a result, the Mill’s efficiency gets affected and so is its productivity. Our challenges are impaired by the failed Sugar Technology Mission (STM) project, which was aimed at modernising the Rarawai Mill. The installation of a new cane-carrier equipment as part of this project has created more issues than modernising the increasing and overall efficiency of the Mill. The flaw in the design has led to inconsistent cane feeding, especially with the billet (mechanical harvested cane). As such, the Mill cannot run to its full potential as the input (raw cane) load has to be limited. Mr. Speaker, Sir, to promptly address some of these ongoing issues, the FSC is implementing a regular furnace cleaning procedure and maintenance programme. This proactive measure is aimed at maintaining stable boiler pressure during each shift, ultimately reducing the frequency of breakdowns. To reduce the hours of repairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, scheduled work such as fixing air heater, tubing leaks and replacement of air heater tubes are carried out during Mill cleaning days. The complete replacement of air heater tubes is scheduled for the 2024 maintenance season. Mr. Speaker, Sir, regrettably, we must anticipate the persistence of some of these issues in the short to medium term. Despite our efforts to implement strategies aimed at reducing breakdowns, it is inevitable to install a new boiler to replace both existing boilers at the Rarawai Mill. This decisive need should address ongoing breakdown problems. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to understand that a substantial investment is required for the success of this project. We cannot ignore the fact that all these three Mills are more than 100 years old, highlighting the pressing need for the modernisation and upgrading of the century-old technology to improve performance, increase the production rate and energy efficiency. Additionally, we intend to have more environmentally friendly systems and processes in the Mills to reduce our carbon footprint as well. Moreover, Sir, FSC is actively exploring various avenues to secure necessary funding and technology for the comprehensive upgrade and refurbishment of critical Mill components. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in consistent and continuous consultations with our sugarcane farmers, truck drivers and other stakeholders to fully understand their concerns and incorporate their valuable feedback. While I cannot provide an exact timeline for the resolution of these challenges or legacy issues, I want to emphasise our unwavering commitment to finding a lasting solution. HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Who wrote it? HON. C. J. SINGH.- As you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be a complete review of the sugar industry as per the provisions made in the 2023-2024 Budget. We fully comprehend the immense significance of the sugar industry to our nation’s economy, and we remain steadfast in our dedication to safeguarding the livelihoods of our farmers and those associated with the industry. As I had explained on Monday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry still brings in more than $200 million of foreign dollars to the country. Rest assured, we will continue to work tirelessly to overcome the challenges of these Mills and we are deeply grateful for the support and understanding of all stakeholders, more importantly our hardworking farmers. I thank them for their contribution to the economy.</p><div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div><p>1838</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Before I sit, Mr. Speaker, this is interesting - I had a fortunate conversation with a Singaporean Consortium, a multi-billionaire Consortium, that is willing to come in to assist our sugarcane industry. So, wait for some good news in time to come. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. C.J. SINGH.- One at a time. Thank you:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.:</span> Sir, we have not heard anything new from the honourable Minister. When he talked about the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs, there was no plan. Now, when he is talking about the sugar industry and Rarawai Mill, again, there is no plan. We all know that you do not have a plan, honourable Minister. My question to you is this, we have talked about the magnetite this morning in Ba River. Rarawai Mill is also a big polluter to the Rarawai River. Are you aware of that, and if so, what are you going to do to fix it? MR. SPEAKER.- Take your seat, honourable Minister. I think this is the second time I am saying this to your good self, Sir, so as to allow us to go over the question that has been raised. Now, you can stand up and give your reply. HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the supplementary question is a new one. The plans that we have for Rarawai Mill is something that you have made a blunder of. We are trying to correct that, and it will take some time. HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Hear, hear!</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.:</span> 16 years and nothing done.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> I will allow one more before I ask the honourable Members if we could adjourn soon after this supplementary question, so as to allow the honourable Prime Minister to join the honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs from Australia in having tea together.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.:</span> Do not worry, honourable Minister, I am not going to derail your train.</p><p>(Laughter) Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that you acknowledged that there are issues with Rarawai Sugar Mill, do you anticipate in this particular season that we are in now, what is the percentage that you anticipate in terms of productivity out of that particular Mill, bearing in mind that there are considerable breakdowns at the moment? HON. C. J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I will probably get that answer to him later because I have to get back to the Mill and the Management for that.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- You should have done it:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Honourable Members, you may have noted how he makes his reply. He has it written down, very detailed, so as to try and provide more information to you.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- But it is not relevant:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Come again?</p><div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1839</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Not relevant:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Is the question not relevant or the reply? (Laughter) Honourable Members, I intend now to adjourn Parliament so that we may have morning tea. The Parliament adjourned at 10.30 a.m.</p><div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div><p>1840</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 The Parliament resumed at 11.13 a.m. Housing Assistance to Fire Victims Grant (Question No. 127/2023) HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament on the approved changes to the Policy for Housing Assistance to Fire Victims Grant? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to response to the question posed by the honourable Member before this august Parliament this morning. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all aware, accidental fires can have devastating consequences for homeowners, leaving them without a place to call home and struggling with the financial burden of rebuilding. I believe that it is the responsibility of any government to assist homeowners in such difficult times. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2015, a programme was established to provide housing grant assistance on first come first served basis to low or middle income earners or families to rebuild their homes destroyed by accidental fires. Sir, under this assistance, households with an annual income of $50,000 or below can access the payable grant of $5,000 per applicant. The programme initially assisted affected families in urban areas until the 2020-2021 financial year when it was extended to rural and maritime areas. Since the inception of the programme, a total of 260 families have been assisted with a total payment of $1.3 million. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a need to further extend this assistance as families who had their homes destroyed by accidental fires were declined because they had agricultural lease titles. The criteria then was for residential lease title holders only. Additionally, following Cabinet’s decision in 2020, housing assistance to fire victims was extended to rural and maritime areas but only for households within registered village boundaries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very pleasing to note that just recently in July 2023, there was a fire that happened in one of the villages in the district of Dreketi in Rewa – Nadoria Village, where five houses were accidentally destroyed. With this assistance, the Ministry was able to assist the families whose homes had been destroyed by fire. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also households that belong to landowning units registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) and residing on their respective land that are not within the village boundary. These families were not considered eligible for assistance due to the current eligibility criteria for rural and maritime areas, hence the need to extend the assistance to include them. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a review was undertaken on the existing policy and assistance have been extended to applicants with agricultural lease titles and households residing on their mataqali land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the grant assistance will continue to be on a first come first served basis. Further extension of this assistance is within the Ministry’s intended number to be assisted in the financial year with a total allocated budget of $150,000. HON. A. V. B. C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question to the honourable Minister, can he inform Parliament of the requirements in place for those five victims who can been assisted under this policy?</p><div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1841 HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I will just outline some of the major criteria on the reason that was made to those who wanted to apply if their houses got accidentally burnt by fire. These are homes that are within the urban, as well as now extended to maritime and rural areas. There are about eight criteria altogether: 1. The applicant must be above the age of 18 years. 2. Household must earn an income of at least below $50,000. 3. Those that have agricultural lease titles, make sure that you provide ownership that the property belongs to you and that the applicant occupies the property. There must be evidence to support the ownership of the damaged property and the applicant occupying the property. 4. For those on mataqali land, the applicant is a member of the landowning unit, whose land has a damaged property located on it. 5. The property must not be insured. 6. A property search will be done to confirm that the applicant does not own any other property within Fiji and this is normally done through the Registrar of Titles. 7. Very important, the cause of the fire must be unintentional, accident fire not through arson and there should be a report lodged with the Police and also from the National Fire Authority. 8. For those houses that are affected in rural and maritime areas, they must have these confirmations: (i) the Provincial Administrator and Office of the Roko Tui must confirm the house ownership rightfully belongs to the landowning unit on which the damaged property is located and on its mataqali land; and (ii) the Provincial Administrator (PA) as well as the Office of the Roko Tui to confirm the cause fire in consultation with the National Fire Authority for incidents reported in the maritime areas. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Chairman, just a question to the honourable Minister pm, mataqali land. I think you said only those who are members of that mataqali will be eligible or qualify to apply for that assistance. What about those living on the mataqali land in the VKB but from somewhere else? There is a case in Sawani where this particular family is from Gau but living in a mataqali land given to them by the landowners. The house was completely destroyed and until now they are still waiting for assistance maybe because of this policy. How can we deal with those kind of cases, honourable Minister? HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Through you, Mr. Speaker, that is a very valid question and I thank the honourable Member for raising this question. That is a very practical example because there are instances of settlements where some even their vasu, the village where their mother is from had given them that piece of land. The most important thing here is, there must be a confirmation or consent from the mataqali owner that they have given consent to whoever that resides on that mataqali land. The confirmation must come from the mataqali or the head of the mataqali to confirm that they have given consent or permission for those who want to reside on their mataqali land. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, my question is on Fire Education Awareness. Can you describe some measures currently being undertaken with households and members of the public in terms of awareness and safety? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, there are five cases from Nadoria, Rewa, and the honourable Minister is seeking explanation again on how to …. HON. M. K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, this is something that my Ministry has been liaising very closely with the National Fire Authority to provide a strategy that is going to help, not only property owners but people at large or the public on how we can prevent fires. Just recently, there was a fire that</p><div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div><p>1842</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 took place in Labasa that really damaged few spaces there, which was really catastrophic. While talking to the Fire Officers who were actually there to assist to douse off the fire, I was told that it started from the kitchen and if only the Kitchenhand had applied the basic training skills that they were taught, the fire would have been contained. It was in a spur of the moment, they started running out and they forgot to apply the basic firefighting skills. These are some of the areas that we have also discussed with the Director of National Fire Authority, to do more educational awareness on how best we can prevent fires. It is not only that we wait for the fire to happen and then we start fighting fires. Before I came this morning, I even asked the Chief Executive Officer of National Fire Authority for us to come up with a national strategy on how best we can prevent fires from happening. They have been invited by schools and they have been conducting consultation and awareness on some of the fire prevention techniques. Hopefully, in the future, they are also going to conduct more awareness and training and also in terms of those who live in the rural and maritime areas, they need to liaise with the Roko Tui and the Provincial Administration Office on how best they can reach out to all the villages and settlements in Fiji so that if fire happens, at least, those who live around those surrounding areas are able to assist in fighting against the fire. Extramarital Affairs and Family Breakdown (Question No. 128/2023) HON. A. N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: Extramarital affairs and marriage/family breakdown have been an issue affecting Fijians contracted under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) and the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Schemes. Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations inform Parliament on the Ministry’s plan to address the problem? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for asking that question. Mr. Speaker, Sir, extramarital affairs and marriage/family breakdown is a two-way occurrence, in our case. It can either happen on the location where the worker is involved abroad at work or with the spouse back at home but for us, our information is that most of them have happened abroad where the workers are based. Mr. Speaker, Sir, research shows that marriage breakdown or extra-marital affairs stem from poor communication, lack of intimacy, money issues and growing apart, as life takes different twists and turns. Sir, issues such as this, dealing with human values and behaviour, are beyond our control. However, the concerns raised require an understanding of such human behaviour. Addressing this issue also requires multi-disciplinary approaches and multi-stakeholder collaboration. No government can resolve this alone but together, Sir, we can take preventive and corrective measures to improve and minimise such painful incidents. I will outline some preventive measures that our Ministry is now taking. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of the PALM Scheme in 2019, 1.5 percent or 65 out of4,351 Fijian workers engaged under the Scheme have been involved in extramarital affairs. While</p><div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1843 the percentage is insignificant, even one family abandoned by the breadwinner or the head of the family should be a matter of deep concern to all of us. The number of reported cases received on welfare issues around this, Sir, under the Scheme began in 2021. It is a major social impact faced by workers’ families here in Fiji, including related issues such as non-communication and no remittance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, a vast majority of them, when they get involved in such affairs, they abscond. They are not at their work site where they were, they run away from the employers and hide somewhere else, so we lose contact with them and our High Commission Officials - our counterparts in Australia and DFAT Officials tried to locate them, but it becomes very, very difficult. So far, through intervention by the employers and through intervention by our diaspora there, we have been able to resolve three cases. Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we came into Government, my Ministry and this Coalition Government have achieved a lot in ensuring that the wellbeing and welfare of the workers under the Scheme comes first. We visited our workers in both, Australia and New Zealand, within three months of coming into Office, to assure them of our commitment, to hear their concerns, to talk to our bilateral partners, to talk to their employers and their Unions, and to make them feel that they are cared for, Sir, to make them feel important. They were, indeed, thrilled to see us, Sir, and many got emotional because it was the first time in four years that any Government Official had ever visited them. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now strengthening our collaborative efforts, we have established a Senior Officials Working Group between the Fiji Government and the Australian Government, which is shared by my Permanent Secretary and collectively, discussing and continuously exploring solutions. Sir, in improving collaboration with our local community, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, to support my Ministry in sharing information and also in preparation of potential Fijian workers through their community connections for communal support and identification of potential leaders of the groups that go out and work there. We feel that connection of our workers with the Vanua through the Chiefs, the Turaga-ni-Koro and the community and Church leaders could help minimise the concerns raised. Mr. Speaker, Sir, for extensive understanding about work in Australia, including managing the culture shock, we will be expanding our Pre-Departure Training Programme from four days to two weeks, and we will also take this out now to the communities, to districts where families and spouses can also come together for the better understanding of the whole programme and what to expect out there, as well as the expectations of their families here. We will also involve other stakeholders when we are conducting this Pre-Departure Training Programme. Sometimes there is over-expectation from the family back home and workers get frustrated when all they earn has to be sent home and they save nothing. I have met some of them and they have shared this with me, and that is why we impress upon families to make sure that the culture of saving is observed. The workers know that they are going to benefit from their savings at the end of the period they are working there. Mr. Speaker, Sir, pastoral care and welfare support is the key to addressing vulnerability, and this is being done through the appointment of our first ever Country Liaison Officer. I wish to thank the Australian Government for allocating funds for a Country Liaison Officer in 2021. Unfortunately, it took us more than two years and a change in Government to appoint a Country</p><div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div><p>1844</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Liaison Officer. We have just appointed one and he is on the ground. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the honourable Minister of Finance for allocating funds for a second Liaison Officer in Australia because it is a vast country, and our workers are spread all over. We are now in the process of advertising and appointing the second Liaison Officer. We are now in conversation with the Australian Government to provide funding for one more. If they do not, then I will come back to the honourable Minister of Finance because we need three in Australia and one in New Zealand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, with our new Country Liaison Officer now on the ground, he will be the key contact person. He will be visiting workers, workplaces, talking to employers, solving problems and ensuring that any communication from families coming here to us will be forwarded to him to make sure that our workers out there are not behaving in a manner that is undesirable. So, that is one major step that we have taken, Sir, and we also have our High Commission Officials who are now continuously assisting us as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, other avenues that the Ministry is embarking on is ensuring transmission of funds directly. We are now in the process of discussion with the employers to get a Deed of Consent between the employer and the worker done, so that the employer can deduct a certain amount and send it directly to the spouse at home. What happens now, Sir, is that the fare is paid by the employer, and they deduct that slowly from the wages. So, what we want to do now is to ask them to deduct a little more so that the return fare is also available. If any worker who gets involved or misbehaves, all we will need to do is to get their ticket, put them on the plane and send them back home. Of course, they will not be able to go back again. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on family accompaniment and Pacific Engagement Visa, the Australian Government has committed to piloting a visa arrangement, allowing PALM workers on long-term placements to bring their families to Australia. This is aimed at addressing the social impact of long periods of family separation. We hope that this will work well, it is a scheme that is being piloted now with a limited number from the entire Pacific and hopefully, the numbers will increase. Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me also to acknowledge the work and dedication of our Church leaders through the Pacific Council of Churches, including our very own Fiji Council of Churches. These stakeholders play a very crucial role in enhancing the spiritual aspect of our workers to remain faithful, committed to their colleagues and families. Last month, I participated in their talanoa session here in Suva on pastoral and practical care of our migrant workers, to have a better understanding of how we could collaborate more closely to support our workers and their families. And, Sir, they have now got a plan on how our Churches are going to assist our workers out there in Australia and New Zealand with pastoral care. Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the other developments as part of the way forward, the strengthening of our people to people links to review the Vuvale Partnership Agreement was held last week between Fiji and Australia Senior Officials here in Suva. Now, this will lead, Sir, to the review of the Labour Mobility Agreement and will address a number of the current issues and concerns that now have emerged. Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted earlier on the Coalition Government’s commitment to address emerging issues, during our Ministerial visit to both, Australia and New Zealand, we also had several community engagements organised by our Fijian communities. And these talanoa</p><div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1845 sessions were very fruitful, Sir, because we were able to extract a lot of information from them regarding how our workers are faring there. At the same time, they are assisting us in making sure that our workers, in connection with them, are having church service together with the communities and they are able to see that they do not fall on the wayside. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in acknowledging the concerns raised by some of the key stakeholders, as alluded to earlier that we need a multi-stakeholder approach to address welfare concerns holistically, my Ministry is currently discussing on the establishment of an inter-agency committee to tackle these concerns. Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there have been issues of performance and welfare concerns for some of our workers and their families, I would like to also acknowledge that most of the workers who have remained focussed have been able to benefit immensely from the Scheme. We know about the remittances that have been coming, we know of the success stories that have come through the social media, d through the mainstream media and from the workers themselves who have come back, that they have either started their own businesses, they have improved their living standards and improved their homes, and they have also improved their villages, and the like. Sir, enhanced labour mobility is a shared priority of the economic relationship. We commit to working together with the Australian Government and their representatives, to ensure that the Scheme is mutually beneficial and also to ensure that our workers get fair treatment and are in good spirits and even connected to their families back home so that we are able to reduce and eradicate the problem on hand. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given a list of all those preventive and corrective measures that we are taking, and we are hopeful that we will be able to resolve this problem, going forward. Thank you very much, Sir. HON. A. N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for his response and I would also like to commend the Ministry and all its staff for the facilitation work they are currently doing for our youth and fellow Fijians. My supplementary question is, apart from those community pre-departure programme and pastoral care that the honourable Minister has spoken about, are there plans to introduce some form of predeparture couples therapy?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.:</span> I must apologise, Sir, I missed the last part of the question.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- I think the honourable Tuicolo is asking therapy for couples before they depart. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier, we are now expanding the period from four days to two weeks and we are getting other stakeholders to come in and one of them will be that. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister you have mentioned something on country liaison officers. I think that is a great idea, but who are these people and which side of the ocean do you recruit them from? Are they our locals whom you take to the other side, or these are the people from the other side, who are experienced and know about the country and all the problems that are engaged in this? I know there is a lot of talk going on the social media regarding those who are doing the job right now, saying that they lack capacity to do the job. HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the country liaison officers whom we are appointing would be those former Fijians now living in Australia who have the correct qualifications, experience</p><div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div><p>1846 and skills.</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when growing up, we heard in schools that on the other side the pasture is always greener, but the pasture is greener where we water it. I think that is the message to the youth to the possibilities in Fiji that we can invest in. Thank you, honourable Minister for your quantitative assessment and the multi-disciplinary approach in prioritising and characterising the degree of issues that we have. But ever since this has been in the media, some family members are a bit worried. What if they have a family member engaged in these kinds of matters, and somehow some of the family members, who were intending to take up this scheme to go on this Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme are sort of being discouraged not to do so. How is your Ministry working to mitigate this aspect of social stigma and demoralisation factor amongst the Fijian people and families? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me share this information through you, that we have some 20,000 plus applications pending, and right now we are actually processing those applications from mid-2021. I am not aware of the lack of interest in people wishing to go and work abroad. HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, these workers are granted Visa 403, in which, there is no provision for the workers to take their partners with them. We know as married men and married women, when we do not have our partners, it is highly likely that people get involved in these kinds of activities. As alluded to by the honourable Minister, how long will it take for the talks so that there is a provision for the workers to take their partners with them? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now six months into these discussions. If we had started these discussions two years earlier, by now we probably would have had it already. So, we hope to have it in place as soon as possible. We are discussing with our Australian counterparts. MR. SPEAKER.- The question has generated a lot of interest from the honourable Members. HON. S. T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is very simple. During my term in the Ministry, I carried out two visits around New Zealand and Australia. One of the issues that had been realised at that time was the Fijian communities in these areas were quite a very bad influence on the workers were coming from Fiji - being raw from the rural areas and they were very easily influenced by our Fijians living around the area. At that time, I had decided to create half-way houses which basically means that there is a community within the town closest to them that will advise them if they do fall off the line. I just wanted to ask the honourable Minister if that problem of interference from our local communities that now reside in Australia and New Zealand have much influence on our workers? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that there are those that do influence our people negatively, they encourage them to abscond, encourage them to get away, encourage them to hide and they probably later on will be able to obtain a visa to stay back, but the vast majority I must say that we have met are great people and they are there to assist us. This is my experience in our last visit. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is actually quite simple but I just want to remind the honourable Minister that discussion with respect to partners travelling with them began with us many moons ago. Sir, the question really is that we have to tread very carefully with respect to how we deal with the situation especially with respect to extramarital matters, et cetera, that is</p><div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1847 being spoken about. Why I say this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because within the Constitution we have a particular provision that guarantees your right to privacy and that also guarantees respect for your private and your family life. My question is that in all that you do with respect to this specific matter Sir, please let us know whether you are consulting with the Solicitor-General’s Office and the necessary legal authorities. Be mindful because our intentions are good (it does not matter which side of the Parliament we are) but we cannot tread and interfere in people’s personal lives. So, have you made arrangements whether it is overseas or whether it is our own Solicitor-General’s Office? HON. A. D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question. Of course, we have our own legal officers, our legal team in the ministry and we have the Solicitor-General’s office to advise us on any matter of legality in any anything at all. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Have you done it though?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. A.D. SINGH.- Yes:</span></p><p>Black Spot Areas in Fiji (Question No. 129/2023) HON. J. R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on the Ministry’s workplan to address the Black Spot areas in the country? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I would like to thank honourable Vocea for his question. Before I respond, Sir, I think the honourable Minister for Labour was actually very polite. Before we became Government, I actually spent some time moving around Australia and worked in New South Wales and Victoria, and one of the things that was unprompted from all those workers was “we have not had a visit from Government”. I am glad that honourable Koroilavesau mentioned that he did visit four times apparently and so when honourable Koya was touting the Scheme as an initiative of the Government, I think I would urge them to just reflect on how they executed the Scheme.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.:</span> Answer the question – you are just wasting time.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, they did not actually have the infrastructure to support the whole thing. The initiatives that the honourable Minister for Labour mentioned - he did it in six months so he should be praised and credited for taking care of that matter. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question raised by the honourable Member of the Ministry’s work to address blackspot areas in the country. Before I begin and for the benefit of all members of the public, please, let me explain what blackspots are. These are areas where there is essentially no internet activity, and the other common technology is grey areas, and this is where internet connectivity is somewhat intermittent. Internet connectivity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we agreed is now the backbone of the modern world and has becoming separable part of our daily lives. Reliable and stable internet to connectivity provides a gateway to access for information, education, economic opportunities and connecting our</p><div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div><p>1848</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 loved ones in a way that was unimaginable a few years ago. Access to good quality affordable secure internet connectivity is crucial and the Government Ministries are fully commitment to bridging the digital divide. Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are already 240 declared sites which have been identified as having poor or no connectivity. I just seek the indulgence of both sides of Parliament. When I saw that list, I was not happy with it because I felt it did not address the whole needs of the country. It was selective. It only picked on certain Provinces, and it did not look in an all-encompassing way across the provinces. As a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have put the programme on hold or slowed it down just to make sure that we consult a bit more broadly and make sure when we roll out (I am hoping to start seriously rolling out at the very latest in the first quarter next year) that we are able to actually start genuinely addressing connectivity needs across the community. Apart from that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also been receiving feedback from Provincial Councils just to ensure again that when connectivity is rolled out that we address everyone. So, essentially, I am hoping what we will do is actually publicly announce provinces where internet is going to be rolled out and then start systematic covering the provinces. I will keep this august Parliament informed particularly as I know both sides of Parliament have elected Members in there whereas electors are important that this is done. We do have a trust account, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has funds in it, and what I am hoping to do once we start spending the money, I will be reaching out to the stakeholders namely Vodafone, Telecom and Digicel whether to see where they can start addressing the grey spots as part of the overall exercise, because one of their contentions has been that the money that has been sitting in the Trust Account has not been used and so they are holding off on addressing the grey spots. In terms of other things that we are doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are maintaining a programme from the previous Government which is maintaining telecentre programmes for 26 schools partnering with the Ministry of Education. We will see whether we can continue to expand that initiative. In terms of connectivity issues, it is not only an issue for Fiji, but also an issue around the world. In fact, the International Communications Union (ICU) which is the arm of the UN, estimates that over 2.7 billion are not connected to the online world. On a regional level, we recognise the need to connect all our people to good quality and affordable secure internet and to this effect, the ICT Ministers of the Pacific met in Port Moresby on 27 th and 28 th August, 2023 where we endorsed the Lagatoi Declaration which focuses on digital transformation across the Pacific. On a global level, we are working very closely with the UN Technologies Specialist Agencies such as International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the World Bank and Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT) and other multilateral partners on the need to improve internet connectivity in Fiji. We are actively participating in discussions on emerging standards and regulations in the connectivity space. The emergence of Low Earth Orbiting Satellites has come as a blessing for geographically sparse countries like Fiji as they do not require upfront investment by the Government and service providers to provide connectivity. Our service providers currently utilise these types of technologies to provide connectivity to the remote areas and there are more opportunities to connect communities directly using these technologies. The last point I would like to make Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that improving internet connectivity</p><div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1849 is not just a matter of convenience anymore. It is essential for the livelihoods of our people. It is a matter of national development and progress. It is about creating a level playing field for all our citizens regardless of their background or location. It is about harnessing the power of technology to propel our nation forward into a brighter and more prosperous future. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to answer the question. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I got confused. Honourable Vocea asked the question about blackspots, but the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has talked about grey spots. Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister explain to me what is the difference between the black spots and the grey spots? HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had already explained that a black spot is where there is no connectivity and a grey spot is where there is intermittent connectivity. In terms of what we are endeavouring to do, the honourable Leader of the Opposition is to ensure when we roll out the programme, it is equitable and fair. The previous programme was like moving around Fiji in an inefficient way. We need to have a structured programme that moves through provinces and then actually executes. Once we go through a province, the province actually experiences the benefit of the internet connectivity. That is really it has been slowed down and I take responsibility for that, but from where I sit, we need to do this properly. The list that was compiled before, I am not sure honourable Members on the other side had a good look at it, parts of Ra were not included in it, so that is why I am re-looking at it. HON. F. S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I remember correctly, I think this has something to do with the 2021-2022 Budget and there were about 317 sites that were poorly connected. Within that budget, there was an allocation of about $570,000 and also the Universal Service Fund was going to be used. My question really is, all of that have been identified under the tower sharing idea that was happening. Honourable Minister, would you not say that that particular programme has actually alleviated the problem somewhat that most of it has gone? I am not sure if you are saying that you have slowed down this particular programme or is it some other programme? Just a clarification on that. HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Koya for your question. It is really slowing down the current programme just to make sure that we have wider penetration when we roll it out. I am not too familiar with the previous programme, but I will certainly check up on it as well. If there is any omission from there, we will include it in this rollout. Telecom is very keen to move so as soon as we finalise the list, we will share it widely with everyone because it is in the interest of the country on both sides of Parliament. Vunisei Kavala Road – Completion of (Question No. 132/2023) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: With the people of Naceva and Nakasaleka in Kadavu anticipating the completion of the Vunisei upto Vacalea and on to Kavala Road, can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport update Parliament on those roads’ progress and when they are likely to be completed and commissioned? MR. SPEAKER.- The question is on a very specific road. It is a bit different from now what</p><div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div><p>1850</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 we used to face in the past. You cannot ask about this, so we are allowing this. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The Vunisei to Vacalea Access Road takes construction of about 32 kilometres of unsealed road from Vunisei Village to Vacalea within the Districts of Kadavu and Nakasaleka on Kadavu Island. The scope of road works consists of 7.8 kilometres design and build section from Vunisei Village Junction to Vukavu Village Junction, which includes construction of nine rural level crossing and pilot cut section of 24.2 kilometres of road, alignment from Vukavu Junction to Vacalea Village which includes the culvert crossing as mentioned. For the pilot cut section, access road has been constructed for Vukavu Village, Niudua Village, Jioma Village, Nacomoto Village, Kadavu Village, Namajiu Village, Lavidi Village and Vacalea Village. However, all these road constructions are only currently accessible during favourable weather as pilot sections are yet to be gravelled. This project has experienced comprehensive challenges such as adverse weather, COVID-19 delays, physical site conditions and land issues that has vastly contributed to the challenging progress. The overall progress is 77 percent complete, whereby the design and build section is completed including the low level crossings. Hence road is fully accessible for Vunisea School, Dravuwalu Village, Dravuwalu District School, Yavitu Government Youth School, Yavitu Village, Soso Village and Naceva District School. The programme is envisaged to be completed in January 2024 with the provision of basic all weather road access for the mentioned villages, schools and health centres hence reducing rural transport cost for Naceva and Nakasaleka. Vinaka. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, honourable Minister for the answer. You did mention about the need for gravel on these roads. One of the challenges is the crusher output is insufficient to provide for the volume that is needed. The honourable Minister has started with this was the carting of materials from Viti Levu to Kadavu. What is the current situation now, is that going to continue, or have you got sufficient materials on the two crusher sites that are available in Kadavu? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition on that. The situation regarding crushers is also under current consideration by the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) regarding the availability of aggregates as you mentioned, that is the challenge. But one of the major costs in terms of maritime road construction is the cartage from Viti Levu. So, we are now engaging with some landowners to expand the cartage operations and assist them to set up, working closely with Ministry of iTaukei Affairs through the iTaukei Trust Fund in terms of their programme to enhance indigenous businesses. HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just in relation to that issue, there are currently two crushers in Kadavu, one in Yawe, it is the softer rock and the other one is in Kiobo in Namara and that is the rock that is being used for the road up from Vunisei to go up to Kavala. I think if you are going to look for another source of rock, it would be at the North end of Kadavu, around Nakasaleka, to bring the rock down. My question, Sir, is in relation to the roads that we have in Kadavu now and with the completion of this road, you will be able to travel from the Jetty in Kavala all the way down to Nabukelevu-i-Ra. But from Nabukelevu-i-Ra there is another road that comes from Vunisea down to Naqalotu. There is also the idea of making that road a loop road. Are there any plans now to join up the roads from Naqalotu to the one that comes from Nabukelevu so that to the South end of Kadavu where we can have a loop? After that there will be just two or three more of this. That is the question</p><div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1851 about completing that loop around South end of Kadavu. MR. SPEAKER.- You probably have to go around Ului Nabukelevu to do that. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will need to check on that information, but definitely, when we look at the planning, that is one of the emphasis where the loop roads could be joined, or enhanced that is what we will be focusing on too. If not in this budget, then in the upcoming budget. Also, after the next election, when we come in, we can continue expanding it really intensively in terms of the rural roads. HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know in Kadavu there is no bus operating or running, but in places like Vanua Levu we have some roads where we are forcing buses to run, but they are not PSV accredited, which is supposed to be done by the FRA. Does the Ministry look into that kind of case or situation because, you need to build the road if you are going to introduce heavy PSVs, then it needs to be done to that standard? I know a couple of roads like in Wailevu West, Natuvu and Vunidamoni, we are just running the buses there because people are demanding for that, but it is not accredited. The problem is, if there is going to be an accident then it is going to be something against the bus company for doing that. HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note that and we are also with the FRA Team in the North, currently working on the programme regarding the North roads. I have seen the bus companies, yes, there definitely is a lot of work that needs to be done and that is something we will be focusing on as we move forward, especially, for road conditions where in terms of the small inclement weather, the vehicles cannot move. So that is what I have asked the FRA Team in the North to focus on.</p><h4>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please note that I have been allowing questions to</h4><p>run like this from Kadavu to the North, and the roads are not accredited.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

Enhancing Quality and Accessible TVET Programmes (Question No. 133/2023) HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the measures being undertaken to enhance the quality and accessibility of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programmes in the country? HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question and I think we can all acknowledge and appreciate the role that the Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) has provided for Fiji to fill the skills gap in the Fijian job market. Trade- related skills that have been provided through TVET has also provided workforce that has also been recognised in Fiji, in the region and also in the international arena.</p><div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div><p>1852</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that over the years, special category of learning has been affected by the various competing interests in terms of the policy changes due to political directions and through changes in government and this has also led to institutional braindrain, as has been experienced in our tertiary institutions. At one stage, we had the Fiji National Training Centre and the former Director is the honourable Member sitting on the other side, the Fiji Institute of Technology that led the training of our vocational studies and also supported by various secondary schools, such as Ratu Kadavulevu School, Queen Victoria School and other schools around Fiji. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education is working with relevant stakeholders to enhance the quality of technical and vocational education training by revising curriculums of all the programmes under this umbrella and the TVET Section under the Ministry of Education is working with the Fiji Higher Education Commission, and other necessary training institutions to conduct skills survey to assess the current needs of all industries in Fiji and also identify where our strengths and weaknesses lie. The findings of this survey will be used to address the various educational needs which will be discussed with implementing tertiary institutions to be able to focus the subjects and ensure sufficient students are attracted to take up training in this skill sets for the job markets in Fiji and abroad. The education curriculum over the years has undergone various changes and it continues to evolve to allow for areas of need that are identified, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I also would like to inform Parliament that this is also part of the thematic areas that will be discussed at the Fiji National Education Summit which will be convening next week. Mr. Speaker, Sir the Ministry of Education has done various outreach programmes and incentives to attract students for TVET and educate communities on the important role of the sector and we are working not only to furnish our domestic markets with professional workers, but we are also fast becoming a country that provides workers for the international job markets. The outreach programmes undertaken addresses the socio-economic wellbeing of the Fijian communities and the scholarships and loan scheme play its part by publishing and launching its booklet on the scholarships, grants and the loan schemes that Government is providing for TVET. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to state that to promote TVET learners of all income categories and locations, the Ministry of Education continues to provide Vocational Tuition Grants of $610 per vocational students across its 32 Vocational Centres. We are also exploring ways to also restore 31 of the 66 Vocational Centres that were attached to our own secondary schools in all the four Divisions. HON. H. CHAND.- Can the honourable Minister inform Parliament how the Ministry is using GPE Technical Financial Assistance to enhance TVET Programme. HON. A. M. RADRODRO. - I think we have covered that in the Ministerial Statement that I did on Monday. It is also part of the discussions that will be undertaken in the Fiji National Education Summit. HON. R. R. SHARMA. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is paramount to eradicate poverty. While I highly encourage the participation at this Technical and Vocational Education in schools, the youths of today have a range of options where they want to get education. To stay in competition, you need a competitive edge. So, what would a young person want after school is get a scholarship, get educated and enter the workforce. You have spoken about the quality and access to being educated. Can you inform us and the people especially the youths if there are direct and indirect collaborations to the workforce or work</p><div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1853 sector so that students feel more encouraged that if I get educated this is the path I can take, and I will be able to get a job? Those are some of the indirect and direct collaborations for the students to graduate and get a job. HON. A. M. RADRODRO. - That is a very good question from the honourable Member. This is something that will be part of the Fiji National Education Summit to consider because that is all covered in the thematic areas that has already identified. HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- I really thank the honourable Minister for his responses and, of course, the focus that the Government has now on TVET Education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, my simple question to the honourable Minister is, you have talked about the 31 out of 66 schools that used to have TVET Programmes but currently I know that some of this work have been outsourced. What proportion of the whole training is under the current arrangement that is, sort of, outsourced as opposed to those currently run by the Ministry and, of course, most importantly is the consistency in the assessment criteria? I hope those from the schools will be in terms of their achievements and can be cross credited as well, perhaps something I think that other institutions are providing for the Ministry. HON. A. M. RADRODRO.- The Ministry has already undertaken steps to sign Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Fiji National University to ensure that all the courses that have been undertaken will be accredited by the Fiji National University and private providers like Pacific Polytech, Monfort Boys Town, Montfort Institute and Vivekananda Technical College. These are some of the private institutions that has also been recognised through the Fiji Higher Education Commission to be providing technical vocational education training. MR. SPEAKER.- I think we have allowed more. Sorry about that, honourable Usamate. Now, we will move on to the last question since the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection was busy in the morning. Child Care Centres (Question No. 130/2023) HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform Parliament if the Ministry has any plans to establish Child Care Centres for three to five year- olds? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. The question is asking if the Ministry has any plans to open any Child Care Centres for three to five years old and the short answer to that is, no. The Ministry is not in the business of operating Child Care Centres. However, the Ministry’s current focus is looking at regulating the standards of Child Care Centres that open around the country. As you all recall, the Early Childhood Care Policy and Regulatory Framework Guidance Note received unanimous approval of this Parliament in May 2023. This Regulatory Framework is designed to set forth the norms and standards that will govern both existing and new Early Childhood Care (ECC) services within the country. Consequently, all Child Care Centres both existing and those yet to be established will be required to adhere to the standards outlined in this Guidance Note. Once again, I thank the Gender</p><div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div><p>1854</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>14 th Sept., 2023 and Social Inclusion Division of IFC who has worked with the Ministry to come up with this Guidance Note. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the setting up of the Department for Children, one of its core functions is to become the central regulatory authority to ensure that Child Care Centres meet the standards. As I had mentioned in an answer earlier this week, we have some employers who have opened Child Care Centres in their locations as well as other Child Care Centres that are around the country. This will ensure that there is one central regulatory authority under the Director for Children to ensure that they have to check up on them. There are also policies in other ministries as you are aware of, honourable Members. We have got the Early Childhood Development Policy in the Ministry for Health that looks at the health of children from one to thirteen years old, but it does include the age you have mentioned. We have the Early Childhood Education Policy that is existing within the Ministry for Education. These policies currently complement each other. Again, the opening of the Child Care Centres are currently done privately but are guided by these policies. HON. K. K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the Ministry is not in the business of opening Child Care Services and there are some privately owned Child Care Services in Fiji. How are their operations monitored and how do you ensure quality childcare services? HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had mentioned about the Department for Children and one of their core functions is to become the central regulatory authority which includes monitoring and ensuring that there are certain standards that are met. That will be the role of that. As you know, we have established it and have the budget for it, so we hope to roll that out as soon as possible. HON. R. R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that you are not in the business of it, but they are established centres. So, there is the establishment and let us say for parents to access it, is another question. Yesterday, in Parliament, we had spoken about single mothers. My question honourable Minister, in your policy framework, do you have any support subsidies in terms of single mothers, let us say working parents who are below the income bracket, who want to go and work but they have a responsibility to take care of a child because if they are not able to get assistance, they are trapped in the cycle of poverty? With your policy framework, do you have any subsidies for them to get their child at the centres or to even get to the centre, the logistics of it? Do you have something or initiative of this sort to support these families? MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, before you issue your reply to that, another interesting question was raised yesterday to also include single fathers. Whenever we address single mothers now, we have to address single fathers as well. That was raised by the Opposition yesterday.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Single parents:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.:</span> Single parents, that includes both father and mother?</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Gender neutral:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- We are being educated here. HON. L. D. TABUYA.- Mr:</span> Speaker, Sir, as you know, single parents who need assistance from the Ministry are receiving Social Welfare Allowance, not just for Family Assistance Scheme but also for their children. There are certain categories in terms of what is given out with the</p><div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023</p><h4>Questions</h4><p>1855 allowance with their age group. Of course, the expenses are incurred more as the kids get older because when they are in high school, they need more. There is a whole certain amounts that apply to a child that is under Child Protection Allowance. What you are asking in terms of assisting single parents, we are currently really appealing to employers to provide this as part of a worker’s compensation package, and we find employers who are coming forward that are willing to do this. This Guidance Note that will help us to regulate these places will assist us to ensure that we still meet the standards. There are willing partners from the community. As you know, our Voluntary Grants from any Ministry is really for voluntary organisations, it is not for private institutions like running a Child Care Centre. There are no plans here to subsidise a private institution because at the end of day, it is still for profit and that is something this Government we do not do. But there are voluntary organisations who assist women with young children, like HART community who, as I mentioned yesterday, have come forward to help those mothers who are attending APTC courses. So, we can help them out with things like groceries as they look after those children. Again, it is not for profit, it is a community service that we can offer. Written Question 2023-2024 Budgetted Projects and Programmes (Question No. 134/2023) HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport inform Parliament on the following: (a) (b) a detailed breakdown of the list of projects and programmes that will be implemented to utilise the Ministry’s budget for the 2023 to 2024 budget; and the targeted cost of each programme and project, together with planned completion dates? HON. RO F. Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will table my response at a later date as permitted under the Standing Order. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that bring us to the end of Questions, both Oral and Written. I understand that few of our honourable Members have important appointments to attend to, since the Madam Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, as well as New Zealand, are here.
