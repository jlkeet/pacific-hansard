B. C. PRASAD.- And they cannot stomach the fact that this Government is doing the right thing. This Government is getting rid of all the stupidity in laws that we saw then:</span> This is just one example, where they removed good laws and replaced them with what I call, “stupid laws”. This Government will systematically, one by one, with consultation and dialogue, change the laws and we will make sure that we do not rule by law. We follow the rule of law.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F.S. KOYA.- We know the law:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C.

V. T. T. K. RAYALU.- Tell them, tell them! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They are enjoying their role in the Opposition because we are following the law. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They are enjoying the Opposition because we are transparent and capable. They are enjoying the Opposition because we allow Parliament and we do not dictate to Parliament. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Yeah! HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, the appointment of an independent body such as the Higher Salaries Commission is one example of what we are doing and the people of this country know.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yes:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.:</span> In fact, Mr. Speaker....</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K.

PRASAD.:</span> Before I finish, in fact many of them, those who were there in the previous Parliament they did not feel free. They had to crawl. (Laughter) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They had to go like this (illustrates) (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- They had to do this. We are different, Mr. Speaker, we have the freedom.

F. S. KOYA.:</span> Once again, Sir, I rise on Standing Order 74(1)(a). The man is becoming so irrelevant with his irrelevance that is ridiculous, Mr. Speaker. He has gone beyond his time, now he is attacking us. Let me tell you something there is a difference between discipline and what you are saying. We are a disciplined party, thank you very much. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let the people judge:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">MR.

SPEAKER.-... I have allowed honourable Members going beyond the time that we have agreed to and stick by. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister has been given that as well because I provided that allowance to the Opposition as well. Please continue and if you feel that you can round off … HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will finish now. I know honourable Koya cannot stomach the truth. He just gets up, makes an irrelevant Point of Order and then you know the things he is doing.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- Sit down:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B.C.

KOYA.:</span> Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.</p><p><span class="speaker">MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> I understand you, Standing Order 74 (1)(a) again. We understand you</p><div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div><p>1900 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 14 th Sept., 2023 have given a bit of leeway, we give as good as we get but, Sir,... HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? HON. F. S. KOYA.- But he is really now going overboard and beyond the fact that he should be speaking on what is before him, he has completely forgotten it. Sir, some decorum, honourable Minister for Finance.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. K.K. LAL.- He should resign:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. F. S. KOYA.:</span> We have had our afternoon session, Sir. I think, Mr. Speaker has given us a lot of leeway - ask him to be relevant, please, Mr. Speaker. MR. SPEAKER.- Are you rounding it off, Sir? HON. PROF. B. C PRASAD.- Yes I am rounding it off Mr. Speaker, Sir. If they had some decorum, if they give me the respect, if they allowed me to speak. (Chorus of interjections) HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.- And f they stopped yelling, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I could have finished earlier but the way they are behaving in a disrespectful manner they deserve that kind of response.</p><p><span class="speaker">HON.

NAUPOTO.- Finally:</span></p><p><span class="speaker">HON. PROF. B. C. PRASAD.-..:</span> is the right thing to do and I urge the honourable Opposition Members, as part of their strategy to repent, support this Bill. HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I thank the diverse discussion and conversation on this topic. It is very important. It is sad that honourable Maharaj was able to make some comments into some of the provisions of the Bill, not knowing this is exactly what a replica of the previous Bill, it is nothing new. Also, in terms of drafting, honourable Usamate commented, it is the same drafting that served your Party, and it is the same that they were working on. There were some comments on the Schedule, why some entities are not scheduled. It is basic, you do not put Schedule if there is no confirmed agreement into the existence and formation. Once that has been done through the formal process of Public Enterprises, then they will be…. (Chorus of interjections)</p><p><span class="speaker">HON. S.D. TURAGA.:</span> Well, as I said, they will be further added to the Schedule.</p><div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div><p>14 th Sept., 2023 Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 1901 (Chorus of interjections) HON. S. D. TURAGA.- Normally, that is why they are listed in the Schedule, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the Schedule can be increased. That is the whole purpose. I just want to respond to honourable Usamate’s comment regarding the right people, but relativity how do you justify someone who was paid $1 million to work here, it was supposed to be for three years, and before the tenure, they go, then we get another one and another one. HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Who, who? HON. S. D. TURAGA.- That is the whole purpose of getting the Higher Salaries Commission. There were some reference made as to the powers of the Minister. The honourable Prime Minister is the Minister for Public Enterprises and covers Public Service Commission. So, we have someone who has gone through life, mature enough who is going to look at the setup as to the membership and how Higher Salaries Commission is administered. It is not someone who has just graduated from high school or college. It is for a good purpose, it was there, it served the nation well. Our supporters, the policy of this Government to make it right and that is why we are here. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to Parliament. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. Question put. Votes cast: - 28 Ayes 23 Noes - 4 Not voted - Motion agreed to. [Higher Salaries Commission Bill 2023 (Bill No. 24/2023), moved under Standing Order 51 passed and enacted by the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji. (Act No. …. of 2023)]. MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that was quite a lively exchange. I did not want to interrupt nor stop the momentum that was going on, but somewhere or rather you are bound to sit and listen once more. I would like to thank honourable Members for today’s sitting and the number of observations you put into the very things that you said in Parliament and that brings us to the end of the sitting today. Once again, I thank you so sincerely for your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. The Parliament adjourned at 6.45 p.m. Page: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76</p></body>
